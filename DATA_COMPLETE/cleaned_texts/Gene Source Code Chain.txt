medical healthcare problems costs gene sequencing decrease scientists citizen scientists able access vast amounts genetic physical fitness data academic medical purposes addition research review species xe2 x80 x99 dna beneficial studies greatly advance knowledge medicine materials energy x0c1 3 genetic data genes substances transmit genetic information information source birth aging illness death gene data contains large health information closely related individual xe2 x80 x99s health present genetic data mainly includes following aspects 1 assisted clinical diagnosis diseases resemblance diseases leads difficulties discriminating clinically lead incorrect diagnosis genetic testing find cause disease genetic level help clinicians differentiate diseases correct clinical diagnosis mistakes 2 screening carriers common health screenings syndrome traditional screening syndrome performed serum detection rate 65 75% false negatives inevitable non intrusive prenatal genetic testing accurately detect children syndrome including 18 trisomy syndrome 13 trisomy syndrome addition screening related disease causing genes high risk groups family history single gene disorder especially recessive disorder promptly detect virulence gene carriers family analyze pathogenic risk offspring 7 screening results provide family members informative suggestions prevent defective genes affecting generation 3 guided treatment strength prescription decided number extensive tests performed groups doses decided way appropriate people normal dosage prescriptions cause death genetic differences patients medicine supposed help patient end endanger patient xe2 x80 x99s health phenomenon called adverse drug reactions adr example drug warfarin anticoagulant drug prevents blood clotting patients taking medicine greatly reduce risk thrombosis anticoagulant prescribed high dosage blood fail coagulate properly x0ccontinuous bleeding threaten patient xe2 x80 x99s life human body enzyme called cyp2c9 metabolize anticoagulant break small molecules destroy anticoagulant effect normal circumstances warfarin metabolized completes therapeutic action harm human body person mutations cyp2c9 production metabolic function slows poor metabolizer result warfarin metabolized slowly accumulates body eventually causing continuous bleeding role genetic testing crucial example firstly determine patient xe2 x80 x99s cyp2c9 production mutation metabolic type belong known dosage drug based individual xe2 x80 x99s metabolism type metabolism strong dose increased somewhat weak dosage reduced drug closely monitored blood guarantees healing effect drug causes adr countless instances genetic testing patient xe2 x80 x99s metabolism plays important role determining correct dosage genes involved metabolism drugs depression diabetes asthma osteoporosis genetic testing guarantee correct dosage person xe2 x80 x99s individual genes seldom considered prescribing drugs result prescribed medicine causes adverse reactions certain patients time time 4 predict risk individual s illness modern medicine believes disease comes genes external factors diseases related genes cases genetic mutations cause dysfunctions human body cause physiological functions deviate normal conditions creating opportunities diseases time negative external factors unclean environment harsh climate poor diet radiation lack exercise etc amplify problematic consequences genetic mutations combination external internal factors causes disease colon cancer example metabolism epithelial cells colon controlled gene called apc person s apc gene properly control normal metabolism epithelial cells uncontrolled epithelial cells undergo excessive proliferation genesis colon cancer dcc x0cand p53 genes human body inhibit cells cancerous dcc p53 genes mutated effectively prevent cancerous transformation cells body faces threat colon cancer believe defects apc dcc p53 genes closely related occurrence colon cancer people defective genes faced imminent risk colon cancer testing subepithelial neoplasia spreads evolves colon cancer warning signs cancer discovered disease prevented measures improving
