blockchain size increases 100 tb likely scenario small number large businesses run nodes regular users light spv nodes situation arises potential concern nodes band agree cheat profitable fashion eg change block reward btc light nodes way detecting immediately course honest node likely exist hours information fraud trickle channels like reddit point late ordinary users organize effort blacklist given blocks massive likely infeasible coordination problem similar scale pulling successful 51% attack case bitcoin currently problem exists blockchain modification suggested peter todd alleviate issue near term ethereum use additional strategies cope problem blockchain based mining algorithms miner forced node creating lower bound number nodes second importantly include intermediate state tree root blockchain processing transaction block validation centralized long honest verifying node exists centralization problem circumvented verification protocol miner publishes invalid block block badly formatted state s n incorrect s 0 known correct state s incorrect s 1 correct verifying node provide index proof invalidity consisting subset patricia tree nodes needing process apply s 1 tx s

page 33 ethereum org putting decentralized applications contract mechanism described allows build essentially command line application run virtual machine executed consensus entire network allowing modify globally accessible state hard drive people command line interface transaction sending mechanism sufficiently user friendly decentralization attractive mainstream alternative end complete decentralized application consist low level business logic components implemented entirely ethereum combination ethereum systems eg p2p messaging layer currently planned ethereum clients systems entirely high level graphical user interface components ethereum client s design serve web browser include support eth javascript api object specialized web pages viewed client able use interact ethereum blockchain point view traditional web web pages entirely static content blockchain decentralized protocols serve complete replacement server purpose handling user initiated requests eventually decentralized protocols hopefully fashion ethereum store web pages conclusion ethereum protocol originally conceived upgraded version cryptocurrency providing advanced features blockchain escrow withdrawal limits financial contracts gambling markets like highly generalized programming language ethereum protocol support applications directly existence turing complete programming language means arbitrary contracts theoretically created transaction type application interesting ethereum ethereum protocol moves far currency protocols decentralized applications decentralized file storage decentralized computation decentralized prediction markets dozens concepts potential substantially increase efficiency computational industry provide massive boost peer peer protocols adding time economic layer finally substantial array applications money concept arbitrary state transition function implemented ethereum protocol provides platform unique potential closed ended single purpose protocol intended specific array applications data storage gambling finance ethereum open ended design believe extremely suited serving foundational layer large number financial non financial
