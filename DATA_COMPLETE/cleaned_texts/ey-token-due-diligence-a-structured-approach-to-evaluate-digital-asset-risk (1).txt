channels. resulted entity s ability drain token s primary liquidity pool repay loan transaction, netting $186 million profits.14 smart contract risks include unaudited codebases. companies, trail bits, provide smart contract auditing services review contract code flaws return report posted protocol s website demonstrate transparency. however, protocols use auditing services, auditing services same. additionally, availability report necessarily indicate seal approval represent form assurance way audit opinion does. cases, reports identify code flaws provide remediation activities, simple

transaction fees means sybil resistance. 3.3 maintenance upgrades despite token designed do, question maintain upgrade codebase? blockchain level, independent organizations, ethereum foundation, fund active research development core protocol specifications implemented execution consensus layer client teams. research team composed experts computer science cryptography. example, eip 1559 introduced transaction-pricing mechanism called base fee. function past block demand, base fee adjusts gradually help smooth expected transaction fees ethereum subsequently burned total supply. concurrent base

returns native token, terra luna saga prime example. is, however, unlikely projects start fully decentralized model. measure centralization required initially bootstrap activity coordinate efficient decision-making, critical early-stage protocol development. important factor consideration project team publicly released project roadmap clear path decentralization, team followed roadmap. 3.3.2 decentralized applications application layer, cases, development activities managed combination community decentralized autonomous organizations daos core developer teams. daos typically set community funds aside purpose token generation event compensate developers. addition, daos fund protocol development community engagement grant programs liquidity incentives.16 on-chain dao governance proposals implement protocol changes needed. daos token holders varying degrees governance rights vote implement changes executed governance smart contract. subsidize community involvement similar project manager product developer, daos offer monetary incentives consulting-like capacity community engaging protocol developers. outsourcing certain roles community, especially community owns governance tokens, important way daos develop new products fit community s needs. therefore, paying employees community, sizable cash runway near mandatory protocol longevity self- sustaining based positive cash
