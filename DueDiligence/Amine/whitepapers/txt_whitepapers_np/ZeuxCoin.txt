Service Market still has high potential Demand Financial services play critical roles in individual life and business activities With the growing global economy and fast process of urbanization there is a growing demand for financial services such as mobile payments easy remittance and access to investment products Here are some statistics Digital Payments \xe2\x97\x8f Global non cash transaction volumes grew by 11 2% in 2014 2015 to $433 1 billion \xe2\x97\x8f This growth was mainly driven by developing markets which recorded a 21 6% increase in 2015 while mature markets grew by 6 8% \xe2\x97\x8f Contactless payments (NFC) are expected to grow to $9 9 billion in 2018 an 18% increase over 2017 \xe2\x97\x8f The mobile wallets market is growing steadily with mobile proximity payments expected to top $53 billion by 2019 \xe2\x97\x8f Debit cards accounted for the highest share (46 7%) of global non cash transactions followed by credit cards with 19 5% in 2015 \xe2\x97\x8f In store mobile payments are predicted to reach $503 billion by 2020 reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% over 2015 2020 Remittances \xe2\x97\x8f $537 billion was sent as remittances in 2016 mostly through firms like Western Union MoneyGram and RIA Investments \xe2\x97\x8f Global assets under management amongst world s biggest 500 fund houses have exceeded $80 trillion \xe2\x97\x8f PWC expects global assets under management to rise to $145 4 trillion by 2025 8 \x0cCrypto Investment \xe2\x97\x8f In 2017 ICOs raised over $7 billion and 2018 YTD has followed pace at over $12 billion \xe2\x97\x8f To capitalize on what could be a massive opportunity over 300 crypto funds have formed to invest in tokens and currencies The assets held by these funds is between $7 5 10 billion and about $2 4 billion is also exposed to crypto through traditional vehicles like ETNs trusts and futures products The financial industry is looking to build tokens into an asset class which would place the current nascent $300 billion of market cap as part of the $10 trillion in global alternative investments and eventually as part of the $500 trillion representing all securities and assets 9 \x0cProblems in current market Financial Services banking insurance and investment play important roles in the everyday lives of consumers Yet most of the products provided by traditional financial organizations have not been designed with ease of access simplicity in use and affordability in price Outlined below are the 6 key issues with current financial services products Investing is difficult and a lot of hassle Interest rates from standard savings are minimal in the developed world yet investing is becoming an increasingly tedious and time consuming affair for customers The list of difficulties a consumer faces range from the hassle of creating a new investment account due to the endless paper forms and questionnaires to the complexity of moving finances between different accounts This abundance of red tape around investment discourages consumers from investing No easy access to crypto investment products As crypto fund management is still at an early stage traditional financial services including banks insurance and asset managers offer very few options for end customers to participate in crypto fund investment opportunities Without the technical knowledge to purchase transfer and manage cryptos ordinary investors have no easy access to purchase crypto fund products and get exposure to these exciting opportunities There is a great deal of FOMO (fear of missing out) among ordinary investors Lack of a point of sale solution for crypto payment For cryptocurrency holders there is no easy to solution for them to spend their cryptos easily in their day to day life at point of sale (POS) machines Users need to sell their cryptos via an exchange and then wait for it to be transferred to their bank account before they can spend it Even with some solutions trying to integrate the processes in one place the waiting 10 \x0ctime is still at least half an hour This is unacceptable for any POS transactions for end customers where milliseconds matter International transactions are expensive and time consuming Banks often impose high charges for basic services such as international transfer and foreign exchange On average each cross border transaction costs consumers 0 5% in fees with a floor at \xc2\xa320 while foreign exchanges usually charge as much as 3% charges On a \xc2\xa3500 transfer this can end up costing the customer up to \xc2\xa335 Likewise inter bank transfers are usually a time consuming process Banks take 3 days to process transactions through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) When there is no direct arrangement between two banks the payment will need to go via a correspondent bank this further prolongs the time until the transaction can be completed There s no integrated solution for all financial products Fintech companies are driving innovation to solve the problems mentioned above We have seen an exponential rise in the use of NFC (Near Field Communication) mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay Additionally various fintech specialists are making investment management more accessible by offering affordable solutions to some other issues including crypto payment cards low fee foreign exchange and international transfers as well as robotic advisors However these solutions remain disjointed These specialized solutions require consumers to constantly maintain multiple accounts and cards and to remember different usernames passwords and answers to security questions In addition the process of moving funds/investments between accounts has become tiresome often with delays or complications These isolated information silos not only leave the user with a huge administration burden but they also deprive customers of the ability to access all this information in a single view Many customers are discouraged to begin using these financial services due to the inconvenience of opening multiple accounts 11 \x0cFigure 1 \xe2\x80\x8b Administration burdens for customers 12 \x0cThe Zeux integrated solution So why can t we have a single integrated solution for all Yes we can Zeux will deliver a revolutionary regulated solution providing a single entry point platform that enables you access to all your financial product accounts Zeux leverages secure decentralized distributed blockchain technology and introduces its own crypto token to facilitate the secure immutably recorded account opening and transaction processes It will be fast convenient secure and reliable Figure 2 \xe2\x80\x8b The Zeux integrated solution Key Services \xe2\x97\x8f Aggregated platform to access multiple investment products from different providers in both fiat and cryptocurrency accounts / cost / value / interest comparison between accounts \xe2\x97\x8f Integrated space where the customer can manage multiple bank accounts (through Open Banking/PSD2) \xe2\x97\x8f Secure decentralized storage of KYC (Know Your Customer) information with historical records on the blockchain and concierge service for hassle free account opening \xe2\x97\x8f Secure NFC mobile payment for major cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies at POS \xe2\x97\x8f No sign up fee or annual fee 13 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f No fees or commissions for foreign exchange \xe2\x97\x8f Use of the globalized border resistant token (ZeuxCoin) for fast secure and free cross border transfers The Zeux Interface Our service is designed to be intuitive and simple to use therefore almost anybody can run a Zeux account with ease The Zeux interface offers users access to all savings/investment accounts with a few easy steps It clearly shows different banking and investment accounts in one intuitive home screen enabling users to easily complete all tasks regarding financial operations Customers give instructions through the Zeux Interface and simultaneously receive information and communications from multiple providers Figure 3 \xe2\x80\x8b Dashboard of Zeux App (Beta) Personal data vault and KYC concierge At the heart of the Zeux model is our core financial ecosystem platform and the Zeux personal data vault This feature will let users manage and own their identity in a secure environment built on blockchain Furthermore they can re use the data to open new bank/investment accounts promptly and easily 14 \x0cAny customer data collected by Zeux during account opening will be encrypted and stored securely in the Personal Data Vault with a corresponding hash created and stored on the decentralized distributed blockchain network Records of a customer s key financial activities within Zeux platform can be added to the Personal Data Vault if the customer grants consent This can be used for future KYC When customers instruct Zeux to open a new financial account with a specific provider the Zeux concierge service will submit the application on behalf of the customer and facilitate the process of sharing KYC hash stored on the blockchain and a link to his/her personal data vault This will significantly reduce account onboarding time for the customers Figure 4 \xe2\x80\x8b How does Zeux Personal Data Vault and KYC concierge work 15 \x0cIn addition when another financial organization completes verification of KYC documents a record of hash validation will be added on the blockchain Future organizations may use the previous verification record and focus on checking new data which will significantly reduce business admin burden and speed up the KYC process All customer data will be encrypted Only customers will have the private keys to access this data and the right to share data with services providers To see details on the underlying technology and how it works please refer to Section Technology & Security Access to all bank accounts Zeux is an authorized AISP (Account Information Service Provider) and PISP (Payment Initiation Service Provider) under PSD2 The Zeux app will collate all account information and display it on a single convenient dashboard Users will be able to see balances from all different accounts and perform financial tasks for any of these accounts Access to multiple investment products Zeux will act as an introducer and aggregator of investment products with available investment products and details listed in the app As Zeux is a comprehensive ecosystem it provides a good picture of a user s financial activities Therefore Zeux will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics to recommend suitable and targeted investment products based on each user s financial profile investment preference risk appetite and other financial information that is captured by the Zeux service Using the Zeux app customers can instruct Zeux to open a new investment account with a specific asset management service provider The Zeux app will provide a view of the user s investment portfolios with analysis on investment performance and risk indicators Compared with other investment apps where users must instruct their bank to transfer money into investment accounts Zeux users can move around funds between multiple accounts and investment accounts seamlessly 16 \x0cFigure 5 \xe2\x80\x8b Screenshot of Zeux App view of bank accounts and investment opportunities Access to crypto investment funds Zeux will become the world s first integrated crypto products/funds investment platform making it easier more accessible and smoother for the average less tech savvy customer to get access to the best investment opportunities out there To purchase the crypto fund products Zeux users without any cryptos can fund their investment via converting fiat currency to ZeuxCoin in the Zeux app with one click Zeux conducts rigorous due diligence and KYC checks on all the crypto funds listed on the Zeux platform to make sure that they have regulatory approvals and can be marketed to Zeux customers in that region Unlike other investment products listed in the platform Zeux will conduct extra KYC suitability tests needed to enable end customers to gain exposure to crypto funds 17 \x0cIn the case where a customer invests in existing large financial institutions products via Zeux the Zeux platform only arranges the execution of the investment Investing in crypto opportunities differs because Zeux acts as a pool manager becoming the custodian of customer funds providing end customer services and dealing with individual fund settlement As a pool manager Zeux invests all end customer funds via nominee accounts into the crypto funds This massively reduces the end customer KYC requirements for the crypto funds For this service Zeux will charge a transaction fee to the customer in ZeuxCoin i e 3% transaction fees Figure 6 \xe2\x80\x8b Investing in crypto funds Secure mobile payment for crypto and fiat currency Zeux App uses NFC payment providers such as Apple Pay Samsung Pay and Google pay to achieve secure payment that links directly to the user s Zeux account A Zeux VISA virtual card will be added to Apple Pay/Google Pay by default and can be used to pay in 18 \x0cany NFC location where a VISA card and Apple/Google/Samsung Pay is accepted As NFC payment requires verification by fingerprint or passcode this adds an extra layer of security over the common contactless card payment Furthermore if the user chooses to pay with a major cryptocurrency such as BTC ETH or ZeuxCoin Zeux will be able to process the payment via the Zeux App and the NFC payment app directly The conversion of crypto to Fiat currency will happen instantly through the Zeux internal buy back facility simultaneously sending Fiat payment to retailers Customers will have the experience of being able to spend their cryptos seamlessly as a mobile payment in any shop Figure 7 \xe2\x80\x8b Zeux POS payment solutions 19 \x0cDecentralized transfer system Zeux will facilitate all transfers using blockchain technology When a customer wants to transfer their ZUC to another Zeux user the tokens will be sent to the recipient s e wallet For transfers in Fiat currency the platform will convert Fiat currency into the Zeux internal ledger token ZXUSD and send the ZXUSD token to recipient s ZXUSD account For details of how the transfer process works please refer to the section in Technology and Security This blockchain based transfer allows ledger records to be kept for each ZXUSD or ZUC transaction in a decentralized way removing the risks of traditional central record keeping such as loss or manipulation of records In addition the transfer process will be significantly accelerated as the transactions can be completed within seconds on the blockchain For cross border transfers this will bring great convenience and much lower costs for customers Figure 8 \xe2\x80\x8b The Zeux decentralized transfer system 20 \x0cIn summary the decentralized transfer system on Zeux is prompt and secure underpinned by blockchain technology it will improve the whole financial ecosystem Zeux will not charge any fees for Fiat transfers within the same country or for transfer of ZeuxCoin between Zeux users For cross border transfer Zeux will charge a minimal fee of 0 1% to cover the network costs for processing these transactions on the blockchain Technology and Security Data encryption and storage When a customer opens an account with Zeux all personal data provided for KYC purposes will be encrypted into the Personal Data Vault The vault consists of a database and a blockchain Every time the customer performs a KYC step the customer data is encrypted (using a private key on their mobile device) and stored in the database The smart contract calculates a hash from this data and adds it to the blockchain guaranteeing the accuracy and authenticity of the customers\xe2\x80\x99 data Once the institution has verified the KYC of the user a new record of validation will be hashed and added to the blockchain The blockchain has a full record of the customer\xe2\x80\x99s KYC history This history data is immutable decentralized and highly secure When users instruct Zeux to share personal data to a third party service provider to open a new financial account for example Zeux will provide the link for the user\xe2\x80\x99s personal data vault address for KYC information to the institution and the corresponding hash on the blockchain while the customer releases the private key of the data from their device by using their biometric key or password Each customer owns a unique private encryption key for their personal data vault This is stored on the end customers\xe2\x80\x99 devices with a backup copy sent to the users\xe2\x80\x99 email Zeux does not own the keys nor have access to them This gives customers total control of their personal data granting them full authority regarding access rights 21 \x0cFigure 9 \xe2\x80\x8b Data encryption storage and KYC Blockchain Transactions Transactions based on blockchain technology have revolutionized the way of making payments and transfers The technology allows users to send payments to one another without having to go through a third party such as a bank Zeux will leverage the blockchain to facilitate transactions Scenario 1 Transfer of ZeuxCoin (ZUC) (see Figure 8 above) When a user requests a transfer of ZeuxCoin to another Zeux user the transfer request is checked and verified by nodes in the blockchain network Once the transaction has been verified the ZeuxCoin will be sent the tokens to the recipient s ZeuxCoin address and the recipient will be able to view the balance in their Zeux App Scenario 2 Transfer of Fiat currencies via Zeux platform (see Figure 8 above) (Note This only applies when users request a transfer via the Zeux platform It is not applicable when user instructs bank A to transfer money to a particular bank account To make a transfer via Zeux platform the user needs to have sufficient balance in their Zeux account ) When a user tops up their Zeux bank account Zeux allocates ZXUSD tokens to the user s digital wallet at a 1 1 ratio These are used internally by the Zeux platform to conduct transactions Once the Fiat has been converted into ZXUSD it then remains at a 1 1 ratio and the ZXUSD balance always reflects the spendable amount the user holds Transfer of Fiat currencies (subject to AML rules and monitoring) will then be carried out by sending ZXUSD tokens from the sender s wallet to the recipient s The payment is checked and verified by the nodes and recorded in the blockchain Once the transaction is 22 \x0ccompleted it will show in the recipient s account as a spendable balance in Fiat As all transactions are completed via the blockchain they are highly secure and immutable Furthermore it removes the tedious processes between various banks particularly where cross border transactions are involved Biometric Verification Each account has an access key that is stored within the mobile device and protected by the phone s biometrics (if available) Because none of the keys can leave the Security Module hackers can t steal them Even in the unlikely event of our systems being hacked the pairing of customer account ID and access key is encrypted using bank grade encryption Multi Layered Security Our multi layered bank grade security measures include Corporation \xe2\x97\x8f Ongoing Training &

sure there is no misleading information We take our data protection responsibilities (GDPR) seriously and ensure that all personal data stored in the Zeux vault is encrypted and protected using distributed ledger technology on the blockchain We are more reliable than other cryptocurrency services because \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Our

partners 26 \x0cFigure 11 \xe2\x80\x8b Zeux Compliance Activities PSD2 (Payments Service Directive 2) / Open banking PSD2 in the EU is also known as the Open Banking project in the UK underpins Zeux s key offerings the ability to easily set up new accounts and to execute operations between these accounts It provides a regulated platform from which we can receive customer data to process financial services With the introduction of Open Banking it is much easier for Zeux to roll out its services It obliges the big banks to release their data in a secure standardized form using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) so that it can be shared more easily between authorized organizations online to process payments and other banking activities As well as all the electronic banking features it also makes it easier for users to find banks with disabled access for example or compare the features of different personal and business accounts to get the best deal The features ultimately make it easier and more convenient to initiate payments and reduce the lag the user experiences while waiting for transactions to complete In the best cases it will reduce the wait from days to minutes This first part of Open Banking went live in March 2017 Zeux will leverage the infrastructure and data to provide best services to customers GDPR Regulation Zeux stores and protects your data information using advanced blockchain technologies ensuring every transaction is stored immutably and validated on the chain through consensus algorithms Only the customer has access to their own data and only the 27 \x0ccustomer can forward this information to open new accounts saving time and effort Zeux complies with all other GDPR requirements such as transfer of data outside the EU Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) This AML / KYC system allows Zeux to make the ownership and use of cryptocurrencies such as the ZeuxCoin safe and compliant By following EU standards we will be delivering a service our customers can truly trust This approach enables Zeux to monitor all incoming and outgoing blockchain transactions and check against key AML & KYC risk factors and see if they relate to suspicious activities such as \xe2\x97\x8f Dark Net Markets hidden markets that sell mainly illegal items \xe2\x97\x8f Mixers / Tumblers Attempts to disguise tainted / stolen tokens More than 80% of mixing activity is related to other suspicious entities \xe2\x97\x8f Scams Receiving funds from known scams \xe2\x97\x8f Unlicensed Money Service Businesses Unlicensed MSBs facilitate money laundering \xe2\x97\x8f Gambling In some jurisdictions online gambling is illegal 28 \x0cToken Overview The ZeuxCoin (ZUC) is the essential liquidity currency underpinning the

data vault A Zeux customer needs to hold 5X number of tokens to open X number of accounts Once opened these tokens will be locked for 1 week and can then be used transferred or sold afterwards but if the user wishes to open one more account to X+1 accounts they need to buy back all the tokens they sold plus two to get to 5X+5 tokens Since the number of the services on the Zeux platform will keep increasing users need to keep increasing their ZeuxCoin holding to get the best deal in the market 4 Reward currency for Loyalty Program All the ZeuxCoin holders also benefit from the Zeux Loyalty Program The tokens distributed for the Sign Up/Referral loyalty program and Active Customer loyalty program will come directly from introduction revenue Zeux receives The number of the tokens rewarded will be constantly adjusted as the customer base grows and when the tokens reach a higher value A proportion of the tokens Zeux receives from all fee revenues will be allocated to a pool that can only be redistributed through the Loyal Programs This will be written in the smart contract and hence cannot be changed There are 2 types of Loyalty Program for token holders a Sign Up/Referral Loyalty

currency of the Zeux platform The ZeuxCoin (ZUC) is the essential liquidity currency underpinning the Zeux ecosystem All the fees charged on the Zeux platform such as investment fees introduction fees all the cashback earned via crypto payments and all the bonuses earned by users such as referrals and holdings are denominated in ZeuxCoin The introduction fees of business providers will be determined in fiat currency and the fee will need to be exchanged to ZeuxCoin prior paying to Zeux If the provider does not hold ZeuxCoin they have the option to transfer fiat payment to Zeux and the company will exchange fiat currency to ZeuxCoin via its internal market making facility This creates constant demand for ZeuxCoin in the market as it is the only way to get access to all the services provided by Zeux The same logic goes for the investment fees for the end customers If the customer does not have enough ZeuxCoin to pay the investment fees they have the options to be charged in fiat and Zeux will exchange fiat currency to ZeuxCoin via its market making facility The cashback currency of crypto payments When an eligible ZeuxCoin holders spends any supported crypto currency including Bitcoin Ethereum or ZeuxCoin at a POS machine a fixed percentage of cashback of the payment currency will be rewarded to the user\xe2\x80\x99s e wallet For example if a user has spent 100ETH in purchases the user gets 0 6% cash back An equivalent value of 0 6 ETH will be paid in the form of ZUC This means the higher the ZUC price is the less the amount of ZUC a user will receive vice versa Token Supply and Demand ZeuxCoin will keep appreciating in price due to the constant demand and reducing supply of the tokens 1 Constant buying demand of ZeuxCoin 32 \x0cAll the paid services on the Zeux platform need to be paid in ZeuxCoin This creates constant demand from the partner businesses and Zeux customers to buy ZeuxCoin to obtain services All the crypto investment needs to be paid through ZeuxCoin To participate in crypto fund investment opportunities end customers need to keep buying ZeuxCoin to get to the right investment opportunity they want These two demands will push the ZeuxCoin price higher and higher when there is no active seller in the market 2 Increasing amount of holding requirement squeezes out the supply liquidity Zeux end customers need to hold a small number of ZeuxCoin to get access to Zeux services and get discount in fees As the Zeux user base grows a small holding requirement for an individual user will translate into a significant total holding requirement for all users All the Zeux partner businesses need to hold a significant amount of ZeuxCoin to get a discount to the introduction fees Given the finite supply of ZeuxCoin in circulation these two holding requirements will keep pushing the prices higher by reducing the supply in the market 3 The more you refer/invest in Zeux the higher the value each token will be worth The sign up/referral and active customer loyalty program has created an incentive scheme for customers to be rewarded for more positive behaviour that benefits the Zeux ecosystem Whenever either program is triggered it will Increase the revenue of Zeux which will create further demand by the business services companies and end customers to buy ZeuxCoin Squeeze ZeuxCoin out from circulation due to holding requirement These factors will drive the price of ZeuxCoin higher Any extra tokens awarded will have already become more valuable The benefit has a quanto effect 33 \x0cToken

Allocation Most of the funds raised from our TDE will go towards accelerating our growth rate through acquiring customers expanding our technology offering licenses and operational development Exchange Listing Cost 10% To make our tokens more liquid obtaining the hard cap can help us to list our token at the major crypto exchanges earlier to support the liquidity value of the token Licenses and Compliance 20% Obtain licenses in different countries to offer our full package of services Most importantly asset management services take time and require significant license fees There are significant costs associated with a high level of compliance including liquidity requirements for licenses Compliance requires thorough AML monitoring based on an increasing user base paying auditors and improving systems for our business development capabilities User acquisition operation cost 20% To grow rapidly we are implementing a similar strategy to most of fast growing companies We charge the end customer nothing at the beginning and warehouse all the processing related operational cost to gain the market share quickly Infrastructure 5% This includes data centres computing power and office space Technology Development 20% The first release of our product is almost complete at the date of TDE but we have ambitious plans to integrate more counterparties into our platforms add new functionality for end customers internalise payment processing issuing & acquiring and expanding to new geographies This all requires a lot of further development 37 \x0cOperational Staff 5% The Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) process is integral to client on boarding and will require additional hires in the operational base We also intend to hire more members for the executive management team as well as a market maker for ZeuxCoin Marketing 10% We need marketing to inform prospective clients of our features & world class security and compliance It\xe2\x80\x99s our primary means of acquiring new individual clients Our TDE will bring favourable attention to our product release but we will need further marketing to keep Zeux ahead of the pack Business Development 5% We need to hire more sales resource to onboard more clients and businesses to our platform This needs to be done very quickly across the globe to become to main entry point of the financial world Other Cost 5% Contingency Soft cap Hard cap While our hard cap would help our business grow more quickly achieving our soft cap would allow us to meet most of our requirements to start growing organically If we can achieve our hard cap the funds raised will allow us to expand our geographical cover of licenses marketing and integrating with local partners and investment providers faster Additionally we will be able get our tokens listed on more major exchanges sooner 38 \x0cAirdrop / Bounty Rationale and strategy The primary function of giving away tokens to a crowd is to help build a community and thus increase adoption This would typically be accomplished via the web site and a Telegram group \xe2\x80\x93 where users can sign up answer a survey (or some other useful task) The user leaves their Ethereum wallet address and gets a marker for x tokens A bounty of x tokens is offered for referrals This can quickly grow a healthy group 10 000 users in a week is possible 39
