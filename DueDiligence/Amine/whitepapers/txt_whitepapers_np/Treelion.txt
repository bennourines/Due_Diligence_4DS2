the world\xe2\x80\x99s population growth projection reaches 8 billion the dilemma between economic development and resources preservation becomes a much more pressing issue We observe a growing need to control carbon emission as well as the sustainable utilization of resources such as arable land water and other agricultural resources These needs will further promote the value of a greener economy and give rise to the development of greener industries The green economy is booming globally and green financing is becoming a major driver of tapping Environmental Social and Governance ( ESG )\ s investment potential and promoting sustainable development However the green economy suffers from slow development and is unbalanced due to technological limitations and lack of social investment Green Digital Finance The Internet has brought countless new opportunities TREELION is a green digital economic platform based on blockchain technology and created to solve the current pain points of the green economy through a brand new business model Backed by a decentralized structure Treelion targets to facilitate the online transfer of value and the secure storage of green assets TREELION trading platform and standards can be used to facilitate the transfer of green assets on a global scale A Gift For Future Generations TREELION\ s mission is not only to remove the barriers existing in international cooperation but also to create an infrastructure for the green digital economy powered by a safe reliable and scalable blockchain Through continuous feedback from external social capital corporations and individuals are effectively involved and participate actively in the global desertification control and emission control projects Ultimately TREELION facilitates the creation of a global sustainable green digital economy business ecosystem \x0c01 TREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 6 1 Project Background 1 1 Overview of the Global Green Economy Development Since the industrial revolution human society has developed rapidly With the rapid economic growth our reliance on coal based energy and carbon intensive industrial equipment has caused serious environmental problems including air soil water pollution as well as global climate issues There are more than 7 4 billion people in the world However land degradation is becoming an increasingly severe issue The competition for limited resources coupled with the rise of trade protectionism has intensified in recent years due to development constraints As resources become scarcer the green economy has become the inevitable choice for global industrial reforms Water resources management Carbon trading Renewable Energy Green Economy Land management Green Building Agriculture and Forestry The growth model of the global economy is witnessing the changes from its quantitative nature to one that is qualitative The green economy drives the efficient allocation of resources accelerates the optimization of industrial infrastructures promotes industrial transformation and becomes a new engine of economic growth \xe2\x80\x9c In 2007 the United Nations Environment Program defined the \xe2\x80\x9cgreen economy\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can economy that values people and nature and creates decent and high paying jobs\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9d The green economy is no longer limited to the sole objective of ecological protection but that which also emphasizes the overall transformation of the economic system improving the global environment while creating high value industries \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM Value of the Global Green Economy 54 90 2018US$ TRILLION 2030US$ TRILLION In 2018 FTSE Russell\ s research pointed out that the global green economy was valued at 54 trillion US dollars and will continue to grow By 2030 the green economy value is expected to reach 90 trillion US dollars Resource Allocation Traditional Industry Green Economy Resource intensive and Emphasis

development and its sustainability 7 \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 8 1 2 Rapid Growth for ESG and SRI ESG stands for Environmental Social and Governance ESG is an indicator to measure the performance of a company\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable development efforts An increasing number of financial institutions consider ESG in their decision making processes ESG can help investment institutions achieve a certain level of risk aversion while improving investment returns at the same time In recent years an increasing number of investors and asset management companies have introduced ESG indicators into their framework for corporate research and investment decisions Institutions such as Thomson Reuters and MSCI have developed their own ESG factor assessment frameworks The Hong Kong Exchange has also introduced Environmental Social and Governance Guidelines to strengthen the disclosure obligations of issuers to third parties \xe2\x80\x9c ESG stands for Environmental Social and Governance An increasing number of financial institutions consider ESG in their decision making and risk evaluating process \xe2\x80\x9d Due to increasingly strict regulatory and disclosure requirements ESG factors will only become more important and can positively regulate corporate governance As a result the demand for ESG and green economy will grow rapidly in the future \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 1 3 Pain Points of the Green Economy Development The development of the green economy globally suffers from serious inequalities due to the differences in technology systems financial resources and natural resources The scale and output of the green economy in developed countries is much higher than those in developing regions Developing countries account for 60% of the global land area and their development potential of green assets is promising The output of the green economy in developed countries is relatively high but has much more room for improvement At present the development of the green economy faces three major problems the difference in international and local standards the inefficiency of markets and current business models are not sustainable As a result the liquidity and returns of green assets are relatively low which inhibits the expansion of the green economy Differences in international and local standards This situation exacerbates the differences in the development of green economy across different countries which inhibits the expansion of the green economy on a global scale Low liquidity in the green assets market Green assets lack standardization in cross border secondary markets The onerous verification process includes the registering of trading licenses preparation of legal documents and due diligence research reports constitutes a large workload This results in a glacial verification process that causes transactional inefficiency which seriously affects the liquidity of assets A lack of sustainable business models At present the green economy heavily relies on governmental and public investments The scope of the public\ s understanding of what a green economy entails is limited to just environmental protection which is limited as a passive measure to protect the environment This can only result in the lack of involvement in the green economy on society\xe2\x80\x99s part Limited social capital investments People in developing countries generally regard the green economy as a method of environmental protection for economic development reasons There are less investments in green projects in developing countries compared to developed countries 1 4 Opportunities brought by the Green Economy 1 4 1 Rapid Development of the Internet and the Digital Economy History is defined by core technological leaps that have helped improve the ways we trade communicate transfer assets and exchange value Economic development has grown at an unprecedented rate in the past 100 years which have facilitated technological improvements in all fields from infrastructure development to the establishment of a mature financial system Our work and life are increasingly dependent on the Internet We can foresee that people will experience a transition from the engagement of the internet for its information to its ability to generate value In addition to information exchange more and more assets will be transferred online as the Internet has greatly improved the speed of modern information exchange and promoted the efficiency of economic development 9 \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 10 Technological developments in information infrastructure such as mobile phones and the advent of 5G networks improves our access to information and the decentralized exchange without involving third party intermediaries in the financial and other industries We will soon transit from an information based Internet to that of information and value The Internet will not only be used to facilitate information sharing but also to facilitate the transfer of assets and value online The field of fintech development payment artificial intelligence blockchain cloud computing and big data will be gradually adopted Digital economies and ecosystems will change our perception of the economy and our lifestyles Indeed they will become a new driver of economic growth 1 4 2 Limitless Opportunities In the traditional economic development models gaps in locations languages cultures and market systems are all barriers to economic development Even though humans have developed countless ways to improve our communication efficiency these barriers still exist This is why digital ecosystems are needed they remove barriers that are present in the real economy while producing real returns for all participants For instance consumers in Xinjiang a remote province in western China and in first tier cities such as Shanghai have access to commodities at the same price on e commerce platforms This is a great example of how digital economies can benefit consumers through implementing transformational technologies in solid business modelsand is a great illustration of the power of digital economy 1 4 3 Blockchain as a tool to build Trust The development of the digital economy from the exchange of information to the exchange of value is based on trust As the Internet rapidly influences all aspects of our daily life our original trust model cannot meet our current needs Therefore an open transparent immutable exchange mechanism to record transactions among market participants on the Internet is needed Therefore we can protect the privacy of the participants and enhance the exchange of assets Blockchain technology can solve this problem for it has technical attributes that can be employed for distributed data storage point to point transmission consensus mechanism and encryption algorithms The fact that blockchain data can\ t be changed provides the foundation of trust for the digital economy Its open source nature allows anyone to access data at any time without third party intermediaries enabling greater level of transparency Combining blockchain technology green physical assets and building a standard green financing platform to improve market liquidity which is able to tap the investment potential of green assets and attract more social capital investments in the developing green economy \x0c02 TREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 11 2 TREELION Introduction 2 1 TREELION Brand Connotation The name \xe2\x80\x9cTREELION\xe2\x80\x9d can be split into two parts \xe2\x80\x9cTREE\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cELION\xe2\x80\x9d TREE symbolizes the need for de desertification and reforestation and ELION represents our brand ELION Group the creator of TREELION TREELION will combine the digital economy with green technologies and develop a new market in the trillion dollar green digital economy 2 2 What is TREELION TREELION is the infrastructure that allows the production management and distribution of green digital assets We will build a blockchain trading platform for green assets and provide green digital financial solutions by implementing exchange standards and support enterprise level green asset registration management transactions certifications and other services to solve the current pain points of the green economy 2 3 Advantages TREELION is a project designed to lead the green economy in Asia and China which has a competitive advantage in the global digital economy infrastructure The decentralized nature of the blockchain enables the asset value to be stored in a system that is trustworthy is able to leverage the efficiency of business operations cuts cost and increase the scale of operations The intention of TREELION\xe2\x80\x99S entrance into the market at this point of time is to establish a first mover advantage in the digitization of the green economy and acquire a strong presence in the new era of green digital finance \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 12 With the population growth and resource shortages the ecological transformation of deserts have brought huge economic benefits in recent years First the degraded land that was uninhabitable to humans is transformed into high value agricultural and industrial land after being greened Second the investments in natural resources and mining on the new land will bring direct economic benefits Third the newly relocated population will develop the local economy and raise the income level of the natives Therefore Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s environmental protection policies are leading in the world from the perspective of scale capital involved and execution effectiveness Chinese government recently announced that it plans to green all the desert land in the country by 2050 at the Kubuqi International Desert Forum of 2019 A satellite photo provided by NASA in 2019 clearly shows that China\ s area with greenery has grown rapidly accounting for half of the world\ s greenery However the greening technology of degraded land is not as simple as people may think It is very difficult to ensure the survival of the seeds The Elion Group China\ s leader in eco restoration and global sand control is recognized by the United Nation and will play an important role as it will share its 30 years of experience and know how \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 13 For example the ELION Group has restored a total of 6 353 square kilometers of deserts in Kubuqi during the past 30 years Elion has become a world leader in water control and planting technology and has developed more than 240 core ecological patents It owned more than 1 000 kinds of seeds that are resistant to cold drought and salt conditions It has also developed more than a hundred technologies as well as a leading big data system related to desertification controls This system improves decision making processes and provides tools to analyze monitor and manage soil conditions via the usage of advanced big data technologies United Nations Ecological Assessment Report on Sand Control in the Kubuqi desert by the Elion Group The Kubuqi model a third major industrial strength of China\ s after the development of the high speed train and nuclear power technology will support the Belt and Road strategy and play an important role in promoting the global green economy 2 4 Support the Real Economy via the Green Digital Economy With the establishment of the green digital economy market TREELION will generate multiple economic benefits through reforestation increasing carbon emission allowance from said reforestation renewable energy and Internet platforms through their global reach TREELION will also accelerate the development of the real economy For example TREELION can register existing green assets created by the ELION Group (forests carbon emission allowances etc ) on the blockchain enabling digitized green assets to be transferred globally more quickly Society as a whole can also participate more transparently in the investment process of the green economy via the TREELION trading platform By obtaining investment funds it is possible for startups to further expand production thereby achieving better economies of scale and financial sustainability At the same time using the advantages brought by the Internet and borderless value exchange TREELION aims to promote the standardization of the green economy to enhance the liquidity of green assets markets and to create a new trillion dollar market for the green economy \x0c03 TREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 14 3 TREELION Ecosystem of Green Digital Economy 3 1 Introduction of the Green Digital Finance Ecosystem To build a complete green digital economic infrastructure TREELION ecosystem includes a range of compliant green digital asset trading platforms standardized green digital assets green digital investment tools as well as a green public Blockchain ecosystem The bottom layer of the TREELION green digital economy is a decentralized system which will be initially developed based on Ethereum and will be used as a storage medium for green digital assets 3 2 Architecture of the General Economic System in TREELION To promote the circulation of value and its conversion TREELION issues a digital currency called TRN token which functions in the following manner 1) TRN acts as a token of the trading platform for green digital assets with which users are able to use and pay for transaction fees and TRN holders can receive up to 50% discount on transaction fees while trading on the exchange 2) TRN is also a means of exchange in the TREELION green digital economy ecosystem The platform users can contribute TRN to incubate green digital assets on TREELION platform The tokens will be passed to the issuer and creator of the asset and in exchange contributors will get concessions and privilege from our platform and ecosystem such as extra discount on exchange transactions and vouchers for airline tickets etc 3) TRN acts as the Gas on TREELION public chain and is also used to prevent spam and allocate resources on the network 4) TREELION works with third party developers and applications to promote the usage of TRN as a payment token For example TRN will incentivize the airlines to reduce their carbon emissions and consumers will also be able to use TRN to purchase tickets on the ZatGo platform the blockchain version of Ctrip TREELION decided to develop two areas that are relatively mature in the blockchain industry transactions and payments Once the market conditions communities technological developments and fund reserves are mature enough TREELION public Blockchain will be developed and TREELION ecosystem will be gradually migrated TRN will first be built on the Ethereum platform The TREELION ecosystem will transit to its native Blockchain once the mainnet launches \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER

solid network and a global trading system of green assets Institutional and retail investors can trade fairly and quickly on the exchange at a low cost By bringing together fragmented markets the trading volume and trading activities of green digital assets in TREELION\ s trading system will reach an unprecedented scale We will strive to operate licensed green digital asset trading platforms in key markets through international cooperation Our exchanges will meet the highest standards in terms of technology and security while meeting stringent KYC and AML requirements TREELION is actively working to acquire trading licenses with partners in Saudi Arabia the Philippines Luxembourg Japan and other countries TREELION partners with local green economy projects and aims to improve global liquidity by merging local trading platforms We expect to launch the first green digital financial exchange in Hong Kong China in Q1 of 2020 and plan to apply for a virtual banking license in the future \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 16 3 2 1 1 Spot Trading The world\ s mainstream green project owners need a green financial trading venue with credibility and sufficient liquidity TREELION\ s green digital trading platform is designed to standardize green digital assets that can be queried traded transmitted and secured at very low cost using blockchain technology At the same time the exchange will facilitate the trading of key cryptocurrency trading pairs (no more than 10) and fiat trading Exchange Profit Sources The profit of the exchange comes from transaction fees The trading fees are tentatively set at 0 1% (taker and maker) TRN holders can receive up to 50% discount for trading on the exchange In addition the exchange will implement a strict review mechanism for online transactions and will charge certain due diligence costs and technical costs \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 17 3 2 1 2 Derivatives Trading The exchange will initially provide spot trading services We intend to introduce appropriate derivatives trading products to meet the hedging needs of professional traders once enough traders use the TREELION exchange platform and such derivative trading is compliant with related regulations TREELION derivatives trading will focus on the following products Index Trading First we will list the overall indexes as well as related regional indexes (emerging market index European index etc ) and product related indexes (carbon trading index energy index etc ) to help institutional and retail investors understand the markets We will then select indices and transform them into investable products such as active index products (e g ESG index) and options that can hedge market risks (e g market volatility index and etc ) Carbon Emission Allowances Derivatives Trading Through the development of carbon trading options we will provide risk hedging tools to meet the needs of professional investment institutions while increasing the trading volume of digital carbon trading to some degree and improve the platform wide price discovery processes Agricultural Products Derivatives Transaction Agricultural products are one of the key areas of the green economy and transactions with digital certification will form an important complement to traditional agricultural products trading In fact agricultural product derivatives trading has a very deep impact on the spot price of agricultural products on the traditional futures exchange such as CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) We aim to facilitate the use of digital certificates in trade related derivatives and thus fully digitize agricultural product registrations and derivative trading on a dedicated platform \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM We aim to build the world\ s leading green trading market by providing the best products and to promote its adoption in different countries and regions Under the One Belt One Road initiative we hope that we can contribute to the development of green economy in these regions through the implementation of digital connections and upgrading local green financing infrastructures 3 2 2 Standardized Green Digital Assets Building a system to standardize the assets is the basis for promoting the expansion of green financial transactions The global green asset standards are very complicated mainly because of the lack of a common standard due to limited international cooperation caused by information asymmetry a lack of exchange transparency and the uneven economic development level in different countries and regions Therefore transactions of green assets (such as carbon emission allowances water resources electricity) are extremely costly and these costs include information costs identification costs language gaps and foreign exchange risks As a result such assets suffer from low liquidity Digital assets based on blockchain can facilitate the transfer of green assets internationally to a certain extent should the digital assets be standardized By registering green physical assets on the blockchain standardized digital assets can be transferred globally faster more conveniently and at lower cost The query and transaction costs on the blockchain are much lower than on traditional trading markets The information of the assets like categories attributes authentication methods locations registration agencies certification bodies etc can be queried anytime anywhere The decentralized online transactions are fast and low cost Hence the transaction threshold is reduced Traceability Confirmation Data on the blockchain is traceable Blockchain technology is immutable and immutable Audit reports certifi Once green assets are registered online cation reports etc will be recorded on the uniqueness of on chain assets can the blockchain to ensure that each be confirmed and the ownership infor digital asset can be traced back mation is transparent Value Intermediary The use of digital assets as value intermediaries can significantly reduce the transaction costs TREELION will use carbon emission allowances as a starting point to promote global green asset standardization In the future more green assets such as forest resources renewable energy plants (solar energy) and organic agriculture businesses will be added into TREELION ecosystem 18 \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM Case Digital Carbon show Emission Allowance Case Digital Carbon Emission Allowance The processes activities and mechanisms by which green plants absorb carbon dioxide produce carbon credits The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that restricts carbon dioxide emissions from countries around the world It was established in December 1997 in Kyoto Japan during three meetings of the UNFCCC The Protocol defines carbon emission cap over a period of time for each participating country jurisdiction or industry Participating entities can meet their emission restrictions requirements by purchasing or selling carbon emission allowances to offset emissions at the end of each period If a company\xe2\x80\x99s emission allowance exceeds its actual emissions this company can sell the remaining allowances Conversely if the company\ s emissions exceed its emissions requirements it needs to purchase carbon allowances from other companies or from auctions by governments 19 \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER EU 2030 Target TREELION COM 40% Decrease in Carbon Emissions 50 60% 20 Carbon emission allowances have economic value The current price of global CO2 emission allowances widely differs among regions The price in Europe is about US$24 6/ton while the price in major Chinese regions is about US$6 1/ton China 2030 Target Decrease in Carbon Emissions According to the \xe2\x80\x9cParis Agreement \xe2\x80\x9c the EU\xe2\x80\x99s objective is to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 China\xe2\x80\x99s CO2 emissions are also expected to decrease by 2030 Carbon dioxide emission /GDP ratio in China fell by about 60% 65% since 2005 Finally the price of carbon allowances is expected to reach 55 Euros per ton by 2030 according to Carbon Tracker \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 21 TREELION was created to solve global carbon trading pain points via digital carbon trading establish an internationally recognized exchang standard and generate sustainable profits in an open and liquid carbon trading market The cost of emission allowance can be reduced by leveraging efficient market mechanisms Polluters are incentivized to reduce their emissions The market liquidity is improved and eventually a carbon trading financial system can be established TREELION will use electronic and satellite equipment to measure the carbon sinks and will engage a professional third party to certify its amount TREELION will also apply local standards (such as \xe2\x80\x9cUnited Nations REDD+ Standards\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChina Certified Emission Reduction Credit (CCER)\xe2\x80\x9d etc ) to ensure compliance in many jurisdictions After the certification process the carbon sink certificate will be registered as a digital asset The first digital carbon sink asset will come from the Kubuqi Desert provided by the ELION Group The geographical coordinates of the plantations is 116\xc2\xb055\xe2\x80\xb255\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2~109\xc2\xb016\xe2\x80\xb208\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2

automobile companieswill need an increasing amount of carbon emission allowances The development of innovative and international carbon emission allowance products will help us further expand the global carbon allowance markets and increase our market share In addition to the Kubuqi Desert TREELION will combine more types of ESG projects to enhance the economic value of its ecosystem For details please refer to the section introducing the TREELION public chain 3 2 3 Green Digital ESG Investment Tool Statiscally China needs at least 320 to 640 billion US dollars of green investments each year to solve the environmental and climate change issues The People\ s Bank of China stated that public investments can only cover 10% to 15% of the total funds needed which is not sufficient Therefore the private sector is expected to become the largest source of capital for green transformation Its contribution rate is expected to reach 85% to 90% 10% 15% private funding 85% 90% public funding TREELION will collaborate with Saudi Arabia North Africa Europe and other regions to establish a standardized green business model through eco friendly technologies and digital economic techniques TRN will be used as a value intermediary in the incubation of global green economy projects TREELION aims to reduce the financing thresholds as well as improve efficiency in green financial markets so that green assets can get financed more efficiently and more people can participate in the incubation of green assets and get benefits from them at a lower cost \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 23 3 2 4 TREELION Public Chain 3 2 4 1 Blockchain Technology Overview Blockchain technology is the foundation on which Bitcoin is built upon and it integrates a variety of technologies like distributed data storage P2P networks consensus mechanisms smart contracts encryption algorithms etc A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions on the peer to peer network The basic structure of the underlying ledger is a chain of blocks which are linked by hash values Hash values allow anybody to compute whether a block was produced according to the agreed set of rules called consensus All network participants (nodes) can propose adding a new block However a unique consensus mechanism must be used to add the block and verify transactions Trustworthiness Blockchain cuts the need for third party intermediaries Cost reduction Compared to traditional technologies blockchain technology can lead to faster transactions through automated contract execution and reduce maintenance costs Enhanced security Blockchain technology facilitates safe and reliable audit and transaction clearance 3 2 4 2 Development Philosophy of TREELION Public Chain The TREELION public chain aims to become the largest green digital platform integrating the Internet of Things big data and artificial intelligence technologies to provide G BaaS (Green Blockchain as a Service) services including green asset registration management auditing and supply chain financing services The TREELION public chain technology white paper is expected to be released in Q2 of 2020 and the mainnet is expected to launch in 2021 TREELION public chain mainly brings together real and virtual assets exploring three topics like transaction security transaction speed and compliance Currently there is no efficient solution to link assets on the blockchain and may give rise to fraud We are currently researching a set of low cost and real time auditing models which can be used to confirm an entity\ s attributes geographic location authentication and other information We are also considering the implications of asset registration and redemption on the blockchain as millions of dollars of virtual assets are lost every year Lost virtual assets are difficult to retrieve on the Blockchain due to its immutability We want to build a user friendly compliant and safe trading system We need to consider many financial policies and technical challenges and help the green economy expand rapidly \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 24 TREELION will utilize the big data system developed by the ELION Group and blockchain technology to strengthen desertification control efficiency improve information utilization and standardized desertification control process on a global scale This system monitors sites in five major desertification areas in China Kubuqi Desert Tengger Desert Ulan Buh Desert Mu Us Desert and Taklimakan Desert It has five sub data systems to monitor soil water quality and desert atmosphere soil microbes satellite remote sensing soil and water quality data in real time These data will be recorded on the blockchain which is true traceable and immutable Through ecological data recording and tracking (i e rainfall soil fertility biodiversity etc ) a multi factor evaluation system for global green projects will be designed In this way we can try to build a

Mechanism In recent years an increasing number of physical assets have been registered on the blockchain However information asymmetry issues may arise due to the lack of industry standards which causes doubts about the authenticity and uniqueness of the corresponding digital assets PoA (Proof of Authenticity) is a set of standards that proves that the on chain assets represent physical assets Through the standardization of asset registrations and professional auditing practices key participants of the green economy (suppliers custodians certification bodies and auditors) will use multi signature technology to digitize physical assets Blockchain technology will be used to solve discordant issues of digital and physical assets as well as solve potential fraud caused by information asymmetry Data transparency is achieved through smart contracts and Inter Planetary File System ( IPFS ) Each digital and physical asset can be tracked PoA is not equivalent to Pow (Proof of Work) or PoS (Proof of Stake) PoA is a set of standards for the digitization of physical assets Standardized digital carbon emission allowances are generated by PoA for instance The information of green vegetation carbon emission allowances land and renewable energy (solar photovoltaic energy) will be registered and audited Carbon emission allowances will be certified by REDD+ CCER and Norwegian Classification Society complying with local regulations An audit report will also be recorded on chain Converting carbon emission allowances into digital assets on the blockchain will require multiple signatures from custodians certifiers and auditors to ensure carbon emission allowances and their equivalent digital assets are pegged and exchangeable \x0cTREELION WHITEPAPER TREELION COM 26 DAPP Digital Assets Physical assets can be digitized using by multi party digital signatures such as suppliers custodians certification bodies and auditors Digital assets will be burned if they are redeemable Asset confirmation The equity and information of green assets such as carbon emission allowance generated by green plants and electricity generated by solar energy will be certified and audited by authoritative organizations Asset deposit Green assets are recorded in an authoritative and standardized manner via professional tools Green asset names attributes lifetime owners and other information will be recorded onto the blockchain Asset registration process The most important technical feature of Ethereum is the smart contract Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain that can be used for the process of verification Smart contract execution cannot be altered and PoA based digital assets will be generated and redeemed via smart contracts The execution in generation and redemption process of each digital asset requires multiple signatures from custodians certifiers and auditors Registration Certificate of Carbon Emission Allowance Passed Passed Multi signature by custodians certifiers and auditors Passed Detect carbon allowance report file Generation of DCARBON Check the amount of DCARBON Did not pass DCARBON Use Case Registration failed \x0cTREELION

annual audit to confirm the information of physical assets We will be transparent and partner with independent third party accounting firms such as the Big 4 We will issue quarterly audits and verification reports of digital assets to certify their uniqueness and authenticity The audit report and audit results will be recorded on the blockchain through the IPFS network and will be available to the public The auditor checks the project report and the carbon emission test report Then he checks the corresponding digital asset report on the blockchain Re Audit no The auditor generates the
