b Cybr \xe2\x80\x93 Cyber Security Ecosystem and Utility Token White Paper \xe2\x80\x94 April 26 2019 By Shawn R Key Matthew Spaeth and David Donnenfeld Cybrtoken io Cybr@Cybrtoken io \x0cContents Executive Summary 4 Enter CYBR 7 CYBR Real World Application 13 CYBR Ecosystem Review 18 CYBR Architecture 20 The Company 23 The Team 28 Threat Intelligence Community (TIC) 30 Roadmap 31 Tokenomics 32 \x0cExecutive Summary Over $1B in financial losses occurred in the cryptocurrency space in 2018\xe2\x80\xa6 and these were just the reported incidents The primary cause was due to hackers who were able to circumvent the countermeasures and safeguards that exist in the crypto ecosystem With an ever\xe2\x80\x91increasing market cap these financial losses will continue to mount until a \xe2\x80\x9cstandard of care\xe2\x80\x9d is established and proper cybersecurity policy procedures and controls are established Enter CYBR \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY A Stolen Horse Growing up in Virginia I am often reminded of an expression Southerners use \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t lock up the stable after the horse has been stolen \xe2\x80\x9d When weighing the need for cybersecurity in the blockchain space this old adage could not apply more nor be more appropriate An Abbreviated History The parabolic rise and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies portends the enormity of its potential impact There is widespread speculation Some pundits predict a cashless society in less than a decade and the more outspoken supporters of Bitcoin predict a price that shall eventually crest seven figures The detractors irrespective of authority and stature utter a single word in dismissing the viability of widespread adoption and that word is \xe2\x80\x9cscam\xe2\x80\x9d Not a pretty word While it certainly speaks to the level of threat the old guard senses from the emergence of crypto and decentralized systems it also smacks of a fundamental concern that these \xe2\x80\x9cmonies\xe2\x80\x9d can be taken as easily as they can be created While swindlers and charlatans can be found in all businesses if digital assets and virtual currencies cannot be secured they can not be widely adopted The irony of course is that crypto and blockchain technologies have garnered public support as a result of a collective distrust for our existing governments monetary policies and fiat currencies on the whole Certainly there is compelling evidence that points to governing corruption across the globe What can be said about crypto Consider the following In June 2016 Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) had 50mm stolen Running on the Ethereum network written in the language of Solidity a simple flaw was responsible In 2014 Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy claiming it had lost 750 000 Bitcoin In January 2018 Coincheck a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange was hacked for approximately 534mm USD After being hacked in April 2017 South Korean Exchange Youbit stated it did its \xe2\x80\x9cbest to improve the security recruitment and system maintenance \xe2\x80\x9d In December 2017 Youbit was hacked again losing 17% of its total crypto holdings Parent company Yapian filed for bankruptcy Bancor raised 153mm in June 2017 to develop a decentralized liquidity network i e a decentralized exchange of the highest order In July it was hacked for 23 5mm On the same day as Bancor a hack on a popular VPN compromised \xe2\x80\x9cMy Ether Wallet (MEW) \xe2\x80\x9d a widely used service to manage ethereum network cryptos 4 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY The list could go on Still it would be remiss not to mention the astonishing number of individuals who have been hacked or scammed out of their crypto The laundry list continues as high profile ICOs have been victimized by phishing attacks and there has been no shortage of exit scams in the space Even simple human error can be costly as one unfortunate individual learned when he inadvertently spent 50 Bitcoin in transferring fees 1 1\xe2\x80\x82\x0750 BTC Mining Fees https //www blockchain com/btc/tx/ d38bd67153d774a7dab80a055cb52571aa85f6cac8f35f936c4349ca308e6380 Hacking and Internet based crimes are not unique nor confined to crypto A 2017 Norton Report stated that $172 billion was hacked from nearly a billion consumers worldwide More than half the adult population online can count themselves as victims of cybercrime and mainstream stories like the Equifax breach have grabbed headlines However the nascent asset class that is crypto and distributed ledger technologies (\xe2\x80\x9cDLT\xe2\x80\x9d) is acutely vulnerable Nothing can destroy a revolutionary overhauling of a monetary system faster than a plague of theft Stateside Measures Security has become such a concern that congress introduced the \xe2\x80\x9chack back\xe2\x80\x9d bill allowing businesses to attack their attacker\xe2\x80\x99s computers or networks \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe A \x07 ctive Cyber Defense Certainty Act introduced this amendment to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act anti hacking law Two clich\xc3\xa9s come to mind when I see this \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9csometimes the cure is worse than the disease \xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe \x07Identifying a hacker often takes time and analysis \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe \x07Hackers have become more savvy and readily circumvent detection \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe \x07Ordinary researchers are not capable of performing such analyses \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe H \x07 ackers often leave clues in the code and spoof that evidence e g leaving code from known hacking organizations in malware \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe \x07The amendment only applies within the United States \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe \x07Most attacks come from abroad and \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe \x07Those that don\xe2\x80\x99t are often routed through servers that come from overseas WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 | CYBR 5 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Governing bodies have already enacted a number of stops on the \xe2\x80\x9chack back\xe2\x80\x9d amendment \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe B \x07 efore taking action against attackers the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF) must be alerted \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe P \x07 rying into hacking networks may be an obstruction to ongoing investigations and non permitted retaliation is potentially criminal The NCIJTF is led by the FBI and the FBI defense review is worried that actions taken by private organizations could effectively trigger our government\xe2\x80\x99s international legal responsibility As DLT winds its way into the mainstream the stakes are rapidly being raised Quantifying prevention is not easy but it is easy to overlook When Equifax hackers made off with the private information of 143 million people who is responsible for what is an en masse modern\xe2\x80\x91day home invasion Is it a victimless crime if insurance pays Reality is that the ultimately accountable Equifax is not held liable and as of now no one is reimbursing lost crypto If the last four digits of our social security numbers can be sold on the dark web in what stead should we hold the security of digitized currency Digital assets are currently being used as mediums of exchange as stores of value and more They are the equivalent of money bartering tools precious metals as well as the lifeblood of emerging ecosystems Make no mistake horses have been stolen and many more thieves are coming We can no longer overlook the clear and present threat to the technologies that are poised to reshape our world It is time to secure the blockchain 6 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 \x0cEnter CYBR \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Good Cyber Threat Intelligence (TI) is continuously refined information that hones in on potential or current attacks that can threaten any system Unlike most token generating events (\xe2\x80\x9cTGEs\xe2\x80\x9d) where a theoretical idea is presented and implementation is to follow much of the CYBR solution is already built and being utilized in enterprise environments CYBR is an ever expanding compendium of information combined with state of the art software solutions that will be optimized for the blockchain CYBR is a holistic security solution that will endeavor to secure wallets smart contract transactions and associated transactions and activities that take place in the blockchain space To this point it is safe to say there is a truly pressing need for top flight cybersecurity in the realm of crypto However there are very few parties qualified to provide the needed level of security With that in mind let us momentarily stray from the traditional structure of a white paper Thus far the \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\xe2\x80\x9d has been addressed Now let us the broach the most critical component of such an undertaking \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthe who \xe2\x80\x9d The Vision and the Visionary CYBR\xe2\x80\x99s founder Shawn Key (detailed bio and related links under \xe2\x80\x9cTeam\xe2\x80\x9d at CYBRtoken io) is a cybersecurity veteran of some notoriety He is attributed as the person first described as an \xe2\x80\x9cethical hacker \xe2\x80\x9d based on an article in a governmental trade magazine 2 The term presaged the popular \xe2\x80\x9cwhite hat hacker\xe2\x80\x9d by more than a decade after Shawn successfully found his way into numerous federal networks in 1999 \xe2\x9d\x9d W\x07 e invest in people not ideas \xe2\x9d\x9e \xe2\x80\x93 \x07A maxim of venture capitalists Shawn\xe2\x80\x99s facility and acumen in the field were widely noted and his early contributions to \xe2\x80\x9cinformation security \xe2\x80\x9d aka \xe2\x80\x9cinformation assurance \xe2\x80\x9d were seminal A few years later the industry would become known as \xe2\x80\x9ccybersecurity \xe2\x80\x9d Some of his early work included one of the first patch management solutions which was acquired by a company that eventually sold to IBM for some $500M USD He quickly garnered a reputation as someone who could \xe2\x80\x9csee around the corner \xe2\x80\x9d Over the last ten years Mr Key\xe2\x80\x99s cyber services company has maintained a flawless reputation and is currently a subcontractor to Raytheon (see CYBRtoken io under \xe2\x80\x9cPartners\xe2\x80\x9d) Raytheon has the distinction of earning the largest cybersecurity contract awarded in US history of 1 115B USD \x072 www govexec com/magazine/1999/04/information insecurity/5989 8 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY In recent years Shawn\xe2\x80\x99s focus has been on the underlying solutions that make up the CYBR Ecosystem \xe2\x80\x94 a real time vulnerability analysis solution that can assess the security posture of ANY public facing IP address The solution is highly scalable and its database of digital identifiers is crypto centric meaning it seeks out the vulnerabilities and potential exploitations that primarily are relative to the crypto and blockchain infrastructure CYBRSCAN \xe2\x80\x94 The endpoint solution that roots out malicious code using fuzzy logic machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) BlindSpot incorporates proprietary algorithms that identify exact AND partial matches of malicious code preventing advanced persistent threats (APTs) from exploiting operating system application and other code flaws that can lead to data and / or financial loss BLINDSPOT The software solution has gone through its share of iterations and pivots but the concepts of detecting malicious code and associated bad actor activity were consistent themes throughout his numerous grants and awards received for his work These include but are not limited to \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe M \x07 ach37 Cyber Accelerator awarded $150 000 in grants via Mach37 and the Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe D \x07 ell Founders 50 Club recognized Shawn\xe2\x80\x99s technology as one of the top 50 most disruptive technologies in the world \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe T \x07 andem NSI associated with the National Security Agency (NSA) awarded Mr Key for one of the best technologies in the D C metro area M A LWA R E I N F O R M AT I O N S H A R I N G P L AT F O R M \xe2\x80\x94 a centralized location for emerging threat data that can be turned into actionable intelligence With the CYBR MISP proliferation of threats can be minimized and financial losses significantly reduced (MISP) \xe2\x80\x94 If two minds are better than one then thousands are better than two The TIP accepts threat intelligence \xe2\x80\x9ctips\xe2\x80\x9d from the CYBR community which in turn is rewarded in CYBR tokens for its contributions Think of the TIP as a 365 / 24 / 7 bug bounty on steroids T H R E AT I N T E L L I G E N C E P O RTA L ( T I P ) Origin of Solutions\xe2\x80\x99 Concepts Mr Key was intrigued by cryptocurrency and with each passing hack this interest morphed into the central preoccupation in his life He quickly found that many of the exploitations were similar to \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d attacks What he dealt with in every day enterprise systems mirrored the methodologies used in the majority of reported hacks He determined that BlindSpot was applicable to the blockchain and it became his mission to optimize it for cryptocurrencies in securing smart contracts and associated transactions Although it poses some unique challenges and there are inherent differences Mr Key realized that his experience could improve the security posture of the world of crypto The last year has been solely focused on what has evolved into CYBR Welcome to the CYBR Security Ecosystem and Utility Token WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 | CYBR 9 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Not Your Father\xe2\x80\x99s Antivirus While antivirus (\xe2\x80\x9cAV\xe2\x80\x9d) software hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sounded relevant for a long time threat detection and eradication has remained at the fore for government and many private sector organizations Sensitive data and the protection of these assets have grown in scope commensurate with our advancements in technology Unfortunately the general public has not benefited from this growth and the displays of negligence in corporate America provide unimpeachable evidence to this point There have been numerous data breaches of sensitive information and despite the headlines they\xe2\x80\x99ve captured it has ceased to be a priority to those responsible for securing said data Society pays the cost for the mishaps of Target Equifax and similar while specialized agencies have continually evolved against growing threats As crypto takes hold and drives towards critical mass the need for a gold standard of security and an attendant solution has never been greater Elegant Robust CYBR like good TI itself is a multi fisted attack that provides real time safeguards countermeasures threat intel and secure transactions via three distinct methods \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe C \x07 YBRscan \xe2\x80\x94 proprietary software solution that identifies vulnerabilities on ANY IP based device in ANY language \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe B \x07 lindSpot \xe2\x80\x94 A proprietary software that powers a potentially borderless landscape of threat identification \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe P \x07 ortal (MISP/TIP) \xe2\x80\x94 CYBR utilizes a real time pedigreed data feed heretofore not available to the general public Identifying a threat is one thing removing it is another and it\xe2\x80\x99s still another to prevent its return Standard issue solutions can tell you something is wrong but can\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily eradicate the problem nor detect the evolution of threats They are simply obsolesced by current malware Work a day antivirus software is nothing more than a compilation of known threats with basic search capabilities Today\xe2\x80\x99s malware has adapted and can morph into a slightly different version of known viruses The result is that malicious code is no longer identifiable by standard AV software The permutations of known viruses that 10 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 can continually plague networks are known as advanced persistent threats (\xe2\x80\x9cAPTs\xe2\x80\x9d) and standard software has no solution for it BlindSpot not only detects \xe2\x80\x9cbad actor \xe2\x80\x9d associated illicit file activities and APTs soon they will be disrupted The three primary tenets of risk management in relation to TI and ensuring data are as follows 1 Confidentiality 2 Integrity 3 Availability \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY BlindSpot captures attack signatures by deploying a combination of fuzzy logic machine learning in concert with artificial intelligence Whence identified this information is distributed to the protected community via the blockchain As previously mentioned to augment the supporting data that runs concurrently with BlindSpot one of the CYBR\xe2\x80\x99s token initiatives is to reward community members for identifying suspicious activities via the TIP This influx of data will also provide CYBR with TI that will differentiate it from other competitors and allow CYBR to have the largest repository of TI digital identifiers in the world Being Smarter Smart contracts are a protocol that executes the terms of a contract The potential efficiencies it offers are myriad and game changing It is a revolutionary time saver that can considerably reduce expenses sidestep legal entanglements and associated costs The applications for smart contracts are growing by the day and they are the lifeblood of distributed ledgers The company believes that the primary stumbling block for mass adoption of blockchain technology is security and aims to establish a \xe2\x80\x9cbest practices\xe2\x80\x9d standard Any executor of code is aware of the inherent issues but unfortunately even the most outspoken and vocal leaders of the blockchain neglect to properly acknowledge this growing risk shall raise the bar and be the benchmark by which security on the blockchain shall be measured We can ill afford to analyze vulnerabilities after an attack While open source is inspired and shall pave the way for innovation there must be a standard Auditing can go a long way but ultimately the safe harbor that CYBR can provide To summarize CYBR is an advanced cybersecurity solution that deploys its proprietary software BlindSpot and layers it with a comprehensive data feed to proactively identify hackers For example smart contract programming in Ethereum is known to be error prone and many of these common errors are known quantities The DAO hack for example was the result of a recursive calling vulnerability Essentially hackers with an initial minimum balance were able to repeatedly withdraw that balance There was no fallback function and thus repeated withdrawals were made as balances were not updated in real time Such gaffs are imminently avoidable This contract would not have met any security expert\xe2\x80\x99s minimum standards yet some 50mm was heisted Mission Critical There is a pressing need to dramatically reduce the average time of detection in identifying and contending threats Without it the adoption of DLT hangs in the balance The implementation of a proactive defensive as well as preventive approach to cybersecurity is sorely lacking in the space CYBR seeks to solve that problem CYBR\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to provide a seamless continuum of threat security and establish a gold standard of cybersecurity on the blockchain WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 | CYBR 11 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Governance Risk Management and Compliance (GRC) In traditional cybersecurity the term GRC is abuzz The acronym stands for Governance Risk (Management) and Compliance Currently an enormous number of vendors are providing this service in integrated point solutions or domain specific capacities Each of the core disciplines is comprised of four basic characteristics \xe2\x80\x94 processes technology strategy and people Dependent upon an organization\xe2\x80\x99s risk tolerance company policies and any external regulations are what determine the level of engagement Once identified and assessed operational rules or parameters that the GRC \xe2\x80\x9cquotient\xe2\x80\x9d supports are integrated or merged holistically across an organization As nebulous as it sounds the field is rapidly growing and its efficacy remains unquestioned What this translates to for CYBR is the need to establish a robust community as their input creates the checks and balances for a decentralized world GRC implemented into security is the voice of a unified whole that lacks central authority but compensates with efficiency and consensus Although the world of crypto is an ever moving target establishing best practices attracting key opinion leaders (\xe2\x80\x9cKOLs\xe2\x80\x9d) as well as supporters is paramount The CYBR token itself shall derive much of its utility by the provision of token to active members who can successful identify and report threats From a business standpoint this \xe2\x80\x9copen sourcing\xe2\x80\x9d of security creates an enviable dataset and encyclopedia of intelligence All this leads CYBR to lay claim to an overused buzzword Although the word \xe2\x80\x9cecosystem\xe2\x80\x9d is bandied about in tech circles let us remember what the definition actually states Ecosystem a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment (In general use) a complex network or interconnected system And this is precisely what CYBR\xe2\x80\x99s governance is \xe2\x97\xbe\xe2\x97\xbe \x07CYBR offers incentives to subscribers whom \xe2\x80\x94 Successfully identify threats \xe2\x80\x94 Offer needed fixes \xe2\x80\x94 Provide actionable intelligence

nce processed and identified the information is disseminated to subscribers CYBRscan \xe2\x80\x94 Cyber Security Scanning and Monitoring Solution 12 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY CYBR Real World Application WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 | CYBR 13 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY CYBRscan \xe2\x80\x93 Cyber Security Scanning and Monitoring Solution CYBRscan is a revolutionary new cloud\xe2\x80\x91based vulnerability and continuous monitoring solution designed for EVERYONE but equipped with specialized capabilities for the crypto community and blockchain ecosystem Historically we have relied on anti virus (AV) and malware scanners to determine if our systems are at risk These solutions previously required a client to be installed on the device which was being assessed The problem is that these solutions rely on digital fingerprints that must be IDENTICAL to the malicious code found on a device If a piece of malicious code deviates from that exact match the safeguard tool will not identify it CYBRscan incorporates fuzzy logic which allows our solution to look for exact AND partial matches of malicious code This means polymorphic and pleomorphic malware (advanced persistent threats) can be identified and remediated BEFORE an exploit occurs Simply stated CYBRscan identifies the threats that seek to circumvent existing safeguards and countermeasures When applied to a device storing a crypto wallet a URL where transactions take place or even an exchange where crypto is traded CYBRscan will assess vulnerabilities pertaining to version control patch management man in the middle (MITM) attacks distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and much much more In fact CYBRscan currently assesses for over 40 000 existing and relevant vulnerabilities that can allow for cyber threats to exploit the system and cause financial loss In 2018 alone nearly $1B USD in crypto losses due to hacks occurred (Source www coindesk com/nearly 1 billion stolen in crypto hacks so far this yearresearch) 14 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 So what are the capabilities of CYBRscan ONLINE VULNERABILITY SCANNING State of the art vulnerability testing suite which integrates scanning reporting and managing threats into one easy to use Admin Control Panel CYBRscan makes network vulnerability assessment seamless across your cloud on premises and / or hybrid environments If your device has a public IP address and an Internet connection CYBRscan is the solution of choice for you UPTIME MONITORING 24 / 7 monitoring of your assets to check whether they are responding You get an alert when an asset goes offline Generate automatic reports which shows the trend timelines and many more W E B S I T E M A LWA R E S C A N N I N G 24 / 7 monitoring of your assets for malwares and blacklisting You get an alert when an asset is infected and also when it gets blacklisted You will be able to generate reports which provides the test results trends and more details on blacklisting and infected malware O N D E M A N D P E N E T R AT I O N T E S T I N G Additionally CYBR offers penetration testing which provides a customized comprehensive and periodic security assessment of various kinds of applications such as internally developed and commercial enterprise web applications CYBR analysts can conduct expert validation for specialized environments and critical systems that may have vulnerabilities that are not easily identifiable via automated means \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY How Does CYBRscan Work 1 Set up your CYBRscan private cloud space

report contains detailed information and advice on how to fix any identified issues You can assign findings requiring action to users They can prioritize and track mitigation on any finding or any asset at any time Summary Simply stated nothing like CYBRscan exists for the average crypto user Historically solutions like these cost thousands of dollars and required dedicated security analysts with advanced training to operate the scans Continuous monitoring has just not been an option as the cost to the average user is astronomical Not any more In closing CYBRscan provides everyone the power of an advanced enterprise cyber security solution Finally the hackers of the world have a worthy adversary which plans to create a significant dent in the mounting financial losses to the crypto ecosystem WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 | CYBR 15 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY BlindSpot \xe2\x80\x94 Endpoint Solution \xe2\x80\x94 Digital File \xe2\x80\x9cFingerprint\xe2\x80\x9d Database \xe2\x80\x9cAny File Type Any Language Anywhere\xe2\x80\x9d BlindSpot can see through the polymorphic camouflage used by the world\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced hackers Utilizing digital file fingerprints and leveraging an adaptive \xe2\x80\x98brain \xe2\x80\x99 BlindSpot locates partial matches within the files on endpoints including systems servers laptops desktops USB drives and even mobile devices BlindSpot is also designed to monitor traffic flowing through the network (available in subsequent release) Most attacks happen weeks or even months after initial penetration Even the simplest attacks tend to have a fuse that is typically several days To map out a system probe for information and obtain or forge credentials takes time However the moment malicious tools land on a network BlindSpot sees them \xe2\x80\x94 even if the files are not copied to your systems BlindSpot is preventive as it identifies and alerts of merely potential illicit activities before Zero Day BlindSpot reveals concealed hacking tools even fragments of more complete sets The software continuously monitors file activities from an endpoint searching for digital fingerprints Whenever it finds partial matches of any file type in any language it is reported back and kept in perpetuity on a temporal repository The constantly updated database of known malicious files and hacking tools locates and alerts subscribers to any indication of hacking malicious files or illicit activity Just like with humans once a fingerprint has been taken you no longer need the person to identify them Even a partial print is enough and sometimes a smudge will do Once BlindSpot has 16 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 taken a digital fingerprint of a file the file is no longer needed to identify it And they are tiny \xe2\x80\x94 even a multi gigabyte file has a digital fingerprint that is no larger than 10k bytes BlindSpot can identify matching files even when the digital fingerprint is only partially there With advanced processing capabilities file fragments recovered data from a hard drive partially downloaded documents damaged files (both intentional and accidental) and other incomplete file structures can be properly fingerprinted in a way that still allows matches to be found \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY System Compliance All government systems go through certification and accreditation BlindSpot offers malicious code protection for both security considerations and required compliance Guidelines found in NIST 800 53 Revisions 3+ Security Requirements for System Integrity SI 3 Malicious Code Protection state that malicious code protection mechanisms must be employed at information system entry and exit points including workstations notebook computers and mobile devices to detect and eradicate malicious code BlindSpot\xe2\x80\x99s continuous monitoring and updating of its known malicious file repository provides the required real time and monthly re scans of files It also alerts appropriate staff when malicious code is found provides reports on potential malicious files illicit activity and offers follow up with brief false positive reports (less than 0 01%) BlindSpot helps organizations meet the mandated security requirements while ensuring continued compliance Intellectual Property Protection Track sensitive information as it changes and moves around the enterprise Government entities and corporations are addressing the issue of monitoring documents Files that contain sensitive information or intellectual property can no longer be safely stored on a secure server with the only requirement for access being the perfunctory credentials People either unwittingly or with malicious intent copy and paste parts of documents move files to USB drives transfer files onto a laptop share them with co workers or exfiltrate confidential information to outside networks and systems BlindSpot carefully guards networks and can even track USB drives BlindSpot can send alerts regarding questionable activity with specified documents / files or with specific computers or even individual activity It is a sensitive information watchdog that catches both unintentional and malicious exposure to non\xe2\x80\x91secure systems BlindSpot will create a set of digital file fingerprints that can track across networks and systems ensuring the proprietary and sensitive information for organizations 365 / 7 / 24 WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 | CYBR 17 \x0cCYBR Ecosystem Overview \x0cCYBR ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW Information technology systems face danger every day as do smart contract transactions and any blockchain project in existence Hackers work around the clock in an effort to infiltrate systems steal tokens take control of systems and the litany of nefarious motives the mind

WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 | CYBR 19 \x0cCYBR Architecture \x0cCYBR ARCHITECTURE The CYBR architecture primarily consists of three key components 1 Web Portal (MISP/TIP) 2 CYBRscan 3 BlindSpot Web Portal The CYBR Web Portal serves as the CYBR Community User Interface (UI) for the Ecosystem solution It offers a holistic solution that ensures the cybersecurity of smart contract associated transactions and its threat intelligence can be used to contribute to the security of the blockchain There are numerous features and capabilities associated with the CYBR Web Portal At a high level

ARCHITECTURE CYBRscan Robust scanner that scales to allow thousands of simultaneous users to conduct vulnerability scans against laptops smart phones websites and other IP based infrastructure BlindSpot Hackers share and use a variety of tools and techniques to gain and maintain access to crypto and similar associated systems The most noteworthy and effective techniques are advanced persistent threats As mentioned earlier APT\xe2\x80\x99s exploit vulnerabilities in systems that traditional cybersecurity technologies are ill equipped to deal with Hackers can now actively camouflage their tools by changing known malware signatures into new files Without known signatures this polymorphic malware exploits a gap in most current file detection systems leaving enterprises open to exploitation Traditional signature based systems simply can not compete and estimated to be roughly 25% effective in contending with APTs BlindSpot even as the files morph and change sees through it all It is an adaptive security solution and the heart of the CYBR Ecosystem that can see through the polymorphic camouflage used by the world<s most advanced hackers Note \x07A deeper dive into the technical specifications can be found in the CYBR \xe2\x80\x9cYellow Paper\xe2\x80\x9d TI Portal (MISP/TIP) Aggregates cybersecurity related data globally and turns it into actionable intelligence via alerts analysis and reporting The TI Portal will contain the largest repository of known vulnerabilities and threats on the planet and will be easily searchable so that information can be accessed BEFORE an exploitation or hack occurs Planned Capabilities C Y B R WA L L E T The CYBR Portal shall offer a proprietary CYBR wallet which incorporates a Token Name Service (\xe2\x80\x9cTNS\xe2\x80\x9d) The unique TNS feature resolves and reduces public addresses to common names This provides users the ability to send tokens to known vetted persons and entities without the concern of sending to incorrect or bogus addresses 22 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 The wallet also includes a facial recognition and biometric (fingerprint) capability which allows smart contract transactions (send / receive) to occur without the need to enter the private key or the incorporation of a mask (e g Metamask) Private keys are NEVER compromised when executed in this fashion

will be locked for one year and large investors\xe2\x80\x99 tokens are locked for a minimum of six months We changed the original token allocation to be more in line with the public tokens generated during the TGE We moved large portions that were allocated to the team and others to the Economic Reserve to ensure that the initial supply at launch will be small enough so that token price appreciation will not inhibit CYBR platform use If we priced our tokens too expensive at launch then the steep price would discourage the use of the CYBR platform and any token price appreciation would just exacerbate this That is why we decided to keep the circulating supply and original price low to leave room for the imminent growth we see coming We plan to keep the majority of tokens in the Reserves locked up for five years while the platform matures increases user base and 32 CYBR | WHITE PAPER | APRIL 2019 the initial price discount that early adopters have enjoyed is closed by the free market The Token Generating event was used to determine the appropriate level of CYBR tokens to release to the public The tokens themselves will act as an access pass to the CYBR portal the more you hold the more features will be available to you We priced the tokens to give our early adopters a very big discount to say thank you for believing in us The tokens allow you access with no need to renew subscriptions As we grow and provide better and better service to the community the world will begin to take notice and see the value that holding our token provides As more and more people use CYBR tokens the initial discount gap between our competitors and us should close If anything we would hope that the token value would appreciate to the point where a subscription to our service is now at a premium to our competitors because we will be offering a top of the line service In the very near future we will be releasing our proprietary Cyber Wallet which will come with some features that if you choose to use them will require a small amount of CYBR to be burned to further drive scarcity of the tokens proportionate with use This will add further utility to the token and increase demand and scarcity Some potential clients might not want to go through the \xe2\x80\x9chassle\xe2\x80\x9d of getting an Ethereum wallet and purchasing CYBR tokens In fact a lot of our potential clients are in the government space and tend to be slow to move out of their comfort zone We don\xe2\x80\x99t want this to hinder their use of our services but doing cash deals would not benefit the CYBR token ecosystem so any cash deal can easily be converted to CYBR token subscription by simply sending the number of \x0cTOKENOMICS tokens needed for an unlimited subscription to a public burn address and use the remaining cash for CYBR operational needs The number of tokens required will vary depending on individual needs Access to live monitoring would require approximately 5 500 tokens* This service would cost upwards of $4 000 annually from one of our competitors We need the tokens value to properly reflect the value of holding a subscription to our service and we are relying on the free market to do this for us The circulating supply of CYBR tokens is exceptionally small with approximately 55 000 000 CYBR currently That quantity would only allow for 1 000 clients holding 5 500 tokens not even counting the casual user who holds just a few hundreds CYBR* just to gain access to M I S P or the big client with 500 000* for unlimited access As more people join the CYBR ecosystem it will be
