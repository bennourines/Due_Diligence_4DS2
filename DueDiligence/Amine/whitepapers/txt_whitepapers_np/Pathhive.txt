\xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cThe Beginning Introduce Even as recently as a few years ago there promises of drones flying safely have not were very few people who had heard been established or the speed with which about drones This was because the institutional rules are made is slow development of drone technology had At the same time it is understandable been led mainly for military purposes that it takes some period of time for the In recent years however as drone enactment of such regulations and related technology and related industries have rules (laws) as well as time for social expanded to the private sector a broad consensus of such technology This is ra n g e o f t h e p o p u l a t i o n i n c l u d i n g because in addition to the importance of those in media filming personal filming privacy military security national security construction surveying atmospheric and various other issues the most critical measurement transmission tower issue surrounding drones is that they are inspection wind power plant inspection directly linked to human life and safety pesticide spraying drone racing and such as in examples of collisions with hobby drones as well as organizations aircrafts or drone crashes during flight That have become interested in drones In is why countries are creating regulatory addition drone technology and related frameworks at a relatively tedious pace industries have seen explosive growth and while gradually easing existing rules development Therefore the PATHHIVE team after However despite the rapid development countless hours has deeply contemplated o f t h e d ro n e i n d u s t r y a n d re l a t e d and researched how we can solve such technologies today analysts say that issues even before the team was formed the reasons that drones have not been and after being able to specify the study practically used are due to various we would like to disclose the conclusions regulations because either the rules or of our study via this whitepaper PATHHIVE NETWORK ee The Beginning ne \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cThe Beginning Airplanes take off/land utilizing a number of runways and control towers that have pathways and there are roads for fast evolving autonomous vehicles which have already undergone numerous studies Likewise in the drone industry many things have been developed such as autonomous flying but there are no designated paths for drones to travel Therefore our team thought that if a number of objects fly like drones without designated paths or schedules autonomously flying individual/ corporate drones would fly inefficiency or have increased numbers of crashes since the drones would not able to recognize one another The motivation of the PATHHIVE network PATHHIVE NETWORK The Beginning \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cThe Beginning began with the idea of making an open environment not owned by ind ividuals/ companies or countries but to which all drones have equal access As a result the team created the openplatform PATHHIVE network that is transparent reliably used and stored and safe from path and communication information being hacked by applying secure blockchain technology and in the platform just like vehicles or general aircraft drones can safely fly with a certified safe path Making an open environment not owned by individuals/companies or countries but to which all drones have equal access and control system with integrity and have fully protected path AI and blockchain technolog ies which usage information available comprise the core of the platform have many In this way since blockchain enables giving advantages including security anonymity receiving recording and verifying path transparency scalability and decentralization and other data information on a distributed Among the advantages we especially focused network security loopholes in a control system on security and decentralization centralized into a single server cluster can be F overcome with blockchain irst security is blockchian\xe2\x80\x99s data forgery/ In addition IoT technology can be applied to manipulation prevention technolog y drones to securely share and maintain the real that prevents each datum from being forged time data of the drones and the maintenance or manipulated by chaining each datum on expenses required for drone operations can a distributed network and this allows data be safely managed without separate fin tec transmission and reception to be more secure technology than general data transmission and drone reception Our project\xe2\x80\x99s main goal is to build a

time system building will also accelerate so that the users who provided such efforts (labor) will be compensated In this sense we view blockchain technology very positively Our team believes that because it helps realize the paradigm in the new the PATHHIVE network IT world of sharing and distributing where the will further facilitate and results of such digital efforts can be returned to develop the drone industry users which has already shown tremendous vision and The PATHHIVE network can also be used rapid breakthroughs Until as a tool to realize the spirit of sharing and such vision is realized we will distributing by providing adequate compensation do our best when regular users directly create a path store information on the blockchain and when a drone uses a path that a user created PATHHIVE NETWORK The Beginning \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cDrone Market Drone Drones can be briefly defined as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that can fly autonomously without pilots on board and the team\xe2\x80\x99s subject is limited to rotary wing drones and excludes fixed wing drones that have the features of general airplanes Advantages of Drones The following summarizes the advantages of drones compared to existing systems $ $ Fast moving and reduced logistics costs Energy saving and air pollution reduced by using electric energy Easy space utilization compared to the ground Absolute exclusion of human error Relatively quiet while flying and minimal size Flying in places where people and other aircraft/ vehicles cannot Disaster relief and security services that humans

the following characteristics Foundation for the Future Aviation Industry Drones are a core technology for the future aviation industry that will include Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs) that will bring future transportation innovation ICT (Information & Communication Technology) Convergence Industry Based on the technology of related high tech industries including aviation SW networks sensors materials etc drone related technology is expected to have a great impact on the economy and in industries such as aviation Economic Ripple Effects In addition to manufacturing components and finished equipment the drone industry is expected to create rear markets in areas such as operation/services and station implementation and as a result drones are an optimized testbed that can apply/verify common core technologies of next generation industries such as AI IoT sensors 3D printing batteries and nano technology Drone technology will also promote the development of related industries such as artificial intelligence (autonomous flight) IoT (drone communication) sensor/nano (sophistication miniaturization) and 3D printing (airframe production) In addition various areas that utilize drones will have improved efficiency and save both money and energy Various Models There is a spectrum of products according to different demands such as size/type/operation range/ flight time/weight/product cycle from toys to large aircraft Analysis Software and Big Data Utilization Industry The vast amount of data collected by drones will require proper interpretation and analysis Therefore related software and analysis will become increasingly important in the drone industry Studies show that software and analytics revenue will increase from less than $50 million in 2016 to $2 billion in 2022 Because of the nature of software sales and renewals software and analytics revenue will grow much faster than hardware Applications to Various Fields Starting from the technological development of military drones further growth has been witnessed in the private market including hobby and filming and will expand to safety diagnosis measurement surveillance logistics passenger transportation and

energy and insurance industries The transportation sector is likely to become large scale but it is difficult to estimate the market size in ten years due to technical difficulties and daily necessities while relief good delivery will be an area where drones will be primarily used PATHHIVE NETWORK ne e \xef\xb8\xb2 Source_Interact Analysis Global Drone Manufacturing Market Forecast (\xe7\xbe\x8e Teal Group 17) \x0cThe Opportunity Key Problem Drones are being studied and developed all over the world and technology related to drones including autonomous flying technology has also reached considerable levels and is on the verge of commercialization Despite the rapid growth of the drone industry there is a growing concern about safety due to the lack of systems such as air paths as roads for automobiles The issue of vulnerability is also becoming heated due to a risk of being hacked and used for terrorism In order to solve this problem various regulations and laws are being enacted in each country but at the moment there is only the classification of \xe2\x80\x9cNo Fly Zones\xe2\x80\x9d for preventing drone collisions Therefore there is a need for a real time integrated control system for when a number of drones fly simultaneously Key Solution \xe2\x80\x9cPATHHIVE NETWORK\xe2\x80\x9d The PATHHIVE network will gradually develop and deliver all the services that can help drones navigate safely and efficiently to their destinations \xe2\x80\xa2Make it easy for anyone to create a path that allows the drones to fly safely anywhere anytime \xe2\x80\xa2Build a \xe2\x80\x9cPath Manager\xe2\x80\x9d (Path Producing Open Platform) \xe2\x80\xa2Provide PATHHIVE AI (Automatic Control AI System) which collects real time traffic information of many drones using drawn paths and find the optimum path to guarantee the safe flight of drones \xe2\x80\xa2Incorporate blockchain technology to store all information in a distributed manner so that drones can fly in thoroughly security \xe2\x80\xa2Provide a \xe2\x80\x9creal time integrated control open platform\xe2\x80\x9d that realizes sharing and distribution by providing an open platform that compensates path producers for drawing paths by the path manager PATHHIVE NETWORK The ni \xef\xb8\xb2 2 \x0cThe Opportunity W h y Blockchain It is important that not only companies that use blockchain technology but also investors who invest in blockchain technology or users who use blockchain related services are clearly aware that blockchain technology is not a panacea So why do we need blockchain The answer to this can be found as described in the Summary in the characteristics of security and decentralization among the many advantages of blockchain First Security Drones flying in the air must be strongly protected from malicious hacking attacks If a crash or collision occurs during a flight due to hacking it can lead to fatal injuries In addition if drones and shipped goods are stolen by an attack such as GPS information disturbance or moving coordinate hacking property damage may occur When these problems occur there will be a societal doubt about the safety of PATHHIVE NETWORK The ni \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cThe Opportunity drones leading to a decrease in credibility which will adversely affect the development of the drone industry Therefore the drone industry and security are inseparable and safety can be implemented using the security of blockchain technolog y The operating systems of drones implement a light validation node of the PATHHIVE network blockchain The answer can be found in the characteristics of security and decentralization and implement the transmitted protocol as the integrity verification method of the general necessary for the control of a large number blockchain to prevent forgery and manipulation of drone flights to be commercialized in the of data by linking with previously received future Also the creation of PHV tokens can be blockchain data In addition if failures occur expected to improve versatility (dependency) due to malicious attacks or if a drone faces an compatibility (ease of exchange) and digital abnormal situation the FailSafe Process Guide based usability for the era of the Internet of is provided to ensure maximum security Things Second Decentralization Most IT services to date so far have been centralized services The server is managed only within the enterprise and is not open and the content created by users is also stored only in the service company and is actually owned by the company Most of the profits for such content have been monopolized by corporations (for example through attracting advertising) as a reasoning for the cost of maintaining the service However it is expected that such centralized services will gradually be converted into decentralized services through blockchain technology This is because an environment has been created that allows users to easily get the rewards for storing user content on an open blockchain network and for creating such content Likewise decentralization will accelerate in the near future and will be a new paradigm for the IT service industry In addition when path information is stored on the blockchain where network structure is very scalable it is very easy to expand control nodes PATHHIVE NETWORK The ni \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cPATHHIVE NETWORK PATHHIVE NETWORK Structure The PATHHIVE network can be made of at least three different blockchains as follows Both wellknow public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum and private blockchain comprise the network Each private blockchain will have its own main net named PM BlockChain TC BlockChain and will have the necessary side chains attached The HE BlockChain responsible for the IOT and ecosystem will be separated from the Ethereum token by a separate mainnet PM Block Chain Path Producer Station HE Block Chain TC Block Chain Drone PATHHIVE NETWORK T T \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cPATHHIVE NETWORK PM BlockChain The Path Manager (PM) blockchain is responsible for recording geographic information It serves as a private blockchain storage mechanism that stores drone path and station information Path Producers receive resources called \xe2\x80\x9cEnergy\xe2\x80\x9d after they pay coins to the PATHHIVE network and the energy is exchanged for coins at a certain rate The ratio of coin to energy is determined by a fair vote by the participation of all coin holders every quarter or year per each country or region and the exchange rate is limited to prevent any sharp price changes When creating a three dimensional path on a map using the Path Manager Web Tool it consumes energy and creates a minimum unit cell of the path Efforts to create a path can be confirmed at 100% and can be additionally redeemed by mining and air drop and a certain amount of producing fees will be provided All energy available and not consumed by the Path Manager Web Tool can be freely exchanged back into coins When two or more cells are assembled the cells become a line and the cells are connected to several cells to create a path Once path information is stored in a certain standard unit and by transaction the length of the path GPS coordinate value altitude owner stability frequency of use path score path class and path identification are recorded on the blockchain In addition the recorded path is changed to a safe path because it is newly updated on the blockchain by constant transactions of the path verification process by AI simulation The PM Blockchain manages map data geographical features geofences station locations and take off/landing locations displayed on the Path Manager Web Tool in a separate side chain to keep the information safe This prevents various incidents accidents and attacks using drones including serious damage from map information modification or aircraft hijacking For example the PM Blockchain completely eliminates the chance of manipulating non drone zones such as buildings airports power stations military facilities and protected data including geofences or locations into drone permitted zones by criminals or terrorist groups To prevent the possibility of forgery the PM blockchain will be the most fundamental safeguard system against physical attacks such as theft abduction and terrorism using the control system The PM Blockchain acts as a secure and complete blockchain path repository by recording all the processes of creating and validating path data and the basic map data for building paths PATHHIVE NETWORK T T \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cPATHHIVE NETWORK TC BlockChain The Traffic Control blockchain is responsible for real time control via AI The TC Blockchain stores information such as the time required to travel from area A to area B and stores data that can be used to obtain various statistical information The activities of the TC blockchain begin from the flight approval stage before drones take off and approach a path The blockchain obtains flight approval authority queries flight schedules with origins and destinations and accesses a specified path All of the drones\xe2\x80\x99 flight information and other status information such as flight approval origin destination flight schedule path access coordinates location of real time drones altitude flight purpose transportation items and modification schedule processed by AI and big data Information are created and transacted like a black box and stored in the TC Blockchain This information can also be optimized by AI to help distribute drones organically to reach their destinations and generate big data based on various data such as weather information geomagnetic information charge state etc This allows safe recording of data that efficiently controls the drones on blockchain All of this is done by the PATHHIVE network\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary blockchain multiple encryption protocol which continuously sends safe and efficient path coordinates and altitude information to the drones The drones decode the data received via wireless communication into multiple encryption protocols verify the network status of blockchain process it with only the information generated by the consensus algorithm so that it can be recognized as modified or unchangeable data i e safe data that is impossible to tampere Multiple encryption blockchain protocols that transact time sensitive control data are created on the private blockchain made by the consensus algorithm via a distributed management method by a technique called \xe2\x80\x9cchannel \xe2\x80\x9d for faster processing speed Also during the process of verifying the multiple encryption blockchain protocol data drones verify the integrity of the block data by screening the block data at a randomly encrypted specific location without verifying the entire block data generated to the nodes In this way drones can check the integrity of a block without becoming a full node with full block data which can be used to send and receive data as a single protocol beyond the speed and limitations of blockchain Of course if drones become full nodes they can have a more robust verification processes but if they act as a full node that go through a number of operations this cannot effectively be covered by availble battery technology Constantly sending data and communicating securely with light and repetitive verification processes can still guarantee safe communication PATHHIVE NETWORK T T \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cPATHHIVE NETWORK HE BlockChain The Hive Economy blockchain is responsible for the economic circulation structure in the network This is a public blockchain that stores coin owned history and transaction information for each wallet a similar blockchain storage similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum Each block is responsible for transacting and recording data of the coin\xe2\x80\x99s owner amount usage usage time and place of use and is connected to various other services such as AI charging payment or main and side chains The HE Blockchain is an encrypted cryptocurrency system used on the PATHHIVE network platform It is a public blockchain and the PHV coin an encrypted cryptocurrency and the electronic wallet are used for drone related economic activities among all electronic payment in our daily lives This is closely related to the drones\xe2\x80\x99 ecosystem and can be used for all economic activities such as shopping shipping fees purchasing of drones flying charging repairing insurance renting fees taxes and access to additional services For example in everyday life people can use the system when they pay for goods or shipping by visiting a drone charging station by themselves during the flight and use automatic payment for repair expenses pay bills for drone taxis pay for the drone license or taxes buy insurance or pay for insurance or pay for the various services associated with the IoT build various services using drone or make automatic payments All of these electronic payment transactions are written and managed transparently and securely on a decentralized public blockchain and the Ethereum token that already passed the primary verification process will be used The PATHHIVE network will be completed with one platform consisting of three multi block chains with special functions for each blockchain and will focus primarily on the drones\xe2\x80\x99 control system and path construction HE BlockChain which will be created as the last main net after two other mainnets are completed will use a consensus algorithm called Proof Of Prestige (POP) which evolved from the POS (Proof Of Stake) agreement algorithm The POP consensus algorithm involves Path Producers contributing to the block generation of the PM BlockChain using the Path Manager Web Tool as the node operator Prestige Points are given to node operators with high scores combining credibility based on AI analyzed safety that evaluates the path score based on reliability level derived from different elements such as shareholding of the POP node the stake to secure a path the length of the path use frequency and AI evaluated safety When blocks are made prestige points are added so that a blockchain with higher score becomes chosen as a valid blockchain PATHHIVE NETWORK T T \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cPATHHIVE NETWORK Consensus Model The POW (Proof of Work) method a mining method used in 1st generation blockchain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and 2nd generation blockchain cryptocurrencies like Ethereum has a downside of requiring vast amounts of electricity and CPU power In addition since a number of nodes participate in the consensus speed slows down which again serve as a critical weakness for services that require fast processing For the reasons above POW was deemed unsuitable for the PATHHIVE network and therefore two consensus models both public blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s and private blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s consensus models will be used as a hybrid model for implementation PM BlockChain & TC BlockChain For the TC BlockChain and PM BlockChain which require fast processing of bulk transactions a private blockchain platform HyperLedger Fabric SBFT (Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm a basic consensus algorithm of the HyperLedger Fabric or a slightly modified method of the SBFT will be used to compose mainnet HE BlockChain The PATHHIVE HE BlockChain that is in charge of currency will use a coin token EOS which uses POS (Proof of Stake) or DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) to implement a speed faster than the POW (Proof of Work) or the Ethernet (ETH) token being forked from a POW to a POS for a certain period before launching our own mainnet Then a mainnet with PATHHIVE network\xe2\x80\x99s own POP (Proof of Prestige) consensus algorithm will be developed The POP algorithm will contain a proof list of the prestige points of the validators in each block The more prestige points held by each node the more permission to update the block and during branching a blockchain with higher prestige points is selected As with POW when a block is confirmed the new coin will be rewarded to the participating nodes PATHHIVE NETWORK T T \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cPATHHIVE NETWORK Service Types The services provided by the PATHHIVE network are as follows \xe2\x80\xa2Geographic information \xe2\x80\xa2Altitude

facilities located at high places bridges wind turbines etc Shipping drones that will occupy the largest portion in the future and drone taxis as a future transportation option Public drones include Police crime prevention drones law enforcement drones vehicle speed violation drones Fire fighting drones in case of fire Rescue drones for disaster rescue etc Emergency drones used for transporting emergency patients In addition military drones used for special purposes Hobby/entertainment and racing drones will be an example All of these drones fly on the appointed paths using services provided by the PATHHIVE network (geography altitude weather traffic no fly zone) Users can also manually create delete and maintain special paths by commercial need Drones can also fly avoiding promised path in security and emergency situations according to their types and characteristics and in case of disasters drones in general flight mode can be allocated to required areas on paths to provide public safety services Roles of Service To understand the role of the service drones that normally need path information should be provided with all the services we provide (geography altitude weather traffic no fly zones etc ) to fly on designated paths and users can monitor and indirectly control all the information of drones that are controlled (full path use plan current location delivery information etc ) through open APIs Direct control is a method of controlling all drones approaching the network By applying AI big data and various service items the service generates paths and coordinates from origin to destination and transmits each flight schedule data in advance In addition the system handles flow data such as traffic weather geomagnetism etc generated at specific coordinates on each flight path and continuously updates the flight schedule data so that drones using the path can move PATHHIVE NETWORK T T \xef\xb8\xb2 2 \x0cPATHHIVE NETWORK more quickly and organically The system also refers to secure real time processing of information with a multiple encryption blockchain protocol to generate one huge block of information in the network and for control and browsing Indirect control plays a role of inputting origin or destination information of a drone using open APIs which allows users to browse and manage one or a specific group of drone travel data on the network The status of the mission performed by specific drones for example data such as the delivery status of the delivery drones filmed screens and the status of the spraying of pesticides can be identified It also means that drones can manage all the costs of charging repairing etc as they fly Indirect control allows individuals or companies to locate drones and view details of drones allowing free control drones and to create a unique control environment for companies and individuals Even for drones not directly controlled by the PATHHIVE network we plan to provide our services (geography altitude weather traffic no fly zone etc ) for public interest purposes The open APIs can be used to receive path information and the received path information can be used to create paths for drones to fly without conflicting with other drones Users can also manually create delete and maintain special paths by commercial need Drones can also fly by avoiding the promised paths in security and emergency situations according to their type and in the case of disasters or other special cases drones in general flight mode can be urgently moved to other areas to provide

anyone who meets the criteria of the PATHHIVE network Station owners are compensated for a portion of the station fee each time drones use the station However users must buy a certain amount of PATHHIVE coins when registering a station which is a guarantee of trust for the station Reward Path producers can receive PATHHIVE coins via air drop once every 10 seconds and if users run POP software provided by the PATHHIVE network they can receive a certain level of compensation for block creation Compensation will follow a method set by the PATHHIVE network and it will not exceed a certain amount of PHV per 10 seconds Unlike the POW method where bitcoin rewards only a node that succeeds in creating a block first the POP method provides compensation for node maintenance In addition the amount of compensation is reduced by half every five years so that additional issuance converges to zero Additional Issuance 2n (Every 5 years) If compensation decreases when drones\xe2\x80\x99 usage increases the path fees will be compensated to path providers PATHHIVE NETWORK e \xef\xb8\xb2 2 \x0cReward Reward Flow Step by step participation compensation Flow ICO & MVP

SAD is over actually flight fees will be dropped to all path producers around the world on the network (100% per drone reward for the path producers) PATHHIVE NETWORK e \xef\xb8\xb2 2 \x0cReward Inflation and Deflation As the number of paths created by the Path Manager Web Tool using the PATHHIVE coin increases the amount of coins entering the network increases and the amount of coins that are released on the market decreases Increasing the value of the paths also further reduces the market holdings of PATHHIVE coins and allows for the continuous reduction of the money supply In order to solve the continuous decrease we will calculate the amount of paths on the land area and city area of the whole earth and will apply the estimated values of the path inflow inflation of paths the speed of the market\xe2\x80\x99s coin holding reduction and drone inflow in order to issue additional coins according to the result This will create the effect of maintaining the volume of currency at a certain level while compensating path producers with mining and air drops In addition PATHHIVE networks will have a five year half life formula for mining and reward to control the rate of the volume increase and the price of money Internally it is exchanged with ENG which is similar to the gas concept of Ether so we can adjust the price of a path relative to the PATHHIVE coin to control the currency distribution and the price of paths We can also keep the fee for drones at a certain level and it can be used to set the shipping or electricity cost of drones according to the exchange rate set for each country In addition the exchange rate for each country will be decided via voting by the network users by a predetermined vote To protect the value of the PATHHIVE network and to protect investors after the initial issuance a small amount can be incinerated to match the dollar based global price increases/decreases Fee Pricing We are not aiming for a dictatorship and monopoly in the future drone industry Our goal is to continuously maintain and increase the value of PATHHIVE while all members that join the PATHHIVE network achieve a win win synergy Therefore rates of fees such as commissions paid by drones to use paths commission paid to PATHHIVE by a station will be adjusted periodically and be set by PATHHIVE Network Committees where participating members can reflect their opinions PATHHIVE NETWORK e \xef\xb8\xb2 2 \x0cPath Manager Path Producing Open Platform The PAHTHIVE Network Path Producing Open Platform is a web based tool that allows Path Producers subscribed to the PATHHIVE network to create drone paths in desired locations (In the service development stage this can be provided via a smartphone app in a more convenient form ) Each producer will automatically be given the wallet address of a unique PHV token when he/she joins the PATHHIVE network and will be able to keep the purchased PHV coins and manage the balance to create paths and buildings Users can also log in to the open platform and check the production history of the paths buildings and terrain that they have created along with current map users\xe2\x80\x99 path information at any time Users can also check the current map users\xe2\x80\x99 path information Temporarily created paths are also provided with the ability to test flights in advance in a drone flight simulation feature In the path producing mode users can create a new path and building by selecting a map It displays GPS coordinates country information no fly zone information altitude restriction information station information etc to guide accurate path production In addition showing already existing paths prevents path collisions PATHHIVE NETWORK h n ge \xef\xb8\xb2 2 \x0cPath Manager Path Producing Entertainment Elements Creating a system that allows anyone in the world to create paths and to get rewards in the PATHHIVE network through the Path Producing Open Platform is the identity and strength of the PATHHIVE network Nevertheless creating a path can be a very difficult and tricky task Therefore in addition to the rewards according to the use of paths Path Producers who create paths will be given a simple entertainment element so that they can have some fun while creating paths For example if they fill out a path in a certain area they will receive coins randomly

Learning In the first phase we develop and systemize the basic path search system and after the traffic data is upgraded to the second path search algorithm at a somewhat completed stage we will finally develop and apply the Full Automatic Control AI system The primary and secondary AI path search algorithms are somewhat passive from drones\xe2\x80\x99 perspective but the third phase AI path search algorithm realizes active full automatic control Km Deep Learning = AI + Big Data (Highest efficiency path calculation and speed control of all drones) PATHHIVE Network = Path Search Algorithm + Deep Learning PATHHIVE NETWORK T \xef\xb8\xb2 \x0cPATHHIVE AI Big Data Big data is a key element of AI (Artificial Intelligence) which extracts value from a large set of structured or unstructured data sets and analyzes the results The PATHHIVE network\xe2\x80\x99s path usage data accumulated over a long period of time along with many other data will become big data and can be used to extract various statistical information beyond simply finding the shortest path search or the measurement of accurate arrival times For example the network can extract the average annual drone traffic volume in a certain area local information in places with high delivery volumes or information about paths that drone taxis often take The PATHHIVE network will provide an API to enable the use of the collected big data and create another added value in the long term Traffic Government Delivery Enterprise PATHHIVE BIG DATA+AI Taxi Civil Path Academy PATHHIVE NETWORK T \xef\xb8\xb2 2 \x0cHive Station Hive (Station) Stations play the role of a traffic control service to drones that wish to land and the network provides the station\xe2\x80\x99s location information and 3D coordinate information of each landing position (POD) and operates the PATHHIVE AI blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s master node function Drones that want to land will receive traffic controls from the station and will perform the departure/ landing in sequence Realistically it is predicted that the roofs of buildings will be used as drone stations early on because busy city centers are narrow and lack space but over time buildingtype drone stations and underground stations will gradually be installed to support comprehensive services The most significant difference between a conventional aircraft and a drone is that the drones can take off and land vertically and do not need a long runway can stay in the air with hovering function and are smaller in size than aircraft Therefore drone stations will also reflect the features for operation Stations will be able to receive fees from drones in return for their services and when drones receive services such as charging parking etc smart contracts can automatically set up the contractual relationship for the payment Stations must pay a reasonable percentage of the drones\xe2\x80\x99 usage fee to the PATHHIVE network and must deposit a certain amount of coins to the PATHHIVE network since the network guarantees that the station is trustworthy and exposes the station to the network Take off Landing POD POD Landing POD Landing Landing POD POD

easy to predict that drone traffic control systems will be similar to general air traffic control systems Therefore we are analyzing and researching existing air traffic control systems and we are developing a drone control system with many points to learn from the air traffic control system The control logic of drones can be summarized briefly as follows Stations will have more than one landing pod Each landing pod has GPS coordinates and altitude information and owns and manages the takeoff and landing priority queue Each landing pod is capable of only one drone to take off or land at once Landing pods may have an induction light for precise positioning and directional guidance or an ultrasonic generator that can help drones secure an accurate position Inside stations a ceiling is present and a conveyor belt is in the inside so that drones can be moved to specific locations Station Search Drones must first select the station where they will receive take off/landing controls from Drones will first search for a station in the PATHHIVE network receive the station information and be controlled via the APIs of the control nodes (server) of the station PATHHIVE NETWORK i e i n
