\x0cOverview Introducing LiquidApps & the DAPP Network LiquidApps\xe2\x80\x99 mission is to promote mass scale adoption of decentralized applications (dApps) by introducing a set of technical solutions that make developing on blockchains substantially easier & affordable the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bDAPP Network\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d While blockchain technology increases in both sophistication and awareness it still remains difficult for people to utilize its potential One reason for this disconnect is the lack of Decentralized Apps or dApps which provide critical utility and engaging experiences for mainstream users \xe2\x80\x9cKiller apps\xe2\x80\x9d are those which organically grow in usage to the point where a substantial segment of the population uses them on a regular basis without necessarily having a deep understanding of the underlying technologies (such as the TCP/IP protocols behind the internet) While consumer applications like CryptoKitties demonstrate the current scaling challenges on platforms like Ethereum a vibrant ecosystem of developers and dApps continues to evolve Today the most popular dApps are in the gaming online gambling and exchange categories but tomorrow their functionality and reach may be as vast as that of the Internet As rivals to Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain platform dominance emerge so do new technical challenges and opportunities While the EOS blockchain introduces potentially unlimited scale and speed the RAM and CPU resources needed to operate on the EOS blockchain are not cheap are limited and are expected to become even more so as a result of successful adoption creating a chicken and egg constrained ecosystem A technical solution is required to allow dApp developers to easily externalize CPU and RAM from the EOS blockchain and to utilize commonly required functionality in an accessible and affordable manner LiquidApps is proud to introduce the DAPP Network native token known as \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bDAPP\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d a multi purpose utility token designed to power an ecosystem of utilities resources & services specifically serving the needs of dApp developers building user centric dApps LiquidApps Whitepaper 2 \x0cThe DAPP Network paves the way for an entirely new class of decentralized applications to emerge those previously unimaginable due to the systemic limitations of the existing technology stack By introducing a new ecosystem of collaboration and incentives a long tail of truly diverse creative and useful dApps will likely emerge In this whitepaper LiquidApps introduces the first utility of the DAPP Token the vRAM System vRAM is an alternative storage solution for developers building EOS dApps that is compatible with the existing RAM system decentralized and enables storing & retrieving of potentially unlimited amounts of data affordably and efficiently LiquidApps released the first key products powered by the DAPP Token to the community seeding the tools for developers to build and create the DAPP Network With this vision in mind LiquidApps set a roadmap suggesting successive tools and services for developers which have the potential to contribute to dApp scalability The growth of the DAPP Network aims to increase the ease speed and affordability of building scalable dApps on blockchains today LiquidApps Whitepaper 3 \x0cI The vRAM System The EOS blockchain\xe2\x80\x8b represents a significant milestone in the advancement of public blockchains With a market value of over $2 200 000 000 and approx 10 000 new accounts added each week (as of Jan 14th 2019) its sheer processing capability distinguishes it as well positioned to support the next wave of paradigm shifting dApps The first use of the DAPP Token is built to enhance one of the core functional features of the EOS blockchain RAM a resource that is used to store data In order to develop on EOS dApp developers must own and use RAM Currently RAM usage is limited for two main reasons it costs more than 58 EOS/1MB (as of Jan 14th 2019) & it has a capped supply which is currently ~90GB (anticipated to increase by Dec 31st 2019 to 128GB) both severely limiting the capabilities of dApp developers and their applications The vRAM system (\xe2\x80\x9cvRAM\xe2\x80\x9d) introduces three innovations for blockchain developers 1 Affordable access to storage 2 Potentially unlimited amounts of storage 3 Off chain processing with on chain integrity vRAM is an alternative storage solution for developers building EOS dApps that is RAM compatible decentralized and aims to enable storing & retrieving of potentially unlimited amounts of data affordably and efficiently Additionally vRAM intends to remove the current correlation between the cost of memory (RAM) and the size of smart contracts (which need to be stored) by using RAM as cache memory dApp developers today are restricted in their efforts to build on EOS because they struggle to pay RAM costs and/or their dApps require RAM that far exceeds the current t\xe2\x80\x8b otal \xe2\x80\x8bsupply With the introduction of LiquidApps Whitepaper 4 \x0cvRAM a \xe2\x80\x8b s a complement\xe2\x80\x8b to RAM dApp developers will be able to envision new types of decentralized applications and user interactions that today\xe2\x80\x99s technical constraints prohibit LiquidApps Whitepaper 5 \x0cII vRAM System Components The vRAM system is comprised of the following main components \xe2\x97\x8f The DAPP Token\xe2\x80\x8b The first utilization of the DAPP Token allows you to interact with RAM as cache memory An EOS contract can only read and write data from actual RAM In order to allow additional capacity vRAM introduces a mechanism to load the data from vRAM to the RAM in a decentralized and trustless manner using a DAPP Token The DAPP Token will serve as the application access token to the vRAM system enabling access and use of the system\xe2\x80\x99s read and write functionality The DAPP Token does not grant additional rights The DAPP Token may be enabled on other blockchains as well and needs to be staked by the dApp developer in order to enable it to use vRAM \xe2\x97\x8f DAPP Token Smart Contract\xe2\x80\x8b Manages the DAPP Tokens\xe2\x80\x99 stakes which are required in order to access the vRAM System and enable its functionality \xe2\x97\x8f The vRAM Library\xe2\x80\x8b Any smart contract which uses vRAM instead of RAM includes the vRAM Library which enables the User Contract to read and write in the same programmatic interface as RAM tables (multi index tables) \xe2\x97\x8f dApp Service Providers (\xe2\x80\x9cDSP\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x8b Anyone that operates a server running the DSP node (as defined below) DSPs may offer customized service packages that include The amount of storage space offered for use servers\xe2\x80\x99 specifications and the corresponding amount of DAPP Tokens one must stake in order to use each package (\xe2\x80\x9cDSP Service Package\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x97\x8f DSP Nodes\xe2\x80\x8b The vRAM network consists of nodes which are operated by dApp Service Providers DSP Nodes function as redundant and trustless stores of data in the network Each node provides an EOSIO API service to which dApps submit their transactions (\xe2\x80\x9cTXs\xe2\x80\x9d) in order to make the relevant data accessible to the contract before executing an action \xe2\x97\x8f User Contracts\xe2\x80\x8b Smart contracts deployed by EOS dApp developers that include the standard code provided by LiquidApps (The vRAM Library) enabling compatibility and operation using vRAM User Contracts interact with the vRAM System as long as the User Contract is equipped with sufficient amount of DAPP Tokens to support the dApp\xe2\x80\x99s read/write demands LiquidApps Whitepaper 6 \x0cIII vRAM System Operation A Setup In order to use the vRAM System a dApp developer needs to complete the following 1) Integrate the vRAM Library into the User Contracts from which data will be written/read from the vRAM database 2) Select the DSP Service Package/s that satisfies the initial dApp data storage and access requirements 3) Acquire DAPP Tokens in the applicable amount to accommodate for the required data storage and access needs 4) Stake the DAPP Tokens in the User Contracts through the vRAM Library assigning the staked tokens to the specific DSP data storage and access package/s selected by the dApp developer 5) You may utilize unused DAPP Tokens to vote for DSP/s that you believe support and strengthen the community B Maintenance Similarly to RAM dApp developers are required to monitor their vRAM usage (and amount of DAPP Tokens staked) and change their chosen DSP Service Packages when needed in order to avoid service interruptions due to insufficient resources (e g too small of a Service Plan or insufficient DAPP Tokens staked) LiquidApps Whitepaper 7 \x0cC Processing TXs with the vRAM System The process for executing a TX on a User Contracts is as follows 1) A client sends a standard TX to a User Contract that uses vRAM The TX is sent through a DSP node\xe2\x80\x99s EOSIO API 2) The DSP node detects all the data required by the TX which is not found on RAM (since it is yet to be written there) but exists on vRAM (see above section 1) a) The DSP executes the action on a local synchronized EOS node b) The User Contract runs the transaction locally and when trying to access the required data it throws an exception (assertion failure) If the data is missing from the RAM this exception can be considered as a way to signal the DSP to request its services c) The DSP catches the exception and parses the service request 3) The DSP verifies that the dApp developer stakes the sufficient DAPP Tokens required 4) The DSP node relays the data along with a cryptographic validity proof of the data to the User Contract This is called a \xe2\x80\x9cWarm Up Request\xe2\x80\x9d 5) The User Contract verifies the cryptographic proof and loads the data to RAM 6) The DSP sends the actual TX from the client to the User Contract At this point all the required data is in the RAM 7) If the User Contract requires modification of data stored in vRAM it dispatches an event with the new data which is caught by the DSP that caches it locally The new data is now present in the chain history 8) The User Contract calculates and stores the signature needed for the cryptographic proof for the next read and it also saves the data on RAM 9) The User Contract signal the DSPs to evict the data from RAM (signaling is performed using the transaction output (e g the console output field) 10) The DSP sends an action to the User Contract (cleanup) the User Contract deletes the data from RAM while leaving the signature to allow for verifying the integrity of the next Warm Up Request As stated above no data is lost as it is part of the chain history LiquidApps Whitepaper 8 \x0cD Cross Chain functionality of the vRAM System The vRAM System can also serve as shared memory in between chains By passing vRAM data pointers (e g IPFS pointers) between chains they will be available to DSPs in more than one chain This way once IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) is available the vRAM System will allow infinite IBC bandwidth in addition to its core functionalities LiquidApps Whitepaper 9 \x0cIV DAPP Service Providers (DSPs) Any individual or entity can become a DSP DSPs maintain complete autonomy over all aspects of their operation Each DSP can offer customized data packages accompanied by predefined terms determined by the DSP The DSPs are incentivized by the DAPP Token inflation as defined below in the section \xe2\x80\x9cDAPP Token Distribution Mechanism\xe2\x80\x9d A DSP Functionality \xe2\x97\x8b Standard API endpoint of the EOS blockchain \xe2\x97\x8b Warm Ups The User Contract holds a temporary cache (which is stored in the standard RAM) Whenever an action is called the DSP simulates the action and gathers all the required data points needed by the action Then the DSP sends a Warm Up Request a request containing both the data points and a cryptographic signature for those data points This request after being verified by the User Contract is loaded temporarily into the temporary RAM cache table \xe2\x97\x8b Proof/data indexing for selected datasets The actual vRAM data and proofs are effectively being stored on the chain history In order to provide fast access for those elements when performing the Warm Up Requests the DSPs listen to the block history in real time and store the latest versions of different data points and proof in an accessible location (e g IPFS S3 Disk SQL) \xe2\x97\x8b DSPs allow for many additional custom external services many of which will be created by the community several are outlined in the roadmap section below LiquidApps Whitepaper 10 \x0cV DAPP Network System Model \xe2\x97\x8f In order to gain access to the vRAM System and services facilitated by the DSPs dApp developers must stake DAPP Tokens in the User Contracts The amount of DAPP Tokens required in each User Contract should be the applicable amount of DAPP Tokens needed to accommodate the dApp\xe2\x80\x99s read/write needs and should match the selected DSP package requirements Note that the dApp developer may stake more than the minimum amount needed in order to vote for a specific DSP \xe2\x97\x8f A dApp developer may maintain multiple stakes of DAPP Tokens assigned to enable services from different DSPs This is to ensure among other things service redundancy for potential cases of DSP unavailability \xe2\x97\x8f The DAPP Token Smart Contract generates new DAPP Tokens on an ongoing basis at an annualized inflation rate that can range between 1 5% (\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bInflation\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d) which will apply to the total supply of DAPP tokens The DAPP Token Smart Contract allocates the Inflation to the DSPs pro rata to the amount of DAPP Tokens staked and assigned to the DSPs The said staked amounts are calculated on an accumulated block to block basis and distribution is executed on a cycle basis The inflation rate will be set initially at 2 71% afterwhich the Inflation may be updated from time to time by the community to an annualized inflation rate between 1% to 5% \xe2\x97\x8f In order to receive the Inflation DAPP Tokens DSPs must claim the Tokens from the DAPP Generator Smart Contact The first time a DSP can claim DAPP tokens is possible only a block after DAPP tokens were first staked to one of his Service Packages Once the DSP claims the DAPP tokens he will not be able to claim again until at least 24 hours have passed since his last claim and so forth LiquidApps Whitepaper 11 \x0cVI DAPP Token Distribution Mechanism A Parameters \xe2\x97\x8f SYMBOL DAPP \xe2\x97\x8f Total Supply 1 000 000 000 (1 Billion) will be issued on the starting day and distributed among the participants of the Vendor Smart Contracts in each cycle as detailed in section B \xe2\x97\x8f Transferable as soon as distribution begins \xe2\x97\x8f All DAPP Tokens are to be generated by the Token Generator and distributed through the Vendor Smart Contract B Distribution \xe2\x97\x8f 50% of the total supply of DAPP Tokens will be sold in 444 sale cycles over 333 days by two separate \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bVendor Smart Contracts\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d hosted by or on behalf of the Token Generator \xe2\x97\x8b There two Vendor Smart Contracts offer a total amount of 1 126 126 DAPP Tokens per Cycle (an 18 hour cycle) (the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bCycle Quota\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d) Each Cycle Quota will be split evenly between the two Vendor Smart Contracts \xe2\x97\x8b Participants may choose which Vendor Smart Contract they wish to purchase DAPP Tokens from the Vendor Smart Contracts are on the EOS Blockchain \xe2\x97\x8b Both Vendor Smart Contracts are similar in that both accept EOS and allocate DAPP Tokens to contributors However the difference is that one Vendor Smart Contract supports an instant purchase while the other requires an on boarding procedure \xe2\x97\x8b By the end of each cycle \xe2\x96\xa0 The Cycle Quota of DAPP Tokens is distributed to the cycle participants pro rata to the amounts sent in each of the two Vendor Smart Contracts \xe2\x96\xa0 Each individual Vendor Smart Contract sends the EOS tokens it received to the Token Generator LiquidApps Whitepaper 12 \x0cFor example Cycle Quota 1 126 126 DAPP Tokens Total EOS tokens received in that cycle 10 000 EOS tokens Participant A sent an amount of 1 000 EOS tokens meaning at the end of the cycle he received 1 000/10 000*1 126 126 = 112 612 6 DAPP Tokens \xe2\x97\x8f 10% of the DAPP Tokens will be \xe2\x80\x9cAir HODL\xe2\x80\x9d (a vested airdrop) to the EOS community Every EOS token holder on block number 36 568 000 will be distributed DAPP Tokens on a pro rata basis (up to a maximum of 3 million EOS tokens) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bPioneer Holders\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d) The amount of DAPP Tokens received by Pioneer Holders will continuously vest (on a block by block basis) over a period of 2 years starting from the day of the AIR HODL so that complete withdrawal of Tokens will be possible after 2 years Any Pioneer Holder choosing to withdraw the Air HODL ed tokens before the end of said 2 years will only receive the vested portion (e g 25% of the distributed DAPP Tokens will be vested after 6 months) Any Pioneer Holder choosing to release (and\\or sell) the Air HODL ed tokens before they are fully vested contributes the remaining unvested DAPP Tokens to those who are still holding their Air HODL tokens increasing the distribution for those remaining Pioneer Holders However Pioneer Holders can stake their vested DAPP Tokens to DAPP Service Providers and by doing so those Air HODLed tokens will not be considered withdrawn \xe2\x80\x8bThe date of the Air HODL will be published in a later stage \xe2\x97\x8f 10% of the DAPP tokens will be distributed to our launch partners design partners other partners and advisors with 1% (of the DAPP tokens) unlocked and the rest continuously vested (on a block by block basis) over a period of 2 years However unvested tokens may be staked \xe2\x97\x8f 10% of the DAPP tokens will be designated towards our grants and bounties programs vested (on a block by block basis) over a period of 2 years However unvested tokens may be staked \xe2\x97\x8f 20% of the DAPP tokens will be distributed to LiquidApps and founders with 6 5% (of the DAPP tokens) unlocked and the rest continuously vested (on a block by block basis) over a period of 2 years However unvested tokens may be staked LiquidApps Whitepaper 13

product vRAM which solves a critical bottleneck for decentralized application development The DAPP Network is built to support numerous use cases that continue to simplify the ability of both developers and users to interact with decentralized technologies As usage grows and the DAPP Network evolves additional functionalities could emerge such as \xe2\x97\x8f DAPP Lending\xe2\x80\x8b Enabling DAPP holders to lend their tokens to others with a built in expiration mechanism that removes the risk of default \xe2\x97\x8f vCPU\xe2\x80\x8b A simple solution for the offloading of CPU intensive processes from the main chain to child chains \xe2\x97\x8f RAM less Accounts\xe2\x80\x8b A way to create RAM free accounts on the EOS Blockchain allowing for a free user on boarding for the

\xe2\x97\x8f And more to come Summary LiquidApps is proud to announce a patent pending innovation the DAPP Token which will power an ecosystem of developer products and services vRAM the DAPP Token\xe2\x80\x99s first use case will enable blockchain developers to affordably develop unprecedented dApps with potential for mass user appeal By aiming to remove the financial barriers to entry & giving developers near unlimited access to data repositories w \xe2\x80\x8b e believe vRAM will inspire a new wave of blockchain development\xe2\x80\x8b LiquidApps\xe2\x80\x99 intention is to inspire the community to build tools & services that empowers dApp developers communities and help blockchain based apps become critical parts of everyday life world wide LiquidApps Whitepaper 17 \x0cRisks The following is a list of highlighted risks which may be relevant for you in making an informed judgment to participate in the DAPP Tokens sale however such list is not and should not be deemed to be an exhaustive or a complete list \xe2\x80\x93 other material risk factors may well exist If any of the following considerations uncertainties or material risks develops into actual events the DAPP Tokens User Contracts DAPP Vendor Smart Contracts DAPP Token Smart Contracts vRAM System and the vRAM Library could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your DAPP Tokens or the usability thereof Regulatory Risk The blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction There is a possibility that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations or introduce new regulations addressing blockchain technology based applications which may be contrary to the current setup of the DAPP Tokens and the Users Contracts and DAPP Token Smart Contracts and which may inter alia result in substantial modifications of their use and the envisioned DAPP Token ecosystem including its termination and the loss of the DAPP Tokens for you Risk of Software Weaknesses The software underlying the DAPP Tokens the mechanism controlling the purchase procedure the vRAM System and related Users Contracts and DAPP Token Smart Contracts and other involved software technology and technical concepts and theories are still extremely novel which is why there is no warranty that the process for receiving use and ownership of DAPP Tokens and/or use of any products will be uninterrupted or error free and which is why there is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses vulnerabilities or bugs causing i\xe2\x80\x8b nter alia\xe2\x80\x8b the complete (or partial) loss of the DAPP Tokens and loss of all (or part of) EOS tokens used for their purchase Risk of Abandonment / Lack of Success Even if the standard code provided by LiquidApps and the vRAM System are adopted the creation of DAPP Token Smart Contracts and Users Contracts and their continuing development if at all by any LiquidApps Whitepaper 18 \x0crelevant party who may contribute to such development from time to time may be abandoned for a number of reasons including but not limited to lack of interest from the public lack of funding or lack of commercial success or prospects (e g caused by competing projects) Therefore there are no assurances even though the DAPP Tokens are fully developed and launched that you will receive any benefits through the DAPP Tokens held by you Third Party Risk The DAPP Token Distribution and the feasibility of Users Contracts DAPP Token Smart Contracts and the DAPP Token ecosystem as a whole depend on the actions of third parties Therefore there is no assurance that such third parties will ever adopt the use of DAPP Tokens or develop or adopt any Users Contract or DAPP Token Smart Contracts including the vRAM System DSPs or that the development deployment and use of Users Contracts or DAPP Token Smart Contract will ever take place as foreseen or be successfully executed and that the DAPP Tokens might never have use LiquidApps may use third parties to manage and operate the DAPP Token distribution and KYC/AML processes in whole or in parts LiquidApps has no control over the process employed and the requirement from you made by such third parties Risk Associated with DSPs Any individual or entity can become a DSP DSPs maintain complete autonomy over all aspects of their operation Each DSP can offer customized data packages accompanied by predefined terms all as determined by the DSP LiquidApps has no control and no monitoring capabilities with respect to the DSPs whatsoever including without limitation with respect to their identity reliability content or quality of services etc Therefore there are no assurances with respect to the DSPs and their services Risk Associated with other Applications The standard code provided by LiquidApps to create Users Contract and DAPP Token Smart Contracts including the vRAM System and vRAM Library may give rise to other alternative projects and applications promoted by unaffiliated third parties under which DAPP Tokens will have no intrinsic value while they may be more widely used Existing market participants may oppose the development LiquidApps Whitepaper 19 \x0cof distributed ledger or blockchain based systems like the Users Contracts and the DAPP Token Smart Contracts Risk Associated with Theft Digital Wallets and Loss of Private Key Cryptographic tokens including DAPP Tokens can only be accessed by using an appropriate Wallet Address with a matching private key If your private key file was lost or stolen the allocated DAPP Tokens associated with your Wallet Address would be unrecoverable and would be permanently lost Cryptographic tokens based on distributed blockchains including DAPP Tokens cannot be controlled by a single entity Therefore LiquidApps has no control over the \xe2\x80\x8bDAPP Tokens and you will have no recourse to seek any refunds recovery or replacements from LiquidApps in the event that \xe2\x80\x8bDAPP Tokens are lost or stolen As a result you should take great care that the website used to purchase DAPP Tokens has the following universal resource locator (URL) \xe2\x80\x8bhttps //www liquidapps io\xe2\x80\x8b Failure to use the official Website and follow such procedures may result you do not receive any DAPP Tokens and loss any EOS tokens used for the purchase attempt Risk of Protocol Attacks The software underlying the DAPP Tokens the mechanism controlling the purchase procedure as well as any Users Contracts including the vRAM System and other involved software and technology may be exposed to attacks or exploited by hackers or other individuals that could result in theft or loss of DAPP Tokens or the EOS tokens used for their purchase impacting i\xe2\x80\x8b nter alia \xe2\x80\x8bthe ability to distribute the DAPP Tokens and the incentives to develop and launch the Users Contracts and the DAPP Token Smart Contracts As with various other cryptographic tokens the blockchain used for the DAPP Tokens is susceptible to attacks pertaining to its protocol Any successful attack presents a risk to the DAPP Tokens any Users Contract any DAPP Token Smart Contracts and their expected proper execution and sequencing Risk of Depreciation Concerning the \xe2\x80\x8bDAPP Tokens no market liquidity may be guaranteed and the value (if any) of the \xe2\x80\x8bDAPP Tokens over time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate resulting in loss that will be borne LiquidApps Whitepaper 20 \x0cexclusively by you Risk Associate to KYC\\AML You acknowledge understand and accept that certain transactions may require KYC/AML to be conducted by a third party Accordingly your transaction could be delayed and/or may not be approved This process may cause your transaction not to be included in a specific Cycle and/or at the time you expected meaning the transaction may be included in a different Cycle with a different price Risk Associate to Distribution and Quote Cycle The distribution of DAPP Tokens will occur at the end of each Cycle (as described above) and only after claiming the DAPP Tokens The actual amount of DAPP Tokens purchased by you depends upon the actions of all other users sending EOS tokens to the DAPP Token Smart Contracts during the same Cycle All users sending EOS tokens during the same Quote Cycle will receive a relative amount of the Quota on a pro rata basis calculated in accordance with the amount of EOS tokens paid by each buyer in proportion to the total amount of EOS tokens paid to the DAPP Token Smart Contracts during the same Cycle It is possible for other people to send in a large amount of EOS tokens after you have sent EOS tokens and dramatically decrease the number of DAPP Tokens to be distributed to you Therefore the price displayed on the sale segment in the website at a given time is not the closing price of the Cycle and reflects only the price calculated at that time out of the transactions then approved which price will definitely change after you (and or others) transfer additional EOS tokens to the Vendor Smart Contracts and be final only following the
