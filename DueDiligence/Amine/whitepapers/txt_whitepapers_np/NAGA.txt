data and have a complete product offering for trading Thirdly cost structures in these sectors are non transparent and disadvantageous to the user NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to open up the world of trading financial and virtual goods to everyone After building up a team of 120 dedicated and motivated people spending tens of millions of EUR on licenses and technology as well as establishing a

profit fairly Furthermore Switex will enter the immense games market with over 1 8 billion gamers13 and over $108 billion14 in revenues worldwide In light of the fact that there are still nearly 50% of the world population15 without internet the number of gamers will most likely increase over the next few decades and the games market will be far more significant as new generations grow up with games/gamified content around them An indication of the hidden potential in gaming can be seen in the E Sports market which has seen an explosive revenue growth in the last few years from $325 million in 2015 to over $696 million in 2017 with the prediction that this will grow again to $1 5 billion in 2020 16 NAGA has set up a 2 step plan First Switex aims to disrupt the gaming industry Secondly a

offering a first and secondary market for in game items The secondary market will allow players to offer their items to other players for sale or acquire the items of others to use in their particular games Switex therefore aims to be both the Amazon and eBay for in game items Figure 6 Switex \xe2\x80\x93 Desktop Item View & Mobile Item View Any item entering the Switex system will be secured through a blockchain technology based system and therefore this exchange will be secured against fraud and scamming The legitimacy of the ingame items its origins and the sellers right to sell will be verified and therefore Switex will ensure a seamless and safe transaction between users Players will be able to transfer their items into and out of the Switex platform without having to worry about security It can be stated that Switex will provide a legal alternative to the grey markets that exist today where virtual goods (in game items) can be bought and sold legally Switex is not only a marketplace for offers but also a fully integrated clearance and settlement system which ensures that items will be automatically transferred to the new owner\xe2\x80\x99s game \xe2\x80\x93 upon the user\xe2\x80\x99s wish In order to manage the virtual goods \xe2\x80\x93 regardless of their origin (e g games concert tickets or any virtual good) \xe2\x80\x93 the Switex platform will always have a

with the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cCYBO\xe2\x80\x9d an investment robot which analyses crowd trading and combines this with artificial intelligence making it the first investment advisor which is driven by human (crowd based) & artificial intelligence CYBO is an automated algorithm driven financial planning service The idea behind CYBO was the creation of a high end technology driven (as opposed to human interference) system that manages investments This is achieved in a multi step process CYBO learns the client\xe2\x80\x99s personal preferences and investment objectives While the client can adjust his risk preferences and investment objectives at any moment CYBO operates on the most recent and up to date information provided CYBO combines decades of experience in the brokerage business with state of the art technology NAGA TRADER users are offered a unique additional benefit as CYBO collects calibrates and computes the intelligence of the crowd and reduces individual client\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes in trading It helps a client to eliminate emotional reactions and missed trading opportunities CYBO is a script/software that runs on a mobile device desktop or tablet It was designed in a way to copy the best trades of the top NAGA TRADER traders CYBO analyses individual traders\xe2\x80\x99 past performance and monitors the current positions CYBO constantly monitors numerous financial and technical market indicators like market volatility market trends price action upcoming news and economic events It picks only the best trades that fit the criteria NAGA TRADER has developed CYBO\xe2\x80\x99s key priorities are the following \xe2\x80\xa2 Provide the best market opportunities \xe2\x80\xa2 Control risk and trade more profitably \xe2\x80\xa2 Diversify between followed traders and selected trading instruments \xe2\x80\xa2 Provide a comfortable way of trading The user decides when to start pause or completely disable their personal CYBO Furthermore the user is able to set his/her individual trading preferences Referring to NAGA TRADER back testing period between June 2016 and July 2017 CYBO outperformed other peer to peer investment advisors Given an investment allocation of \xe2\x82\xac10 000 a CYBO was able to generate an annual return of \xe2\x82\xac1 600 (over 16%) Compared to the best robo advisory solutions available in Germany which is solely focused on one core product (for example Scalable Capital or Ginmon who raised over $50m in Venture capital) they achieved a performance return of 12 1% in 201617 Besides the individual

The business model of NAGA comprises the development marketing and promotion of applications in the area of financial technology and online trading In this respect there is a risk that other companies with (much) more human and financial resources could enter the market as a competitor and could possibly copy the business model of NAGA These companies could offer more attractive and competitive products and services showing a longer company history better established customer relationships and use their experience and resources in different ways in order to compete with NAGA e g through acquisitions aggressive investment in marketing or the offer of more attractive conditions for customers service providers and business partners In addition other start up companies could get access to equity and debt capital significantly easier than NAGA Aa a result NAGA might grow slower than expected thus losing its customers to its competitors NAGA offers an operational business unit headquartered in Hamburg with additional operational units in Madrid Barcelona Valencia Palma de Mallorca and Limassol Future locations in Shanghai and New York are planned in order to directly address potential partners in the American and Asian market Based on the project oriented corporate structure of NAGA projects are managed completely independently from each other NAGA is able to develop cross platform applications and to provide whole technology interfaces for multiple platforms on desktop and mobile (Ios and Android) The founders of NAGA jointly have long term expertise and complementary experiences in the fields of banking law and technology (start up) Due to the cultural diversity of its employees NAGA is highly internationally oriented and is in a position to provide up to date technologies system processes and structures both in IT and business Since the start in 2015 NAGA has gained the trust of strong and internationally partners In particular NAGA partners are

interactions and correlates with the interaction of other users With each interaction of users be it trading copying sharing or consuming content the system learns personal preferences of individual users The collection of user\xe2\x80\x99s social economic data is used to segment specific user groups and target their preferences This approach is key to more effective inbound marketing and enhances the scale effects of the platforms Within the first months of operations of the NAGA TRADER platform the following advantages in comparison to its competitors were observed \xe2\x80\xa2

as Base Currency Token Holders will be able to use NGC as their base currency on NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s platforms This further implies that token holders will be allowed to trade all kinds of financial instruments or virtual items using cryptocurrencies Furthermore the NAGA Academy will accept NGC granting users special benefits in comparison to \xe2\x80\x9cfiat users\xe2\x80\x9d THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 40 \x0c4 3 2 Lower Trading Fees on NAGA TRADER on Every Asset Using a NGC Account NGC users will pay 50% less on the trading commissions for each trade they perform on NAGA TRADER If for example the fee for an Apple Trade with 100 Apple shares would be $10 using an USD account and the NGC/USD rate at the time is 1 NGC = $1 a NGC based account would only need to pay 5 NGC in trading fees 4 3 3 Cashback per Each Trade Performed on NAGA TRADER Using a NGC Account For each trade made (round turn) the trader would receive \xe2\x80\x93 based on the formula below \xe2\x80\x93 a bonus booked to the dedicated bonus wallet inside the NAGA WALLET This also applies for trades made with a CYBO connected to a NGC account as well as all auto copied trades Example If a user opens a trade and invests 100 USD then he/she should receive a percentage of the invested amount as a cashback The final number depends on the traded instrument the leverage of the trading instrument and the trading volume According to NAGA TRADER current estimations users can expect a cashback of 0 01% to 0 05% per trade based on the trading volume The exact numbers are subject to NAGA TRADER Terms & Conditions and will be updated on a regular basis 27 4 3 4 Double Crediting of Copy Bonuses on NAGA TRADER Using a NGC Account If a user opens and shares trades on the NAGA TRADER platform using an NGC based account NAGA TRADER will credit a double bonus to the users bonus wallet inside the NAGA WALLET If \xe2\x80\x93 based on the formula below \xe2\x80\x93 a copy bonus would result in $2 and the NGC/USD rate at the moment would be 1 NGC = $1 NAGA TRADER would book 4 NGC to the user\xe2\x80\x99s balance instead of $2 The copy bonus is calculated when the user\xe2\x80\x99s trade gets copied and opened on the copying users Live Account and is further determined by the particular closing volume (round turn) The bonus amount depends on the traded volume in USD on Live accounts from other users Whenever a user gets copied he receives a real time push notification of how much Bonus he has made 27 https //www nagatrader com/legal documentation/ THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 41 \x0cFigure 24 NAGA TRADER Copy Feature The generated income depends on the number of copiers of the trade and the capital that the particular trade \xe2\x80\x9cmoves\xe2\x80\x9d The following formula shows exactly how the bonus is calculated Explanation This multiplier (2) means that NAGA TRADER pays a doubled bonus for a round turn trade Note NAGA TRADER pays up to $50 in copy bonus per $1 000 000 traded volume The actual amount may vary between $10 and $50 and is subject to the decision of the company The exact numbers are subject to NAGA TRADER Terms & Conditions and will be updated on a regular basis 28 Based on NAGA TRADER historical data traders have received an average of 0 81 EUR in copy bonus per 1 trade which was copied by others (average value) The total amount of the monthly copy bonus for NAGA TRADER will grow based on the number of newly acquired users and the virality effect of the network Exact numbers are subject to the adoption rate of NGC and can be taken from the financial model available on the Token Sale website It is further planned that traders can charge NGC for sharing their trades If a trader opens a trade he can decide if he wants to share the trade with the community and how much he wants to charge in NGC for his trade When a potential copier sees the trade he can unlock the copy function and copy the trade by paying in NGC for this information 28 https //www nagatrader com/legal documentation/ THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 42 \x0c4 3 5 Lower Trading Fees on Switex on every asset using a NGC account The Switex platforms plans to charge a 10% fee for each purchase on its platform Using an NGC account token holders will only pay 9% of the equivalent fee 4 3 6 Cashback Program Switex In Switex users who have exchanged their NGCs into Switex Coins will receive an extra bonus and thus a better exchange rate in comparison to users who exchange their Fiat money to Switex coins NGC users will thus receive 5% more Switex Coins 4 3 7 Discounted purchase of Ad Credits for the Switex and NAGA TRADER Ad Manager Visiting ad switex com and ad nagatrader com respectively NAGA TRADER and Switex will accept NGC as payment method for its Ad Credits Based on the scheme below it is planned to allow marketers and advertisers as well as users who want to gain more visibility on the platform to purchase more clicks and impressions on the Switex and NAGA TRADER platforms Users are able to target their traffic based on various attributes such as country platform age income level and placement inside the app Figure 25 Example Calculation Advertisement Credit Scheme 4 3 8 Community Status and Access to Paid and Premium Content Token Holders will get a more prominent status so that their profiles are better ranked and more visible than the profiles of others Their trades will be ranked better and they will get access to educational material closed groups and promotions activities that will be not disclosed to regular Fiat money platform users Switex will offer token holders who successfully obtain an item on the platform a premium virtual good which can only be used within Switex for unlocking premium content and receive access to the newest games/new in game items Furthermore token holders will benefit from discounted and/or free access to NAGA Academy courses and online degrees THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 43 \x0c4 4 SMART CONTRACTS FOR BONUSES All bonus calculations and transfers are handled by the NGC Bonus Smart Contract which will be published alongside the integration for NAGA TRADER and Switex respectively From all connected platforms there will be a Smart Contract developed for the NAGA DONATION FUND From each transaction on NAGA TRADER Switex and the NAGA WALLET the smart contract will take a percentage of the transaction volume and allocate a portion of tokens to the NAGA DONATION FUND 4 5 THE NAGA DONATION FUND The NAGA Donation FUND will be operated by NAGA and selected charity projects will be proposed to the token holder community In quarterly polls all NGC holders will be eligible to decide which charity projects will receive a donation The projects will be assessed by a dedicated team and will include NGOs only 4 6 NAGA TOKEN PRICE VARIATIONS It is important to understand that the price of NGC will vary over time based on a number of factors which are outlined below \xe2\x80\xa2 Organic growth of user demand \xe2\x80\xa2 Speculative demand \xe2\x80\xa2 USD/ETH exchange rate and \xe2\x80\xa2 The cost of gas within the Ethereum network While NGC will fluctuate in value against fiat BTC and ETH the listing fee will be regularly adjusted to track $1 For example if NGC are each worth $1 then 1 NGC will be needed to reflect the value of $1 NGC tokens can be purchased directly within the app or from other NGC holders on external markets (cryptocurrency exchanges OTC etc ) Once NGCs have been used within the NAGA Ecosystem these tokens will be continuously recirculated into the market by selling them on exchanges Recirculating NGC tokens at market price helps to engage the user community As NGC grows in popularity and more users join the platform higher revenues will allow the completion and release of new features that are already in development This will further increase the appeal of the platform and lead to higher transaction volumes within the NAGA Ecosystem THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 44 \x0cCHAPTER 5 THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 45 \x0c5 TOOLS FOR NETWORK GROWTH 5 1 A SUSTAINABLE CRYPTO ECONOMY For a cryptocurrency to be successful over time it must become the driver for a sustainable economy As NGC is utilised by more users and adopted by more providers the network effect of the NAGA ecosystem and its platforms will grow building the value of the ecosystem for the benefit of long time holders and token sale participants A successful economy requires NGC to have growing demand within the NAGA network The core focus of the public listed NAGA AG is the acquisition of deposits and growth of users for NAGA TRADER Switex and the NAGA Wallet As NGC is the future currency of choice for these platforms the NGC is backed and additional NGC demand is accelerated and generated by the multi hundred million publicly listed NAGA Group AG Why the NAGA Crypto Economy will work Like every economy the NAGA crypto universe is determined by supply and demand The core business model of the NAGA Group is to grow their platforms and user base by generating deposits (or subscriptions in the case of NAGA Academy) The success of the acquisition of deposits/subscriptions (demand generation) depends on the ratio between customer acquisition cost (CAC) and customer life time value (LTV) The main monetary policy measure in the NAGA crypto economy is hence the efficiency and budget for generating users and deposits Existing market measures of The NAGA AG Based on historic numbers the current CAC to LTV ratio is around 1 5+ (CAC vs LTV) The NAGA Group AG with its additional traditional access to the capital markets and investors is aiming to further increase the marketing focus and enhance the CAC vs LTV ratio An additional marketing budget will be generated by the proceeds of this ITS NGC will be lent or paid to third parties such as The NAGA Group AG to carry out marketing activities and to generate more users and deposits Marketing will be carried out via viral growth as well as organic growth (acquisitions) This will result in higher deposits NAGA Academy subscriptions revenues demand and hence a higher NGC price The user centric benefit and bonus system as well as the engaging and social user experience of the NAGA platforms further generate organic and viral growth Furthermore the re investment of profits generated on the platforms will fuel the marketing activities and hence grow deposits and thus demand for NGC (it is crucial to understand that the supply of NGC is limited therefore the demand for NGC however is not limited) Furthermore the NGC utility token has a broad and diversified use case fundament that ranges from financial trading via in game item trading to purchasing multiple benefits including online education Since participation in the NAGA Ecosystem requires users to acquire NGC demand for the token will grow in proportion to the number of active users and the number of transactions they execute The ITS proceeds will further allow the network to grow in proportion to the number of active NAGA application users who are acquired via a diversified portfolio of marketing channels incl crossplatform selling and potential M&A transactions Buyers of NGC are incentivised to hold significant reserves of NGC in order to participate in the growth of the NAGA eco system Aside from spending NGC the model also provides a means of earning NGC rewards for activity on the platforms THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 46 \x0cNecessity for a decentralized and democratic solution in the financial trading and in game item space Switex requires virtual goods to be based on blockchain to a) Guarantee authenticity of items b) Prevent fraud c) Make transactions transparent d) Make transactions traceable e) Prevent abuse and money laundering f) Allow partners within the ecosystem (publishers affiliate partners etc ) to participate in the value chain and have a transparent way that allows such partners to have an \xe2\x80\x9cembedded live audit\xe2\x80\x9d with regards to any receivables In the eyes of NAGA the crowd/community and not a central institution needs to have control over the ecosystem and its full transparency and safety as a natural evolutionary process within this industry Most of these attributes will apply to NAGA TRADER and the NAGA WALLET as well (publishers are brokers banks financial institutions within this context) NAGA believes that trading in the financial space will naturally evolve into the blockchain space and that financial transactions will governed by smart contracts The NAGA ITS built the foundation for NAGA and the NGC to play an important role and to secure a seat in the front row of this development Furthermore NAGA believes that such crucial functions should not be owned/governed by a centralised company but rather the token holders 5 1 1 Fully Barrier Free Entry In order to allow simple access to every user both NAGA TRADER and Switex offer a proven virtual trading mode Clients can access and try out the platforms in a risk and hassle free environment Furthermore the platforms and its Joint Venture partners financial institutions brokers as well as providers are able to provide welcome credits as an incentive to join the platform These mechanisms have proven to be very efficient in attracting masses of users and traffic and have historically lead to the purchase of NGC (opening \xe2\x80\x9clive accounts\xe2\x80\x9d) in up to more of 50% of all registered users Within NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s decentralised universe Ever since the inception of Bitcoin and throughout the entire history of cryptocurrency one of the major barriers to entry for curious individuals has always been converting FIAT directly into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies The process usually requires some degree of technical skill and knowledge an understanding of security and trust in a system which is unlike anything these people have previously used There\xe2\x80\x99s no phone call to a broker to make a trade there\xe2\x80\x99s no speaking with an advisor in an office and of course there are ways of being swindled Currently the process of buying cryptocurrencies is a tremendous multi step hassle Generally speaking it begins with trying to figure out how to buy Bitcoin from various platforms (e g Bitcoin ATM website cash deal) sending it to an exchange (e g Bittrex Poloniex) and then figuring out how to make a trade for the desired cryptocurrency These multiple steps can seem complex intimidating and incomprehensible in some cases Even for experienced investors with technical THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 47 \x0cknowledge the process of converting FIAT into digital currencies is generally slow limited frustrating and occasionally risky Due to these inconveniences NAGA believes that curious and qualified investors are still turning their backs on the crypto markets and are consequently missing opportunities they would have otherwise seized 5 1 2 Transparency and Trust NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s crypto wallet is secured by applying the highest industry standards NAGA works together with a leading wallet security provider in the industry to ensure the safety of funds The funds are also secured by a combination of hot and cold storage solutions which provide further security The ID of the multi asset wallet is the user\ s e mail address and/or phone number User registration automatically creates a blockchain wallet Access to the user\xe2\x80\x99s wallet is locked by a 6 digit pin code and any transfers out from your wallet ARE also secured by a 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) to provide an additional layer of security NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s number one priority is to provide an open and completely transparent process when getting this platform established so that everyone can understand and appreciate the potential that this system will have For this project to succeed the diversity of currencies is going to be key hence the large ITS amount NAGA wants to create a strong and lasting relationship with its customers by providing responsive and helpful customer service complete transparency comprehensive security and the levels of anonymity that they desire To accomplish all this NAGA needs to have a thorough referral program that is going to encourage users to report all bugs and any security issues that may be present Due to a strong desire to put forth the best system possible NAGA still considers the possibility of adding more members to its team to cover areas like crypto security experts and the hiring of an outside auditor 5 1 3 Liquidity and Volatility Unlike any other ITS the NGC is used within two eco systems (Switex and NAGA TRADER as well as future use cases such as NAGA Academy) out of which NAGA TRADER is already live and generating billions of Euros in trading volume every month In addition to those concrete use cases NGC is listed at several Crypto Exchanges such as OKEX and HitBTC with further listings expected The details and exact dates will be communicated NAGA has already managed to generate a thick and deep market with NAGA TRADER and intends to further enhance these characteristics following its path of exponential growth As NAGA has already established a functioning network for real money transactions the liquidity risk is being mitigated from day one by running a \xe2\x80\x9creal money platform\xe2\x80\x9d in parallel that is linked and connected to the NGC Furthermore NAGA holds licenses as an EU regulated financial institution (NAGA Markets Ltd ) that allows NAGA to act as a market maker and liquidity provider Unlike any other ITS provider or token issuer NAGA Markets has a team of 20+ highly skilled and regulated employees with a vast background of experience to facilitate such services as a market maker and liquidity provider in a regulated and fair environment The procedures that are currently followed by NAGA Markets are in accordance with the MIFID guidelines29 to ensure a safe stable and fair operation of all services carried out 29 https //www esma europa eu/policy rules/mifid ii and mifir THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 48 \x0cIn addition to an already achieved critical mass to operate the platform NAGA TRADER the linkage to the ECR 20 protocol provides exchangeability within the largest crypto exchanges and hence ensures sufficient and deep liquidity which naturally leads to lower volatility The liquidity should furthermore naturally become deeper with Switex which in addition to the above mentioned primary market adds an additional pool of liquidity with the introduction of the Switex peer to peer secondary market The ability to have access to an EU financial markets regulated market maker and liquidity provider as well as the backbone of high volume trades worth billions per month and two use cases clearly differentiate the NAGA Token from most ITSs that have ever been performed In addition to these factors to mitigate liquidity and volatility risk the usual procedures offered by all other token generators such as using the ECR20 protocol and having the token listed on all major crypto exchanges contribute to the portfolio of simultaneous risk mitigation strategies 5 1 4 NGC Monetary Policies NAGA will use smart contracts to limit the lifetime of certain bonus tokens or tokens held with specific partners users market makers publishers or providers This self devaluation as well as NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to determine such self devaluation intervals will allow NAGA to subsidise promote and fuel certain services (or make non beneficiary areas for the ecosystem less attractive) products or campaigns (i e Welcome Deposit Bonus Copy Bonus or Referral Bonus ) The limitation of lifetime is achieved by re allocating such NGC tokens into the i e Donation Fund By limiting the lifetime of the holders of such tokens they are highly incentivised to then immediately use such tokens for the desired transaction and service Hoarding tokens (which is unattractive and undesirable to every economy) becomes less attractive or impossible NAGA aims to further grow and stabilise its ecosystems by implementing such smart contract based monetary policies ( SCBMP ) primarily applied by setting devaluation intervals and restricting the use of tokens for specific services or to specific holders only) Changes of SCBMP can lead to tokens being used to fuel the ecosystem in the desired areas and grow it SCBMP also has a high impact on liquidity volatility and spreads SCBMP is an active steering and controlling tool that can subsidise certain areas of the ecosystem such as virality growth trading volume referrals bonuses etc Whoever wants to use NAGA TRADER or Switex (or the NAGA Academy) will need to buy NGC Hence there should be a naturally increasing demand Even though there is still the fiat platform world the NGC user benefits from various advantages first and foremost from participating in a decentralised safe democratic transparent and safe blockchain based economy NAGA has proven to be able to consistently raise client\xe2\x80\x99s deposits which will soon be raised in NGC primarily or in Fiat which NAGA then will convert into NGC NAGA will try to convert \xe2\x80\x9cFiat users\xe2\x80\x9d into NGC users over time But like every economy the NGC crypto economy requires an adjustment mechanism This task is being performed by a discretionary Monetary Reserve pool It is based on all NGC held by NAGA plus a certain percentage of the generated revenues The discretionary Monetary Reserve Pool can be used to 1 Ensure sufficient NGC liquidity 2 Create a market uplift (by buying or holding NGC) THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 49 \x0c3 Prevent an overheated market (by selling NGC) The instruments are for example the following 1 Token buy back programs (i e by using ITS proceeds) 2 SCBMP (see above \xe2\x80\x93 by limiting the lifetime of i e bonus tokens) 3 Market Repurchase Buy Back \xe2\x80\x93 i e buying back NGC with a premium to the current market rate 4 Giving loans to user run market makers (see chapter peer2peer Trading Platform) \xe2\x80\x93 and letting them register as market makers This increases liquidity increases competition and hence reduces spreads (by creating numerous decentralised user run liquidity providers) 5 Install a dynamic exchange rate multiplier (NAGA reserves the right to introduce an additional sub NAGA TRADER /Switex coin in the event of extreme volatility with a dynamic exchange rate multiplier in order to provide a stable base currency for its platform The utility benefits of the NGC remain unchanged for the user) 5 2 PERENNIAL PLATFORM GROWTH Being traded and used on several internal as well as external marketplaces platforms and ecosystems carries a risk of high volatility including inter platform arbitrage Both carry significant risk as well as the opportunity to trade the NGC for price difference only Subscribers should be aware of market risk as well as liquidity risk Although NAGA intends to use the majority of the proceeds of the ITS for driving volume and traffic to the platform there is no guarantee of the sufficient (or any) liquidity of the NGC One of the most crucial user benefits and embedded functions for viral platform growth is the Follower Bonus paid in NGC Users can monetise their skills and earn NGC by posting attractive trades or strategies on NAGA TRADER and get paid per follower or auto copier Users can hence earn NGC by generating their own community of followers This feature has also proven to increase the virality of the platform The user\xe2\x80\x99s incentive to generate passive and steady income from followers if they constantly post and share sustainable trades and strategies generates visibility even beyond the borders of the NAGA TRADER Ecosystem NAGA TRADER currently supports sharing functions into the largest (social) networks worldwide (i e Facebook WhatsApp) The niche of a \xe2\x80\x9cFacebook for Finance\xe2\x80\x9d has yet to be taken on and NAGA TRADER currently boasts a vast variety of features that can usually only be found in major networks such as LinkedIn Facebook Instagram or What\xe2\x80\x99s app These features will also be integral parts of the NAGA Cryptocurrency trading and investing services By combining these features with a highly latency optimised real time data infrastructure connecting the largest trading exchanges NAGA TRADER has an optimal foundation to grow both by intrinsic user activity (triggered by sharing motivated through follower/auto copier bonuses) and externally by investments in marketing or acquisitions (with its IPO The NAGA Group AG has created an acquisition currency (the NAGA Group AG share) The follower bonus on NAGA TRADER hence generates a concrete incentive \xe2\x80\x93 credited in real time to the user\xe2\x80\x99s wallet for the individual user at the same time as being the engine for exponential and viral growth of the community Unlike conventional asset management or advisory services that are usually centralised in their nature the NAGA TRADER Ecoystem allows every user to publish his trade or strategy and get paid in NGC per follower and per copied trade In addition to human THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 50 \x0cusers following and

Development of the NAGA Platform consists of three tracks \xe2\x80\xa2 Technology development \xe2\x80\xa2 Legal and licensing development \xe2\x80\xa2 Community and business development The technology development track is dedicated to creating not only the smart contracts for NGC and its ecosystem but also all the necessary infrastructure for fund administration reporting analysis and integration with publishers banks and brokers Thanks to the extensive experience of the NAGA team in the development of trading platforms and the setting up of API connections with lending companies these tasks rest on a solid foundation of expertise and successful track record On the legal and licensing track NAGA legal and executive teams will focus their efforts on setting up a fully transparent licensed where necessary and auditable structure making sure that the envisioned structure is fully compliant with regulations To do this NAGA will perform in house research as well as contract with reputable legal firms On the community and business development track NAGA will continue its aggressive expansion strategy sign new partnerships and build a strong international brand Partnerships with leading online marketing agencies and consulting companies will accelerate NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s future expansion plans The funds collected in the token sale are used to meet predefined milestones in NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s product roadmap as outlined below The mentioned dates are the earliest dates possible The milestones provide today\xe2\x80\x99s view of the market needs Due to the fast evolving nature of the blockchain ecosystem these milestones are indicative NAGA commits to these milestones regardless of the outcome THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 54 \x0cof the token sales and total funds collected As NAGA is already publicly listed and has a running business with an EU licensed brokerage billions of $ in traded volume every month and several offices around Europe NAGA intends to use the proceeds mainly to expand the ecosystem acquire millions of users and build a powerful engine for NGC holders Besides Marketing Business Development and diligent work on Legal & Regulatory NAGA foresees the following roadmap on the product side NAGA MARKET GUARD Looking at websites such as coinmarketcap com which have 80 to 100 million users to analyse the momentum of specific coins there is clearly high demand for detailed learning about the specifications around the various tokens which are being issued nearly every day NAGA believes that crypto Investors need a place to learn about tokens in depth instead of solely looking at the market cap or traded volume Together with its partner Finery who helped NAGA TRADER with the development of its crowd & market intelligence based robo advisor \xe2\x80\x9cCYBO\xe2\x80\x9d NAGA is already working on a sophisticated solution which allows users to evaluate a special risk score around tokens on the market called NAGA Market Guard NAGA thinks that there is too much scam around tokens currencies and exchanges in general Thus NAGA partially sees itself on a social mission for its users to save them from supicious players in the market Figure 27 NAGA Market Guard \xe2\x80\x93 Landing Page With NAGA Market Guard NAGA will use advanced machine learning and data mining techniques and benefit from deep expertise in market microstructure in order to realise investment opportunities for retail clients B2B algorithmic traders and brokers With a normalised real time market data feed

NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 57 \x0cCHAPTER 7 THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 58 \x0c7 TRANSPARENCY REGULATORY & RISK FACTORS 7 1 TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s group activities comprise of a large set of activities that may be subject to regulatory scrutiny in various territories The NAGA entities already operate in a highly regulated environment The holding company The NAGA Group AG as a public company listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is subject to all transparency and market abuse regulations according to European legislation The groups brokerage company NAGA Markets Ltd is licensed as a financial services provider under supervision of the Cyprus security and exchange commission This implies that not only the companies\xe2\x80\x99 operations namely its dealings with client funds but as well its personnel with respect to running a financial services institution are under constant supervision and control Although the regulatory environment for companies and groups operating with tokens and cryptocurrencies of its customers is not yet clearly defined the fact that the NAGA Group already has to comply with various compliance transparency as well as regulatory rules provides the groups customers as well as participants of the token sale with the most secure environment so far available for token generating events or initial coin offerings The legal structure set up for the token sale has been and will be constantly reviewed and approved by the groups legal advisors to ensure that they are compliant with the existing laws and regulations As far as the group or its advisors will encounter legal uncertainties these will be resolved with the responsible regulatory bodies involved By sorting out any legal or regulatory exposures from the very beginning the group is aiming for full transparency towards investors as well as regulators in order to achieve the highest level of investor confidence as well as legal and regulatory compliance possible 7 2 REPORTING NAGA will provide a reporting structure that gives the token holders full transparency on what has been achieved with the proceeds from the ITS as well as the use of the tokens and the status of the projects NAGA Development Association Ltd will provide the token holders with an annual reporting on Balance and assets \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Crypto currencies held Fiat money held Use of the Token Sale proceeds \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Platform development progress Marketing

etc 7 3 RISK FACTORS The purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk including but not limited to the risks described below Before acquiring NGC tokens it is recommended that each participant carefully weighs all the information and risks detailed in this White Paper and specifically the following risk factors Please further note that the NAGA project may be subject to other risks not foreseen 7 3 1 Dependence on Computer Infrastructure NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on functioning software applications computer hardware and the Internet implies that NAGA can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the use of your NGC tokens Despite NAGA\ s implementation of all reasonable network security measures its processing centre servers are vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other disruptions of a similar nature Computer viruses break ins or other disruptions caused by third parties may result in interruption delay or suspension of services which would limit the use of the ITSs tokens 7 3 2 Smart Contract Limitations Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development and its application is of an experimental nature This may carry significant operational technological regulatory reputation and financial risks Consequently although the audit conducted by an independent third party increases the level of security reliability and accuracy this audit cannot serve as any form of warranty including any expressed or implied warranty that the ITSS Smart Contract is fit for purpose or that it contains no flaws vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the complete loss of ITSS tokens 7 3 3 Regulatory Risks Blockchain technology including but not limited to the issue of tokens may be a new concept in some jurisdictions which may then apply existing laws or introduce new regulations regarding Blockchain technology based applications and such regulations may conflict with the current smart contract setup and token concept This may result in the need to make substantial modifications to NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract including but not limited to its termination the loss of NGS tokens and the suspension or termination of all NGC token functions It cannot be ruled out that services and projects described in this document will have to be adjusted or modified in certain countries because of the regulatory environment It also cannot be ruled out that some services will be impossible to provide in certain jurisdictions THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 60 \x0c7 3 4 Taxes NGC token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the transactions contemplated herein It will be a sole responsibility of NGC token holders to comply with the tax laws of the jurisdictions applicable to them and pay all relevant taxes 7 3 5 Force Majeure NAGA\xe2\x80\x99s performance may be interrupted suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances For the purposes of this White Paper force majeure shall mean extraordinary events and circumstances which could not be prevented by NAGA and shall include acts of nature wars armed conflicts mass civil disorders industrial actions epidemics lockouts slowdowns prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication service acts of municipal state or federal governmental agencies other circumstances beyond NAGA\ s control which were not in existence at the time of White Paper release If such circumstances occur prior to the issue of NGC tokens and NAGA is unable to issue NGC tokens within one month from the projected date the escrow agent may issue a refund at the request of the NGC token purchasers The refund will be issued in the original form of payment to the same digital wallet or bank account where the funds were transferred from 7 3 6 Disclosure of Information Personal information received from NGC token holders the information about the number of tokens owned the wallet addresses used and any other relevant information may be disclosed to law enforcement government officials and other third parties when NAGA is required to disclose such information by law subpoena or court order NAGA shall at no time be held responsible for such information disclosure 7 3 7 Value of NGC Token Once purchased the value of NGC token may significantly fluctuate due to various reasons NAGA does not guarantee any specific value of the NGC token over any specific period of time NAGA shall not be held responsible for any change in the value of NGC token including the complete loss of value of the NGC Even though the large scale and large magnitude use cases (with a proof of concept in billions of Euros already traded every month on NAGA TRADER) implies deep liquidity and hence also lower volatility there is no guarantee that NAGA will achieve those goals There is no guarantee that users can acquire sufficient NAGA Tokens for their usage within the NAGA and external platforms and neither is there a guarantee that users can cash out their NAGA Tokens via external platforms Furthermore every NAGA Token holder naturally carries the risk of volatile exchange rate fluctuations of the NAGA Token towards both other Crypto Currencies and Fiat Money exchange rates 7 3 8 Bitcoin and Ethereum Volatility The NGC token may be significantly influenced by digital currency market trends and NGC value may be severely depreciated due to non NGC related events in the digital currency markets Cryptocurrencies exchange rate volatility may impact the company\ s ability to provide services at the indicated prices Assumptions with respect to the foregoing involve among other things judgments about the future economic competitive and market conditions and business decisions most of THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 61 \x0cwhich are beyond the control of the NAGA team and are therefore difficult or impossible to accurately predict 7 3 9 Lack of funds from ITS proceeds NAGA may not reach the target sale amount and may not have sufficient funds to execute its business plan Furthermore NAGA may not succeed in creating the necessary momentum and acceptance for the NGC token which may result in low liquidity and depletion of trades The positions and plans outlined in this white paper may be altered as the project progresses 7 3 10 Delayed Projects & Competition Although the NAGA team believes that its assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable any of these may prove to be inaccurate As a result the NAGA team can offer no assurances that the forward looking statements contained in this White Paper will prove to be accurate In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements contained herein the inclusion of such information may not be interpreted as a warranty on the part of NAGA or any other entity that the objectives and plans of the NAGA project will be successfully achieved Competition may introduce the same or better prediction market solutions and cause NAGA to lose market share and eventually fail to deliver on its business goals THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 62 \x0cANNEX 1 THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 63 \x0cANNEX 1

Advisory Robo advisors are automated software asset managers which on the basis of ready made strategies offer automated investments of customer funds These robo advisors build portfolios out of mostly index funds (ETFs) These portfolios usually contain common asset classes such as stocks bonds and occasionally also commodities 51 In comparison to conventional portfolio management solutions such as managed funds robo advisory strategies primarily are characterised as lower cost structures In addition this type of automated system is particularly attractive for younger and technology oriented users 52 Figure 30 Global Robo Advisory Assets Under Management Growth Forecast Robo advisors were popular in the late 1990s for the first time and have gained in significance since 2008 In

shows an average growth rate of 7% per year This means that by 2019 the gaming market will achieve a total forecasted turnover of 118 6 billion USD 54 In 2016 the top 25 public gaming companies showed an additional 22% growth in sales in comparison to the previous year When considering the mobile market growth rates between 2015 and 2016 actually amounted to 40% This indicates how Sony for example managed to increase sales by 45% in the same period Tencent by far the biggest gaming group reported a record turnover of USD 5 3 billion in 2016 55 The most rapid growing market segment in the gaming area is the Free to Play genre (games are provided to the user free of charge and additional content can be purchased such as in game items) Virtual Reality and of course the mobile sector The latter according to a forecast from 2017 is surpassing the classic computer game sector by 4 billion USD In the Free to Play genre alone the games League of Legends and DOTA 2 generated total monthly sales

has revolutionised how humans live communicate think and how they live their everyday lives It has turned their very existence upside down Today most humans take the internet for granted and cannot even imagine their lives without it The internet was born nearly five decades ago and since then technology has rapidly advanced by huge leaps About 15 years ago only 12% of all people owned mobile phones Now more than six out of ten persons worldwide use a mobile phone About 15 years ago one third of the population in developing countries lived in extreme poverty compared to less than 15% today Facebook which now has nearly 1 5 billion users had not even been launched then In another fifteen years\ time who knows how much technological innovation and developments society will see and what changes this will bring Cryptocurrencies offer a fundamentally different way of approaching money and conducting online commerce The development of blockchain based money solves a number of problems inherent in the current financial system A properly implemented online trading platform with integrated cryptocurrency payments has extensive advantages Bitcoin The first cryptocurrency was the bitcoin Articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto\ s 2008 white paper Bitcoin deals with the \xc2\xabdouble spending\xc2\xbb problem through the use of a shared ledger that is maintained by a large number of network nodes By contriving a system in which it is computationally expensive to add a block of transactions to the ledger but easy for anyone to verify it Bitcoin makes it unlikely for any member of the network to succeed in submitting a fraudulent transaction \xe2\x80\x93 and it is expensive to try to do so Thus miners \xe2\x80\x93 those tasked with upholding the security of the network \xe2\x80\x93 are better off acting honestly and maintaining the integrity of the ledger Financial independence Nakamoto\ s implementation of his white paper effectively removed the need for a trusted third party to act as a middleman in online transfers This enabled real peer to peer transactions online for the first time ever a remarkable breakthrough and a task that many experts had believed could not be achieved Money which had been centralised for millennia in seigniorage and for decades in terms of the payment system could once again become purely a tool of commerce rather than a way to extract value and exert control Because Bitcoin transactions take place directly \xe2\x80\x93 from sender to recipient and without the involvement of a centralised third party \xe2\x80\x93 they cannot be censored Once a transaction has been accepted into the ledger there is no way of reversing it This has a simple but powerful implication if you want to send someone money you can There is no authority that can block or reverse the transfer Bitcoin\ s financial system restores full autonomy to its users Low cost transfers Because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use a blockchain to secure transactions there are no middlemen to keep accounts and therefore there are no single entities that can charge fees for the service Miners collectively process transactions and are rewarded for verifying a block with both new coins (block rewards currently set at 12 5 Bitcoins per block) and the smaller fees incurred with each transfer Unlike the legacy banking system Bitcoin does not recognise geographical borders Transferring funds to a neighbour on the other side of the road is as fast and efficient as sending money to the other side of the world While banks and remittance services tend to THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER _______________________________ 71 \x0ccharge significant flat fees as well as unfavourable exchange rates between currencies Bitcoin\ s fees are fixed and low by comparison Other blockchain protocols tend to charge even lower fees Privacy Bitcoin\ s use of a shared ledger to facilitate peer to peer transactions also has implications for privacy The Bitcoin ledger is fully transparent by design meaning that anyone can trace transactions from one address to another right back to the block in which the coins were first created However because addresses are essentially strings of random alphanumeric characters it is not inherently obvious to whom the address belongs Bitcoin is strictly speaking pseudonymous rather than anonymous While data may be leaked in a variety of ways that associate a Bitcoin address with other personal information to reveal the owner\ s identity by using best practice it is possible to use Bitcoin privately The lack of a trusted intermediary means that no information need to be registered to use a Bitcoin wallet There is no administrative authority to control transactions or to collect user data Initial Token Sale (ITS) a disruptive fundraising model Since of the year 2017 the world has witnessed an explosion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) as an innovative and unique method of financing for startups globally ICOs are a completely new and game changing funding method done by issuing a corporate related token This rise has challenged the conventional venture capital industry in its capacity to finance innovative startups and projects ICOs have increased in popularity with over $2 billion raised since the beginning of 2017 The amount raised by startups through ICOs has even surpassed venture capital (VC) funding in the blockchain area in the first 2 quarters of 201757 ICOs raised nearly $1 3 billion in Q3 2017 alone vs just around $259 million for early stage VC funding58 Companies have raised at least $2 6 billion this year via initial coin offerings (as per October 2017) ICOs have already surpassed all historical VC investment in the blockchain space which stands at $1 7B since 2010 Contrary to conventional equity funding ICOs give specific rights to their holders to use or profit from specific company related services 57 58 http //www businessinsider

\x0cFigure 32 ICO Funding vs VC Industry Startups specialised in Blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies are no longer the only ones to use ICOs for their funding This trend is accelerating spectacularly with funds raised from ICOs breaking new records on a monthly basis The appeal of cryptocurrencies for investors is due to the flexibility and the potential of solid returns that have been been witnessed lately on the market According to coinschedule com59 there were 46 ICOs in 2016 and around 202 this year (as per Oct 23)60 The potentially disruptive funding model of the ICOs give companies the capacity to raise money from individuals more efficiently However and if we take into consideration the increasing exposure that ICOs have been gaining lately the amount of funding generated is expected to keep increasing dramatically in the coming months Ethereum Launched in 2015 Ethereum is a decentralised software platform that enables Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (D Apps) to be built and run without any downtime fraud control or interference from a third party Ethereum is not just a platform but also a programming language (Turing complete) running on a blockchain helping developers to build and publish distributed applications The potential applications of Ethereum are wide ranging Dash Dash was launched in January 2014 as Xcoin and then changed its name to Darkcoin In March 2015 Darkcoin was rebranded as Dash Dash was created as a fork of Bitcoin which means it duplicated Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s existent code and made it better by

efficiency As an alternative to Bitcoin Dash provides a faster and more anonymous service to its users Litecoin Launched in the year 2011 Litecoin is an alternative cryptocurrency based on the model of Bitcoin Charlie Lee a MIT graduate and former Google engineer is Litecoin\ s creator Litecoin is based on an open source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority Litecoin differs from Bitcoins in aspects like faster block generation rate and use of scrypt as a proof of work scheme ICO The acronym ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering When an ICO is offered by a company capital will be raised through the creation of a new cryptocurrency which can then be bought by investors with Fiat money or crypto currencies ICOs are similar to IPOs and crowdfunding The big difference between an ICO and an IPO is the fact that investors in an ICO do not take an actual stake in the company as is the case with an IPO Investors in an ICO are invested in the company but only indirectly though the cryptocurrency that is being created If the ICO is successful the value of this cryptocurrency is likely to increase and the investors will have made profit Smart contracts Developed by the Ethereum foundation a Swiss non profit organisation Ethereum upends the traditional approach to offering services on the internet Instead of building server farms across the world \xe2\x80\x93 staffing them maintaining them and securing them \xe2\x80\x93 Ethereum makes it possible to build a global computing infrastructure by using a type of coding called \xc2\xabsmart contracts\xc2\xbb These contracts allocate computing resources across the blockchain and reward those who use their own hardware to support the calculations required With the right skill and hardware anyone can join this effort by creating an Ethereum node and be compensated for their contribution all without a central coordination authority Ethereum works in a fully decentralised manner just as the Bitcoin blockchain does Smart contracts are pieces of code whose execution is ensured by the network as a whole in the same way that Bitcoin\ s transfers and records of funds are policed by the whole network This means that applications that run automatically can be built and the reliability of the services they offer is guaranteed because there is no single point of failure Ethereum\ s smart contracts therefore offer the possibility of an e commerce platform that has unique properties privacy for both the buyer and the seller complete freedom from censorship and interference and
