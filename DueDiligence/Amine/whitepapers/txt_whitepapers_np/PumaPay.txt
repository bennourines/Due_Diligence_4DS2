 Abstract 
 
 Retailers and service providers are struggling with inefficient and costly payment 
 mechanisms which have not kept pace with the evolution of global commerce 
 Nothing credit cards alternative payments virtual coins or blockchain technology 
 
 has yet adapted to todays various processing needs in order to provide an 
 optimized solution for payment processing PumaPays PullPayment protocol (the 
 Protocol) under development is intended to solve this problem by utilizing a new 
 architecture of smart contract called PullContract which enables new billing 
 methodologies over the blockchain We wish for the Protocol to promote more 
 frequent use of cryptocurrency in online and offline markets thereby significantly 
 increasing the total volume of payments transacted with cryptocurrencies as well 
 as contributing to the global trend of payment decentralization 
 The Protocol is intended to be a comprehensive solution which offers robust 
 payment mechanisms far more credible efficient flexible cost effective and 
 scalable than current implementations Unlike todays payment methods which 
 include credit cards and virtual coins like Bitcoin the Protocol is being designed 
 from the ground up with the intention to overcome some of the existing payment 
 problems In addition we believe the Protocol will have the potential to increase 
 economic efficiency reduce friction and minimize risks by removing intermediaries 
 such as credit card companies that also charge excessive fees 
 
 The Protocol is designed as a free open source project built around a customizable 
 chain of contracts that govern transaction behavior It can be set as a simple 
 single transaction a complex transaction that includes among others recurring 
 payments pay per use payments split payments restricted payments exchange 
 rate corrections or a combination of the above Businesses will be able to use 
 the Protocols payment mechanism as is or modify and/or create new ones to fit 
 their needs We believe the solutions offered by the PumaPay Protocol will create 
 business opportunities for external third party companies that can build additional 
 services on top of the Protocol and contribute to the PumaPay ecosystem Such 
 services may include but are not limited to credit facilities transactions insurance 
 dispute arbitration and escrow services code verification services and others 
 
 It is our intention that the PumaPay Protocol be promoted through partnerships 
 with businesses that have significant turnovers by encouraging them to adopt the 
 PumaPay ecosystem from the onset Through our Launch Partner we hope the 
 protocol will plug into industries with tens of thousands of daily customers spanning 
 numerous markets

 Motivation 
 
 To date the dominant payment method for online as well as offline purchases has 
 been payment cards (credit cards debit cards prepaid cards etc ) The problem is 
 that payment cards were developed in the 1950s before the existence of personal 
 computers and the internet They were originally designed for offline transactions 
 where the customer approved a transaction by manually signing a receipt Payment 
 cards were not designed to deal with our modern fast paced global economy Their 
 popularity is mostly due to a lack of acceptable alternatives for electronic payments 
 Payment card usage perpetuates an anachronistic system which suffers heavily 
 from infrastructural inefficiencies 
 
 The structure of the payment cards ecosystem is very complex and consists of 
 multiple participants Credit Card Associations (Visa MasterCard AmEx) Issuing 
 Banks Acquiring Banks Processors and Payment Gateways to name a few The 
 market is oligopolistic and the incumbent players each control their networks 
 dictating the rules and the costs This centralistic structure leads to inefficiencies 
 Similar to many other centralized systems the intermediaries in the payment 
 ecosystem use their power to increase the spread between the value they extract 
 and the value they add The merchants that depend on card acceptance for their 
 existence have to comply with an endless list of rules dictated by the owners of 
 these networks Moreover they are also subject to a complex fee structure that 
 ranges from 3% 15% of their gross receipts (depending on the settings) and to add 
 insult to injury they are also exposed to the risks associated with fraudulent activity 
 and chargebacks 
 
 The introduction of Bitcoin as an electronic cash system in 2009 was the first 
 step towards a modern online payment solution Bitcoin was originally designed 
 to address trust issues and to optimize security but at the expense of scalability 
 speed and cost As a result Bitcoin in its current construct is unable to offer 
 flexible processing solutions for most of the current online billing methodologies 
 None of the cryptocurrencies that were introduced over the past few years has 
 provided a comprehensive payment solution that allows crypto holders to utilize 
 their cryptocurrencies as a means of payment Cryptocurrencies are far too 
 underdeveloped to compete at scale with payment cards they suffer from poor 
 
 acceptance by merchants mostly due to their complexity of usage and they do not 
 support transactions that are more sophisticated than a simple push transaction 
 
 There is a real need for a payment infrastructure that is built to serve merchants not 
 exploit them A system that is built from the ground up for the digital era and that 
 is as scalable flexible and accessible as payment cards but without their inherent 
 flaws and disadvantages Blockchain technology offers a great opportunity to create 
 such a system for the benefit of merchants and consumers alike 
 
 PumaPay Protocol is an attempt to design such an infrastructure which would have 
 the potential to grow into a fully decentralized payment system 
 
 Payment Cards 
 
 There are several types of payment cards that are managed by and run on specific 
 networks like Visa MasterCard and American Express (AmEx) These include 
 multiple card types such as credit debit pre paid and charge cards Payment 
 gateways like PayPal or Stripe and e wallet systems such as Apple Wallet and 
 Google Wallet are developed around payment cards 
 
 Payment cards accommodate over 77% of global commerce Of over 257 billion 
 cards transactions worldwide Visa cards alone generated 54% worldwide in 20161 
 
 Ecosystem structure 
 
 Every card swipe or tap triggers a complex process as payment data is generated 
 and sent through an intricate network of stakeholders each of which charges a fee 
 for pushing the transaction through These include 
 
 Card networks which act as a central point that facilitates transactions between 
 users and acquiring entities while establishing the protocol that other parties 
 engaged in card processing are required to follow They also set interchange fees 
 (paid to the issuer) ensure compliance with the rules and regulations they set and

 Acquiring banks provide merchants with access to systems required to accept card 
 payments They provide access to payment terminals processing services and a 
 bank account into which settled funds can be deposited 
 
 Issuing banks (which have issued the customers debit or credit cards) may either 
 hold the deposits or extend the credit associated with the account that the card is 
 tied to 
 
 Processors apart from providing different levels of back office support the main 
 purpose of processors is to securely transfer payment data 
 
 Payment Gateways work in the same way acting as payment terminals and frontend 
 processors Services such as Stripe serve as a portal connecting e Commerce 
 merchants and acquirers Furthermore payment gateways can benefit merchants 
 by offering them additional services like analytics and reporting 
 
 MSPs (Merchant Service Providers) and ISOs are intermediaries that sell payment 
 processing services to merchants on behalf of acquirers and processors2 
 
 Structure of a Payment Card Transaction2 
 
 Credit card processing happens in three stages Each of them involves all players 
 outlined above Lets take a closer look at the payment card ecosystem through an 
 example of a 100 USD purchase made by a customer 
 
 
 Processing Batching and Clearing Funding

 Consumer Merchant Acquirer/ Card Network Issuing Bank 
 Processor 
 Customer swipes

 Authorization Request

 Heres how this system works in practice A buyer wants to make a 100 USD 
 purchase To begin the transaction the consumer runs the credit card through the 
 credit card reader The payment terminal reads the card and passes the data to the 
 acquiring bank which requests the credit card networks authorization In turn the 
 card network communicates with the card issuing bank to ascertain that there are 
 enough funds available to cover the amount of the transaction It also investigates 
 that the card isnt stolen and that there arent any red flags to hinder the payment 
 
 As soon as the issuing bank confirms the transaction it shares an authorization code 
 with the card network which passes it on to the acquiring bank After the acquirer 
 sends the code back to the merchant authorization is complete All this takes place 
 in seconds leaving the customer with an impression of a finalized transaction For 
 other parties however things arent as fast 
 
 Batching and Clearing

 While the transaction may be over from the customers standing point given that 
 shes already out of the store with her purchase a lot more is going on behind the 
 scenes The merchant has not received the money for the purchase yet For that to 
 happen all the individual transactions of the day must be grouped into a batch and 
 cleared 
 
 When the day ends the batch containing all the days transactions is passed to the 
 acquirer When the acquirer receives the batch it requests payments on behalf of the 
 merchant by sharing the days transaction history with the relevant card networks 
 The transactions are divided up by issuer and fund requests are sent to the relevant 
 banks3

 Money starts to change hands after the issuing bank receives a request for funds 
 The requested amount is then passed to the acquiring bank through the card network 
 after deducting an interchange fee Theres another fee taken by the card network 
 (an assessment fee) The remaining funds are passed to the acquirer Lastly the 
 acquirer subtracts a Markup fee The remainder is then deposited in the merchants 
 account This process can take days and sometimes even weeks to complete 
 
 Notes 
 
 
 There are other types of transactions such as closed loop transactions debit card transactions etc but the 
 basic mechanics illustrated above are enough for the understanding of the complexity of the transaction 
 
 Transactions can be settled in real time as well not only in batches This approach has the advantage of 
 being faster but it also carries more risk and is costlier for merchants Its usually used by e commerce 
 providers and merchants with a high volume of transactions 
 Fees 
 
 Accepting payment cards comes with a price and merchants are subject to a 
 complex fee structure There are nearly 300 different fees and they can be broadly 
 divided into 3 categories 
 
 
 Transaction fees These are the fees the card issuing banks and the credit 
 card associations charge for each transaction and they represent the largest 
 expense that merchants incur This category includes Interchange fees which 
 consist of transfer the funds from the customers account to the merchants as 
 well as Assessment and Markup fees 
 
 Flat Fees In addition to transaction fees merchants also pay various flat fees 
 These include Terminal Fees Payment Gateway Fees PCI Fees Annual Fees 
 Monthly Fees Monthly Minimum Fees Statement Fees Network Fees etc 
 
 Incidental Fees These fees are not fixed and are charged only per incident 
 AVS (address verification) VAF (voice authorization fee) Retrieval Request Fee 
 Chargeback Fee Batch Fee NSF Fee and more 
 Looking at the 100 USD transaction here are the fees collected by various parties 
 before the funds reach the merchants account

 To keep things simple we did not take into account indirect fees such as monthly 
 fees account maintenance fees incidental fees etc Nonetheless these fees may 
 be substantial 
 
 The merchant in our example pays a total of 2 95% of its gross earnings to all the 
 parties involved in processing the payment This may not seem too painful at first 
 glance but remember this 2 95% is from the gross revenue Consider our merchant 
 has a net profit margin of 7 5% such that from every 100 USD of sales it takes home 
 
 7 5 USD Suddenly the payment industrys 2 95 USD chunk of the sales becomes 
 40% of profits Ouch

 PumaPay Protocol will offer merchants the advantages of payment cards without 
 the associated costs risks and hurdles 
 
 Risks 
 
 Payment card processing exposes merchants to various risks and fraud attempts 
 Most fraud prevention features are designed for card present environments Visa 
 for example has deployed several anti fraud measures designed to make card 
 reproduction extremely difficult including holograms and embossed security 
 characters on the face of the card Moreover the signature and magnetic strip on 
 the back of the card are designed to verify the card holders identity Merchants are 
 usually not liable for fraud when card present transactions are properly authenticated 
 
 Online platforms however typically facilitate card not present (CNP) transactions 
 (card payments made without physically swiping a card) Unfortunately card notpresent 
 transactions are highly susceptible to fraud and abuse for which merchants 
 and payment facilitators are not protected5 
 
 Online merchants and e commerce sites especially smaller merchants are exposed 
 to a rising wave of card not present (CNP) fraud A 2017 Javelin Strategy and 
 Research study found that in the US this fraud categorys losses rose 40% from 
 2015 to 2016 Losses are expected to rise even more a Juniper Research study6 
 found that over the next five years retailers are on track to lose 71 billion USD in CNP 
 fraud losses globally 
 
 US merchants surveyed by American Express in 2017 said they spent just over 30% 
 of their IT budgets on payment security Still many merchants are not equipped to 
 hold off the CNP fraud wave While established e commerce providers like Amazon 
 Walmart and Target have ample budgets earmarked for security smaller players are 
 finding their dollars stretched too thin to justify further security spending 
 
 Card not present fraud may originate from various weaknesses and incompatibility 
 of payment cards to the digital age such as merchant identity theft customer 
 identity theft or friendly fraud but they all pose one major risk for the merchant 
 Chargebacks 
 
 Chargebacks 
 
 When a cardholder disputes a charge with their bank (the issuing bank) banks 
 usually reverse the payment and refund the cardholder This is called a chargeback 
 Payment facilitators recover the chargeback funds from the acquiring bank of the 
 merchants who generated them and the acquirer recovers them from the merchant 
 
 Since chargebacks may be received weeks or even months after the original 
 transaction took place it is sometimes difficult to recover the funds from the 
 merchant To protect themselves acquirers may be very conservative in their 
 underwriting they will implement special policies such as reserves or holdbacks 
 to mitigate loss and may sometime require personal guarantees from business 
 owners whom they will hold personally liable for the businesss financial obligations 
 
 Card networks (Visa MasterCard etc ) set standards for chargeback ratios For 
 example Visa does not allow merchants to exceed a threshold of 1% chargebacks 
 out of all transactions in any given month Exceeding this threshold will result in 
 fines Crossing the threshold several months consecutively may lead to account 
 termination by the network and inability of the merchant to process payment cards 
 in the future 
 
 To minimize chargeback risks merchants may deploy various tools and tactics 
 some offered by payment processors or other 3rd parties While these may help 
 reduce chargebacks they come with the inevitable cost of lost sales for false 
 positive errors 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 Payment card processing is an elementary requirement for merchants However 
 due to the centralized structure of the payment processing ecosystem merchants 
 are subject to inefficiencies exorbitant fees and substantial risks 
 
 PumaPay PullPayment protocol was designed from the ground up to facilitate a 
 robust scalable and flexible payment system that will overcome these hurdles

 The PumaPay Vision 
 
 Blockchain technology holds a great promise for changing the payments industry 
 The problems described in the previous section can be addressed by a blockchainbased 
 payment protocol that enables the flexibility and scalability of payment cards 
 over a decentralized platform Such a protocol would be capable of facilitating 
 transactions between the customer and the merchant eliminating intermediaries 
 along the way saving substantial amounts for both merchants and customers 
 increasing overall efficiency and reducing risks Adoption of such a protocol by 
 merchants could eventually lead to increased use of cryptocurrencies for daily 
 transactions 
 
 There are currently many hurdles that stand in the way of purchasing items with 
 cryptocurrency if holders do not convert to fiat currency first The mass adoption 
 of a cryptocurrency payment protocol like PumaPay could result in crypto holders 
 being able to transact directly with merchants without having to go through an extra 
 layer of banking By promoting the protocol to high transaction volume industries 
 and by providing a powerful and flexible PullPayment protocol PumaPay hopes to 
 become the base layer for cryptocurrency payments throughout the world 
 
 The PumaPay Protocol is designed with both on chain and off chain components 
 The functionality of the PumaPay Protocol will be present in the on chain 
 components while the off chain components will be designed to make the user 
 interaction with the Protocol seamless and user friendly 
 
 PumaPay PullPayment Protocol 
 
 Cryptocurrencies were designed for direct transfer of value between two parties 
 without having to go through intermediaries (P2P) and presently allow only one 
 simple basic type of transaction push While this may be enough as a POC for 
 cryptocurrencies it is definitely not enough in order to make them a widely used 
 means of payment as it does not address the requirements of modern commerce 
 
 At the heart of our protocol we are designing a unique architecture of PullPayment 
 smart contracts that inverse the mechanics of common cryptocurrencies 
 transactions instead of having side A send or push tokens to side B it allows side 
 
 B to connect to side As account (public address) via a PullContract and pull funds 
 into its account This is of course subject to predefined terms and prior acceptance 
 of the transaction by side A 
 
 PumaPay PullPayment Protocol is being designed from the ground up specifically 
 to address this issue and to facilitate flexibility in transaction mechanics The 
 innovative PullPayment architecture will open the door to a whole universe of 
 payment mechanisms that are very common in our daily lives both online and 
 offline but to date are either impossible or practically unfeasible over the blockchain 
 such as recurring payments direct debit pay per use etc In fact the protocol is 
 intended to be so powerful and flexible that it will enable any merchant to design 
 their own transactions and implement their own business logic 
 
 A Truly Decentralized Vision 
 
 For Decentralized Vision the company behind PumaPay decentralization is more 
 than a buzz word Decentralization is something we are truly committed to It is the 
 philosophy behind the PumaPay PullPayment protocol To adhere to this vision we 
 strive to develop a protocol that will eventually have a life of its own without having 
 to be governed by any central entity 
 
 To meet the needs of development and initial launch we will be employing a 
 centralistic model gradually moving to the hybrid one where the role of the 
 community in development will grow With the decentralized model being our 
 ultimate goal all PumaPay components are being developed open source making 
 it possible for the community to take the lead We expect developers and service 
 providers to start offering paid services on top of the protocol taking the technology 
 and user experience to the next level As the initial effort to deploy PumaPays 
 decentralized model we may develop prototypes of services such as the Wallet 
 PumaPay Pride etc 
 
 The long term vision of decentralization also guides our development of the SDK and 
 API both of which will allow for the flexibility the Merchants will need to efficiently 
 utilize the PumaPay ecosystem and use the Protocol to their best advantage

 PumaPay Token Economy 
 
 For a cryptocurrency to be successful over time it needs to be a core aspect of the 
 ecosystem it represents The PumaPay ecosystem will be built entirely around the 
 functionality of the PumaPay Token Our goal is to make PumaPay the de facto 
 standard for modern payments by achieving adoption backed by a powerful token 
 economy 
 
 We have carefully crafted a strategy that rests on four pillars 
 
 1 Early Adopters 
 2 Launch Partner 
 3 PumaPay Pride 
 4 Third Parties Extension Services and Products 
 Early Adopters 
 The First pillar of the PumaPay strategy promotes the adoption of the Protocol 
 by merchants that have already agreed to implement the protocol once released 
 referred to as Early Adopters 
 
 Early Adopters are prominent businesses from various industries that have already 
 committed to the PumaPay Protocol These merchants represent a significant 
 volume of processing that could be done within the PumaPay ecosystem 
 
 The Early Adopters will benefit from easy integration and receive support from 
 PumaPay when integrating the Protocol In order to encourage the usage of the 
 PumaPay Token by Early Adopters specifically we will incentivize these businesses 
 by rewarding them with PumaPay Tokens 
 
 
 Launch Partner 
 
 Whereas the Early Adopters commitment is to integrate the Protocol when released 
 and enable customers to pay with PumaPay Tokens our Launch Partner will 
 work closely with us to create a basis for decentralizing entire industries through 
 widespread adoption of the PumaPay Token This will initially be done on a wallet towallet 
 basis independent of the Protocol 
 
 We have carefully chosen the launch partner with the ability to realize PumaPays 
 potential in the field of personal skills marketplaces These marketplaces will enable 
 anyone to empower monetize services and shatter unequitable revenue allocation 
 models that exist currently 
 
 We anticipate that our Launch Partner will not only use the PumaPay Token but will 
 also be able to create a prolific marketplace where content creators and service 
 providers are rewarded a much higher revenue share than the existing status quo 
 By accepting this challenge and creating a disruptive market we expect an immense 
 shift of users content providers and service providers toward this new platform 
 Our Launch Partner may decide to airdrop PumaPay Tokens to its customers to 
 incentivize usage

 ImLive com 
 
 ImLive com serves the adult entertainment industry and through its leading 
 platform any approved service providers can offer private live shows and charge 
 customers on a pay per minute basis ImLive has agreed to create its own platform 
 where PumaPay Token is the only means of payment and service providers keep a 
 lion share of their revenue (instead of ~ 32% today) Moreover as our Protocol will 
 enable P2P payments they will receive their earnings directly immediately and riskfree 
 By creating this disruptive activity in the adult livestream industry combined 
 with substantial media promotion we believe that natural business dynamics will 
 lead the new ImLives platform to a leading position in the industry Therefore we 
 expect a huge shift of customers joining the new platform which is destined to earn 
 a significant chunk of the adult webcam industrys revenues 
 
 ImLive is a marketplace where nearly 50 000 service providers serve millions of 
 registered customers Approximately 15 000 new members join ImLives network of 
 sites every single day The ImLive affiliate network is one of the largest in its industry 
 and consists of thousands of traffic providers On top of that many websites use 
 ImLive technology either as white label platforms or by using its API 
 
 Launched more than fifteen years ago ImLive is one of the pioneers of livestream 
 platforms on the web It is highly reputable and well positioned in the adult 
 entertainment industry and will play a crucial role in demonstrating the advantages 
 and potential of PumaPay thereby encouraging more businesses to adopt PumaPay 
 and become part of its ecosystem The adult entertainment industry which has a 
 market size of tens of billions of dollars will most likely be among the first to adopt 
 the Protocol given its inherent advantages and ImLives reputation 
 
 We expect the newly ImLive based disruptive livestream platform to be fully 
 functioning by Q1 2019 
 
 The ImLive platform presents a technology that is a key factor for penetrating other 
 skill based marketplaces and facilitating the integration of the Protocol It might be 
 adapted to serve other vertical markets such as private teachers psychologists 
 personal trainers coaches and dieticians thus enabling the PumaPay token and 
 protocol to serve billions of dollars worth of transactions

 As part of the supporting systems that will be developed in order to promote the 
 adoption of the PumaPay Token we will incorporate an application as part of our 
 wallet in which only businesses that have chosen to process with the PumaPay 
 Token will appear PumaPay Pride is an example for a 3rd party extension service for 
 which we are developing a prototype 
 
 
 3rd Party Extension Services 
 The PumaPay Protocol will support a variety of extension services to enhance the 
 basic features of the protocol and enable the growth of functionality and improved 
 user experience PumaPay may choose to develop prototypes of any of such 
 services or engage 3rd parties to develop such services

 Instalment based Payments 
 
 The PumaPay PullPayment Protocol allows merchants to sell products and services 
 on an instalment basis However this puts the merchant at a potential risk of not 
 being fully paid by the customer A possible solution may include a 3rd party credit 
 company setting up a service which allows it to assume the risks associated with 
 such credit thus ensuring uninterrupted risk free commerce 
 
 To provide customers with more shopping options merchants may choose to 
 integrate with such 3rd party extension service and allow customers to pay off 
 their purchases in instalments The credit company will handle all background 
 checks on customers and manage the associated risks A possible implementation 
 may include the credit company setting up a special pull contract with scheduled 
 instalment based payments for the customer As soon as customer reviews and 
 approves the contact the first instalment will be pulled from their account and the 
 payments will continue at a predefined schedule The merchant will immediately 
 receive the full amount for the purchase from the loan company and the purchase 
 will be completed 
 
 Smart Contract Management Certification 
 
 While some PullContracts and Authorizers will be developed by PumaPay others will 
 come from third parties 
 
 The PumaPay ecosystem will allow merchants and / or developers to engage with 
 code verification companies that would verify that PullContracts and Authorizers 
 developed outside PumaPay are certified and risk free A wallet developer may opt 
 to allow only certified PullContracts or warn customers if they are approving a noncertified 
 PullContract 
 
 Arbitration Companies 
 
 While the idea of PumaPay is to make payments as easy and transparent as 
 possible it is inevitable that some disputes between merchants and consumers may 
 arise from time to time Arbitration companies will be available to solve commercial 
 disputes 
 
 To provide customers with security and reassurance merchants may add the 
 Arbitration company to their PullContract Once the purchase is made funds go into 
 an escrow smart contract for a set period of time Within this timeline the customer 
 may dispute the transaction As soon as the dispute is launched the Arbitration 
 company freezes the funds and starts the dispute resolution procedure 
 
 With the clear dispute resolution policies and transparent communication most 
 disputes are expected to be settled within the shortest timelines with the funds 
 being released to one party or split between the parties based on the decision of the 
 Arbitration company The second party will be able to dispute the decision within the 
 timelines and processes specified There will also be an option to take the case to 
 another mediator should one of the parties suspect any sort of bias in the decision 
 Merchants are likely to be charged a small fee for this kind of service 
 
 User Advanced Management Capabilities 
 
 PumaPay users will have an option to receive advanced management capabilities 
 including reminders and notifications regarding expected transactions restricted 
 transactions and any other useful information that can protect the user 
 
 Upon accessing the wallet PumaPay users will be able to set up the types and style 
 of notifications according to their preferences They will be able to either disable 
 notification in full or opt for in app messages push notifications emails or SMS 
 regarding their wallet activity including but not limited to incoming PullContracts 
 reminders for upcoming scheduled purchases notifications about connected wallet 
 activity in the restricted payment scenario incoming funds from split payments etc

 PullPayment Protocol 
 
 The PumaPay Protocol is meant to be a flexible payment 
 protocol that encourages outside input and development 
 This motivation inspired the modular architecture of the 
 Protocol Although the Protocol will come with built in 
 modules we encourage the involvement of the community 
 in its development The core functionality of the PumaPay 
 Protocol will be contained in its on chain architecture 
 which is designed to be flexible and evolve with the needs 
 of the community

 Platform Components 
 
 On chain Components 
 
 PumaPay will initially be introduced on the Ethereum network but intends to utilize 
 other networks to develop its token on in the future The PumaPay solution will be 
 composed of several unique smart contract components that come together to 
 create the flexible PullPayment protocol 
 
 PumaPay Token Contract 
 
 The PumaPay Token Contract will be the smart contract that mediates and stores 
 the ownership of PumaPay Tokens among accounts It is a modified version of the 
 ERC20 token contract that adds flexibility to its payment and transfer protocol 
 
 The PumaPay Token Contract will be the ledger used by PumaPay to keep track of 
 the balances associated with each address as well as keeping track of PullContracts 
 and Limiters associated with the Accounts This is done by mapping all of the 
 addresses to another mapping of their respective PullContracts Also it will include a 
 mapping between these PullContracts with their respective Limiters It is important 
 to note that the Token Contract will be managing 
 
 
 Approvals of PullContracts 
 
 Adding Limiters to Accounts 
 
 Executing PullContracts 
 PumaPay Token (PMA) 
 
 The tokens will be the basis for the Protocols ecosystem 
 
 The PumaPay Token is the payment mechanism for merchants adopting PumaPay 
 Protocol It will initially be built using the ERC20 standard interface but will extend 
 the money transfer process so that advanced payment methods can be utilized The 
 PumaPay Token is designed to differ from current cryptocurrencies because it will 
 allow comprehensive all in one billing mechanisms to be implemented in a simple 
 and flexible way 
 
 Account 
 
 The Account will be implemented as a public address that is used to track the 
 balance of PumaPay Token PullContracts and Limiters associated with that 
 address The balance PullContracts and Limiters are found on the Token Contract 
 described above 
 
 Authorizers 
 
 Authorizers will operate as modular components that set up a condition to determine 
 whether a PullContract should be able to pull or request money from an account 
 One simple example of an Authorizer would be a condition that states a PullRequest 
 can only be executed if it has been at least 30 days since the last one It is important to 
 note that authorizers can be chained together in PullContracts to make PullContract 
 development easier for merchants and to allow the easy reuse of code 
 
 PullContracts 
 
 PullContracts will be smart contracts that represent a payment relationship between 
 Accounts and facilitate the transfer of tokens between them PullContracts are 
 designed with flexibility and can be implemented to allow many different payment 
 mechanisms and features These contracts allow merchants to develop their own 
 billing methodologies through the Contract present them to the user authenticate 
 transactions before execution and transmit it for execution on the blockchain 
 
 While PullContracts can be created with original code they can be built modularly 
 from a pre existing set of Authorizers This enables the chaining together of different 
 functionalities into one contract Authorizers can be vetted and are less likely to 
 include security issues in their implementation PullContracts can be created and 
 deployed with a variety of parameters Any deployment of a PullContract will include 
 a hash of these parameters and these will be checked when a pull request is made 
 to ensure the hash of the pre defined parameters matches that of the pull request

 Limiters 
 
 The Limiter is an on chain component that an account user can add in order to set 
 various quantitative limitations on that Account 
 
 Off chain Components 
 
 There are several off chain components to help with adoption and usability of the 
 PumaPay Protocol and ensure that there is an excellent user interface and an outlet 
 for developers to build on the PumaPay Protocol This section covers anything that 
 is not going to be on the blockchain 
 
 PumaPay Wallet 
 
 A dashboard into the Account used to view Account details as well as to connect/ 
 disconnect PullContracts and other contracts The wallet is the holder of the users 
 private key as through it the user executes actions on the blockchain 
 
 The PumaPay Wallet will facilitate payment interactions between Accounts 
 These interactions consist of PullRequests submitting PullContracts approving 
 PullContracts showing pending and previous transactions and displaying the 
 accounts balance We are developing two versions of the Wallet 
 
 
 A mobile application We will first develop an Android app followed by a version 
 for iOS See our development roadmap for more details 
 
 Chrome based application something conceptually akin to Metamask 
 PumaPay SDK 
 
 The PumaPay Protocol SDK (Software Development Kit) is an off chain set of 
 tools aimed at facilitating and expanding the Protocol adoption by merchants The 
 PumaPay SDK is meant to provide developers the tools they need to fully leverage 
 the Protocol It will also provide any interested third party with the ability to build 
 additional business solutions based on the Protocols abilities (such as insurance 
 code review credit billing services product delivery etc ) 
 
 The PumaPay SDK will contain many different components and features including 
 
 1 Utilities and code samples for merchants to interact with the blockchain 
 2 A repository of pre signed and pre vetted Authorizers to be used in PullContracts 
 3 Data Transparency and easy access Providing transparency by seeing the 
 results of transactions to enable the creation of complementary products 
 and services to receive raw data enabling them to create aggregated reports 
 related to transaction volume per period and/or product 
 PumaPay Server & API 
 
 The initial version of the PumaPay architecture which we are currently working on 
 is relatively centralised and relies on the PumaPay Server To start using PumaPay 
 and accepting PMAs as a means of payment the merchant would need to register 
 through the PumaPay Server to receive an API key In turn the PumaPay Server 
 would communicate with the merchants SDK where the rules for the transaction 
 would be set These rules would then translate into a PullRequest targeting the 
 clients wallet To be able to access the details of the PullContract available in the 
 wallet the client would need to scan a QR code generated by the merchant If the 
 information contained in the PullContract is compliant with the parameters set in the 
 clients wallet he or she then digitally signs it off and the data is automatically sent 
 to the PumaPay Server The PumaPay Server would authenticate the transaction 
 which would then be published on the Blockchain Ultimately the PullTransaction 
 would take the form of a Smart Contract on the Blockchain network 
 
 In the next iterations PumaPay is aiming to evolve into a truly decentralised payment 
 system

 The Ultimate Goal 
 
 Envisioned as a fully decentralized model in the long run PumaPay will be relying 
 on an improved architecture setup in the future As a likely implementation we are 
 looking into ways to enhance our current architecture by delivering a lightweight 
 authentication server which may be encapsulated in the merchant SDK and 
 authenticates with the clients wallet SDK and manages the pull services Hence this 
 will allow the Wallet API to directly connect to the blockchain network allowing for a 
 fully decentralized model in line with PumaPays long term vision 
 
 Implementation Considerations 
 
 As with all platforms and protocols there are implementation considerations for the 
 PumaPay Protocol It is important to note that not all of the implementation and 
 security considerations that are mentioned will be dealt with by the Protocol itself 
 as the Protocol is meant to be as open as possible Nevertheless it is important to 
 recognize the limitations and considerations to be accounted for 
 
 Fees due to having too many Limiters do not impact customer 
 
 There is nothing that prevents a customer from putting up an unreasonable amount 
 of Limiters for a single Wallet because the merchant is paying the fees to send the 
 PullRequest This could be fixed by plug ins that limit the number of Limiters or that 
 charge customers for a portion of the fees of the transaction 
 
 Lack of Flexibility with the Implementation of PumaPay Protocol 
 
 It is to be noted that because the implementation of the PumaPay Protocol will rest 
 on the Token Contract making changes could be made difficult PumaPay deals with 
 a portion of this issue by creating massive flexibility in PullContracts and in Limiters 
 This flexibility in these contracts is designed to reduce the technical strain on the 
 Token Contract and to place the evolution of the Protocol alongside the evolution of 
 the PullContracts and Limiters 
 
 Contract Certification 
 
 As a possible way of illustrating the security of the PullContracts linked to a wallet 
 these contracts may be assigned a trust score based on multiple criteria such as 
 the entity certifying the contract the amounts the authorizers used the number of 
 users subscribed and a trust score of the merchant if available The wallet could use 
 simple signaling to express the trust score to the user such as 
 
 
 Green trust >=75 
 
 Yellow 45 >= trust > 75 
 
 Red trust < 45 
 Potentially the wallet could be configured to block all transactions below a certain 
 trust score This is one of the few possible implementations that could demonstrate 
 the certification of contracts within the wallet

 PumaPay On chain 
 
 PumaPay will be introduced on the Ethereum network which is the current standard 
 for decentralized software platforms for distributed applications However PumaPay 
 has the capability to migrate to a next generation distributed contract network to 
 meet performance scale and increased on chain confidentiality requirements 
 Potential dependencies for scaling the PumaPay Protocol are listed below 
 
 Orbs 
 
 A good potential path toward scalability is through the Orbs a blockchain designed 
 with consumer applications in mind Orbs offers a highly scalable decentralized 
 ledger at minuscule per transaction costs and guaranteed SLA 
 
 EOS 
 
 EOS is a proposed blockchain implementation based on fast Delegated Proof of 
 Stake consensus and a high performance smart contract engine (VM) EOS provides 
 high transaction volumes without transaction fees 
 
 Credits 
 
 Credits is another option we are looking into when it comes to flexibility optimized 
 functionality and further development of the PullProtocol given its expected highvolume 
 transaction capacity and fast execution speed 
 
 Other options PumaPay developers are exploring include Stellar and Cardano As we 
 define the best solution to meet the needs of PumaPay in the long run we may opt 
 to combine several blockchain solutions (e g one for transactions and another one 
 for the token) 
 
 Stage of Development 
 
 PumaPay has entered the stage of active development We have working prototypes 
 of Smart Contracts that outline the architecture The team is currently testing the 
 Recurring Payments Smart Contract and improving upon its design 
 
 The Token Smart Contract has already been audited by a third party provider 
 (SmartDec) who have confirmed its compliance with all required standards 
 
 In terms of relevant technology we have completed the Version 1 0 of the Wallet 
 which is currently in testing The team is also developing the API and SDK that will 
 allow for an easy integration with multiple merchants We are also working on the 
 prototype of the PumaPay Pride Once PumaPay components pass security audit 
 and their smooth functionality is confirmed they will be added to the projects Github 
 repository https //github com/pumapayio

 PumaPay PullPayment Protocol 
 Use Cases 
 
 One of the cornerstones of the PumaPay Protocol should be its flexibility The 
 Protocol is being intentionally developed as a modular implementation to enable 
 merchants and customers the ability to use a wide variety of billing mechanisms 
 to meet their specific needs As a result there can be different implementations 
 of Limiters and PullContracts as well as different implementations of the Account 
 Below are a series of features designed to illustrate the potential use cases of the 
 PumaPay Protocol 
 
 Note the following use cases are merely examples and the Protocol is being 
 designed to address a wide range of options that merchants will be able to define for 
 themselves The fact that we have chosen to mention a certain use case does not 
 necessarily mean we will develop the solutions it illustrates Merchants will have the 
 ability to use the protocol as is modify it according to their needs or develop their 
 own solutions based on it

 Use Case My First Wallet 
 
 Timmy is a young boy that is starting elementary school and his Mom wants to give him money for lunch 
 but she doesnt want him to spend it on sweets Through the use of 3rd party Limiters PumaPay could allow 
 his mother to oversee his connected wallet activity and ensure that Timmys money is spent responsibly 
 Every time Timmy tries to make a purchase his request shall be submitted to his mothers wallet and will be 
 approved if the transaction fits certain predetermined parameters set by his Mom or disapproved if it does 
 not When Timmy attempts to make a purchase he will get a frowny face if the payment is not approved or 
 a smiley face if it is approved In this use case Timmys mom chose to approve transactions manually for 
 every purchase through the use of 3rd party messaging service to her device This real time messaging is not 
 
 part of the protocol and is done off chain Alternatively Timmys mom could have chosen to set parameters 
 for automatic approval or rejection of transactions (for example based on product category) effectively and 
 efficiently enforcing parental control on Timmys purchases even when his mom is not available 
 
 It is important to note that this is a simple use case and additional limitations can be placed to constrain the 
 velocity of transactions business type and much more 
 
 Additionally there can be numerous other implementations but these two elaborate both an active and passive 
 restriction by Timmys Mom at the point of purchase

 Use Case Affiliate Marketing for Dummies 
 
 David has a moderately successful online store and he wishes to expand He knows the power of affiliate 
 marketing and wants to utilize it Since he does not have the resources to build a reputable affiliate network 
 it will be very hard for affiliates to trust that he will pay them commission and do so in a timely manner If he 
 submits his offer to an existing affiliate network it will cost him unnecessary intermediary fees With PumaPay

 Once a customer origintaing from an affiliate 
 traffic chooses to make a purchase she is 
 presented with a PullContract In this case it is a 
 SinglePayment PullContract Upon acceptance 
 
 the PullContract pulls funds from the customers 
 wallet and split it 65% 35% between David and 
 
 the affiliates wallets respectively 
 
 
 David can create a PullContract to charge his customers and chain it to a Split Payment contract that will 
 automatically split the revenues from each purchase between his account and the affiliates This ensures that 
 both the affiliate and David will immediately get their share of every purchase without any risk thus solving the 
 trust issue

 The PumaPay Token 
 
 The PumaPay Token (symbol PMA) is the facilitator of the protocols unique 
 PullPayment functionality It is the only means of value transfer between parties over 
 the protocol and can be converted to/from any other cryptocurrency or fiat 
 
 The token will initially be developed as an ERC20 compatible token over the public 
 Ethereum blockchain (PMA V1 0) This will facilitate the TGE as well as the initial 
 usage of the token as a means of payment on our Launch Partners platforms from 
 day one 
 
 To ensure the long term scalability of the project and to meet potential needs of 
 the community we may decide to migrate the PMA token by either upgrading it or 
 moving to another blockchain In case of migration a formal announcement will be 
 released on our website and through our official Telegram channel PMA holders 
 will have the ability to convert their V1 0 token to the new version In case of such a 
 migration all necessary guidance and tools will be provided in our Github repository 
 
 The final and total supply of tokens will be issued in the TGE and there will be no 
 future addition to this amount

 Token Generation Event 
 
 In order to facilitate the development of our Protocol and PMA Token and to 
 encourage adoption we are pre selling PMA tokens to qualified individuals and 
 companies who wish to contribute to the project Due to prevailing regulatory 
 conditions we will not conduct an open Crowd Sale Participation in the Pre Sale is 
 limited to accredited/qualified/exempt investors (as defined by law) and subject to 
 the companys KYC and AML policies The minimum amount accepted during the 
 Pre Sale is 50 000 USD Contributions are accepted in ETH BTC USD and EUR 
 
 Private Sale Contributors will be eligible to receive 50 000 PMA / ETH 
 
 Private Sale of PMA tokens will end on May 7th 2018 at 12 00 am (UTC) Thereafter 
 we will generate the Tokens 
 
 The total and final amount of PMA tokens that will be generated during the TGE will 
 be calculated in such a way that the total amount of tokens sold during the Private 
 Sale will represent 20% of the total amount generated pro rata according to the total 
 amount raised and our hard cap of 150M USD (e g if our Private Sale generates 75M 
 USD the tokens issued will represent 10% of the total number of tokens generated) 
 
 Altcoins Contributions 
 
 The company may also consider accepting contributions in certain other 
 cryptocurrencies (Altcoins) Contributors in Altcoins will be entitled to receive 40 000 
 PMA / ETH equivalent of the relevant Altcoin The Altcoin/ETH exchange rate will be 
 calculated within 24 hours from the moment the contribution will be received by the 
 company and according to the exchange rate that will be cited at coinmarketcap 
 com 
 
 Altcoin contributions are subject to pre approval by the company Please contact us 
 via our Telegram group or by email to info@pumapay io 
 
 Special Contribution Scheme 
 
 Contributors may choose to place their contribution in a special elective 
 refund scheme Contributors choosing this option will have a period of sixty (60) 
 days after the TGE to either claim their tokens (partially or in full) or refund their 
 contribution (partially or in full) During this period the tokens issued against the 
 contribution will be locked in the smart contract In case Contributors choose to 
 claim the tokens contribution will be transferred to the companys wallet and the 
 tokens will be released to the Contributor In case the Contributor opts for a refund 
 their contribution will be automatically sent back to them while the tokens issued will 
 be transferred to the companys reserve 
 
 Contributors who choose to place their contribution in this special elective refund 
 scheme will be eligible to a lower rate of 42 000 PMA / ETH (for contributions in fiat 
 BTC and ETH) or 35 000 PMA / ETH (for contributions in Altcoins) 
 
 TGE Results 
 
 Private Sale of PMA tokens ended on May 7 2018 at 12 00 am (UTC) with the total 
 funds raised equalling $117 019 041

 * If a certain allocation category exceeds its above threshold (%) of total PumaPay Tokens the surplus will be 
 taken from the companys share of allocated PumaPay Tokens and vice versa 
 ** In case the amount we have raised exceeds the Hard Cap due to exchange rates fluctuation the actual 
 percentage allocated to the public will exceed 20% and will be balanced with the companys allocation 
 
 Public contributors 
 
 Launch Partners 
 and Early Adopters 
 
 Use of proceeds 
 
 Approximately 30% of the proceeds are used to cover the TGE costs pay various 
 advisors and service providers motivate founders and team members and repay 
 debt The lions share of the amount we have raised shall be dedicated for the delivery 
 of the protocol including development operational costs business development etc 
 Approximately 3% of the proceeds should be kept as a liquidity pool for the company

 Token Sale Risks 
 
 
 There is no prior market for Tokens and the Token Sale may not result in an 
 active or liquid market for the Tokens 
 
 Future sales of the Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price 
 of Tokens 
 
 Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Tokens 
 
 There is no assurance of any success of the Companys business platform or 
 any future Token functionality 
 
 The market price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Sale 
 
 The private keys to the escrow wallet may be compromised and the 
 cryptocurrencies may not be able to be disbursed 
 
 The Token may be significantly influenced by cryptocurrencies market trends 
 and Token value may be severely depreciated due to non PMA related events in 
 the cryptocurrencies markets 
 
 The use of the Tokens may come under the scrutiny of governmental institutions 
 
 The ownership of Tokens may fall under new and unpredicted taxation laws that 
 will erode Tokens benefits 
 
 There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Tokens 
 
 Applicable laws and regulations may limit the utility functionality the accessibility 
 and transferability of the Tokens 
 
 Crowd sales have been known to come under malicious attacks from hackers 
 and/or other parties resulting in the theft of tokens Such events may inflict 
 massive losses on buyers and the company 
 
 The Company may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively 
 manage its operations as its business develops and evolves which would have 
 a direct impact on its ability to maintain or operate the Companys business 
 platform and/or develop structure and/or license any future Token functionality 
 
 The Company may experience system failures unplanned interruptions in its 
 network or services hardware or software defects security breaches or other 
 causes that could adversely affect the Companys infrastructure network and/ 
 or the Companys business platform 
 
 The Company may in the future be dependent in part on the location and data 
 center facilities of third parties 
 
 General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on 
 the Companys operating performance results of operations and/or cash flows 
 
 The Company or the Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations 
 
 The Company may not be able to pay any anticipated rewards in the future
