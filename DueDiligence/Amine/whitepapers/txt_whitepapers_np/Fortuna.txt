 The majority of the
 The majority of the derivatives are derivatives are designed for the majority of the designed for the majority of the participantsparticipants However many investors need some derivatives onHowever many investors need some derivatives on smaller granularity level to manage smaller granularity level to manage their risk more precise and more specificallytheir risk more precise and more specifically For example S&P 500 index futures are For example S&P 500 index futures are good for majority of the investors but there are still a lot of demandgood for majority of the investors but there are still a lot of demand on makingon making S&P S&P 500 a smaller index 500 a smaller index so so that that investors can take more targeted hedging strategyinvestors can take more targeted hedging strategy to manage to manage the risk of their portfoliosthe risk of their portfolios 
 Furthermore the factors that can affect the price of underlying assets are abundant
 Furthermore the factors that can affect the price of underlying assets are abundant and investors may have more precise and investors may have more precise prediction and analysis on these single factor rather prediction and analysis on these single factor rather than the price of the underlying assetthan the price of the underlying asset For example a company occupied For example a company occupied in international in international tradtrade between China and America Te between China and America The CEO of the company predicthe CEO of the company predicteded that Trump that Trump would be the presidentwould be the president of U S of U S and hand he believee believed that the result couldd that the result could affect the foreign affect the foreign exchange rateexchange ratess and the international trades However the only way he couldand the international trades However the only way he could manage the manage the risk in trisk in the finical market is to trade foreign exchangehe finical market is to trade foreign exchange derivativederivativess to hedge the riskto hedge the risk but but there are some problems withere are some problems with this way th this way 
 First of all t
 First of all the reaction chain is too long Take the international trade company as he reaction chain is too long Take the international trade company as an example the result of the presidential election an example the result of the presidential election can can determine whether Trump has the determine whether Trump has the right to name a new chairman of Fright to name a new chairman of Fed The new chairman of Fed caned The new chairman of Fed can affeaffect the monetary ct the monetary

 Second other than the presidential election there are too many factors affecting
 Second other than the presidential election there are too many factors affecting the foreign exchange the foreign exchange which means even if the CEO predictwhich means even if the CEO predictss the election result correctly the election result correctly he may not benefit from the he may not benefit from the derivatives derivatives tradingtrading in the financial marketin the financial market 
 Third 
 Third the presidential election will not only affect the foreign exchange but also the presidential election will not only affect the foreign exchange but also the the tariff policy and other potariff policy and other policies that will affect the international tradelicies that will affect the international tradess between China between China and Aand America The CEO can trade the foreign exchangemerica The CEO can trade the foreign exchange derivativederivatives s to hedge the risk for to hedge the risk for the assets accumulated in history However there is no vethe assets accumulated in history However there is no vehicles in traditional hicles in traditional market for market for him to hedge the risk of the whole business him to hedge the risk of the whole business of international trades of international trades in the future in the future 
 As for the three problems described above Fortuna support
 As for the three problems described above Fortuna supportss new typenew typess of of derivativederivatives s on on a a smaller granularity level which can enable investors or hedgers to tradesmaller granularity level which can enable investors or hedgers to trade derivatives on single factor derivatives on single factor such as the monetary policy tariff policy presidential such as the monetary policy tariff policy presidential election etc New type of derivatives on election etc New type of derivatives on a a smaller granularity level will be a new way smaller granularity level will be a new way for investors to for investors to hedge the risk more precisely hedge the risk more precisely

 Traditional
 Traditional derivatives markets are notderivatives markets are not friendly to friendly to many investors for two reasons many investors for two reasons as follows as follows 
 F
 First of all hirst of all high threshold of financial knowledge igh threshold of financial knowledge The majThe majority of investors are ority of investors are not not familiar with the derivatives market because of the familiar with the derivatives market because of the complex deal structurecomplex deal structures and s and professional terms However the demand for risk management shows everywhere for professional terms However the demand for risk management shows everywhere for every investevery investor even if they don’t realize andor even if they don’t realize and being blocked by the high threshold of being blocked by the high threshold of financial knowledgfinancial knowledge e 
 Second 
 Second hhigh requirement of initial igh requirement of initial depodepositsit Take the stock index futures of China Take the stock index futures of China as an example the initial account deposit requirement is 500as an example the initial account deposit requirement is 500 000 RMB 000 RMB which turnwhich turns out s out to be a to be a high requirement for the majority of investors in China high requirement for the majority of investors in China Although a high Although a high requirement of initial deposit is an effectiverequirement of initial deposit is an effective way to protect the investors by blocking way to protect the investors by blocking them out there will be another way to protect the investors while enabling them to utilize them out there will be another way to protect the investors while enabling them to utilize the derivatives to hedge their risk the derivatives to hedge their risk 
 As for the higher threshold of financial knowledge and initial deposit Fortuna
 As for the higher threshold of financial knowledge and initial deposit Fortuna supposupports more friendly vehicles for risk management through lowering the requirement rts more friendly vehicles for risk management through lowering the requirement of initial deposit simplifying the deal structure standardizing contract clauses of initial deposit simplifying the deal structure standardizing contract clauses introducing new asset class and otheintroducing new asset class and other effective means Fortuna canr effective means Fortuna can make more and more make more and more investinvestors know and get used to hedging for risk management ors know and get used to hedging for risk management
