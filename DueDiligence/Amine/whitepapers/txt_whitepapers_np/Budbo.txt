Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Letter Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s journey has taken many paths touched many lives and connected a great number of people Since you are reading this you are now a part of that journey Thank you for your time and consideration Budbo began as a simple idea we wished to connect patients and users with the highest quality locally available cannabis products Yet within this simple mission we realized we had created something much more extraordinary a platform on which dispensaries manufacturers and growers can get the most accurate data possible on patient and user preferences A synergy was born We quickly noticed a direct correlation between the number of patients using the application and the diversity of the local product offering around them In short the more patients exploring products and finding flower through the application the better and more targeted information our network of growers manufacturers and dispensaries would receive through the Budbo dashboard Allowing them to make spot on forecasting decisions when it comes to product trends whether that be which products to buy and stock their shelves with which strains to grow and cultivate or which concentrates or edibles to manufacture and distribute Budbo bridged the gaps between patient dispensary manufacturer and grower Business was good and to accommodate our growing cannabis network we expanded our product offering to include real time GPS tracking of cannabis shipments Our current network consists of roughly 75 000 users and patients 2 000+ dispensaries 500+ product manufacturers and 50+ grow operations Growing into a worldwide network has been a challenging but steady climb Now we elevate our offering even further by utilizing the immutable ledger of blockchain and the tokenization of our platform Imagine if you will the entire cannabis industry as a decentralized autonomous organization Where a patient\xe2\x80\x99s identification and medication regimen are encrypted and safely stored within the ledger of a blockchain Where a smart contract enables the safe transfer of goods through verifiable proof of pick up bill of lading and proof of delivery Medical testing of cannabis potency is verified and immutable as the product is moved from lab to dispensary The community at large is a selfgoverning group of activists patients physicians developers artists and enthusiasts all working towards the common goal of improving the cannabis industry through contributing votes time engineering and knowledge to the decentralized applications and network of Budbo

WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 27 Market Context Seed to Sale is an umbrella term used in the cannabis industry to refer to software and services that help businesses track and manage inventory\xe2\x80\x94from planting and growing all the way through processing product shipping and finally to transactions at the PoS in dispensaries Seed tosale systems help cannabis businesses keep track of assets and sales as well as get in touch with consumers and manage the complex hurdles of state by state legal regulations and compliance As the recreational marijuana sector moves from the black market to the retail market the demand for cannabis looks more and more lucrative with consumers who \xe2\x80\xa2 Use cannabis but less than once per month 11 6 million occasional users \xe2\x80\xa2 Use between one and 20 times per month 11 1 million regular users \xe2\x80\xa2 Use more than 20 times per month 7 1 million heavy users The 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health statistics from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that 29 7 million Americans 12 or older had used cannabis within the past year Of those 18 1 million consumed cannabis within the past month For our purposes let\xe2\x80\x99s assume the people who smoked within the past month are regular users and the rest are occasional users This means that in 2017 about 11 6 million are smoking at least once a month and 6 5 million people are using marijuana less than once a month The report also estimates that 7 1 million people 12 or older are using marijuana more than 20 times per month It\xe2\x80\x99s important to draw these lines when it comes to usage because it makes a difference when it comes to estimating how frequently people buy marijuana Because we\xe2\x80\x99re estimating the number of full time marijuana dealers we only want to look at regular and heavy smokers Let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that people who use pot less than once per month probably get it from friends For the next step we use data from a study performed by RAND Corp which focuses on the reasonable frequency of users who buy their products from a professional marijuana dealer including dispensaries This means that 11 1 million people are buying cannabis once a month and 7 1 million people are buying twice a month This comes out to 29 2 million professional marijuana transactions per month in the United States If we assume that a standard marijuana dispensary is open eight hours a day every day and makes one transaction per hour that comes out to about 240 sales per month per dispensary WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 28 With 29 2 million marijuana transactions per month and 240 transactions per dealer 121 600 dispensaries are needed to satisfy demand This seems surprisingly reasonable That\xe2\x80\x99s a little less than the number of family physicians in 2011 around regulatory restrictions Budbo centers on There are already a couple of big players in the seed to sale space Weed tech startups such as Flowhub are competing with pharmaceutical incumbents including BioTrackTHC and MJ Freeway for state by state government compliance contracts Others such as KIND Financial have gotten tech giants involved hosting their Agrisoft seed to sale platform on Microsoft Azure sale systems with Budbo as the middleman that But while other blockchain startups focus predominantly on helping businesses work transactions will be instant and secured with the consumer business relationship within the cannabis industry Budbo gives users full control over their blockchain based transaction history that\xe2\x80\x99s linked to local dispensaries and seed tofacilitates the connection As an enterprise level solution

industry Budbo Token state of the art cryptography WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 29 Government Regulations Marijuana\xe2\x80\x99s status as a Schedule 1 drug means state marijuana operations are federally regulated as illegal enterprises Despite the obstacles legal marijuana has managed to go mainstream on a state bystate basis transforming the way Americans view and use cannabis Federal regulation on the legality of transport sale and distribution of cannabis creates major obstacles for companies to establish manage and grow their business The lack of a fast reliable and readily available payment method contributes to the multitude of issues businesses face making it difficult to attract and retain customers The adoption of blockchain technology is the soundest solution to solving the fragmentation of the cannabis market and the marginalization of businesses and consumers By integrating smart contracts and blockchain into its working model Budbo targets the very basis of every digital transaction exchange of value goods and services and private data A host of economic legal regulatory and technological hurdles must be scaled before we see widespread adoption of blockchain technology in the cannabis market but first movers are making incredible strides The Budbo blockchain gives government agencies the solution for economic legal

events or circumstances which adversely affect Budbo Inc or any of its successor operating entities (collectively referred to herein as \xe2\x80\x9cBudbo Inc \xe2\x80\x9d) may have a corresponding adverse effect on WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 51 the Budbo platform and any future business line including but not limited to structuring and launch of the Budbo Token future business lines Such adverse effects would correspondingly have an impact on the utility liquidity and the trading price of the Budbo Tokens Budbo Inc may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively manage its operations as its business develops and evolves which would have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the Budbo platform and/ or launch any future business lines The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the legal cannabis markets in which Budbo Inc competes have grown rapidly over the past four years and continue to evolve in response to new technological advances changing business models shifting regulations and other factors As a result of this constantly changing environment Budbo Inc may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes and the sustainability of Budbo Inc will depend on its ability to manage its operations ensure that it hires qualified and competent employees and provides proper training for its personnel As its business evolves Budbo Inc must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s business relies on its blockchain based software systems cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms blockchain technology and smart contract technology and efficient real estate management All of these systems tools and skillsets represent complex costly and rapidly changing technical infrastructure In order to demonstrate continued ability to effectively manage technical support infrastructure for the Budbo platform Budbo Inc will need to continue to upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational systems procedures and controls These upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that Budbo Inc does not control If Budbo Inc is unable to adapt its systems and organization in a timely efficient and cost effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected If the third parties whom Budbo Inc

These companies may have more personnel talent economic resources and manufacturing relationships needed to develop a competitive product Many of these manufacturers also have well recognized brand names and established distribution and retail relationships that could enable them to successfully market and sell a competitive product The advantage they will have because of their scale and distribution network could be difficult for us to overcome As a result it is possible that our product could be forced out of the market by larger more established players Budbo Inc may experience system failures unplanned interruptions in its network or services hardware or software defects security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure

\xe2\x80\x99s network or services which would include the Budbo platform and if successfully structured licensed and launched the Budbo Token future business lines could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters equipment breakdown network connectivity downtime power losses or even intentional disruptions of its services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users some of which are beyond Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s control Although Budbo Inc has taken steps against malicious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure which are critical for the maintenance of the Budbo platform there can be no assurance that cyber attacks such as distributed denials of service will not be attempted in the future that Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s enhanced security measures will be effective Budbo Inc may be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology financial data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to Budbo Inc and/or holders of the Budbo Tokens Any significant breach of Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability stability and security of the Budbo platform may adversely affect the utility liquidity and/or trading price of the Budbo Tokens We are dependent in part on the location and data center facilities of third parties Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s current infrastructure network is in part established through servers which it owns and houses at the location facilities of third parties and servers that it rents at data center facilities of third parties If Budbo Inc is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all Budbo Inc may be required to transfer its servers to a new data center facility and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with the relocation These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from among others natural disasters arson terrorist attacks power losses and telecommunication failures Additionally the third party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of third party action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and a third party may obtain unauthorized access to the data in such servers Inc and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on Budbo Token\xe2\x80\x99s operating performance results of operations and cash flows Budbo Inc has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect on Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s business operations and financial condition including decreases in revenue WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 54 and operating cash flows and inability to attract future equity and/or debt financing on commercially reasonable terms Additionally in a down cycle economic environment Budbo Inc may experience the negative effects of a slowdown in usage of the Budbo platform and may delay or cancel the structuring licensing and launch of the anticipated Budbo Token future business lines Suppliers on which Budbo Inc relies for servers bandwidth location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s operations or expenses There can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on Budbo Inc \xe2\x80\x99s business financial condition and results of operations and hence the Budbo platform and/or ability to structure license and launch the Budbo Token future business lines Any such circumstances would then correspondingly negatively impact the utility liquidity and/or trading price of the Budbo Tokens The Company Budbo Inc or the Budbo Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations Cryptocurrency trading is generally unregulated worldwide but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency markets Furthermore while the US experiences a liberalization of cannabis regulations at the state level cannabis remains illegal at the federal level The Company or the Budbo Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency markets and/or legal cannabis industry including having to take measures to comply with such regulations or having to deal with queries notices requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities which may come at a substantial cost and may also require substantial modifications to the Budbo platform and/or the anticipated Budbo Token future business lines This may impact the appeal of the Budbo platform and the anticipated Budbo Token future business lines for users and result in decreased usage of the Budbo platform and the Budbo Tokens Further should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold maintaining the Budbo platform and structuring licensing and launching the Budbo Token future business lines may no longer be commercially viable and the Company or Budbo Inc may opt to discontinue the Budbo platform the anticipated Budbo Token future business lines and/or the Budbo Tokens Further it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications including the Budbo platform the anticipated Budbo Token future business lines and the Budbo Tokens WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 55 The Company or Budbo Inc may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or make it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction In scenarios such as the foregoing the utility liquidity and/or trading price of Budbo Tokens will be adversely affected or Budbo Tokens may cease to be traded Cryptographic tokens such as the Budbo Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology In addition to the risks included in the above discussion of risk factors there are other risks associated with your purchase holding and use of the Budbo Tokens including those that the Company and Budbo Inc cannot anticipate Such risks may further appear as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above 4 Risks relating to the U S federal laws affecting the legal cannabis industry Certain activities involving marijuana remain illegal under US federal laws Such activities include but are not limited to (i) distribution of marijuana to minors (ii) transporting marijuana from states where it is legal to other states (iii) drugged driving and other adverse public health consequences (iv) growing marijuana on public lands (v) marijuana possession or use on federal property and (vi) other criminal activity or violence associated with the sale of marijuana To the extent the Company and/or Budbo Inc may not prevent certain of its users from using Budbo Tokens in violation of U S federal law it may subject the Company and/or Budbo Token Inc to civil and/or criminal liability and the utility liquidity and/or trading price of Budbo Tokens will be adversely affected or Budbo Tokens may cease to be traded Trump Administration\xe2\x80\x99s May Strictly Enforce Federal Law Criminalizing Cannabis Cannabis is a categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance by the DEA and the U S Department of Justice and is illegal to grow possess and consume under federal law Even in those jurisdictions in which the use of medical cannabis has been legalized at the state level its use remains a violation of federal law The U S Supreme Court has ruled in United States v Oakland Cannabis Buyers\xe2\x80\x99 Coop and Gonzales v Raich that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis even for medical purposes WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 56 Therefore federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use for medicinal or adult retail purposes Strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s inability to proceed with its business plan The previous Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis In furtherance thereof on August 29 2013 the Department of Justice provided guidance to all U S federal prosecutors with respect to the enforcement of laws regarding cannabis via the publication of a memorandum authored by former US Attorney General James M Cole (the \xe2\x80\x9cCole Memo\xe2\x80\x9d) The Cole Memo stated that enforcement should be focused on eight priorities which is to prevent (1) distribution of cannabis to minors (2) revenue from sale of cannabis to criminal enterprises gangs and cartels (3) transfer of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is illegal (4) cannabis activity from being a pretext for trafficking of other illegal drugs or illegal activity (5) violence of use of firearms in cannabis growth and distribution (6) drugged driving and adverse public health consequences from cannabis use (7) growth of cannabis on federal lands and (8) cannabis possession or use on federal property On January 4 2018 the U S Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo and restored the \xe2\x80\x9crule of law \xe2\x80\x9d Such rescission essentially shifts federal policy from the hands off approach adopted under the Obama administration to allowing federal prosecutors across the U S to decide individually how to prioritize resources to crack down on pot possession distribution and cultivation of the drug in states where it is legal Furthermore the Trump administration has previously indicated that it will pursue the enforcement of federal cannabis laws While Budbo is a tech cannabis company and does not believe its activities involve those enumerated in the Cole Memo in light of the rescission of the memo by the current Attorney General federal prosecutors will now have significant discretion on their interpretation of these priorities and no assurances can be given that federal prosecutors will agree with Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s position Budbo therefore cannot provide assurance that its actions are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other state or federal laws or regulations In addition there is no guarantee that the current administration will not further change its policy regarding the strict enforcement of federal laws or the eight listed priorities Additionally any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws even stronger Any such change in the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to Budbo WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 57 Some of Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s business activities and the business activities of some of its users while believed to be compliant with applicable state law are illegal under federal law because they violate the Federal Controlled Substances Act If Budbo or its users are closed by law enforcement authorities it will materially and adversely affect Budbo\xe2\x80\x99 business As of July 19 2017 29 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing some degree of medical use of cannabis while four of those states and the District of Columbia have also legalized the adult use of cannabis However under U S federal law and more specifically the Federal Controlled Substances Act the possession use cultivation marketing and transfer of cannabis is illegal The federal and in some cases state law enforcement authorities have frequently closed down dispensaries and investigated and/or closed physician offices that provide medicinal cannabis recommendations To the extent that Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s dispensary users are closed it will negatively affect Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s operations and revenue and to the extent that it prevents or discourages other similar businesses from entering the cannabis industry Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s potential user base would contract leading to a material negative affect on Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s business and operations The cannabis industry faces strong opposition It is believed by many that large well funded businesses may have a strong economic opposition to the cannabis industry Budbo believes that the pharmaceutical industry does not want to cede control of any product that could generate significant revenue For example medical cannabis will likely adversely impact the existing market for medicines sold by mainstream pharmaceutical companies that contain active ingredients from cannabis Furthermore the medical marijuana industry could face a material threat from the pharmaceutical industry should marijuana displace other drugs or encroach upon the pharmaceutical industry\xe2\x80\x99s products The pharmaceutical industry is well funded with a strong and experienced lobby that eclipses the funding of the medical cannabis movement Any inroads the pharmaceutical industry could make in halting or impeding the cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s business and operations Additionally Budbo is substantially dependent on continued market acceptance and proliferation of consumers of cannabis medical marijuana and recreational marijuana Budbo believes that as marijuana becomes more accepted the stigma associated with marijuana use will diminish and as a result consumer demand will continue to grow While Budbo believes that the market and opportunity in the marijuana space continues to grow Budbo cannot predict the future growth rate and size of the market Any negative outlook on the marijuana industry will adversely affect Budbo\xe2\x80\x99s business operations WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0cBUDBO | Global Cannabis Blockchain 58 Budbo and its users and clients may have difficulty accessing the service of banks which may make it difficult for them to operate Since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law there is a compelling argument that banks cannot accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with cannabis While the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has provided guidance to financial institutions on how to provide services to marijuana related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations the decision to open close or refuse accounts and/or relationships are made at the discretion of the banking institution Consequently businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for Budbo and its users and clients to operate WEB WWW BUDBO IO \x0c
