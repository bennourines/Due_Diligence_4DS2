 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 Rento is proposing a global sharing platform for businesses and individuals that allows the renting of underutilized assets Unlike competitors in the market Rento will rent any item to any individual rather than focusing simply on one market (cars apartment share) Furthermore Rento
 leverages blockchain technology to implement a trusted economy through smart contracts that
 ensure rental conditions are met and that the parties can count on one another to deliver and
 return the product or service Rento aims to introduce the sharing economy in the daily lives of
 people everywhere reducing waste in the economy and allowing more people to enjoy a variety
 of services and products without having to shoulder the cost of owning every type of item they
 use 
 SOLUTION
 Rento is creating a software solution for individuals and businesses to share items and services
 that until now needed to be purchased The Rento solution is based on the increasing “sharing
 economy” market but rather than focus on one vertical Rento is providing a complete solution 
 including smart contracts for anyone to rent or borrow any item or service In the same way that
 e commerce sites such as eBay do not limit themselves to one type of item Rento is providing
 the sharing economy marketplace Rento is leveraging blockchain technology for the smart contracts that ensure trust throughout the system 
 The concept of sharing economy is built around the use of economic resources to their fullest
 potential and that is exactly what Rento is aiming to accomplish Rento proposes a mobile application (and web platform) that allows users to list their unused assets for renting or sharing on
 its Platform Every listing on Rento includes the key aspects of the asset or resource such as its
 rental cost availability schedule images or video of the actual item specifications and terms
 and conditions specific to the asset 
 Rento proposes multiple products and services segments with its initial focus on businesses
 and service providers to populate the Platform with a large stock of available resources ensuring that the Platform initially has enough inventory for consumers to find it appealing Rento will
 be launching with primary listing segments such as household items like lawn mowers or snow
 blowers through more commercial offerings such as shared offices and conferencing facilities 
 construction equipment parking spaces and even underutilized human resources In addition to
 developing a sharing platform Rento plans to set up at least one bricks and mortar rental store
 as a proof of concept for its sharing ecosystem 
 7
 Considering that the assets to be proposed for listing vary in financial value maintaining transparency is of utmost importance Also in the sharing economy reputation is key and it’s essential that all information is verified and secure 
 To this effect Rento plans to utilize blockchain technology to 
 • Secure international and local transactions
 • Utilize smart contracts for security deposits
 • Ensure that reviews of items lenders borrowers services and items are real and verified
 • Reduce friction for transactions
 • Verify the transactions themselves and ensure payment for services as well as compensation through smart contracts for any breaches of the contract
 MARKET
 Smartphone users in Europe are the primary target market for the Rento Platform and App Because of Europe’s high smartphone penetration it offers the ideal demographics for Rento’s initial launch 
 COMPETITION
 Rento aims to expand the sharing economy to untouched industries and it will quite likely face
 stiff competition from established players Airbnb operating in the hospitality/real estate rental
 space and Turo operating in the personal car rental space are among its primary competitors 
 However these competitors are limited in both their reach and the range of items offered For
 example Airbnb is focused only on the rental of vacation spaces whereas many people need
 temporary office space as well Turo is not operative in many geographical areas Furthermore 
 none of these cater to businesses In business many types of equipment can be shared but
 there is no convenient way to get access to other people’s equipment and there is no assured
 way to verify trust within the systems From farming to construction to office equipment the potential for the sharing economy is tremendous 
 8
 BACKGROUND/INDUSTRY
 MISSION
 Enabling people to become a part of the global sharing economy and share their unutilized assets easily 
 THE INDUSTRY THE SHARING ECONOMY
 The concept of sharing economy has been in practice for centuries both at a person to person
 level and at a higher operative scale Time shares farming collectives and informal arrangements allow a group of people to share one expensive resource among them With the spread
 of the internet the sharing economy model has seen immense growth because of the ability to
 share with people you have never met through centralized organizations that ensure trust Over
 the past decade the world has witnessed small startups turn into multibillion dollar businesses
 (Uber Airbnb) Despite the success of sharing based businesses around the globe the sharing
 economy model hasn’t reached its potential and has multiple risks associated with its mass
 adoption 
 Current Trends in the Sharing Economy
 Uber is one of the best examples of the sharing economy Ironically the Company does not own
 its own vehicles and is still one of the largest taxi services in the world The Company defines
 itself as a technology enterprise that offers a platform for taxi drivers and commuters to operate
 together According to a recent report Uber is said to have a market valuation of roughly $70
 billion larger than the market cap of Delta Air Lines and other traditional transportation companies Similarly Airbnb valued at over $31 billion is the largest hospitality company in the world
 but owns no hotels Ola an Indian taxi riding platform is also succeeding in the sharing ecosystem 
 • Uber and Airbnb illustrate the profitability of a global sharing economy 
 • The industry is likely to grow from $14 billion to $335 billion between 2014 and 2025 
 • The growing market of the smartphone is a key growth driver for app based sharing platforms 
 9
 • Demographics Millennials are at the center of the sharing economy but they are not the
 only generation using these services The adoption rates are growing for all ages and economic backgrounds 
 • Popular examples ShareGrid BoatBound Uber Airbnb Trringo Ravgo Rent the Runway 
 • Economic impact Survey research revealed that 80% of people participating in the sharing
 economy are ready to pay more for durable and high quality products 
 CHALLENGES
 ● Highly concentrated growth The global sharing economy is limited to a handful of industries including hospitality automobiles and real estate There has been limited innovation in other industries despite their huge potential 
 ● The need to install multiple applications The growing number of applications fight for
 the users’ mobile computing resources and maintaining multiple apps is inconvenient for
 customers It seems logical that there will be a consolidation similar to eBay and Amazon rather than multiple platforms for different sharing items 
 BLOCKCHAIN HOW IT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE OUR INDUSTRY
 Blockchain technology provides opportunities in the sharing economy due to its immutable
 records transparency and smart contracts 
 Blockchain technology can 
 ● Introduce transparency The sharing economy operates on trust Considering a limited
 interaction between a product owner and customer it becomes imperative to maintain
 operational transparency within the ecosystem With blockchain technology each of the
 parties can access relevant information easily creating a trustless environment for business operations 
 ● Lower transaction charges In comparison to traditional financial institutions transactions on a blockchain cost less and are processed within a fraction of a second In traditional banking international transaction charges easily mount up considering the forex
 conversion fee transfer fee and remittance charges Digital cash makes these transactions seamless and fees transparent 
 10
 ● Limit fraud Blockchain technology prevents feedback manipulation on public listing
 platforms The open structure of a blockchain allows a limited scope for fraud Additionally it facilitates built in validation methodologies for feedback ensuring feedback authenticity throughout the ecosystem 
 ● Offer risk protection with smart contracts Smart contracts offer an efficient risk prevention mechanism Smart contracts can guarantee payments and hold deposits while
 items are being rented and provide financial risk protection to the product owners 
 11
 
 RENTO TAKING THE SHARING ECONOMY TO P2P
 Rento aims to develop a sharing ecosystem that dramatically increases the reach of the sharing
 economy beyond the existing industries such as transportation or hospitality Rento plans to
 develop a platform that makes the sharing of everyday products and services easier as well as
 implementing sharing across different industries Additionally Rento utilizes blockchain technology to secure international transactions and smart contracts to facilitate security deposits 
 The key components of Rento’s ecosystem are 
 ● Rento App
 ● Rento Blockchain
 ● Rento Model Store
 Rento App
 The Rento App aims to expand the sharing economy beyond the transportation real estate and
 hospitality industries It allows users to rent everyday items such as real estate office space 
 hardware tools electrical equipment construction equipment cameras and everything that one
 may require or want to rent on the Platform 
 Features for platform users 
 ● Listing page The listing page lists all the available services and products for renting on
 the Platform It supports multiple categories search filters and geo filters to show relevant results 
 ● Search engine The Rento App comes with a built in search functionality that allows
 users to search products using multiple filters and sorting capabilities 
 ● Renting calendar Every product and service listed on the Rento App reflects its availability through a renting calendar Users can access a product depending on its listed
 openings Rento plans to introduce a “Book in advance” feature after the launch 
 ● Feedback Rento has a built in feedback system that allows users to rate the product or
 services depending on their experience The Rento App utilizes blockchain technology to
 limit feedback manipulation practices on its Platform 
 12
 Features for listing owners 
 ● Active listings The listing owners can find all of their active listings in a single location 
 Additionally they can view the renting schedule of any item or service on the active listing page itself 
 ● Listing/Advertisement package details The listing owners can access listing package
 details or advertisement subscriptions on the dashboard Every business/service

 owners allowing them to understand customer behavior renting preferences and other
 relevant parameters to grow their business 
 Following are sample screenshots from the Rento App

 Note Please refer to Appendix I for more screenshots of the Rento App

 Rento Blockchain
 Rento is creating a proprietary blockchain with specific features that are essential for the sharing
 economy The chain for Rento will be used specifically for the sharing economy Because it is an
 independent blockchain Rento is able to develop the chain specifically for the implementation of
 this business model ensuring that it is the best database customized specifically for the needs
 of the Rento ecosystem 
 ● Custom smart contract facility The Rento Platform requires specific smart contract
 customizations that are not available in the present blockchain platforms Additionally 
 the Rento Platform needs the flexibility to develop new functionalities to address any operational/technical challenges in the future 
 ● Handle dispute resolution Rento requires complete control over its blockchain to handle disputes which is not possible when using third party blockchains Having its own
 blockchain will allow Rento to address disputes in accordance with local regulations 
 The Rento ecosystem features a Proof of Authority (PoA) blockchain to be used for transactions
 inside the Rento App particularly for payments security deposits and transaction history 
 thereby ensuring full transparency 
 Key Functionalities of Rento Blockchain
 ● Creation of renting agreements Platform users can use the Rento Blockchain to create renting agreements through smart contracts 
 ● Manage security deposits The Rento Blockchain will manage security deposits between the owner and client The client will confirm the return of the object and the owner
 will confirm that the object is not damaged in any way and that the owner has received
 payment Once both confirmations are received the security deposit will be transferred
 back to the client 
 ● Payment protection/blocking The Rento Blockchain will restrict access to funds until
 the client confirms the receipt of the object 
 ● Automatic payment The Rento Blockchain allows the client and owner to use a portion
 of the security deposit as payment Furthermore they can provide their crypto wallet details to process the payment automatically 
 15
 ● Transaction history management The Rento Blockchain will manage the history of
 every transaction which will prevent feedback manipulation within its ecosystem 
 ● Dispute resolution The Rento Blockchain will use third party dispute resolution services to handle disputes on its Platform Some of the potential service providers are

 Rento Model Store
 The Rento Model Store is a proposed rental store that will feature a wide range of assets such
 as lawn tractors boats and scooters This will not only build credibility for the Rento Platform
 but will also promote the sharing economy vision since all rentals will be done through the Rento
 Platform The Rento Model Store will provide an in person experience allowing Rento to get
 first hand feedback as people use the service 
 Furthermore this business model also represents a pathway to the building of a brand and a
 franchise For an interested person to own and operate a Rento Model Store under the Rento
 franchise one would need to satisfy a number of conditions outlined in the franchise agreement 
 In addition to the payment of the franchise fee outlined therein one would need to purchase the
 number of Rento Tokens stipulated in the same agreement and hold the Rento Tokens for a
 minimum period of two years 
 Rento App Transaction Workflow
 Listing a Service/Product for Rental

 Blockchain Transaction Smart Contract
 Once the listing owner and user have reached an agreement they can move forward with creating a smart contract for the transaction with a one click function 
 ● The listing owner sets up the transaction details through Rento’s intuitive interface 
 These details include the period of rental cost security deposit and accepted currency 
 ● The user agrees to the specified terms and makes the security deposit which is refundable once the transaction is complete 
 ● Once the rental period is over and the product is returned the listing owner confirms the
 receipt of the product 
 ● The smart contract returns the security deposit to the user after deducting the rental
 cost (If the security deposit was $1 000 and cost $200 the returned amount will be
 $800 )
 Direct Transactions Between Users

 BUSINESS BENEFITS
 Target Audience 1 Business Owners & Service Providers
 ● Access to a new customer base In addition to the existing customer base the Rento
 Platform opens a new customer segment for businesses 
 ● Generate revenue from unused resources Since the Rento App serves both retail
 and industrial customers it can potentially generate a consistent revenue stream for
 businesses sharing their unused resources 
 ● On demand access to hardware and manpower The Rento ecosystem is an ideal
 Platform for small and medium sized businesses to rent hardware and manpower as per
 their requirements This on demand economy can help improve operating margins by
 renting resources that are occasionally free 
 ● Improved reputation Because every user on the system is known for both their lending
 and borrowing behaviors each person’s reputation is built over time Therefore good
 behavior is rewarded in the long term resulting in better clients 
 ● Guaranteed payments and repair in case of damages The smart contract built into
 each rental ensures that there will be no issues with payment for the rental in case it is
 overdue or needs repair 
 Target Audience 2 Individual Consumers/Listing Customers
 ● Rent anything For individual consumers the Rento App is the one stop shop for any
 item or service Individuals can rent/share assets that are otherwise occasionally used 
 such as hardware tools coworking spaces and even meeting rooms 
 ● One stop hire Unlike existing apps where consumers need different logins for each
 type of rental Rento offers every type of rental with just one login Just as Amazon is a
 21
 one stopshop for any purchase Rento saves the user the trouble of using multiple apps
 and developing different reputations and identities for each app 
 ● Generate revenue with unutilized assets The average Rento user can generate additional revenue by sharing assets that they don’t need on a daily basis such as lawn
 mowers electronic equipment and automobiles 
 ● True reviews Rento uses an immutable ledger to ensure that every review is from
 someone who actually used the service Therefore the reviews of the equipment and
 suppliers are highly reliable

 The Rento Platform has blockchain technology at its core Rento will create its own blockchain
 to facilitate customized technology implementations and authority 
 Proof of Authority Consensus Model
 Rento plans to implement a PoA consensus algorithm which operates through a reputationbased consensus mechanism In PoA blockchains pre approved validators stake their identity 
 and they are responsible for validating transactions throughout the network These validators
 are incentivized for maintaining honest nodes 
 Wallet for Token Sale Event
 Rento recommends MyEtherWallet and eBit system to receive Rento Tokens during the Token
 Sale event It is important to note that Rento is an ERC20 compatible token which means sale
 participants can use other ERC20 compatible wallets including Trust Ledger Nano S Trezor 
 Metamask Coinomi Parity and Mist

 RISK FACTORS
 By providing any personal data to us and by participating in the Token Sale and the ICO and/or
 purchasing holding using and disposing of RTOs and by using any other services and goods
 that are or may in the future be offered by us you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks 
 A Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol and Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies in General
 Because RTOs and our Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol any malfunction breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the
 Platform or RTOs Moreover advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing could present risks to RTOs and the Platform including the
 utility of RTOs for obtaining services by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus
 mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol Smart contracts concepts the underlying
 software application and software platform (i e the Ethereum blockchain) are still in an early
 development stage and unproven There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating RTOs will be uninterrupted or error free and there is an inherent risk that the software could
 contain defects weaknesses vulnerabilities viruses or bugs causing inter alia the complete
 loss of your cryptocurrency contributions and/or RTOs 
 Subject to the timely satisfaction of any conditions that may be applicable to the Token Distribution by the Purchaser (including without limitation the satisfaction of all KYC/AML procedures
 and the provision of a valid wallet address and other information) RTOs will be distributed to
 your registered wallet address after the contribution is completed The Company may delay distribution of RTOs for any reason whatsoever (including the collection processing and completion of any KYC or AML checks on Participants and their wallet addresses as well as in connection with any requirements of applicable law) 
 In the event that there is a serious and permanent malfunction or breakdown of the Ethereum
 protocol the Company directors may at their sole discretion elect to transfer or change protocols to ensure the continued operations of the Platform 
 Blockchain technologies are controlled by various regulatory bodies around the world Any cryptocurrency including RTO Tokens can also be regulated by them which makes it possible to
 restrict the use or possession of digital crypto tools or the purchase of crypto tools in the future 
 RTO Tokens are not an investment and do not involve passive income All persons and parties
 involved in the purchase of RTO Tokens do so at their own risk 
 37
 B Risk of Mining Attacks
 As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol RTOs are
 susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating RTO transactions on the Ethereum
 blockchain including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks 
 and selfish mining attacks Any successful attacks present a risk to the Platform and RTOs including but not limited to accurate execution and recording of transactions involving RTOs 
 C Risks of Hacking Security Weaknesses and Theft of RTOs
 Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the website 
 the Platform or RTOs in a variety of ways including but not limited to malware attacks denial 
 of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing Furthermore because the Platform is based on open source software there is a risk that a third party
 or a member of our technology team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses
 into the core infrastructure of the Platform which could negatively affect the Platform and RTOs 
 including the utility of RTOs for obtaining our services 
 Notwithstanding any security measures there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the
 cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks sophisticated cyber attacks distributed denials of service
 or errors vulnerabilities or defects on the Token Sale websites in the smart contract(s) on
 which the escrow wallet and the Token Sale relies on the Ethereum blockchain or any other
 blockchain or otherwise Such events may include for example flaws in programming or the
 source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof In such event even if the Token Sale is
 completed we may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and may not be able to
 use such funds for the development of the Platform and/or for launching any future RTOs functionality In such case the launch of the Platform and structuring and licensing of any future
 RTOs functionality might temporarily or permanently be curtailed As such distributed RTOs
 may hold little worth or value and this would impact their price or value 
 Any third party that gains access to your login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of your RTOs To minimize this risk you should guard against unauthorized access to your
 electronic devices 
 Any cryptocurrency is an inherently risky asset One of the main features of cryptocurrency is
 the anonymity of all users and the absence of personalized accounts Cryptocurrencies are to a
 large extent intangible digital codes for which there is no property right In the case of an erroneous or fraudulent transfer it is usually no longer possible to return the money All transactions
 are at your own risk When performing transactions through many exchanges the user does
 not in fact own the funds on his account – the assets are owned by the exchange The Platform only provides access to them at the entrance to the system There are a lot of cases when
 users of crypto exchanges lost their assets due to cyber attacks and bankruptcies of platforms 
 38
 If money is stolen from a virtual wallet the owner can neither identify the thief (because of
 anonymity and decentralization) nor assert his right to coins (due to the lack of a law on personal property) 
 D Risk of Privacy and Data Retention Issues
 As part of the Token Sale and the subsequent verification processes the Company may collect
 personal information from Purchasers All information collected will be used for the purposes of
 the Token Sale and community management and may be transferred to contractor service
 providers and consultants worldwide as appointed by the Company Apart from external compromises the Company and its appointed entities may also suffer from an internal security
 breach whereby their employees may misappropriate misplace or lose the personal information of Purchasers 
 The Company may be required to expend significant financial resources to alleviate problems
 caused by any breaches or losses settle fines and resolve inquiries from regulatory or government authorities Any information breaches or losses will also damage the Company’s reputation and thereby may harm its long term prospects 
 E Risks of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography
 Cryptography is evolving and there can be no guarantee of security at all times Advancement
 in cryptography technologies and techniques including but not limited to code cracking the
 development of artificial intelligence and/or quantum computers could be identified as risks to
 all cryptography based systems The security of RTOs and your personal data or assets cannot
 be guaranteed as the future of cryptography or security innovations is unpredictable 
 F Risks Associated with Markets for the Company
 There is no prior market for RTOs and although approval of cryptocurrency exchanges and
 markets to list RTOs for trading may be sought by certain persons in the future there is no
 guarantee that such approval will be obtained There is no guarantee that an active or liquid
 trading market for RTOs will develop or grow or if developed that such development and
 growth will be sustained after RTOs have been made available for trading on such an exchange
 or market There is also no guarantee that the market price of RTOs will not decline below the
 original or issue purchase price and the purchase price may not be indicative of the market
 price of RTOs after they have been made available for trading on an exchange or market If
 secondary trading of RTOs is facilitated by third party exchanges such exchanges may be rela39
 tively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight making them more susceptible to fraud
 or manipulation Furthermore to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange
 value to RTOs (e g as denominated in a digital or fiat currency) such value may be extremely
 volatile The Company is not responsible for the circulation and trading of RTOs on any exchange or market The trading of RTOs will merely depend on the consensus on their value between the relevant market participants No one is unconditionally obliged to purchase any RTOs
 from any holder of RTOs including you nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price
 of RTOs to any extent at any time 
 The Company cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for RTOs or that the purchase price is indicative of the market price of RTOs after they have been made available for
 trading on any exchange or market Exchanges or markets may require additional due diligence
 on our contributors in order to list on their platforms 
 G Risks of Potential Concentrated Ownership of RTOs
 Immediately after the completion of the Token Sale a number of individuals may directly or indirectly hold significant portions of the total available RTO Tokens These Token holders may have
 significant de facto influence over the Company These significant Token holders may acting
 alone or in concert not necessarily make decisions that are in the best interests of the other Token holders or of the RTOs community as a whole 
 H Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights
 Because the Company confers no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Company
 Platform all decisions involving the Company’s products or services within the Platform or
 Company itself will be made by the Company in its sole discretion These decisions could adversely affect the Platform and the value and/or utility of RTOs you own including their utility for
 obtaining any Services 
 I Risks of Uncertain Liquidity of RTOs
 The Company is not responsible for and has limited control over the subsequent circulation
 and trading of RTOs RTOs are not money legal tender or currency fiat or otherwise issued by
 any individual entity central bank or national supranational or quasi national organization nor
 is it backed by any type or quantity of assets property or any cryptocurrencies included in the
 RTOs index nor does it represent any entitlement to any distributions of profits dividends or
 any other returns or payments of any kind There is no obligation of the Company nor anyone
 40
 else to redeem repurchase or acquire any RTO Tokens from any Holder There is no guarantee
 or assurance that there will be a market or marketplace where Holders may readily trade RTOs 
 J Risk of Fluctuating Trading Price of RTOs and Cryptocurrencies in General
 All cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies are subject to volatile pricing and pricing can
 fluctuate rapidly and significantly over short periods of time 
 The demand for and the corresponding market price of RTOs and other cryptocurrencies may
 fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to among others the following factors many of
 which are beyond the control of the Company 
 a New technical innovations
 b Analysts’ speculations recommendations perceptions or estimates of RTOs market
 price or the Company’s financial and business performance
 c Changes in market valuations and cryptographic token prices of entities with businesses
 similar to that of the Company that may be listed on the same cryptocurrency exchanges
 or markets as RTOs
 d Announcements by the Company of significant events for example partnerships sponsorships or new product developments
 e Fluctuations or departures of key personnel of the Company
 f Success or failure of the Company’s management in implementing business and growth
 strategies
 g Any legislative or regulatory action which may adversely affect the Company the Rento
 Blockchain or the RTOs
 h Negative press or publications about the Company or any related parties about the
 Company Platform or about our services
 i Changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology industry the general economic conditions or market sentiments or other events or factors 
 Generally speaking high volatility of the exchange rate is a very characteristic feature of any
 cryptocurrency Even within one day fluctuations in the rates of individual cryptocurrencies can
 range from 50% to +50% 
 41
 Formation of the cryptocurrency exchange rates occurs in a very specific way Unlike money
 that is issued by national banks electronic money is subject to change in the exchange rate
 over a short period of time Due to the decentralization of the cryptocurrency market and the
 absence of a governing body no one can maintain the minimum value of a digital currency In
 this case large holders of cryptocurrencies can influence the market creating an opportunity for
 panic and collapse 
 K Risk of Failure
 There is no reasonable expectation of profits based on your purchase of RTOs and there is no
 guarantee that you may benefit from the Rento Blockchain in any particular way 
 While the Company adopts quality assurance procedures to help ensure the source codes reflect as accurately as possible their intended operation the flawlessness of the source codes
 cannot be guaranteed They may contain bugs defects inconsistencies flaws or errors which
 may disable some functionality create vulnerabilities or cause instability Such flaws may compromise the predictability usability stability and/or security of the RTOs and the Rento
 Blockchain in general Open source codes rely on transparency to promote community sourced
 identification and solution of problems within the code 
 Due to the technically complex nature of the Rento Blockchain the Company or those contributing to the Company’s software development effort could face difficulties from time to time that
 may be unforeseeable and/or unresolvable Accordingly the development of the Project could
 fail terminate or be delayed at any time for any reason including due to the lack of funds Development failure or termination may render the RTOs non transferable of reduced or no utility
 or value and/or obsolete 
 L Risk of Competition
 In addition there is fierce competition in the cryptocurrency market Our competitors may offer
 products and services that may be superior to ours and/or more aggressively marketed or more
 modestly priced than our products or services which may negatively affect the value of our
 product and services and the value of RTOs 
 42
 It is also possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open
 source code and protocol underlying the Rento Blockchain and attempt to facilitate services that
 are materially similar to our project or any parts thereof 
 M Risk of Uninsured Losses
 Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions Company accounts are
 uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them Thus in the event of
 loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by the Company to offer recourse to you 
 N Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Further Enforcement Actions
 The regulatory status of digital tokens and the distributed ledger technology in general is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions Cross border data exchange does not directly link wallets and transactions with them to a single jurisdiction Moreover each state has its own traditions in the legal regulation of information technologies and international regulation in this area
 is minimal Many experts believe that due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency legal problems 
 and some high profile fraudulent schemes it is better to consider all cryptocurrencies as speculative instruments since the level of investment security is extremely low and the risks are too
 high 
 The governments of many large countries are already discussing the legal basis for regulating
 the industry in order to make it more transparent and safe for investors which means that the
 cryptocurrencies have prospects for further development However it is also necessary to take
 into account the fact that national regulators can at any moment introduce criminal liability for
 the turnover of the cryptocurrency which means that the risks of a strong depreciation of digital
 assets are also high 
 It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with
 respect to such technology and its applications including the Rento Blockchain its user network
 (“Network”) and the services we offer It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and cryptocurrencies and its applications including to the Company
 Platform and Company Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Company in various
 ways including for purposes of illustration only through a determination that the purchase 
 sale and delivery of the Company constitutes unlawful activity or that the Company is a regulated instrument that requires the registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the
 parties involved in the purchase sale and delivery thereof 
 43
 The Company may choose or be required to cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that
 regulatory actions or changes to laws or regulations make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in
 such jurisdiction This may impact the appeal or practicality or functionality of the Project and/or
 the anticipated RTOs functionality for the Purchasers and result in a decreased usage of and
 demand for the Project and RTOs Further should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold maintaining the Company Platform and/or developing structuring licensing and/or launching the future of RTOs
 functionality may no longer be commercially viable and the Company may opt to discontinue
 the whole project the anticipated future RTOs functionality and/or RTOs 
 The Company may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate
 in such jurisdiction or makes it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary
 regulatory approval (s) to operate in such jurisdiction In scenarios such as the foregoing the
 utility liquidity and/or trading price of RTOs will be adversely affected and/or RTOs may cease
 to be traded The value of RTOs may also have to be refunded to our affected participants 
 Crypto tokens have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory authorities and may be
 overseen by the legal and regulatory authorities of a number of jurisdictions globally The functioning of the Network and the Project generally could be impacted by one or more regulatory
 inquiries or actions including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital
 tokens like RTOs which could impede or limit the development of the Project 
 The Company may receive notices queries warnings requests or rulings from one or more
 authorities upon short notice or may even be ordered to suspend or terminate any action in
 connection with the Token Sale or the Network as a whole without prior notice 
 Furthermore many aspects of the RTOs the Rento Blockchain and the Network also involve
 untested areas of law and regulation and could be subject to new laws or regulations so their
 legal and regulatory outcome in all relevant jurisdictions is not possible to predict The planning 
 development marketing promotion execution or otherwise of the Company or the Token Sale
 may be seriously affected hindered postponed or terminated as a result Since regulatory policies can change with or without prior notice any existing regulatory permissions for or tolerance
 of the Company the Rento Blockchain and the Token Sale in any jurisdiction may be withdrawn
 without warning The RTOs could be deemed from time to time as a virtual commodity a digital
 asset or even as money securities or currency in various jurisdictions and therefore could be
 prohibited from being sold purchased traded distributed or held in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local regulations In turn the Rento Blockchain or the Network could be deemed to be a
 regulated or restricted product There is no guarantee that the Company can maintain any particular legal or regulatory status in any particular jurisdiction at any time 
 44
 Since the cryptocurrency market the market of crypto tools tokens or bonuses exchanges and
 platforms on which secondary tokens can be traded are not always regulated by applicable law 
 the volatility of the cryptocurrency tools bonuses or tokens in general and RTOs in particular
 can be very significant Transactions with cryptocurrencies transactions with bonuses tokens 
 and other electronic instruments are not insured by any external public or private bodies All the
 risks associated with the loss of cryptocurrency tokens and points including RTOs are borne
 by the acquirer of the cryptocurrency RTOs are generally not refundable The Company does
 not repurchase RTOs from RTO holders Holders of RTOs will not receive financial means or
 other compensation from the Company for their Tokens The Company makes no promises regarding the future performance or value of RTOs 
 The regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrencies and cryptographic tokens including
 RTOs is fast evolving There may be uncertainty in the regulatory treatment of RTOs and this
 offer purchase and sale of tokens in the jurisdictions where it is conducted Although we do not
 believe that RTOs are securities in any jurisdiction where the RTOs Sale is conducted there is
 no assurance that relevant competent government or regulatory authorities would take a similar
 view either now or in the future Similarly although the Company does not believe that the offer 
 purchase and sale of RTOs is subject to any securities commodities derivatives or other financial laws and regulations there is no assurance that any competent regulatory and governmental authorities in your jurisdiction would not subsequently take the view that RTOs or this
 offer purchase and sale of RTOs be subject to specific regulations and is or was not in compliance with certain existing regulations including without limitation financial services based
 regulations Any such different view or determination by a relevant regulatory or governmental
 authority may adversely affect the legality of RTOs and this Token Sale or may otherwise impose restrictions on the future transfer of RTOs which may affect the market value and liquidity
 thereof 
 Legislative and regulatory changes or actions in your local jurisdiction or at the international level may adversely affect the use transfer exchange and value of RTOs You acknowledge there
 may be risks associated with RTOs and/or the Index not being regulated in the jurisdictions in
 which RTOs may be purchased including the risks of retroactive regulatory applicability Neither
 the Company its founders advisors or affiliates is a financial institution or is currently under the
 supervision of any financial supervisory authority The Company does not provide any licensed
 financial services such as investment services fund management or investment advice 
 45
 O Risks Relating to Use of the Internet or Other Electronic Media
 Without limiting the foregoing risks any communication transaction or information (including
 the document) transmitted via the internet or other electronic medium involves risks and by participating in the Token sale or utilizing the Network or the Rento Blockchain you acknowledge
 that you understand and accept the following risks 
 ● We and/or third parties may use such authentication technologies as we deem appropriate 
 ● No authentication verification or computer security technology is completely secure or safe 
 You agree to bear all risks of unauthorized access/use hacking or identity theft 
 ● The internet or other electronic media (including without limitation the electronic devices
 and services of third party telecom service providers such as mobile phones or other
 handheld trading devices or interactive voice response systems) are inherently unreliable
 forms of communication 
 ● Any information (including any document) transmitted or communication or transactions
 made over the internet or through other electronic media (including the electronic devices
 and services of third party telecom service providers such as mobile phones or other
 handheld trading devices including those with interactive voice response systems) may be
 subject to interruption transmission blackout delayed transmission due to data volume internet traffic market volatility or incorrect data transmission (including incorrect price quotation) or stoppage of price data feed due to the public nature of the internet or other electronic media 
 As a result of such unreliability there may be time lags delays failures or loss of data or loss
 of confidentiality in the transmission of data and receipt of communications While the Company
 may believe certain data to be reliable there may be no independent basis for it to verify or contradict the accuracy or completeness of such data 
 P Risks of Exposure to Cryptographic Tokens
 After the completion of the Token Sale the Company expects that a certain portion of the proceeds will be held in cryptographic tokens The Company may but it may not be required to 
 convert an appropriate proportion of cryptographic tokens received into fiat currencies at the
 sole discretion of the directors of the Company For the avoidance of doubt no Token holder has
 any right title or interest in any such cryptographic tokens or fiat currency 
 46
 Q Risk of Malfunction in the Company Platform the Network and the Project in General
 It is possible that the Network and the Rento Blockchain malfunctions in an unfavorable way 
 including but not limited to one that results in the loss of RTOs or information concerning any
 particular asset market 
 R Unanticipated Risks/Other Risks
 Cryptographic tokens such as RTOs are a new and untested technology In addition to the risks
 discussed here there are other risks associated with your purchase holding use and disposal
 of RTOs and access to and the use of the Company Platform Services and Network including
 unanticipated risks Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed here
