form of digital money which is adaptable and well disposed to use would enable online payments and transactions to be sent specifically from one party or person to another without using financial institutions like banks as an intermediary Stellar Gold is based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) and we are building a platform which will be secure smart and easy touse platform where people can convert any crypto to their fiat currency very fast and without paying any conversion fee for the fiat 3 www stellargold net \x0cThe world is globally changing The trade barriers have been decreased since the past few years and more and more companies are interested to invest offshore But even if they have the money to invest there are few obstacles which may cause few problems One of the main problems is \xe2\x80\x9cfiat currency\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPaper money\xe2\x80\x9d Fiat currency is essentially paper money Fiat currency is not backed or guaranteed by a commodity Its intrinsic value is decided and guaranteed by a central authority such as the government and then it is distributed accordingly A major problem with Fiat currency is that the governments can print as much new money as they like which causes inflation which in return devalues the money already in supply 4 www stellargold net \x0cNormal individuals are helpless before this unpleasant framework since they can\ t spend the dictator\ s useless paper outside the country They also do not have a decent method for moving money outside the country since no one else accepts their national currency We offer a solution to this problem by introducing the world to the very first digital currency Stellar Gold (XLMG) that can move money across borders quickly and that can be converted into any international fiat without any conversion or transaction fees 5 www stellargold net \x0cWhat is Stellar Gold Stellar Gold is a platform for the future of conversion of crypto to fiat easily While existing solutions offer to solve just one problem at a time our team is building a secure useful & easy to use product based on private blockchain It will include easy cryptocurrency payments integration and even a digital arbitration system At the end our aim is to convert the cryptocurrencies without any conversion cost like deposit and withdrawal fees 6 www stellargold net \x0cMoreover the XLMG Token is based on utilizing the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) Executing Stellar Lumens innovation we make it simple and easy to move advanced resources and assets around the globe rapidly dependable and furthermore engaging the genuine vision of Satoshi XLMG is an absolutely distributed form of electronic money adaptable and well disposed to utilize would enable online Payments to be sent specifically starting with one gathering then onto the next without experiencing a financial institution like banks 7 www stellargold net \x0cOur Vision \xe2\x80\x9cMove Money Across Borders Quickly and Conversion of Crypto into Any International Fiat \xe2\x80\x9d Stellar Gold is a platform for the future of conversion of crypto to fiat easily While existing solutions offer to solve just one problem at a time our team is up to build a secure useful & easy to use product based on a private blockchain It will include easy cryptocurrency payments integration and even a digital arbitration system In the end our aim is to convert the cryptocurrencies without any conversion cost like no deposit and withdrawal 8 www stellargold net \x0cWhy We Are Not Using Ehtereum Or Any Other Technology Ethereum and Bitcoin use a mix of particular devices and inspiring powers to ensure that they accurately record who claims what without a focal specialist The issue is it\ s questionable to protect this accord while moreover building up the number of customers (Especially to the point where people can use the system to purchase coffee or run Applications) This outcome from Ethereum depending on an arrangement of \ centers\ all of which stores the entire Ethereum exchange history and the current \ state\ of record modifies contracts and limit This is plainly a clumsy task especially since the quantity of exchanges is extending around each 10\xe2\x80\x93 12 seconds with each new square The pressure is that if engineers raise the range of each square to fit more exchanges the data that a center point should store will increase therefore rejecting people from the framework If each center grows adequately substantial just a few broad associations will have the resources to run them 9 www stellargold net \x0cRegardless of the weight running a full center is the best way for customers to misuse Privacy and security Making full center points progressively difficult to run would also compel the number of individuals that can check exchanges themselves In a manner of speaking decentralization and adaptability are starting at now in danger yet fashioners are looking for courses around this 10 www stellargold net \x0cTransaction Processing Speed Comparison Upheld by the blockchain development different cryptographic forms of money are exchanging ownership the market Assessments express that there are in excess of 1400 digital forms of money which are exchanging ownership on standard crypto exchanges and more are being utilized for an extent of purposes Given the possibility of digital forms of money and how the mystery is the key quality it is over the top to hope to have the right figure Besides making a decentralized fiscal framework and ensuring secure exchanges a champion among the most basic perspectives which are as often as possible talked about in association with cryptographic forms of money is quick exchanges 11 www stellargold net \x0cRegardless the reality of the situation is that with everything taken into account in case we take a gander at the exchange speeds that are o\xef\xac\x80ered by customary trade stages (visa PayPal) that empower exchanges for fiat money related structures we see that none of the current digital forms of money are even close to their exchange taking care of rates While Visa can process 24 000 exchanges for every second and PayPal can process around 200 exchanges for every second the most pervasive advanced cash Bitcoin handles only 7 exchanges for each second best case scenario 12 www stellargold net \x0cNotwithstanding the way that bitcoin money has seemed to process up to 60 exchanges for every second it still incredibly falls behind when appeared differently in relation to Visa or PayPal To address the issue of moderate exchange speeds and make crypto exchanges speedier Ripple is the fundamental blockchain based money with a decent exchange speed which they certification to be up to 1500 trades for consistently This makes swell second just to VISA the extent that exchange speed is worried as Ripple ends up being speedier than PayPal by over 300% PayPal with 218 million unique customers is so far the most noticeable shared store trade master association But then amidst all the cryptographic forms of money Ethereum is commonly very moderate with an exchange speed of simply up to 20 exchanges for each second 13 www stellargold net \x0cIn spite of the way that Ethereum defeats bitcoin in exchange speeds and was delivered with the objective to o\xef\xac\x80er favored exchange speeds (notwithstanding more prominent usefulness obviously) over that of Bitcoin with creating blockage on the Ethereum\ s blockchain it has failed to keep up to higher exchange speeds Much of the time the exchanges are not arranged and take hours to get confirmed As per Blockchain info Bitcoin as of now forms around 3 exchanges for each second Evaluations demonstrate that number can go as high as 7 You can follow affirmation times at ETH Gas Station which right now appraises a 2 minute handling time 14 www stellargold net \x0cStellar Stellar on the other hand was forked off of the Ripple convention in 2014 and the group has rolled out numerous exclusive improvements to the stage from that point forward The gathering at Stellar says the framework can without a lot of a stretch handle 1 000 exchanges for consistently today Exchange settlement time is assessed at 2 5 seconds 15 www stellargold net \x0cConclusion Blockchain innovation can accept essential employment in disturbing the equalization in the tech business the way where we make exchanges and Ethereum explicitly furnishes an immense number of chances with the usefulness of its decentralized applications In any case the moderate exchange speed (which is as it was because of the strategies drew in with the working of Ethereum blockchain while ensuring the decentralization of the stage) is a critical issue that must be perceived significantly since with cryptographic forms of money grabbing reputation among people and drawing in examiners the traffic on the Ethereum blockchain will just increment Similarly with savvy contracts new organizations and associations are making their own tokens to raise resources through their ICOs This calls for snappier exchange affirmation and getting ready to make the blockchain and associations relying upon the advancement versatile and down to earth While some creative responses for this issue are inducing they are yet to be attempted through and through Further research is required to examine the possible results and execution of the proposed arrangements 16 www stellargold net \x0cStellar\xe2\x80\x99s Proposal While Bitcoin and Ethereum can\ t deal with a significantly high number of transactions every second in this respect a feasible and cutting edge money related alternative Stellar ran over with a shrewd idea where adaptability issues can be taken to the next level With the capacity to process over 2000 transactions per second we trust Stellar will o\xef\xac\x80er us the shot of executing the vision of Satoshi\ s under its Blockchain 17 www stellargold net \x0cThe Issue Of Installments In Cryptocurrency The gathering of digital money isn\ t generally such great Clients who approach digital coins are unfit to utilize them for the buy of merchandise and enterprises in view of the absence of a strong ecosystem system and framework 18 www stellargold net \x0cHere is the place the issue emerges High And Unusual Commissions In numerous exchanges including cryptographic forms of money commission rates for installment are very deregulated making it hard to make precise expectations Subsequently the expense of any exchange can out of the blue increment Low Security Advanced wallets have overwhelmed online commercial centers without tending to stage explicit vulnerabilities The utilization of libraries further entangles the investigating procedure on every stage 19 www stellargold net \x0cDigital Currency Compliance Is A Long Procedure In numerous chains a solitary exchange subentry can take as long as 30 minutes This isn\ t perfect for purchasers and dealers who are utilized to quick outcomes in customary methods of installment By and large corrupt excavators can sell a similar coin a few times more than a procedure known as \ twofold waste\ Poor Ease Of Use The normal client doesn\ t think a lot about blockchain applications and thus sets aside an extensive effort to see each procedure A well actualized blockchain application is clearer Usually for new monetary forms to turn out to be a piece of computerized wallets however embedding them is a long and strenuous procedure There are various passage focuses on exchanges including digital forms of money Banking applications don\ t coordinate cryptographic forms of money to their installment frameworks expecting that the decentralized record could undermine its income age capacities The absence of framework and administrative help implies that digital currency won\ t become fiat money at any point in the near future It is beyond the realm of imagination to in a split second proselyte cryptographic money while paying for products and ventures 20 www stellargold net \x0cThe Stellar Gold Solution Our coin solves all of the problems mentioned above Stellar Gold have can handle 2000 transactions per second and within 2 5 seconds it is transferred from one wallet to another Stellar Gold is the first platform where people and transfer money from one place to another with just one click without any transaction fees plus your XLMG Tokens are secured in the Lobstr Wallet Executing Stellar Lumens innovation we make moving advanced resources around the globe simple rapid dependable and furthermore realizing the genuine vision of Satoshi We propose a shared system utilizing SCP to record an open history of transactions with a restricted supply of 21 million coins in existence ever Our point is to give a worldwide arrangement that is free of the Bitcoin adaptability issues 21 www stellargold net

wallet A transaction on the system comprises of at least one task Instalments o\xef\xac\x80ers payments and charges are on the whole instances of tasks that could make up a single transaction No Transaction Fees Every coin requires some transaction fees to transfer them from wallet to another even transferring of Bitcoin and Ethereum from one wallet to another costs some money but on the other hand Stellar Gold does not change any sort fees Transaction from one point to another does not costs anything 22 www stellargold net \x0cSecurity Stellar Gold tokens are stored in the Lobstr Wallet LOBSTR provides highly secure storage for your Lumens and other digital assets offering 2FA and multisig protection Stellar usages industry standard open key cryptography gadgets and procedures which suggests the code is all around attempted and without a doubt understood All exchanges on the framework are open which suggests the advancement of benefits can for the most part be audited Each exchange is set apart by whoever sent it using the Ed25519 figuring which cryptographically exhibits that the sender was endorsed to make the transaction While all transactions are open banks using Stellar to exchange resources the enthusiasm of individual record holders can keep information about the general population sending and tolerating it secretly by securing mixed or noteworthy identifiers in the transaction\ s notice field This empowers banks to meet regulatory consistence necessities and keep exchange history undeniable while up \ til now keeping favored information secure 23 www stellargold net \x0cWorldwide Transactions Moving cash across countries over fringes rapidly dependably and for fractions of a penny has never been excessively simple With Stellar Gold now we can associate banks making instalments and confiding in individuals everywhere throughout the world without agonizing over twofold spending issues With Stellar Gold you can transfer any amount of money from one country to another with just one single touch Scalability To wrap things up dependent upon gear and framework setups a preservationist measure of Stellar Gold taking care of rate is 1000 exercises for consistently The conveyed Stellar framework is involved servers running the Stellar Core programming These servers are kept up by di\xef\xac\x80erent individuals and substances Stellar Core keeps up a close by copy of the framework record conferring and staying in a condition of amicability with various instances of Stellar Core on the framework Track Prices Stellar Gold is listed in coin market cap With this you can track the price of your coin and setup alarm which will notify you if a change in the price occurs 24 www stellargold net \x0cSupply of Stellar Gold Tokens

blockchain is in the most straightforward of terms a period stepped arrangement of changeless record of information that is overseen by a bunch of PCs not claimed by any single block Every one of these blocks of information (for example square) is verified and bound to one another utilizing cryptographic standards (for example chain) 28 www stellargold net \x0cA blockchain conveys no transaction cost (A framework cost truly however no transaction cost) The blockchain is a straightforward yet cunning method for passing data starting with one point then onto the next in a completely computerized and safe way One gathering to a transaction starts the procedure by making a block This block is confirmed by thousands maybe a huge number of PCs disseminated around the web The confirmed block is added to a chain which is put away over the web making a one of a kind records yet in addition an exceptional record in history Misrepresenting a solitary record would mean distorting the whole chain in a large number of examples Obviously this is practically incomprehensible Bitcoin utilizes this model for money related transactions yet it can likewise be sent from numerous points of view The private blockchain depends on the Graphene chains (Bitshares Steemit EOS) convention This kind of design is known for its great throughput This is an alluring element thinking about that the system is intended to cover the requirement for clients in micropayments without commissions Chain chiefs take a shot at servers make squares check transactions and incorporate transactions into the blockchain 29 www stellargold net \x0cClients have open keys joined to their records All exchanges inside the system are performed just with the mark of the exchange transaction of assets by a private key of the client Nobody aside from the proprietor can know it They are produced on the gadget from the client which ought to be kept classified so as not to bargain access to their assets in a private lock Blockchain private expenses for commissions are missing from this procedure Blockchain will be open data about transactions made by clients and their introduction to the exchange of tokens Inward activities are in this manner free It is conceivable to exchange resources inside the framework without bringing about commissions and extra installments 30 www stellargold net \x0cThe Three Pillars Of Technology Transparency Decentralization Immutability 31 www stellargold net \x0cLobstr Wallet LOBSTR Wallet is a Simple & Secure Stellar Wallet LOBSTR is a great way to

Federation Server The Stellar federation protocol empowers you to change over an intelligible location like Amy*your_org com to a record ID It similarly joins information about what should be in a transaction\ s update When sending a portion you contact a federation server first to make sense of what Stellar record ID to pay Luckily the augmentation server does this for you Federation The Stellar federation protocol maps Stellar addresses to more data about a given client It\ s a route for Stellar customer programming to determine emaillike addresses for example name*yourdomain com into record IDs like GCCVPYFOHY7ZB7557JKENAX62LUAPLMGIWNZJAFV2MITK6T32V37KEJU Stellar addresses give a simple method to clients to share installment subtleties by utilizing a language structure that interoperates crosswise over di\xef\xac\x80erent areas and suppliers 35 www stellargold net \x0cStellar Addresses Stellar addresses are divided into two parts separated by * the username and the domain For example ammar*stellar org \xe2\x80\xa2 ammar is the username \xe2\x80\xa2 stellar org is the domain The domain can be valid RFC 1035 domain name The username is constraint to printable UTF 8 with whitespace and the following characters prohibited <* > Although the domain administrator can place additional limitations on usernames of its domain Note that the @ character is allowed in the username This allows for using email addresses in the username of an address For example ammar@gmail com*stellar org 36 www stellargold net \x0cDistributed Exchange Notwithstanding supporting the problem and advancement of favorable circumstances the Stellar framework moreover goes about as a decentralized conveyed exchange of an advantage that people have added to the framework Its record stores the two modifies held by customer records and o\xef\xac\x80ers that customer accounts make to buy or move assets O\xef\xac\x80ers An account can make o\xef\xac\x80ers to buy or move assets using the Manage O\xef\xac\x80er action In order to make an o\xef\xac\x80er the account must hold the preferred standpoint it needs to move Similarly the account must trust the benefactor of the advantage it\ s endeavoring to buy O\xef\xac\x80ers in Stellar Gold act like limit arranges in conventional markets For o\xef\xac\x80ers set at a similar value the more established o\xef\xac\x80er is
