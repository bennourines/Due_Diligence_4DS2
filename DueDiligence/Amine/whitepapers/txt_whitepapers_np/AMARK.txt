b AMARK \x0cExecutive Summary An attention based marketing ecosystem that employs blockchain & cryptocurrency to maintain privacy AMARK is a platform that solves three key problems Marketing offers and attention data profiles are linked only to blockchain wallet addresses rather than to \xe2\x80\xa2 Local marketing inefficiency from the inability to capture customer attention consumers Cryptocurrency is the ONLY viable way to privately compensate a consumer for their attention as \xe2\x80\xa2 The need to collect personal data by marketing solutions other digital payment methods expose the identity of the payee If an individual consumer receiving an attention \xe2\x80\xa2 Poor consumer and merchant adoption of cryptocurrency payment was identifiable via the payment method then all response and preference data could be easily tied Efficient Local Marketing back to that individual thereby compromising the individual\xe2\x80\x99s data privacy AMARK began development in 2017 with the goal of improving local marketing efficiency through the AMARK has adopted General Attention Currency [ XAC ] to facilitate private attention payments to application of attention resource economics and consumer preference indexing Attention resource consumers XAC can be used to purchase goods and services at any AMARK participating business economics properly treats attention as a finite resource and when applied to local marketing allows businesses to capture verifiable consumer attention by offering direct compensation for it AMARK uses marketing response data to understand consumer preferences and accurately measure the value of individual consumer attention Consumers are delivered targeted advertising through AMARK and compensated for their attention to these offers at a rate that corresponds to their expected future purchases at aligned businesses AMARK local marketing efficiency improvements are realized through achieving verifiable attention improved attention quality data based consumer targeting and effective distribution Blockchain Ending Personal Data Collection The consumer pushback against intrusive data collection and resulting governmental privacy regulations created a need for data based marketing solutions that ensure consumer privacy In response AMARK A Trojan Horse for Crypto Adoption Cryptocurrency as a payment method for in store purchases has not gained significant traction For consumers there is little incentive to buy crypto from exchanges and then use it to make in store purchases when there are many other payment methods readily available For merchants there are too few consumers making payments with crypto to warrant the additional setup needed to accept it and convert it to fiat AMARK eliminates these hurdles to adoption by changing how consumers and merchants interact with marketing Merchants will join AMARK to benefit from a superior marketing system that improves profitability The activation of AMARK allows merchants to purchase XAC through the attention marketing system and distribute it to consumers via targeted advertisements Consumers receive XAC payments in exchange for their attention to these offers bypassing the need to secure crypto through an exchange Once merchants activate the marketing system XAC is accepted natively through in store terminals without additional setup adopted blockchain and cryptocurrency as tools to eliminate ANY need for the collection of personally identifiable information AMARK uses public blockchain data overlaid with merchant data to identify consumer preferences understand local trends and set a value for consumer attention In our view a pivot of the local advertising model to attention resource economics will lead to widespread adoption of cryptocurrency by both merchants and consumers \xe2\x80\x9cAMARK rejects the premise that personally identifiable information must be used to effectively target advertising and is challenging that assumption with a marketing platform that enforces privacy by design \xe2\x80\x9d \x0cIntroducing AMARK AMARK is a marketing platform that creates regionally based attention ecosystems between consumers and businesses These connected ecosystems eliminate intermediaries from local marketing while bypassing payment gateways CRYPTOCURRENCY ADOPTION CONSUMER ATTENTION

result in BUSINESSES DEALS a 70% cost of sale for local businesses Compounding costs is the inability to exclude existing customers from these aggressively priced deal promotions Customer Acquisition Blanket Marketing Print TV and Radio are very inefficient at identifying and targeting consumers which leads to excess costs associated with mass distribution MEDIA CUSTOMERS Through

Online media companies harvest personal data and manage large servers full of personal details Today\xe2\x80\x99s marketing solutions build advertising profiles based on your location gender age hobbies career interests relationship status and income AMARK rejects the premise that personally identi\xef\xac\x81able information must be used to e\xef\xac\x80ectively target advertising and is challenging that assumption with a marketing platform that enforces privacy by design \xe2\x80\xa2 No personally identifiable information is ever requested or needed Name age gender race and occupation are never collected or analyzed \xe2\x80\xa2 All consumer preference data is tied only to blockchain attention addresses and learned from blockchain and connection analysis \xe2\x80\xa2

Horse for Crypto AMARK will function as an engine for adoption and usefulness of the XAC currency Cryptocurrency has a retail adoption problem Merchants Consumers \xe2\x80\xa2 Little incentive for local businesses to accept cryptocurrency for goods and services as crypto is still not held by enough consumers \xe2\x80\xa2 Little incentive for consumers to purchase cryptocurrency off exchanges and then use it as a payment vehicle for goods and services \xe2\x80\xa2 For many businesses it is currently too complicated to accept crypto in store and then convert it to fiat currency \xe2\x80\xa2 Low acceptance by local merchants and other payment methods are easily available AMARK solves the crypto adoption problem with built in adoption hooks \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Merchants will use

assumptions to foster innovation and challenge a diversity of ideas to drive optimal gains FLYWHEEL performing dynamic organization \x0cAMARK will use XAC as a retail currency within the ecosystem The XAC protocol rules are consistent with growing the AMARK ecosystem \x0cWhy Blockchain An innovation that balances business requirements for data based marketing with consumer requirements for data privacy There is a massive pro\xef\xac\x81t motive behind personal data collection for marketing companies like Google and Facebook These companies source demographic and personal interest data from individuals to better target advertising and drive ROI for their customers The collection of personal information will continue to accelerate in the absence of an e\xef\xac\x80ective alternative since it has proven to o\xef\xac\x80er advertisers a competitive advantage in the marketplace A major \xef\xac\x82aw in this method of marketing is that the marketer\xe2\x80\x99s demand for personal information remains out of balance with the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s demand for privacy Blockchain enables private data based marketing AMARK has created an implementation of attention resource economics uniquely dependent on blockchain and cryptocurrency to e\xef\xac\x83ciently target advertising while maintaining the privacy of consumers The platform links consumer attention value represented by blockchain wallet addresses with direct payments to consumers in exchange for their attention Cryptocurrency o\xef\xac\x80ers the ONLY viable way to privately compensate a consumer for their attention as other digital payment methods expose the identity of the payee If an individual consumer receiving an attention payment was identi\xef\xac\x81able via the payment method then all response and preference data could easily be tied back to that individual thereby compromising the individual\xe2\x80\x99s data privacy When applied to local marketing the innovations of blockchain and cryptocurrency restores a balance between e\xef\xac\x83cient data marketing and consumer privacy \x0cGeneral Attention Currency [ XAC ] A decentralized point of sale focused cryptocurrency developed by the General Retail Currency Foundation Token to Coin XAC General Use XAC will initially be distributed as a token on the Ethereum blockchain The Through AMARK the XAC currency will achieve wide distribution to consumers and Ethereum token will be used by AMARK as a platform currency while the concentrated merchant acceptance This adoption will increase the usefulness of XAC blockchain protocol development is completed XAC as a general currency The protocol will be developed with on chain and offchain transaction scaling capabilities to accommodate the additional use of XAC XAC Blockchain XAC Specifications The XAC blockchain is designed to function as an effective point of sale \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 payment solution while allowing for economic rules that result in value retention through supply scaling 150 million coins Consensus through proof of stake \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Stake Rate 2% annually Blocktime <1 minute \x0cXAC Attention Addresses Attention addresses link consumer data and align incentives Attention Addresses are linked to AMARK consumer data and have specific rules enforced by the XAC protocol Two Key Functions of Attention Addresses XAC Lock XAC Burn XAC Lock is a feature that encourages continued consumer engagement with XAC Burn is enforced at the protocol level All transfers to Attention AMARK The XAC sent to Attention Addresses is initially locked and becomes Addresses require 5% of the XAC transferred to be burned The XAC available after a maturation period The XAC attention awards paid to consumers Burn feature is designed to align interests between merchants and continually matures into availability as new XAC is earned from ongoing attention consumers in the AMARK ecosystem Anytime merchants use the AMARK marketing This process encourages engagement with AMARK as attention wallets platform for marketing they are supporting the value of the XAC will rarely have a zero XAC balance giving consumers a consistent flow of value to currency as protocol rules enforces a 5% burn As such merchants are spend within the ecosystem e\xef\xac\x80ectively scaling the supply of XAC to match the demand from the ecosystem This supply side scaling mechanism will o\xef\xac\x80set new coins introduced through block rewards and pressure the price of XAC to an equilibrium re\xef\xac\x82ective of demand from the ecosystem \x0cWhy not use Bitcoin AMARK participants bene\xef\xac\x81t as the value of XAC correlates with the growth of AMARK attention ecosystems XAC has economic rules to allow the value of XAC to be supported by the demand generated from the AMARK ecosystem 01 03 BTC Concentration XAC Demand BTC Speculation Price Discovery The high concentration of bitcoin AMARK expects to quickly build Demand for BTC is largely speculative The XAC price is supported by the ownership is a risk to the value of BTC fundamental demand for XAC through resulting in significant price swings participation of consumers and and therefore presents a risk to regional ecosystems resulting in wide which would negatively impact the merchants in the AMARK ecosystem the AMARK ecosystem distribution of the XAC currency attention ecosystems rather than correlated to the general crypto market 02 04 \x0cA Complete System AMARK & XAC combine to deliver an industry disrupting attention marketing ecosystem Real Innovation Executable Path Forward Trojan Horse For Crypto XAC Price Balancing AMARK takes public blockchain data AMARK network growth teams will The \xef\xac\x81rst ecosystem where Attention Addresses will
