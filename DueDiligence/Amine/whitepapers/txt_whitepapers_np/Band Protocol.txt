 Abstract
 Decentralized applications have huge potential to disrupt traditional busi 
 nesses by replacing centralized middleman with automatically executed trust 
 less smart contracts In Web 2 0 centralized corporates act as gatekeepers who
 store and distribute data in a way that is most protable to them [19] Web 3 0 
 the decentralized web has promised a paradigm shift to restore data ownership
 and return the internet to the hands of users 
 However decentralized applications still need to rely on data to operate
 and function in a trustless way Smart contracts currently have no easy way
 to access reliable real world information making its use case rather limited At
 presence current decentralized applications rely on centralized data providers 
 representing a single point of failure and defeating the purpose of being decen 
 tralized in the rst place 
 Band is an open protocol that facilitates the governance of data used in
 decentralized blockchain systems The protocol functions as an open standard
 for data handling and data management This whitepaper outlines how Band
 Protocol intends to solve data accessibility and data reliability in a fully de 
 centralized manner This includes how Band provides data endpoint such that
 any smart contracts can easily consume real world data and data governance
 mechanism to ensure data integrity 
 While Band is initially built on top of Ethereum [18] the protocol itself
 is blockchain agnostic and will eventually be supported on all major smart
 contract platforms including Cosmos Network and EOS [13 1] Band s vision
 is to become the go to decentralized world s database which any decentralized
 programs or applications can rely on for trusted data

 1 Introduction
 All blockchain platforms that operate and execute code trustlessly in smart contracts
 suer from the same centralizing issues that arise when needing to use external
 data points Many decentralized systems rely on being able to perform basic tasks
 and computations that require external data feed such as asset price inter chain
 communications real world events and external web API interactions 
 1 1 Data Availability Problem
 Smart contracts cannot access data by themselves { there is no simple and intu 
 itive query interface for decentralized applications to receive real world data Until
 decentralized applications can interface real world external data inputs into simple
 function calls there will be signicant barriers in adoption of the technology and
 the accessibility for developers to realize new applications
 Existing data availability solutions for blockchain smart contracts either depend
 on highly critical central points of failure or are subject to asynchronous interactions 
 which cause delays and complicate the smart contract logic 
 1 2 The Need for Trusted and Reliable Data
 In the permissionless environments of decentralized systems the economic incentive
 and temptation to corrupt and attack critical data sources can be signicant With 
 out strong incentive mechanisms to ensure high quality and reliable data provision 
 decentralized applications will persistently suer from these security risks 
 For instance if an external data source provided by an oracle controls the data
 inputs to a smart contract then it has the sole ability to determine the response
 and behavior of that smart contract The data source essentially controls that smart
 contract { if the oracle is compromised then so is the smart contract and all the
 systems depending on it creating a signicantly weak point in the security and
 censorship resistance characteristics of blockchains 
 In order for decentralized applications to become increasingly sophisticated and
 useful they must be able to use and replicate equivalent tools used in centralized
 settings for their decentralized counterparts Ultimately this enables developers to
 build the decentralized applications of tomorrow that will improve people s lives

 1 3 Smart Contract Component Layer Solution
 Figure 1 Overview of Web 3 0 stack Band Protocol ts in Component Layer powering reliable
 and trusted data to other decentralized protocols 
 As g 1 shows Band Protocol is a Web 3 0 component layer solution for managing
 data that resolves the data availability and reliability problem for blockchains in the
 Web3 technology stack [15] Dapps using Band Protocol consume data via Band s
 public smart contract data points rather than through oracles that are external to
 the blockchain Band s data feeds are community curated data sources 
 providing a framework for dApp users and developers alike to self moderate curate
 and manage the data sources such that they can be trusted and reliable for their
 intended purposes 
 By creating a standard framework for the community governance of data Band
 can create a socially scalable method for the widespread adoption and integration
 of trusted data that all dApps can utilize 
 Band data interfaces are source and application agnostic meaning that they can
 be applied for any purpose that the community governing and curating the data
 deems t Sources can be aggregated using mean median or majority and can be
 sourced from multiple sources such as centralized external feeds or on chain data
 aggregators Example use cases includes 
 4
 Asset Price Feed includes crypto crypto crypto at traditional securities and
 commodities prices Decentralized nancial applications rely on these external price
 feed in order to build decentralized lending algorithmic stablecoin derivative trad 
 ing etc 
 Real World Event Feed includes sport events IoT data outputs real world
 payment settlements etc Many smart contracts need to depend on this information
 to process its transactions For example prediction market can be easily built using
 our sport event feed without having to rely on token holders resolving the outcome
 for every contract created 
 Identity Data includes relevant information such as accredited status credit
 score educational background and work experiences Decentralized exchange and
 marketplace are some of the potential applications that will need to rely on such
 data 
 Location data includes GPS location Any decentralized applications that need
 to leverage maps can rely on such data 
 Most importantly Band does not dene how the data is treated rather it
 provides the means for a community to collectively decide how it will
 be used and curated No assumptions are made as to how the data should
 be curated and treated by Band this power is placed entirely in the hands of
 the community that wishes to use that data for their decentralized applications 
 creating optimally incentivized participants that align with a common goal of
 creating a reliable data source for their decentralized applications 
 Beyond furthering the goal of truly decentralized world Band Protocol is also
 building an ecosystem of private data sharing between private enterprises Many
 data are sensitive and held custodian by many private enterprises who have no easy
 way to freely and securely share data among the right stakeholders Band Protocol
 extends our Web 3 0 support to cover such private information sharing to enable
 the creation of World Database which includes crucial and useful information such
 as identity and credit score

 2 Band Protocol Overview
 Figure 2 Overview of Band Protocol Multiple community curated datasets co exist on the
 blockchain ready to be consumed by dierent decentralized applications depending on their uses 
 Band Protocol s main functionality is to bridge the gap between decentralized appli 
 cations and real world data while also ensure that data is accurate and trustworthy
 through economic incentives Band Protocol will initially be built on the Ethereum
 network but the protocol itself is not restricted to Ethereum infrastructure As the
 protocol gets more widespread adoption it will support all leading smart contract
 platforms and power the new generation of decentralized applications 
 2 1 Simple Data Layer for Dapps
 Existing data provider networks such as ChainLink or Oraclize [9 4] require asyn 
 chronous interactions between smart contracts and data layers Not only does this
 method complicates smart contract implementations it also introduces a signicant
 delay as two blockchain transactions need to be executed and conrmed sequentially 
 To obtain data a smart contract follows the 
 ow shown in g 3 
 6
 Figure 3 Interaction between smart contracts and existing oracle networks Two seperate trans 
 actions are required to achieve information 
 1 Contract saves the state of the current transaction to the contract s storage 
 2 Contract emits an event to request data query and stops current transaction 
 3 O chain network waits for sucient transaction conrms 
 4 O chain network invokes a callback transaction with supplied query result 
 5 Contract validates the transaction recovers the state and continues execution 
 Band Protocol shifts the paradigm and instead provides an intuitive
 query interface for decentralized applications to receive real world data
 as a simple function call to a static smart contract Data providers are
 responsible for inputting and curating data to the blockchain making it ready to
 be consumed from Dapps synchronously 
 Figure 4 Interaction between smart contracts and Band Protocol Query occurs in one transaction
 7
 As g 4 shows as a result querying data on Band Protocol is simple to imple 
 ment and only incurs small gas cost overhead This method also scales with more
 applications using the same dataset since data is readily available to be consumed
 by multiple parties whereas existing solutions require every application to perform
 redundant data query 
 2 2 Consortium of Data Governance Groups
 Figure 5 Overview of Band Protocol s architecture Multiple independent communities together
 provide data for dapps 
 Datasets inside Band Protocol are split into multiple Dataset Governance Groups 
 each of which utilizes its own unique \dataset token to stake curate and govern
 its dataset through mechanics like Token Curated Registry or Token Curated Data 
 Sources While the data governance groups are independent and do not share the
 same token they are all secured by Band Native Token through the bonding curve
 mechanic This is fundamentally dierent from other data curation protocols such
 as DIRT Protocol [3] which exclusively uses one token for all types of curations 
 Having one token per group has two advantages 
 8
  Token holders have direct incentives to curate good data As the
 token s value is tied directly to the specic dataset governed within this group 
 curating good data gives benets solely to the token holders Otherwise if
 there is only one token it is not clear how contributing to any specic dataset
 will lead to a signicant value increase and therefore the model for security
 and reliability of the data is weaker This can easily lead to Tragedy of the
 Commons [12] and low vote turnouts 
  Bribing token holders becomes more dicult Conversely if there is one
 token one bad dataset will likely not result in a signicant drop in token value 
 Thus bribing token holders to manipulate a dataset is more probable than one 
 token one dataset situation where token holders loses are more signicant
 should the dataset s quality drops 
 For more information on data governance groups including its token issuance
 and governance model see Section 3 for more details 
 2 3 Band Native Token
 Band Protocol is built around its own native token Band token (BAND) BAND is
 initially released as an ERC 20 [16] token on the Ethereum blockchain As we deploy
 to more blockchains BAND will also be available there with the ability to swap
 the token between supported blockchains The token provides four main utilities to
 the protocol ecosystem 
  Provide liquidity to the data governance groups and guarantee token
 values Band token is used as collateral to issue dataset tokens Anyone can
 buy dataset tokens by sending BAND to the data governance group s bonding
 curve smart contract Conversely dataset tokens can be sold to the bonding
 curve to receive back BAND Similar to how there is a long tail of ERC 20
 Token there will be a long tail of less liquid dataset tokens BAND acts as a
 network token to provide global liquidity between them and thus anyone can
 buy sell or switch between any dataset token with instant liquidity 
  Store the value of all datasets To mint any dataset token Band token is
 required as collateral Thus as the demand of dataset tokens increase BAND s
 demand will increase as well This has a two fold eect Firstly BAND s price
 and token value will increase making it eectly re
 ect the value across all data
 governance groups Secondly as dataset tokens are valued in terms of BAND 
 an increase in BAND s price results in more security for all data governance
 groups 
 9
  Governance for future protocol upgrades Similar to projects like 0x s
 ZRX token [17] BAND can be used for proposing and voting on future protocol
 improvements Once BAND protocol is deployed its internal logic cannot be
 changed easily since upgrade can aect security and usability of the system 
 BAND Token will act as a governance token for stakeholders in every data
 governance group to vote for future decentralized upgrade and governance
 issues such as changing voting schemes or adding new curation methods 
  Control dataset quality through curated dataset registry Initially the
 rst set of datasets will be strictly handpicked However as Band Protocol
 moves toward decentralization creating and curating a dataset will be permis 
 sionless To control the quality of datasets inside the ecosystem BAND token
 holders will together maintain a curated registry of legitimate datasets based
 on a set criteria Band token will be used as the voting power to protect the
 registry against bad actors 
 2 4 Protocol Economics
 A protocol cannot survive without proper economic incentives Band Protocol relies
 on query fees to cover the cost of data providers and incentivize honest data curation 
 Whenever a smart contract issues a data query function call it must
 attach a fee in terms of the blockchain s native currency (ETH in the
 case of Ethereum) with the call Query fees get split among the dataset s data
 providers and token stakers based on a fee schedule set by the data governance
 group s Governance Parameters 
 10
 Figure 6 Dapps can ask for query price via the standard query interface which forwards the
 query to the responsible dataset s governance parameters contract 
 The decision to accept the blockchain native currency is primarily to simplify
 onboarding and integration process since it is unreasonable to assume that every
 app is willing to hold dataset tokens or Band token In implementation Band
 Protocol utilizes decentralized exchange protocols such as Uniswap [20] to instantly
 convert accepted currency to Band token which then gets converted to dataset
 token through bonding curve on the same transaction Thus although Dapps pay
 in native currency data providers and token stakers still receive their revenue share
 in dataset token Through the process more BAND gets locked to the bonding
 curve and the supply of dataset token increases resulting in price increases for both
 tokens 
 11
 Figure 7 Query price received in native tokens can be converted to dataset tokens via uniswap
 and bonding curve 
 It is important to note that some curation methods such as Token Curated
 Registry do not necessarily need revenue to economically benet the participants 
 In that case the dataset community may collectively decide to set query fee to zero 
 12
 3 Dataset Governance Groups
 Dataset data governance group is the most fundamental unit of Band Protocol 
 Band Protocol consists of multiple data groups each of which has its own unique
 token Dataset token holders participate in community governance and data cura 
 tion In return they receive fee collected from public data consumption and gain
 from token value appreciation 
 Figure 8 Each dataset governance group inside Band Protocol utilizes its own token for data
 governance However every token is bonded with Band token Having Band as collateral ensures
 that dataset tokens always have tangible economic value and cannot be minted from thin air 
 3 1 Dataset Token
 A Dataset Token is an ERC 20 [16] token that is deployed with a governance group
 when it is created The token supply is controlled by bonding curve contract which
 has the sole authority to mint and burn dataset tokens Dataset tokens are used for
 governing and curating data through Token Incentivized Data Curation methods 
 Band Protocol adds three extra functionalities to the ERC 20 contract to improve
 user experience 
  Transfer and Call allows the token to be received and processed by a con 
 tract within a single transaction while the traditional work
 ow requires two
 separate transactions 
  Minimi s Balance Snapshot allows a contract to query for historical balance
 of any account This is primarily useful for determining voting power and
 eliminate double voting [10] 
 13
  Transfer Freeze allows authorized contracts to disable token transfers This
 is primarily useful for implementing the stake mechanism while still allowing
 stakers to keep their token custody 
 3 2 Bonded Token Issuance
 Dataset token issuance is controlled by the data governance group s bonding curve
 bonded with Band token Bonding curve concept is originally proposed by Simon
 de la Rouviere [8] Bonding curve ensures that (1) dataset token s price always goes
 up as the supply increases and (2) token holders always have an option to exit by
 selling their dataset tokens to receive back proportional BAND back This ensures
 that the dataset tokens always remain liquid and useful in any situation protecting
 the incentive mechanisms crucial for successful operation 
 3 2 1 Value Supply Function
 This convex and monotonically increasing function describes the relationship be 
 tween the dataset token s total supply and its total value in terms of collateralized
 Band tokens In other words given the current supply s V (s) produces the total
 number of BAND collateralized in the bonding curve contract Notice that by den 
 ing this value supply function one can easily derive the spot price of dataset token
 at a given total supply P(s) as the derivative of the value supply equation at that
 specic supply value 
 Figure 9 Example of bonding curve with linear token price and quadratic collateral The two
 graphs are equivalent 
 14
 Whenever a person buys dataset tokens the buyer sends BAND tokens to the
 bonding curve contract The contract calculates the adjusted dataset token s supply
 and mints the added supply to the buyer Opposite conversion happens when a
 person decides to sell dataset tokens 
 Figure 10 Example of situations when a person decides to buy or sell tokens with a bonding
 curve 
 To combat against front running the bonding curve contract allows users to
 specify price limit simulating traditional limit orders A transaction will get
 reverted should it violates the limit condition saving the user from executing a bad
 order 
 3 2 2 Equation Library
 Band Protocol provides a generic smart contract library [14] to construct arbitrary
 mathematical expressions in Solidity (also see video explanation for more details) 
 Any expression that can be described in terms of recursive applications of common
 unary binary and ternary operations on the current supply and numeric constants
 can be encoded 
 15
 3 2 3 Liquidity Spread
 Liquidity spread controls the dierence between buying and selling prices of
 dataset token The parameter can be set via Governance Parameters under name
 bonding liquidity spread High liquidity spread makes it more dicult for ma 
 licious actors to perform front running attacks However high spread also leads to
 token holders receive less BAND when they cash out their dataset token Revenue
 from liquidity spread is sent to address specied by bonding revenue beneficiary
 parameter The default value is the governance group s creator address 
 3 3 Governance Parameters
 Governance parameters inside of a data governance group dictate how other smart
 contracts of the group perform their logics Formally governance parameters con 
 tains a set of 32 byte key and 32 byte value pair A 32 byte value can be interpreted
 as an integer a percentage value a blockchain address or an IPFS hash depend 
 ing on its key For instance parameter bonding liquidity spread maps to an
 integer that controls the spread percentage between the bonding curve buy and sell
 spot prices Dataset token holders can conduct changes in parameters through the
 following process 
 Figure 11 Lifecycle of a proposal to change parameters 
 1 A dataset token holders proposes a change to one or more parameters by
 sending a \propose transaction to the governance contract thereby creating a
 16
 proposal Once created a proposal stays open for params expiration time
 seconds 
 2 While the proposal is open token holders can vote for approval or rejection
 to the proposal 
 3 After the voting period ends if (1) more than params min particiation pct
 percentage of ALL tokens participated in the vote AND (2) more than
 params support required pct percentage of participating tokens voted for
 approval the proposal is approved and the change is applied 
 4 Additionally to facilitate unanimous parameter changes a proposal can be
 resolved prior to its expiration if more than params support required pct
 of ALL tokens approve the proposal 
 Initial parameters of the bonding curve and governance contracts will be set
 during the data governance group s creation It is important to note that the
 three parameters of the governance contract itself can also be changed via the same
 proposing voting process 
 17
 4 Token Incentivized Data Curation
 During the rst mainnet launch Band Protocol will provide two primary models
 for a data governance group to utilize its dataset token to collectively govern and
 curate data We are actively researching for more curation models and will add
 them to the protocol in future protocol upgrades A data governance group is not
 necessarily restricted to only use exactly one curation method the same dataset
 token can be used across multiple datasets within the same data governance group 
 This section primarily discusses the technical token mechanics More concrete
 examples will be explained in Potential Use Cases section 
 4 1 Token Curated DataSources
 Token Curated DataSources (TCD) is a method to curate objective data with high
 volume TCD is in many ways similar to Delegated Proof of Stake consensus To 
 ken holders collectively elect data providers by staking their token in the name of
 the candidates Data providers have the authority to provide data to the public
 with a specied condition and earn a portion of the fees collected from data queries 
  Data providers apply for the authority to provide data to the dataset Top
 providers by total stake get to provide data They receive the majority of
 query fees in exchange for their services 
  Token holders stake their tokens for data providers that they trust They
 earn a smaller portion of query fees in exchange for securing the list of top
 trusted data providers 
 4 1 1 How does TCD Curation Work 
 Figure 12 Flow chart of TCD provider s promotion path 
  A token holder who wishes to become a data provider deploys Data Source
 Contract She then registers to become a provider candidate by staking
 18
 min provider stake token 
  Other token holders can stake for a provider candidate they trust Top
 max provider count data provider candidates by the total number of token
 staked become active data providers 
  Whenever there is a data query coming in TCD contract issues a sub query to
 every active provider s data source Query results are aggregated to become
 the nal result of the data query 
  Dapps pay query price ETH for each query which gets converted to commu 
 nity token owner revenue pct of the revenue goes to the active providers 
 The remaining goes to community members proportional to their stake 
  Token holders can withdraw their stake anytime and get their stake back
 together with their portion of revenue After a withdrawal the active provider
 list gets recalculated 
  Data providers can also withdraw their stake However they must notify
 TCD smart contract about their intention to withdraw for withdraw delay
 duration This allows ordinary token holders to withdraw their stakes prior to
 data providers which may be possible if data providers act maliciously 
 4 1 2 Connect with Query Interface
 External data consumers query for data using the query interface which aggregates
 data points among currently active data providers A data point is valid if and only
 if more than 2
 3 of active data providers are providing such data This guarantees
 that the system can tolerate up to 1
 3 of malicious data providers While at the
 protocol level Band Protocol does not impose specic aggregation methods data
 providers should aggregate data using a method that is tolerant from manipulation
 of less than half of available datapoints such as 
  Median value among all the results at the given key 
  Majority value among all the results at the given key or failure if there is no
 majority 
 4 1 3 Economic Analysis
 This subsection discusses the economic aspect of Token Curated DataSources 
 Low Cost for Data Providers Updating a data point incurs a very small cost
 to data providers For instance for a provider to update a key value pair on the
 19
 Ethereum blockchain the gas cost is approximately 26000 gas (5000 for storage
 word update and 21000 for xed transaction cost) Thus updating this data point
 every hour only costs (assuming 5 Gwei gas price) 26000245=109 = 0 00312 Ether 
 or $0 624 per day at Ether price of 200 USD/ETH Sub dollar per data point per
 day is considerably low for crucial data point such as real world price feed or other
 blockchain s block hashes Furthermore In the future iteration of Band Protocol 
 data providers can additionally save cost by providing the dataset s Merkle hash
 instead of every individual data point See section 7 1 for more details 
 Low Cost for Data Consumers Data consumers already pay for gas fee when
 broadcasting a transaction to the network Assuming a complex transaction s av 
 erage size of 200000 gas at the gas price of 5 Gwei a transaction fee alone already
 costs 20 cents (at 200 ETH/USD) Thus paying for instance 10 cents extra to
 ensure that the data is secured should not disrupt user experiences Note that the
 fees can be adjusted based on the data s security need 
 Healthy Prot Margin and Reputation Gain Combining the previous two
 points we can see that only a small number of queries are required for data providers
 to reach break even point Using the numbers above if there are 10 data providers 
 only 10  0 624=0 1  60 queries per day are required to support data providers 
 Beyond that is pure economic prot to data providers In addition to economic
 benets data providers also gain reputation from adopting the protocol Cryptocur 
 rency exchanges for instance may gain reputation in supporting the decentralized
 ecosystem by contributing valid and up to date price information to the network 
 Market Scalability As more decentralized applications join Band Protocol they
 can start consuming data and paying fees without incurring any marginal cost to the
 data providers This translates to a direct increase in dataset s market capitalization 
 beneting both data providers and token holders Additionally a data governance
 group can expand to support more TCDs without having to issue a dierent dataset
 token 
 4 1 4 Security Analysis and Possible Attack Vectors
 Collusion of  1
 3 of Providers A small number of data providers may collude
 to tamper with data results { An insignicant number of malicious attackers will not
 aect the overall data integrity of the network We show the case analysis below 
 20
 > 2
 3 of active data providers are providing data In this case more than
 1
 2 of data provided by the providers are honest (since > 2
 3 are providing but  1
 3 are
 malicious Thanks to the Median s and Majority s tolerance against less than half
 of bad data points the protocol will still provide trusted data to users 
  2
 3 of active data providers are providing data In this case the protocol
 will not serve data to users In other words the protocol favors safety over liveness 
 Data will be served to users once > 2
 3 of active providers are providing data ensuring
 data validity 
 Collusion of > 1
 3 of Providers A more signicant number of data providers
 may collude to tamper with data results { If more than one third of the providers
 provide bad data the protocol will inevitably serve bad data to dApps However 
 If such attack occurs and data becomes less useful the value of token is essen 
 tially destroyed since there will no longer be any dApps willing to pay for such
 data The \withdraw delay mechanic prevents the data providers from convert 
 ing dataset tokens to BAND prior to ordinary token holders This ensures that
 data providers suer the most from the governance group s collapse The credible
 threat of economic loss should be sucient to discourage community wide collusion
 of data providers Additionally real world reputation loss from collusion also serves
 as an incentive to prevent data providers from acting maliciously In the future we
 also consider imposing token slashing condition to further dis incentivize dishonest
 behavior 
 Wealthy Attacker Wealthy adversary may use large amount of capital to buy
 tokens and obtain a signicant staking power conducting a 1/3 +  attack on the
 TCD { Buying tokens to overrule existing token holders is prohibitively expensive 
 Due to the bonding curve nature of token issuance new tokens are increasingly
 pricey to mint As a concrete example to achieve 1
 3 of token supply of bonding
 curve under 20% reserve ratio one would need to mint 50% of the current supply 
 The cost is 1 5(100%=20%)  7 6 times of the current collateral which is extremely
 costly for a governance group with a suciently high market cap Future deterrent
 can include delay in eligibility to become a data provider i e one needs to buy and
 hold tokens for certain period before they are able to stake This delay can cause
 the governance group to react to sudden price increase 
 Denial of Services Since the identities of data providers are likely known ma 
 licious attackers may directly attack those providers making them unable to provide
 21
 data { Data providers are responsible for maintaining healthy connection to the
 blockchain However unlike traditional data APIs that are served directly to users
 from data providers Band Protocol leverages blockchain infrastructure to aid data
 distribution It is near impossible for an attacker to shut down Band Protocol s
 data serving unless they shut down the entire blockchain ecosystem 
 4 2 Token Curated Registry
 Token holders can collectively build a public dataset with Token Curated Registry
 (TCR) [11] A TCR is an on chain list data structure of 32 byte entries including
 strings addresses numbers or hashes Three parties are involved in building a
 TCR application candidates token holders and data consumers 
  Application candidates stake their dataset tokens to get their entries in 
 cluded in the system essentially acting as data provider They risk losing
 tokens if their entries are not aligned with the TCR s guideline 
  Token holders monitor the quality of entries on the TCR They challenge low
 quality entries and vote for ongoing challenges They receive token rewards
 for performing the curation tasks 
  Data consumers read and utilize information regarding the entries on the
 TCR While the consumers do not pay they provide intrinsic value to the
 owners of the TCR s entries 
 Example of data that can potentially be crowdsourced and curated with TCR
 includes but not limited to list of veried crypto projects that meet certain criteria 
 list of news and research that meet community standard or a list of unique identity
 vered by trusted third party TCR oers potential benets over centralized data
 curation when it comes to transparency and scale 
 22
 4 2 1 How does TCR Curation Work 
 Figure 13 Lifecycle of an entry inside of a TCR 
 1 A candidate applies for an entry to be listed on the TCR by staking
 min deposit dataset token The entry gets automatically listed if it is not
 challenged for apply stage length duration 
 2 A token holder can challenge an entry by staking a matching deposit The
 entry goes to a voting period Using commit reveal voting token holders vote
 to keep or remove the entry 
 3 If less than min participation pct of tokens participated the challenge is
 considered inconclusive The matching deposit is returned to the challenger 
 and the entry stays on the TCR 
 4 If enough tokens participated and more than support required pct vote for
 entry removal the entry is removed and the entry s deposit becomes chal 
 lenger s reward The challenger receives dispensation percentage percent 
 while the winning voters get the remaining 
 5 On the other hand if the challenge fails the challenger s stake is conscated
 and split among the entry owner and voters that vote to keep the entry The
 entry owner receives dispensation percentage percent while the winning
 voters get the remaining 
 Band Protocol is actively experimenting with Depreciative Stake Model in entry
 deposit which allows an entry s deposit to decrease as time goes and the entry s
 real value decays [7] 
 23
 4 2 2 Economic and Security Analysis
 The economic and security of TCR have been in active research and study since
 its inception in 2017 Interested readers may learn more about the mechanic from
 the TCR Reading List [2] In addition to the commonly known aspects as dis 
 cussed in section 2 2 the fact that Band Protocol isolates dataset tokens on a per
 governance group basis also contributes to stronger incentive and security of the
 system 
 24
 5 Potential Issues and Limitations
 5 1 Parasitic Data Sources
 A parasitic smart contract consumes data from a dataset and redistributes it to
 other Dapps at a lower cost In essense it acts as a caching layer to the original
 truth resulting in a loss of revenue to the original curated dataset While tradi 
 tional companies can prevent data reselling businesses using law enforcement an
 autonomous data governance group s smart contracts do not have such privilege 
 Unfortunately Band Protocol as an open protocol cannot prevent this party s
 existence However Dapps that choose to rely on parasitic smart contracts risk
 receiving out to date or malicious data As the Dapps get bigger since their trust
 and reputation are put at stake they should converge to consume data from ocial
 data sources 
 5 2 On Chain Voting
 The viability of token based on chain voting is not yet completely proven partic 
 ularly with respect to potential bribery This topic has been in active research by
 several teams However as of current token based voting is the mechanic that is
 most widely adopted and is the best way to combat against Sybil attack Band
 Protocol implements the following extra layers to disincentivize attacks 
  While dataset token is free to be bought or sold via continuous bonding curve 
 the contract imposes small liquidity spread between buy and sell prices This
 makes buying tokens solely to in
 uence a specic voting costly 
  Reputation is another critical resource at stake Data providers generally need
 to submit their identity in order to gain trust from the community Hence 
 every data provider will have both monetary value and reputation at stake {
 which disincentivize them to act maliciously 
  Every voting based decision inside of Band Protocol can be re considered A
 TCR challenge can be initiated again should the former challenge ends with
 an unfavorable result Governance proposals similarly can be re proposed 
 Band Protocol will continue to actively research on chain voting with the vot 
 ing mechanics likely to be upgraded should better techniques and implementations

 6 Potential Use Cases
 6 1 Decentralized Finance
 The majority of existing decentralized nance (DeFi) applications share one critical
 source of risk Price Feed Oracle Reputable projects such as MakerDAO Com 
 pound Dharma dYdX or SET rely on only a relatively small number of trusted
 developers to provide o chain price information to the protocol Band Protocol
 can ll the gap and provide such crucial information allowing projects to focus
 on the aspects that they do best while also enjoying the security of Band s data
 providers This also extends to future decentralized nancial application such as
 derivative trading of real world asset which requires knowledge of real world data
 such as interest rate foreign exchange rate price of securities such as stocks bonds
 and commodities 
 6 2 Decentralized Commerce
 Many decentralized applications utilize tokens as a mean of payment which requires
 them to price their products and services in token term However this is dicult
 because these applications usually price their oers in stable at value whereas
 these tokens have high price volatility Hence they need a mechanic to continuously
 convert their at value to token value which requires a reliable constant feed of
 crypto at price 
 6 3 Identity Layer
 Many decentralized applications struggle to deal with fake accounts and Sybil at 
 tacks As Vitalik suggests identity layer is one of the most crucial parts for building
 collusion resistant tokenomic system [6] Band Protocol can serve as a platform for
 dierent identity services to together curate identity information ready to be con 
 sumed by applications via a simple query interface 
 6 4 Gaming Gambling and Prediction Markets
 Gaming and gambling have been one of biggest sectors in the blockchain ecosystem 
 By utilizing Band Protocol dApps can access trusted real world information that
 is not controlled by a single source of truth Similar to DeFi this allows developers
 to focus on their core product while also leverage Band Protocol s security 
 26
 6 5 Supply Chain Tracking
 Buying and selling real world products in a fully trustless way using cryptocurrency
 is near impossible with current technology Band Protocol allows supply chain re 
 lated data such as item shipments or non blockchain payments Smart contracts
 can verify such information on chain and perform nancial logic accordingly 
 6 6 Real world API connection
 Smart contracts are currently limited because they cannot bridge between digital
 and physical world Band Protocol can support real world API connection so smart
 contracts are fully aware of real world event and also able to supply input to the
 API to trigger specic event For example one can connect bank API so that smart
 contract knows exactly when there is an o chain transaction or smart contract may
 automatically trigger o chain transaction by itself 
 27
 7 Future Technical Goals
 7 1 Curating Massive Datasets
 For Band Protocol to become the go to place for data query similar to traditional
 web s Wikipedia or Wikidata it must be able to support large datasets With the
 current TCD design data providers must submit every single piece of data in a
 dataset to the blockchain which is not feasible due to prohibitive costs The next
 iteration of Band Protocol will allow data providers to submit only the Merkle root
 of the complete dataset Raw data will be distributed through an o chain network 
 where token holders will collectively verify data On chain smart contracts can check
 for data validity through the same query interface 
 7 2 Interchain Communication
 A dataset data governance group that aims to curate the hash chains of other
 blockchains will be available Combining with Merkle hash compression mentioned
 above Ethereum smart contracts will be able to inspect what happens on other
 blockchains such as Bitcoin or EOS 
 We envision Band Protocol as a blockchain agnostic protocol with Band token
 available on every supported blockchain including Cosmos Network and EOS To
 enable that Band token will support cross chain atomic swaps between blockchains 
 similar to BancorX [5] albeit with decentralized data oracle powered by Band Pro 
 tocol itself With this enabled we can eectively interconnect dierent blockchains
 and empower a wider range of decentralized applications 
 7 3 On chain Data Privacy
 Some data is not feasible to be stored and published as a plain text Personal
 information such as name age or credit scores are private However such informa 
 tion is crucial to unlock the potential of decentralized applications For instance 
 non collateral loan applications require personal information to make a sound lend 
 ing decision In future iterations of Band Protocol we plan to incorporate cutting
 edge cryptographic techniques including but not limited to trusted execution envi 
 ronment (TEE) and zero knowledge proof to allow trustless information assertion
 without compromising user privacy
