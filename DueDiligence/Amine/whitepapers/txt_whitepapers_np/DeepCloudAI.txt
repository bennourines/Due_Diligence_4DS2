decentralized cloud computing platform for running decentralized applications specifically what we would consider IoT and Web 3 0 dApps We believe that these are not just trends in the making and are preparing technologies that will support both existing and upcoming use cases for technology Our platform will provide a fully functional marketplace for computing and storage resources for companies and individuals enabling them to share their excess capacity via our decentralized cloud More importantly instead of leaving it up to users to perform p2p matching of the resource transactions we are applying our expertise in AI technologies to create a Matching Engine that will easily and smoothly pair these resources for application developers Applications will execute in a secure sandbox on the peer to peer resources with transactions managed on the blockchain via automated smart contracts Our application marketplace for developers with pre validated applications will speed up development of end to end solutions We believe that our vision to democratize cloud computing and level the playing field for both resource providers and application developers will become one of the pillars of the next generation of internet technologies Stay tuned to our project as we will be releasing more details especially technical implementations and our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before our crowdsale \xe2\x80\x9cOur mission is to democratize cloud computing and level the playing field for cloud resource providers and application developers \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This

compute) Governance Compliance IaaS Storefront Enterprise Resource Provider (shared compute) Figure 1 DeepCloud AI Platform \xe2\x80\x93 Decentralized cloud for IoT and dApps While the cloud industry is already very mature with large players like AWS Google Cloud and Azure their cloud infrastructure is geared towards centralized applications where key resources are running in large centralized data centers These solutions are not suitable for building decentralized peer to peer and IoT applications which have the requirement for computation resources running close to the edge devices for processing the growing volume of data generated at the edge or a cost effective solutions for payment flow for micro transactions executed automatically by the p2p IoT devices as they interact with each other and automate common tasks Similar problems exist for solutions involving complex multi party integration across organizations for example in supply chains government institutions financial institutions Current systems rely heavily on high cost intermediaries and proprietary interfaces which are very costly to build and maintain making it difficult for smaller players and companies to enter into market Many aggregation platforms like Airbnb Uber etc have emerged in recent years with promise for a shared economy with sharing of wealth with the crowd but have soon evolved into centralized behemoths taking large cut and fees (often 30% or higher) for these aggregated services Blockchain the underlying technology behind Bitcoin has emerged as a new disruptive platform to tackle these problems ushering in a new era of \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Value\xe2\x80\x9d vs the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Information\xe2\x80\x9d It is democratizing the internet and leveling the playing field for consumers and business to operate in an increasingly global marketplace DeepCloud AI will democratize the playing field [1] for cloud infrastructure and open up the market for resource provides and application developers to run and deploy their decentralized applications in a cost effective manner Like Golem SONM iExec we are building a decentralized cloud platform and betting on blockchain based cloud solution as the future for decentralized applications Our core differentiator is the use of AI for doing the resource matching between the network resource providers and application developers Further with the extensive industry knowledge and expertise of building Enterprise solutions our core team brings to the table deep insights and know how for Enterprise customers \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This document is proprietary and confidential \x0cMARKET ANALYSIS PAGE 06 Cloud platforms are enabling complex business models and

for running their decentralized applications in the distributed network Every Network User in the platform can customize user services for their applications (like data replication streaming encrypting or computation power hashing) through their user dashboard In addition users can select dApps from the predefined applications from the Application Marketplace Based on these specifications a specific gossip protocol will serve this application This includes o IoT Developers \xe2\x96\xaa Businesses requiring decentralized compute resource close to IoT devices for local processing of data \xe2\x96\xaa Developers offering such IoT application services \xe2\x96\xaa IoT apps that require payment flow micro transactions o Web3 0 dApp Developers \xe2\x96\xaa Seeking scalable blockchain \xe2\x96\xaa Deterministic Fast Finality of Transactions Developer Community Provides open source tools for the IoT and DApp application developers Some of these tools are provided by DeepCloud AI itself other\xe2\x80\x99s will be contributed by the broader community 4 1 Consensus Mechanism and Masternodes DeepCloud AI is based on Proof of Service (PoSe) Masternodes for each cluster schedule tasks between nodes in the same cluster and arrange tasks dependency and execution time between nodes Master nodes works as the brain of the network They have complete visibility into all resources in the network And using DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s AI Matching Engine the controller dynamically configures and assigns the resources based on real time analysis Any consensus in the network would be through master nodes (i e Measuring network states network traffic balance) If any network cluster requires additional resources the allocations would be handled through consensus between master nodes More details of our Masternode implementation can be found in Technology View Section 4 2 AI Matchmaking and Controllers A Matchmaking algorithm is a necessity for any distributed system as decentralized applications require many resources close to the source DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s AI Matching algorithm is based on several parameters including information from network user requests location of usage network contributors\xe2\x80\x99 states in master nodes Each masternode will classify network contributors into clusters based on services Every request will be handled based on the service network states and consensus between masternodes We follow predictive and reactive strategies Reactive approaches measure the current system\xe2\x80\x99s state (i e the current transactions) And predictive approaches aim to predict the future behavior of the system based on the historical dataset We apply statistical and AI models as predictive strategies Most of these algorithms utilize Regression SVM and statistical time series techniques such as ARIMA We define the problem of predicting the resource usage for a given task to be provisioned Several components are integrated with the model (i e scoring task dependency task cost) These are then compared to models suitable for classification using techniques like Bayesian classification \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved

details about matching recommendation in the technical section The AI Controller will analyze every transaction in the network and its effect on the network (e g latency task discarding) From these deep insights the AI Controllers builds strategies for different usage scenarios We use deep learning algorithms like RNN CNN to analyze these scenarios along with Reinforcement Learning for a continuous learning feedback loop with the main target to understand transaction behavior work load patterns and remedy the bottlenecks in the system \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved

(Internet of Things) and dApps which lend themselves to running in a decentralized environment IoT applications require edge computing close to the source something vastly different from today\xe2\x80\x99s cloud computing paradigm which has a bigger focus on scaling the service or offering consistency Like the case of specific license plate detection for tracking a criminal using the video camera on traffic lights as they are running in a high speed chase Such use cases are better handled by doing computation and detection at the edge and only sending the compressed insights back to the central servers instead of flooding the networks with live video streams which can choke the entire neighborhood network We enable resource providers close to the edge such as retail shopping malls or apartment complex residents to share excess capacity of their computer resources on the decentralized cloud close to the city traffic lights making it possible to do these local computations close to the source and enable such use cases With our AI matching engine we match the right resources to the right applications based on real time analytics of the data across the network Other big problem for IoT and dApps is micropayment solution that is cost effective and viable to manage the machine to machine and peer to peer automated transactions on the shared blockchain infrastructure Using our Sidechains and Decentralized Acyclic Graph layer on top of the existing blockchain we provide a mechanism for faster transactions with zero fees for transactions The lack of good marketplaces for reusable components and tools is also directly addressed by our Application Marketplace where we provide a pre validated set of reusable applications and components that dApp developers can use to quickly build their applications With DeepCloud AI we are unlocking the potential of the decentralized application developers so that they can focus on building the core logic for their applications and leave the management of the infrastructure and right tools and components to us A wide range of use cases can be addressed using our platform These include IoT and AI @ Edge scenarios for smart cities so that local governments can focus on building the core infrastructure and rely on DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s resources close to the edge for running and deploying their applications Enterprises and shipping companies with complex supply chain tracking challenges can run and deploy their blockchain based applications on DeepCloud AI fabric for tracking all the transactions with full audit trail secure and tamper proof Service providers like TV/Cable companies can rely on DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized cloud fabric for ondemand decentralized services such as local caching of media streams during Football season or largeaudience events like the Olympics For IoT applications with security and data privacy concerns by running decentralized AI algorithms close to the edge devices themselves one can generate the compressed insights on DeepCloud AI resources This provides mechanism for IoT device consumer\xe2\x80\x99s to monetize their own data with all the transactions and encryption of the data and the algorithms via the blockchain \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This document is proprietary and confidential

resources (compute storage networking) without spinning up own cloud like infrastructure Can participate in Spot Market for spare AWS resources but not outside this walled garden Individuals Can participate on Altruistic Grid computing solution like SETI@Home but not for profit making Can participate in Bitcoin / Cryptocurrency mining but very energy inefficient and resource consuming with no real computational benefit DeepCloud AI Value Proposition Generate revenue from spare excess capacity of compute/storage/networking resources by participating as \xe2\x80\x9cNetwork Resource Provider\xe2\x80\x9d DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s AI based resource matching does proper matching for resources for Network Resource Providers and Consumers close to the location of use DeepCloud AI

Value Prop for Decentralized Application Developers (IoT dApps) Customer Pain Points IoT Developers For Decentralized IoT apps requiring heavy compute requirements need complex infrastructure rollout at each point of use / device deployment Cost prohibitive and big barrier for deployment of such data intensive IoT applications All data must be sent to central cloud / datacenter for processing requiring heavy network bandwidth thereby limiting the deployment scope Too costly to do microtransactions on existing payment gateways for IoT use cases Similar issues for micro transactions on public blockchains like Bitcoin Ethereum were the \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d for writing transactions per block is much higher than the microtransaction itself plus the delays in finality of the block validation make is unusable for many use cases DeepCloud AI Value Proposition DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s AI based resource matching does proper matching for resources for Network Resource Providers and Consumers close to the location of use Application developers can focus on the core business logic for their application instead of worrying about deploying compute resources close to edge device and save costs Deterministic fast block finality makes the solution viable for microtransaction flows DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s DAG based blockchain provides support for zero cost fast deterministic transactions making micropayments viable All transactions done on immutable Blockchain with full traceability No transparency and easy way of running audit trail for resource usage and billing Web3 0 DApp Developers Public blockchains Bitcoin / Ethereum not scalable take too long for blocks to write and finalize No easy mechanism for doing off chain computation or pairing complex logic with smart contracts DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized cloud resource nodes provide the execution power / space for running complex computations off chain Have to build and deploy complete solution by self not many easy to use marketplaces of prevalidated apps and components that can be reused Development tools to jump start application development and deployment Marketplace of pre validated Applications \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This document is proprietary and confidential \x0cDEEPCLOUD AI \xe2\x80\x93 TARGET MARKET PAGE 13 Newly decentralized cloud networks (e g Storj Golem iExec and so on) have sparked the proliferation of decentralized cloud platforms These platforms offer a wide range of decentralized services and allow for the deployment of decentralized applications in a way that more cost efficient than traditional vendors (e g GAE AWS and Azure) They achieve this by providing their platform users with decentralized computing storage and networking resources at a fraction of cost by leveraging the idle resources of end users private data centers or enterprise infrastructure Even though these platforms try to provide a distributed cheap and reliable cloud computing alternative to the existing centralized cloud offerings they are hardly providing any tangible value to their platform users that really differentiate them from the major cloud providers The question is whether we just need more cloud computing platforms or we seek a tangible added value to the users which are not provided by the existing platforms In DeepCloud AI we value the advances and breakthroughs achieved by leveraging the rich set of AI/ML techniques And we find that the existing centralized and decentralized platforms lack the intelligence in resource allocation More specifically they do not leverage the rich set of AI/ML tools that could allow them to intelligently manage and optimize the resources used by their users For example when users provision cloud resources to deploy their applications they usually do not know how much resources they are going to need to fulfil their application purposes (or usage scenarios) with the lowest cost possible On the other hand an AI/ML managed cloud would be able to provide the users with smart recommendations based on their requirements and rich set of historical data Hence in DeepCloud AI we leverage the rich set of academic and industrial experts in cloud computing AI and blockchain technology to aim for filling the gap between traditional and smart cloud computing This is based on a true need that has become very essential for a cloud computing platform to exist that gives the users with enough timely and proactive information to improve cloud usage experience and allow them to have better inputs for efficient decision making In DeepCloud AI we aim to satisfy this emerging need by building a cloud service that provides various AI/ML wrappers (or interfaces) that make available to our users a rich set of information and predictions for them to be able to take better and intelligent decisions \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This document is

people Desktop Grid Computing technology (utilization of nodes) will be implemented on our platform Data will be managed and processed through the nodes that are running on the network in return node holders will earn DEEP tokens Network Resource Providers \xe2\x80\xa2 Network Resource Providers are the people who provide resources to the network and earn DEEP tokens Network Resource Provider is required to stake (lock) up a certain number of DEEP tokens to run the nodes and offer the services to the users who require them This strategy encourages competitions among the network contributors as DeepCloud AI envision an enterprise graded service on our platform The higher the quality of the services of Network Resource Provider the higher the lock up scale and the DEEP they will earn Network Users (Application Developers) \xe2\x80\xa2 Network Users (i e Application Developers) are the people who use our services on DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s platform by spending DEEP tokens they are the main target audience There is a large variety of services the platform provides such as database usage software usage and processing power usage Most importantly all the customers will be provided with a customizable AI functions when utilizing the computing usage Application Marketplace Providers \xe2\x80\xa2 Application Marketplace Providers are the people who provide reusable components for building the decentralized applications and earn DEEP tokens Application Marketplace Providers are required to stake (lock) up a certain number of DEEP tokens for providing reusable components The more the number of developers reusing their components the higher the lock up scale and the DEEP they will earn AI controller \xe2\x80\xa2 Each node (network contributor) has a state in the network The controller assigns each requests (network users) to the nodes Some requests may have more complexity to run over the network controller allocate these requests to run on sidechain or master nodes In addition adjusting the scheduling between tasks to make sure that there is no dependency between the current tasks The controller saves results make sure that every request run on the right cluster work on real time request matching More details about matching recommendation in the technical section \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This document is proprietary and confidential \x0cHOW THE PLATFORM WORKS PAGE 16 8 1 DEEP Tokens DEEP tokens is going to be launched as an ERC 20 tokens in the beginning Since our development is not going to be implement on Ethereum network due to scalability issues DeepCloud AI is going to carry out a \xe2\x80\x98transition process\xe2\x80\x99 with the tokens when we have integrated with a much faster and scalable blockchain Nebulas has been selected as the first blockchain The value of DEEP does not represent our development progress its price is driven and set by the market There are several usages of DEEP tokens on DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s platform 1 Access to the DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s network system 2 Utilize premium features for High End Users 3 Payment means by Network Users and Application Developers 4 Payment method to Network Resource Providers and Application Marketplace Providers Users can acquire DEEP tokens in three ways for the access of DeepCloud AI platform 1 DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s Initial Coin Offering Campaign 2 Cryptocurrency Exchanges 3 Or by becoming Resource provider users can earn tokens from the resources they make available on the platform which they can use as a user for using other services To ensure the liquidity of DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s DEEP tokens a certain number of DEEP tokens is reserved for all the Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Airdrop events This way we can ensure Network Users can access our network in a reasonable price and our tokens will not be dominated by a certain group of users 8 2 Revenue Model DeepCloud AI core service will be free for users Our revenue will be generated from the intrinsic value of the DEEP tokens with the expansion of the user base Additional revenue will be generated by the network resources provided by DeepCloud AI itself for the infrastructure In future we also plan to have tiered service model for Enterprise customers requiring higher levels of SLAs and Security Both the Network Resource Providers and Application Developers will stake DEEP tokens for using the platform services thereby have a built in incentive for honest use and promoting the growth of the network \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All

on building a distributed cloud infrastructure based on the blockchain instead of building a specific service such as unused storage AI computing platform or Database as a service Which were applied in Filecoin DeepBrain Chain and Bluzelle respectively Many challenges affect the performance of a decentralized cloud infrastructure Beginning from syncing between nodes matchmaking algorithm scheduling criteria and fair incentives for any network contributors Moreover load balancing in the network and cost effective in terms of the market supply DeepCloud AI are facing these challenges in different architecture levels The network is built using membership protocols and proof of service to meet user dApps services and node configurations The purpose of choosing membership protocol it allows nodes to discover one another disseminate information quickly and maintain a consistent view across nodes within application cluster In addition to membership protocols the AI controller is based on several aspects (i e sharding sidechains matchmaking algorithm task scheduling load balancing etc ) The main aspects for the controller is sharding and sidechains As the network is self organized and based on the AI The more information one can get from each node the better the network would be These functions do the following tasks 1 Get node State Every node in the network share it is state to controller 2 Collation Analysis The main task to get collation from nodes in different shards (clusters) 3 Network analysis The main purpose is to analysis running smart contracts in the network What network users do in the network In other words what is the current application running in the network This is reflected to master nodes 4 Sidechain analysis Based on the above step specific application could run on sidechain to handle specific issues It is important to keep sidechains states updates with controller As a result we categorized some applications types into several clusters that could be run in each shard in the network like \xe2\x80\xa2 Sharing computation power \xe2\x80\xa2 Multimedia streaming \xe2\x80\xa2 Storage \xe2\x80\xa2 IoT Applications \xe2\x80\xa2

B Shard C Figure 5 Each node shard works on a specific application based on consensus between master nodes The network consists of three main nodes (Master nodes network contributor (worker) nodes and sidechains) Master nodes have the controller and more computing power than normal nodes You can consider them as command centers The master node concept was firstly presented in DASH architecture The Network Resource providers contribute resources which are added as worked nodes to the network These nodes are managed and updated by controller according to network users\xe2\x80\x99 requests At last sidechains are used for scheduling and handling issues in case of any bottlenecks in the network As seen in figure 2 for on demand request several parameters are calculated to choose the best node to do the request Network (worker) nodes would be classified into clusters based on the DApp Figure 6 Each node color represents a specific application in the network \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All

application Developers) use the on demand services for running their decentralized applications in the distributed network Every Network User in the platform can customize user services for their applications (like data replication streaming encrypting or computation power hashing) through their user dashboard In addition users can select dApps from the predefined applications from the Application Marketplace Based on these specifications a specific gossip protocol will serve this application Network Resource Provider On the other side a Network Resource Providers (contributors) are the people who provide resources to the network and earn DEEP tokens A Network Contributor can share storage specific computation power based on the node configuration in network contributors\xe2\x80\x99 dashboard And using the network resource provider dashboard contributors can configure nodes in the network based on the resources they share Master nodes Master nodes works as the brain of the network They have complete visibility into all resources in the network And using DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s AI Matching Engine the controller dynamically configures and assigns the resources based on real time analysis Any consensus in the network would be through master nodes (i e Measuring network states network traffic balance) If any network cluster requires additional resources the allocations would be handled through consensus between master nodes 9 1 2 Fair Incentives In any distributed systems it is challenging to derive bandwidth from Network Resource Providers who operates independently Creating dynamic on demand incentives based on all peers to contribute resources and sharing bandwidth becomes imperative We adopt peer wise proportional fairness scheme to achieve this objective 9 1 3 Failure Detection Network resource providers join the network by sending a request to the platform with the detailed node contribution through the dashboard And they are assigned to the right cluster based on the configurations and load in the network The master nodes coordinate the network ping across the nodes in the cluster and maintain a heart beat to detect failure conditions When a node becomes unreachable it is removed from the cluster and all the application jobs running on it are automatically deployed onto other worker nodes in the cluster \xc2\xa9

large database into smaller faster more easily managed parts called data shards In DeepCloud AI sharding is an important factor for the network performance It is heavily used in partitioning complex queries in the network to make it smaller and faster in the distributed network A global trend in emerging in blockchain/crypto currency space to build sidechains that tie into main chain The properties of sidechains are different for each project We use AI to configure and adjust the roles for sidechains based on real time monitoring for the network and historical data The master nodes for each of the shards are linked with sidechains Defining the role of the sidechains in the network lies on the master nodes for handling any bottlenecks or other issues with the network 9 1 5 Data Replication and Integrity DeepCloud AI is building an API for data storage to make it easier for application developers to take backup of their data and integrate with other decentralized storage options Additionally we are also simplifying the data migration between centralized storage into distributed storage system 9 1 6 Load balancing The core of the decentralized cloud is based on AI Real time data is recorded for each transaction occur in the network As mentioned sharding and resource allocation are dynamically configured based on the network status Moreover adjusting running services queues with priority to balance the network traffic Furthermore nodes are classified into clusters if there is an issue in any cluster master nodes manage network traffic Usually there are two scenarios The first scenario master node use nodes from sidechains to handle the load imbalance issue The second scenario master node rely on the Network Contributors when network contributor share resources in the network Network Contributors have the option to specify the node for a specific purpose Alternatively the nodes can be set to dynamic and hence more return This guarantee that the nodes in the network would be configured based on the network requirements in real time 9 1 7 AI Controller & Matching algorithm A Matchmaking algorithm is a necessity for any distributed system Further Decentralized applications require many resources close to the source DeepCloud AI\xe2\x80\x99s AI Matching algorithm is based on several parameters including information from network user requests location of usage network contributors\xe2\x80\x99 states in master nodes In addition each masternodes classify network contributors into clusters based on services Every request will be handled based on the service network states and consensus between masternodes \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This document is proprietary and confidential \x0cTECHNOLOGY VIEW PAGE 21

security needs for Enterprise customers DeepCloud AI is building a secure layer around Intel\xe2\x80\x99s SGX technology We are also developing selective partnerships with Security providers on our Application Marketplace to provide a range of services for different types of application needs For Enterprise customers DeepCloud AI intends to use Intel SGX based security for providing software accreditation that helps make sure DeepCloud code is running on the system without compromise DeepCloud is partnering with Hardware providers to enable this DeepCloud Integrity code is uploaded via the Linux kernel into a seperate Enclave whose memory is protected from the kernel and all other system software DeepCloud runs the monitoring code in user space which calls SGX Enclave code that itself monitors the integrity of the monitoring code All requests to the DeepCloud backend uses TLS and requires the SGX Enclave code to sign the request Thus making sure the Deep application data that is with DeepCloud is not compromised 9 1 10 Application Registry Reusable application components speed up the development cycle for application developers Application Marketplace providers publish their components on the Application Registry which makes it easy for developers to search and deploy these components for their applications \xc2\xa9 2018 DeepCloud AI All Rights Reserved This

complement each other First Golem was aiming to become the world\ s first Decentralized Super computer with an initial vision to attract 3D artists animators and designers iExec came after with vision to create a cloud marketplace for users and dApps built on Ethereum and relying on offchain computations At last SONM shine as an alternative work provider through running services in the marketplace DeepCloud AI share\xe2\x80\x99s the same vision of the future of decentralized cloud computing We believe in integration with existing computing resources for existing infrastructure like Storj Filecoin etc Meanwhile we are defining the purpose of each node in the network to serve in the application according to the shared resources This guarantees fair incentives On the other hand we serve the decentralized cloud for several purposes (i e Sharing storage running AI codes data streaming etc) All the nodes in our cloud are configurable and we using our AI Matching Engine for proper
