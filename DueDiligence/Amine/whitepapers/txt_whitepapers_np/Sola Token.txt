https //sola foundation 27 2 \x0cSummary Sola is the next generation decentralized social platform that incentivizes and benefits all involved parties \xe2\x80\x94 users third party developers and the core team The name Sola is an acronym for \xe2\x80\x9csocial layer \xe2\x80\x9d Sola is an open ecosystem which means that most of its source code will be made open source and available for audit improvement and usage by anyone This document outlines Sola\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental principles structure and its economic and usage aspects for involved parties https //sola foundation 3 \x0cBackground The most criticized aspect of centralized social networks is the way they handle user data and privacy This is unlikely to come as a surprise given that almost 100 percent revenue of social networks comes from displaying ads to their users based on the user data We consider this as a symptom and not the root cause The root cause it that networks are reluctant to see their largest and most important audience users as their full partners We think that users shall have the right to benefit from the networks as do advertisers and network owners There have been a number of attempts (and they are not ceasing) to build an open sourced or a decentralized social network that pushes the concept and the business model of social media beyond the existing incumbents It is worth mentioning app net (paid open source Twitter rip off) and Diaspora (distributed rudimentary Facebook clone) The most notable contenders today are Akasha (decentralized rudimentary Facebook rip off) and Steemit (Reddit clone powered by cryptocurrency) We do not consider these and other decentralized social network attempts as serious contenders in the social space Despite modern architecture they are falling short on the two most important levels \xe2\x80\x94 comparable or superior user experience (ideally of the new users) and a solid underlying business model There are two examples that fit into our defined criteria that a nextgeneration social media contender should meet \xe2\x80\x94 Status and Kin However both of them use a messenger form factor while we at Sola use a modified social network approach https //sola foundation 4 \x0cWe think that the social network approach is more likely to succeed than the messenger approach as public communications are easier to monetize than private communications Furthermore it requires a lesser user base in order to become valuable and the value of a social network grows faster than the value of a messenger Ilya and Pavel Sola\xe2\x80\x99s co founders have been working together since 2011 when they established a new venture for innovative social products development The first project of a photo based social network We Heart Pics lost to Instagram and was shut down despite its 3M users The next project was Plague a social experiment that was started to find out if people were ready to communicate and collaborate with strangers in a constructive and respectful way It has been running for almost 3 years and now it is ready to come out of its infancy phase with a 650K user base Sola is successor to the Plague experiment and a major upgrade enabled by the blockchain capabilities Sola has inherited Plague\xe2\x80\x99s unique approach and proven social mechanics together with all the data and the user base We have created Sola in an attempt to succeed in our mission \xe2\x80\x94 to democratize access to the audience and to allow all involved parties to benefit from it In this White Paper we intend to outline our approach to a nextgeneration social network that uses decentralization because this necessary infrastructure element enables new approach implementation rather than \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralize it while it\xe2\x80\x99s hot\xe2\x80\x9d approach https //sola foundation 5 \x0cSocial Information Network There are two general types of social media \xe2\x80\x94 messengers and social networks Messengers are private networks as they are mostly used for private communications and their content is private by default Private communications are not considered in this paper Legacy social networks (Facebook Twitter etc ) can be categorized as semi public networks Despite most of their content being public you are required to establish connections with other users in order to receive information without which such semi public networks are useless By making connections you define your content However instead of choosing information directly you choose sources of information You effectively create filter bubbles for yourself The system is restricted by its own rules and it cannot show the content that falls out of filters Moreover legacy social networks were initially intended for communication among friends so their feeds are a heavy mix of general and personal content Reddit comes closest to our definition of a social information network Its content is not intended for friends but for the consumption by general audience It does not require users to establish connections to use the service and it still provides a way to fine tune the received results Reddit has one of the most visited resources on the net despite the fact that it has not changed a lot in the last 12 years and was not fully aware of the Mobile First concept at least in 2011 Thus there are a lot of possibilities Sola is a public social information network with a strong financial incentive for all involved parties to follow the rules of the network and to develop it together Its content is produced by quality oriented users for the global audience instead of just the user\xe2\x80\x99s friends Summarizing the above written statements it is safe to call social information networks as a hybrid of a social and a media network https //sola foundation 6 \x0cEconomy Layer Attention has its price The amount of information created daily is growing exponentially In digital economy information production and spread cost is close to zero At the same time attention is a finite resource and cannot be stretched \xe2\x80\x94 you cannot read 100 books or look through 1 000 000 of pictures in just one day It leads to growth of resource (attention) deficit and subsequently a continuous increase of its cost Most of the real sector economy is directly connected to the attention economy It is not enough to create information produce a good or a service \xe2\x80\x94 you need to attract user\xe2\x80\x99s attention The current model of attention distribution totally ignores attention producer/owner (aka user) excluding them from the economy This will inevitably change in the nearest future Sola economy is built on the principle of ethical use of attention Attention is the new currency https //sola foundation 7 \x0cSOL Token To empower Sola economy we issue SOL tokens based on the ERC20 standard Long term viability of a platform depends on the viability of its economy and it is essential to be able to control it and influence its value with our own growing economy development and overall progress Bitcoin and Ethereum are huge economies in themselves and by using these currencies we will become completely dependent on their state and fluctuations SOL is a pure utility token and the only currency used for transactions on the Sola platform \xe2\x80\xa2 Possession of a token has no benefits other than monetary \xe2\x80\xa2 Sola ecosystem exclusively uses SOL for transactions \xe2\x80\xa2 Revenue in other currencies is converted into SOL through crypto exchanges \xe2\x80\xa2 Users\xe2\x80\x99 and developers\xe2\x80\x99 earnings and rewards are provided in SOL \xe2\x80\xa2 Third party services built on the Sola platform should use SOL \xe2\x80\xa2 Purchasing of additional services on Sola app (cards exposed to more users action points ad free experience) You can obtain SOL tokens in the following ways \xe2\x80\xa2 Buy during Token Sale \xe2\x80\xa2 Earn tokens by creating quality content endorsed by other users in Sola app \xe2\x80\xa2 Earn tokens as a node owner providing for the service distribution \xe2\x80\xa2 Earn tokens by taking part in the Bounty Development Program improving Sola platform and Sola app \xe2\x80\xa2 Procure or trade tokens for different currency on the crypto exchange Sola economic system is a hybrid of an internal crypto economy powered by own token and external revenue streams with different monetization methods powered by a variety of currencies https //sola foundation 8 \x0cOur idea is simple in the current state of the crypto market it is still possible to make money out of thin air for a while using speculative approach to ensure token value but it cannot serve as a long term sustainable business model The bubble will pop someday To cover our expenses and fulfill our obligations to customers partners and employees we have to earn money In contrast to the critics of centralized social networks we do not think advertising business model is \xe2\x80\x9cbroken\xe2\x80\x9d It is unequal to the user and it can be significantly improved with the implementation of a crypto economy but it is definitely not broken SOL other currencies We are not trying to find a substitution for the advertising model we converge it with fair treatment of users https //sola foundation 9 \x0cRevenue streams Sola has a number of revenue streams \xe2\x80\xa2 Native advertising (third party networks at the early stage) \xe2\x80\xa2 Pay per engagement model (connectors for 3rd party services that want to benefit their users for engagement \xe2\x80\x94 games apps \xe2\x80\xa2 Custom ad hoc campaigns \xe2\x80\xa2 User purchases for services built on Sola Platform (Action Points ad free accounts additional exposure) \xe2\x80\xa2 SOL transactions commission \xe2\x80\xa2 Token sale (limited capacity) Stack and card format makes Sola app a perfect fit for native advertising The frequency of ads displayed will be defined by tests At the moment we consider that user will not see more than 2\xe2\x80\x933 ad cards per day which is much less than what other social media can suggest What makes Sola platform unique is the fact that users will be interested in boosting advertising on the network as this has an effect on their potential earnings and the value of SOL Depending on the commercial stage of the platform functionality and its audience size we forecast the following APRU ARPU USD est Stage functionality 0 1\xe2\x80\x930 2 Third party advertising network 0 3\xe2\x80\x930 7 Establishing direct relations with first tier advertisers Adding special ad hoc projects 0 8\xe2\x80\x931 2 Replacing third party advertising network with direct advertising self\xe2\x80\x91service platform Adding new formats of advertising action cards 1 2\xe2\x80\x932+ Launch of connector platform enables \xe2\x80\x9cpay per engagement model\xe2\x80\x9d https //sola foundation 10 \x0cThe platform suggests an opportunity to create third party services using Sola developments infrastructure and audience It might as well be existing business integration like an online shop or a brand new service Partners shall use SOL for the transactions within such services with the platform holding its fee Sola app provides a range of paid services including an ad free version and Action Points purchase Users are Partners It is critical for a social service to create quality content This is why we consider content creators as partners and we share with them a part of our revenue Revenue distribution between the content creators is performed based on the \xe2\x80\x9cendorsement\xe2\x80\x9d given by other users in Sola app To give the content creators additional motivation and to accelerate platform\xe2\x80\x99s economic development 18% of all emitted tokens will be transferred to the content creators using the Sola app endorsement mechanism Once the token sale is over these tokens will be evenly distributed (transferred to the users) over the next 365 days ATTENTION SOL token ownership does not influence and is not connected to the platform revenue distribution interest in revenue the rights or the votes regarding any issues etc SOL token is the platform\xe2\x80\x99s currency used as a reward for the content creator and nothing else https //sola foundation 11 \x0cContent Layer Stacks and Cards Sola uses a stack of fullscreen containers for information \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ccards\xe2\x80\x9d instead of legacy social networks traditional feed format User always sees one item of information at a time Tinder like gesture based mechanism is used to go through stacks This stack implementation ensures higher user engagement with the content compared to feed concept Card format provides an opportunity to unify user experiences regardless of the card content and it is flexible enough to present any type of information Cards can consist from one to several \xe2\x80\x9cpages\xe2\x80\x9d allowing the users to portray large amount of information Ubiquitous Cardification We think that any content can be presented as cards We were the first to use the unified card format when the project was launched in 2014 We are happy to see that other social services are beginning to grasp its value from the point of user experience as well as good monetization opportunity \xe2\x80\x94 Instagram stories for photos Twitter Moments for short form content Medium Series for longreads etc Over these three years we have conducted a series of experiments and have gathered a significant amount of data which helped us understand the way the format is used and the way it can be simplified The latter is critical for consumer services ML (Machine Learning) and NLP (Natural Language Processing) give us an opportunity to automate raw content to cards conversion in part or in whole We call this process cardification The degree of cardification varies depending on the source content and user needs With any kind of cardification user can edit the result and add information https //sola foundation 12 \x0cBasic cardification is used to convert links and standardized data from third party services When you add a link a card with the link and the title is created where all relevant source media elements are stored allowing user to decorate their card Third party service data is formatted and cleared of all excessive meta data (YouTube videos Instagram photos Facebook posts tweets etc) ARTICLE IN BROWSER LINK PASTED TO SOLA LINK WITH CHOSEN PICTURE Complete cardification is used when the user wants to take advantage of all source content When such source is added the algorithms automatically make a decision about the type of basic card templates to use their number and their arrangement It is under development now and is not available in the current public version of the app ARTICLE IN BROWSER https //sola foundation LINK PASTED TO SOLA 13 \x0cAssisted cardification is the result of AI Summarize work an algorithm that we have developed which is best for medium and large amounts of text data processing (articles longreads etc ) Based on the explicit indication from user AI Summarize performs the semantic parsing of the source data and finds the parts which are essential to get the gist of the text The result of this processing is ten or less cards containing the most important ideas of the source text with the least possible loss of useful information The algorithm currently supports nine languages English French German Italian Spanish Czech Dutch Turkish and Swedish Article in browser Link pasted to Sola AI Summarization applied Basic Card Templates Core platform functionality The platform supports the following basic data types \xe2\x80\xa2 Text Card (up to 250 characters) \xe2\x80\xa2 Link (title with URL) \xe2\x80\xa2 Poll (up to 5 options) \xe2\x80\xa2 Media (image video gif) These data types can be used in any combination Card templates are automatically selected as new content is added to achieve the most attractive presentation For example the font size is automatically reduced as more text or a media element is added to the card https //sola foundation 14 \x0cA card can consist of several pages containing any data in any combination The core team has developed various templates which should cover basic user needs TEXT CARDS \xe2\x80\x94 THE SIMPLEST FORMAT UP TO 250 CHARACTERS FOR 1 PAGE OF A CARD LINK CARDS \xe2\x80\x94 THEY ALLOW EXTERNAL LINK ATTACHMENT TO THE CARD MEDIA CARDS WITH EMBEDDED PHOTOS VIDEOS AND GIFS POLL CARD UP TO 5 OPTIONS https //sola foundation 15 \x0cCustom Card Templates 3rd party developer\xe2\x80\x99s custom card types Access to the content layer is fully open to third party developers (paperwork is under development) This means that the platform allows creation and adjustment of card templates to fit the needs of a particular user and will be automatically available for all users Templates are generic and can be used by anyone and are not limited to the author EXAMPLE 1 AMAZON\xe2\x80\x99S PRODUCT PAGE DEFAULT TEMPLATE https //sola foundation CUSTOM TEMPLATE 16 \x0cEXAMPLE 2 NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE DEFAULT TEMPLATE CUSTOM TEMPLATE Now the reader can skim read the essential points of the chosen article using the cards and there is no need to read through the whole text If the reader finds the content of the cards particularly interesting then they can follow the link to the source article and read it more carefully https //sola foundation 17 \x0cEXAMPLE 3 APP PAGE IN APP STORE DEFAULT TEMPLATE https //sola foundation CUSTOM TEMPLATE 18 \x0cAdvanced Card Templates Core platform functionality + 3rd party development Our Roadmap includes complex interactive cards development and implementation phase These cards will use smartphone sensors and external data like user location and smartphone movements time of day weather etc First of all such opportunities are aimed at enhancing user engagement in the card content and then as commercial benefit for the ad providers and platform partners EXAMPLE 1 CARD WITH INTERACTIVITY PROVIDED BY PHONE SENSORS https //sola foundation EXAMPLE 2 PAID CONTENT WITH A SUBSCRIPTION OR PAY PER CARD MODEL 19 \x0cEXAMPLE 3 SHOPPING CARD WITH ABILITY TO PAY IN SOL EXAMPLE 4 PAID APP INSTALLS AND PAY PER ENGAGEMENT MODEL Third party developers will take part in this phase They will obtain a part of revenue from these formats commercial use A number of opportunities will be open to use within basic and custom templates once support at the platform level is on https //sola foundation 20 \x0cDistribution Layer Incoherence Principle Unlike traditional social networks Sola does not require user interconnection Content distribution is controlled by the algorithms that uses user overt actions as correctors and amplifiers The necessity to perform actions is embedded into the service as its basic mechanics (user needs to make decision on the current card to move to the next card) This allows gathering larger amount of data per user compared to other social networks This approach gives the platform a huge advantage regarding user engagement and retention of the new users who can get a quality experience from the beginning Our current proprietary spread algorithm began as simple information spread for N nearby users and was under improvement based on real data for the last 3 years Now it takes into account many parameters such as text content basic analysis user relationships geographical location UTC language etc One of the key elements of this algorithm is the infection index of the card creator within the system and of those users who supported in spreading the card At the time of writing users are testing the algorithm while fine tuning with priority filters that are aimed at certain users https //sola foundation 21 \x0cNeutral AI Some time ago we started working on the new spread algorithm which uses neural networks based on deep learning The end result we are planning to achieve is called Neutral AI Its task is to select knowledge domains in the whole amount of data understand the structure of the certain knowledge domain and either reject useless information or suggest the widest possible range of opinions in this domain depending on the certain knowledge domain and the set rules EXAMPLE 1 INFORMATION REJECTION EXAMPLE 2 A RANGE OF OPINIONS Within the \xe2\x80\x9cTech\xe2\x80\x9d knowledge Within the \xe2\x80\x9cPolitics\xe2\x80\x9d knowledge domain we select the \xe2\x80\x9ciPhone\xe2\x80\x9d domain we select topics from and \xe2\x80\x9cAndroid\xe2\x80\x9d topics We start \xe2\x80\x9cUSA Politics\xe2\x80\x9d sub domain to consider them and suggest the the \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats\xe2\x80\x9d and the user the cards selected from each \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans\xe2\x80\x9d An event occurs topic Based on the user\xe2\x80\x99s reaction which is identified as related to the we understand whether that user \xe2\x80\x9cUSA Politics\xe2\x80\x9d sub domain In this is interested in the information case while taking into account the about Android or not In this essence of Neutral AI we consider case Neutral AI (according to the that we cannot restrict the range of set rules) knows that for these opinions and thus strive to suggest topics there is no need to suggest the user all cards from the topics a range of opinions and strives to related to both the \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats\xe2\x80\x9d protect the user from unnecessary and the \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans\xe2\x80\x9d providing information full information and keeping the user out of the filter bubble Neutral AI logic and code will be documented It will be open for review and suggestions for everyone so that any prejudice and concern about the algorithm neutrality can be eliminated https //sola foundation 22 \x0cCollective Machine Learning Key problem in Machine learning is lack of marked datasets Our solution is the category tree that reflects user\xe2\x80\x99s main interest domains Classification algorithms allow us to set up a correspondence to the category tree for most of the analyzed information and to verify this correspondence with the help of the users The users taking part in the Neutral AI learning program will receive a certain percentage of all operations within the involved knowledge domain corresponding to their contribution to the learning process We expect that this will allow us to engage a significant part of the platform audience into the learning program Such category tree compilation requires a significant amount of work and expertise in each topic and domain We expect to engage professional institutions in this process using the above mentioned reward scheme for each knowledge domain that they can help develop and improve Neutral AI can work in parallel or over the existing spread algorithm allowing us to perform the learning and implementation by modules focusing on those knowledge domains where the platform possesses more content and in development in which it takes greater interest https //sola foundation 23 \x0cArchitecture Layer Launched in 2014 the service involved logical decentralization This means that the users independently processed the available amount of information An outburst of interest for blockchain technology and its drastic development has led us to a point where blockchain implementation into the mass user service is both feasible and justified This is why we have made a decision to decentralize the service at the architecture level Why decentralize All social services that we use are centralized and controlled by a small group of people which makes them consequently and potentially impartial At the same time democratic principles make it inevitable that sooner or later an independent social service will be created Moreover such attempts are regularly taken (see more detailed info) From a functional point of view decentralization has the following main advantages \xe2\x80\xa2 A decentralized service is better in fighting blocking attempts and both self and external censorship \xe2\x80\xa2 It can significantly lower platform service charges if wisely implemented \xe2\x80\xa2 It allows restriction of service creators influence subsequently becoming better fitting for end users and third party developers engagement into its development \xe2\x80\xa2 Using cryptocurrencies is much more flexible and less costly than operating fiat currencies at the payment layer https //sola foundation 24 \x0cWe are carrying out transfer from the current centralized model to the decentralized and distributed architecture step by step Stage 1 \xe2\x80\x94 token issue which leads to creation and start of the economic development Stage 2 \xe2\x80\x94 operations decentralization on blockchain Stage 3 \xe2\x80\x94 media data handling decentralization Stage 4 \xe2\x80\x94 providing distributed operations via nodes Decentralized Media Storage Media data (pictures video other card data) can be preliminarily stored via IPFS which will allow content to be available anywhere IPFS is a good solution for fail safe systems The key risk is a relatively low access speed which will significantly affect user experience and can appear not to be enough for the highload consumer service For quick access to post media and data content available via IPFS the CDN server can be used This could cut data receipt time dramatically https //sola foundation 25 \x0cmain node country nodes Distributed Immutable Service (Nodes) Country nodes shall be used to build a distributed service Any user after the installation of the special software will be able to become a node for the platform and use excessive power of their PC to provide for its performance servicing users located nearest in their country As a reward such user will get a certain percentage of all transactions with SOL within their node Nodes give two huge advantages to the platform \xe2\x80\xa2 Platform maintenance becomes significantly cheaper which means that costs can be reduced and the freed resources can be used for user payments and other purposes \xe2\x80\xa2 Fail safe operation in case a node goes offline (including the main node) and in case of the country node isolation (i e service operation will remain intact when the Great Firewall of China is on) https //sola foundation 26 \x0cModeration and Censorship Our more than 10 years of experience in the social services domain has shown us that there is no way they can exist without moderation An importance of centralized moderation is best shown by the examples of Facebook and Twitter Moderation is one of the forms of censorship and claims of some services that they have no censorship are either evidence of a populist statement or of complete ignorance about the basic principles of social media Moderation allows us to ensure safe and non toxic environment which is extremely important for a social service that only has public content To avoid abuse of power or becoming the blind tool of censorship moderation shall be carried out as per publically stated rules In case of Sola the two level moderation model is used \xe2\x80\xa2 Centralized moderation provided by the team\xe2\x80\x99s own forces \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralized pseudo moderation at user level where users can prohibit publishing the content which they think is improper This tool can effectively reduce the audience for improper content like nudity and violence Unfortunately it can be pretty useless when dealing with racism bullying and other such content which is often highly supported Our view is that ensuring comfortable and safe environment for public communication should be one of the priorities for the social service even if it involves certain unpopular decisions https //sola foundation 27 \x0cJoint Development Open for a Purpose Social services market is one of the most competitive ones The latest major players Instagram (2010) and Snapchat (2011) were founded more than 6 years ago making use of mass user migration from PCs to smartphones \xe2\x80\x94 a window of opportunities missed by the largest market players We think that the drastic growth of decentralized services is comparable to this window potential The very nature of a decentralized service suggests that it ideally fits to attract and develop users and other involved parties own services It is hard to fight for users and talents with the existing services that have many users and resources It is not enough to produce a free product equal in quality and user experience One can attract allies by providing them with two kinds of motivation \xe2\x80\x94 financial and ideological and they go together From an ideological point of view we have created a social layer \xe2\x80\x94 an integrated social space which is defined and controlled by the actions of all being owned by none We are intentionally striving for restricting the core development team\xe2\x80\x99s influence keeping all current developments as open sourced as possible Our task is to build the system in such a manner that it could be self regulated with no external intrusion or as little as possible From a financial point of view we consider it as pure necessity to acknowledge all involved parties (users third party developers and the core development team) as equal partners and grant every participant an opportunity to make profit from their contribution to the network development https //sola foundation 28 \x0cUser Layer Users are provided with following three main profit making scenarios \xe2\x80\xa2 Receiving endorsement for user created content (cards comments) by other users (see more in Sola application) \xe2\x80\xa2 Using own resources to ensure distributed immutable service (see more in Distributed immutable service (Nodes)) \xe2\x80\xa2 Contributing to Neutral AI learning and data separation (see more in Collective Machine Learning) Developer Layer API documented in detail is the the first major milestone after the launch of the service Gradually most of the existing code will be documented and open sourced Third party developers are also provided with the following three main profit making scenarios \xe2\x80\xa2 Content Layer (see more in Custom card templates and Advanced card templates) and Distribution Layer (see more in Neutral AI) development \xe2\x80\xa2 Core platform and Core App improvement via Bounty Development Program \xe2\x80\xa2 Own services development based on Sola capabilities and infrastructure (see more in the next section) During the first quarter of 2018 we are planning to launch the Bounty Development Program which will enable the Core Dev Team to act as a customer and outsource some of the tasks to the experts that are unavailable or impractical to be hired as permanent team members Besides the program will allow the engaged users to build teams enabling them to make joint requests for development supported by financial obligations https //sola foundation 29 \x0cEXAMPLE 1 CORE TEAM SPONSORED DEVELOPMENT EXAMPLE 2 USER SPONSORED DEVELOPMENT Core team wants to make the Some users think that the service process of setting up and running has to have an Instagram like a decentralized node as smooth pinch zoom function Core as possible but the design unit development team does not is overloaded Thus a bounty for consider this request as their an improved interface is declared first priority and it goes to the for node installer and client This Bounty Development Program decision is made after taking a vote where the users who want this of existing node holders function to be included fund SOL to the request deposit for its implementation While the amount of reward is growing some third party developer solves this task and once the code is approved it is implemented into the platform and the reward is released to the developer\xe2\x80\x99s account Sola as Social Layer Being the Core Dev Team we are focused entirely on platform development opportunities and the increase of its audience However we are completely aware of the fact that both users and advertisers are interested in communication as well as making profit Open Social Layer concept intends that we grant third parties free and unrestricted access to the users (the right to address the users not the right to deal with their personal data) and the platform infrastructure to create https //sola foundation 30 \x0cown services The key points here are platform reputation and trust and we are able to provide all necessary elements to build quality relationships \xe2\x80\xa2 Open source code \xe2\x80\xa2 Public API \xe2\x80\xa2 Universal payment layer based on cryptocurrency Our own Sola app is the first service built on the platform and its purpose is to demonstrate platform abilities attract interest and audience to the platform The only condition to use the platform is an obligation to utilize SOL tokens as a means of payment It does not mean that the platform is unable to work with other crypto and fiat currencies However it means that once received they are to be converted to SOL When a withdrawal for SOL is made it can be converted into any other currency at the discretion of the service EXAMPLE 1 THIRD PARTY SERVICE BUILT IN SOLA APP EXAMPLE 2 EXTERNAL THIRD\xe2\x80\x91PARTY SERVICE USING SOLA PLATFORM BUT NOT SOLA APP Sola\xe2\x80\x99s content spread logic is fits Someone decides to make a truly perfectly for the early influencers user friendly and social movie detection Third party service recommendation app Users swipe allows investing in influencers for through the movie database cards the share in their future profits and user generated cards like Relations are regulated by smart \xe2\x80\x9c5 best sci fi movies of all time\xe2\x80\x9d contracts Investing interface can one by one making

discussions and receive service developer Anyone who can better tailored recommendations see the widget can add it to their after a while own profile which results in widget adoption in a viral way https //sola foundation 31 \x0cSola App At the end of 2014 we launched Plague \xe2\x80\x94 a decentralized social and information network where information spread among users as per epidemic propagation model Sola app is an evolution of this service and has inherited its data audience interface and logic which are expanded and upgraded with the Sola platform resources The app is quite simple and crystal clear from the user experience point of view Instead of traditional feeds Sola uses a stack of cards So the user always sees only one card on the screen and is able to switch to the next only after making their decision on the current card Gesture based Tinder like interface is used to switch between cards Every card can either be ignored or \xe2\x80\x9cendorsed\xe2\x80\x9d which

Acquisition Content Creators and their Audience Content creators are both the key asset of a social network and one of the drivers of its development Sola allows content creators to get direct financial benefit \xe2\x80\x94 money reward which stimulates acquisition of quality content creators Our aim is to create the most favorable conditions for the largest possible content creator audience so that content creators are motivated to create quality content on our platform which are \xe2\x80\xa2 There is no entrance threshold You can make money from the start The cryptocurrency payment layer allows us to implement both automated and financially effective logic for paying any amount of reward \xe2\x80\xa2 There is no need to make new connections first as there is no such notion \xe2\x80\x94 our spread algorithm will take care of that while assisting the user to utilize the existing audience \xe2\x80\xa2 There is no need to become a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d creator to monetize your content Any comment or card allow users to make profit Many people have large audiences on those services where they are registered and which they use to spread their content \xe2\x80\x94 social networks blogs etc A lot of these users have thousands and thousands of followers but they lack direct monetization tools with the exception of contextual advertising or direct relationships with advertisers However there are no other direct monetization tools for small and medium \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d creators not to mention regular users Amongst other things the above mentioned creators can also be highly financially motivated to use Sola and to attract their followers onto the platform explicitly or implicitly benefiting both from the content they create as well as referral programs https //sola foundation 34 \x0cAutomated Referral Program Mobile phone verification and SOL cryptocurrency allows us to set referral programs for acquisition of new users ensuring transparency and effectively stimulating program members As part of this program Sola\xe2\x80\x99s current users are rewarded for attracting new users who follow their links to the content and the service itself A member who is attracts new users receives Action Points for each visit made by these new users More Action Points are awarded if the new users register on the platform In addition to this the member of the program receives a certain percentage of SOL earned by the new user for some time period A big advantage of our approach to referral program\xe2\x80\x99s implementation is that there is no need of special referral codes or any explicit participation in the program in general Any user spreading information beyond the network automatically becomes the member of the program and gets a detailed view of all granted rewards https //sola foundation 35 \x0cToken Sale SOL tokens are issued and put into circulation for Sola\xe2\x80\x99s platform launch and
