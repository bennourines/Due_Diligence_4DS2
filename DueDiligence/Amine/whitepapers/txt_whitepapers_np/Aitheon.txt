33 4 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Preface This White Paper provides a general outline for the Aitheon platforms its goals and token Due to the complexities involved in Robotics and Artificial intelligence this paper will not be delving into the intricacies of the underlying neural networks and deep or machine learning algorithms but will be presenting a more palatable broader definition of understanding Aitheon will be releasing a Tech Paper in Q2 covering the underlying functionality of Aitheon and its subsystems in technical detail Items in this White Paper will change as a function of time and token holder voting to help direct and create a living business plan for the continued development of Aitheon as described in this document Societal Challenges & Concerns with AI and Robotics Increasing organization costs and tightening margins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bHiring employees time management \xe2\x80\x8band \xe2\x80\x8bdelegation of tasks\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d are listed among the \xe2\x80\x9c14 most common small business challenges\xe2\x80\x9d according to \xe2\x80\x8bSmall Business Bonfire\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bEmployees don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for salary cuts they ask for raises Overhead costs only increase and vendors will send year end notices about their new costly price structure Distractions of mundane business operations take attention away from opportunities for growth Worker displacement due to automation With the rise of employee wages businesses often turn to automation The growth of automation makes some employees obsolete If they are unable to perform certain functions they will be replaced Limited opportunities in emerging economies With geopolitically isolated populations the location of an individual\ s birth is one of the most significant factors dictating vertical growth opportunities to better a familial cycle of poverty Universal basic income/robot taxes \xe2\x80\x8bThe idea of universal basic income and/or robot taxes have been proposed by governments around the world as the way to solve worker displacement In reality this only creates a circular problem which will increase tax burdens for businesses Technological Obsolescence Due to constant technological updates business owners governments and professionals are realizing that they need help to stay abreast of the trends Digital solutions are constantly evolving but are time consuming to acquire and adopt and are therefore costly to implement At present no cohesive platform exists for a user employing AI or robotics without him or her being highly knowledgeable in computer science or engineering Currently if users wish to incorporate AI or robotics in a business or consumer setting they will require programming and integrations by third parties into existing platforms These options provide lackluster performance and the ability to perform only the limited programmed solution If users want additional dependent based outcomes or variables they will be required to engage third parties to program and provide additional integrations 5 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 When using AI in the banking industry there is also no simple way for businesses and individuals to render or collect payment for services billed or provided in these types of operations Current methods of payment are based on banking institutions that are not willing to allow AI automated transactions This means relying on checks wires or credit cards for payment and waiting for them to arrive and/or settle This settlement can take days or weeks Meanwhile businesses exposure to risk and financial ruin is increased and businesses and individuals have accepted that this risk placed upon them without a choice Currently the financial industry uses multiple intermediaries to process a transaction and the seller Even though there can be an immediate response from the client that allows the seller to believe that the transaction is good the seller can be left without payment for the goods that just left their store This fraud happens to many people in many ways chargeback forged fiat bad checks stolen cards and many other forms Aitheon Solutions Leveraging AI and robotics to reduce organization costs We believe that individuals and organizations should be able to pursue their passions and not be distracted by complex back end business functions Aitheon allows its business users to spend the majority of their time doing what they do best while Aitheon automates their needs through the Artificial Intelligent platform coupled with optional physical robotics and devices \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon and its blockchain\xe2\x80\x93based ecosystem will serve as a vehicle to solve most of these critical problems Many businesses and individuals don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the true power they can wield because of the traditionally accepted barriers that they face Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s initial customer base will be businesses and individual users using Aitheon Tokens to conduct business within the platform Possession of this Aitheon Token (AIC) will immediately enable various specific services Those services in turn will allow them to work with other people AI or robots that have already been activated on the platforms For example two people who routinely do business with one another could enter the Aitheon platform by possessing Aitheon Tokens and the these two individuals would no longer have to involve themselves with accounts payable accounts receivable or any other mechanics of the actual business transactions Instead Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s platform smart contracts robots and AI can perform the transactions automatically or on an owner approval basis until the business owner is comfortable with the AI handling their transactions Actual exchanges of inventory payment shipping manufacturing fulfillment and updates to bookkeeping would occur without need for owner input This can be done through unlimited ways including point of sale devices reservation/appointment setting AI and accounts receivable all driven by the Aitheon Token (AIC) In this way the Aitheon platform acts as a mechanism to achieve goals or tasks By possessing an Aitheon Token a token holder is granted entry into the blockchain based Aitheon ecosystem Utilizing smart contracts Aitheon will provide contracted solutions to a distributed cluster of customers agents and devices that use our token as a method to exchange services Businesses and individuals can deploy these agents services and devices to perform work on their behalf and also to barter with and pay humans robots and deep 6 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 learning agents on the platform for work performed directly and without managerial involvement needed Retraining today\ s workforce for the automated era \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon propels forward blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s existing paradigm for mining by combining mining with the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal steps\xe2\x80\x9d of AI business processes solutions AI and robotics can do only so much in executing a business process \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps 90 99% The remaining 1 10% of a business process requires some sort of human interaction Consider human resources In that process machines robotics and AI can complete 90% of the steps to search recruit and prequalify a candidate to fill a position Through the Aitheon platform an accredited individual with an extensive expertise and background in human resources (a subject matter expert) can enter the process in the final steps and approve documents that AI is unable to understand (samples of previous work product letters of recommendation etc ) These documents would get kicked out of Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s AI node over to the subject matter expert The subject matter expert would translate and approve the documents and new Aitheon Tokens are minted to them as a result from the mining pool The combination of people working with AI are called Aitheon Specialists The Aitheon Specialist model is similar to freelancing but with client data anonymity from the specialist and a blockchain of events recording work done Individuals can become accredited and then have accredited roles to perform certain tasks in human resources finance and accounting procurement facilities legal IT etc The Aitheon specialists portion of the Aitheon blockchain uses multi blind consensus to determine the quality of work When the consensus weight becomes the clear majority the block has been mined and tokens are minted Upon token minting the tokens are distributed back to the specialists with a weight of achievement and ranking Through this the work becomes 99 99% correct and the specialist network is self regulating based on the specialists performance Reviewed documents are parsed out so that important information is not accessed by one specialist This is done so that no personal information or sensitive business data can be used for a purpose other than data interpretation Aitheon does this for both HIPAA compliance and for data security For information marked as sensitive by the owner the data on specific areas of a form will be automatically split into even more pieces and encrypted to keep sensitive information from ever falling into wrong hands In sum Specialist personnel can join our ecosystem to create a better environment for clients and give a business owner the chance to reclaim valuable time With their business processes handled by Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem the business owner can then use their talents and extra time to grow their business and focus on customers 7 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 *Specialists can work from anywhere Aitheon also accounts for potential error in mechanical robotic operations \xe2\x80\x8bTechnicians are trained to supervise and teleop robots all over the world to ensure proper performance These are known as Aitheon Pilots \xe2\x80\x8bThere are many instances where these technicians will be able to help advance the robotic industry \xe2\x80\x8bIn the future Aitheon will introduce a way to combine mining with the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal steps\xe2\x80\x9d of autonomous vehicle solutions In the autonomous vehicle experience this segment of the journey comes when the AI encounters unknown situations Until this juncture in the ride the AI and robotics of the autonomous vehicle will capably handle the drive However the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal steps\xe2\x80\x9d are not within the capabilities of AI so the autonomous vehicle would contact the Aitheon platform and ask for a pilot to finish the final part of the route The \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon Pilots who are able to work remotely from anywhere in to world are continuously vetted through consensus by their peers They are a key component to Aitheon These Pilots are trained by Aitheon and operate out of specialized centers or fully vetted home offices These Aitheon Pilots will be trained to pilot different types of robots One example of this type of human AI and robotics synergy is when a self driving car company wants remote supervision to decrease costs \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon would promptly connect a pilot who is certified to perform these operations One of these certified Aitheon Pilots would take over and assist the AI in performing the task until the AI is again able to continue without the need for assistance Upon completion of the task by the pilot Aitheon Tokens are paid through the ecosystem to the pilot for services rendered *Special command and control centers allow Aitheon Pilots to teleop robotic customers without interruption issues 8 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Creation of new job roles mitigating the need for UBI or robot taxes\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bA prominent concern today is the notion that AI will eliminate the need for many jobs Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Robot Tax (RT) have become buzzwords to address this issue The Aitheon platform however introduces a symbiosis between robotics humans and AI Humans are essential to the Aitheon model and human contribution will be critically important as described above The past ten years have been a bumpy road with the advent of AI but now it is becoming more prevalent \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon\xe2\x80\x99s AI and robotic services are uniquely coupled directly to the work capacity performed by AI Specialists and AI Pilots automatically leveling supply and demand This creates a symbiotic relationship between humans and robotics \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon solves the UBI and RT problems by being able to allow displaced people to acquire employment by augmenting and facilitating the performance of AI (see the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal steps\xe2\x80\x9d and augmentation examples above) While AI can greatly improve quality of life at home and in the workplace AI simply is not able to complete all tasks on its own The future will not be AI but rather human augmented AI which will require a significant workforce Robots will not fully displace humans Instead robots will need human input for task completion just as they always have While robots will displace some positions robotics create new and higher paying positions and new support roles As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past initial skepticism of new technologies gives way to embracing them over time once the value is clear While the kerosene lamp signalled the end of the whale oil industry in the long view this technological innovation helped humanity advance Consensus driven advancement By leveraging the community running on and operating within the Aitheon ecosystem decisions about improvements features new developments and more are decided upon by committees formed by those using the components of Aitheon This allows Aitheon to grow and always be responsive to its users This consensus will take place in many areas including but not limited to community advancements order of business use cases to be added in the ecosystem new innovations and whether or not to migrate and build the ultimate altcoin Aitheon encourages community involvement Goals Year 1 Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s Year 1 goal is to get robots and systems available for the public to use With the funds from the tokens sold Aitheon will add additional staff to improve the user interface and flow of the platform We plan to educate integrate and onboard the first Enterprises Governments Small to Medium Sized Businesses and Individual Users We also plan to contract with most robotic suppliers in the world as well as major contributors to the AI space 9 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Year 2 We plan to take a socially responsible role by reaching out to people in need through no fault of their own by creating mobile offices with a \xe2\x80\x8bshipping \xe2\x80\x8bcontainer design Through these mobile offices people can become part of the Aitheon solution for good and no longer need to rely on local fiat for sustenance The first of these mobile offices is expected to be transported to a country that is underdeveloped where a significant portion of the population is highly educated Aitheon will work to provide them with certifications and then these skills can be used to help AI with various aspects (bookkeeping reservations etc ) Aitheon Creators\xe2\x80\x99 Program will enter a new phase of development where innovations are being actively sought from colleges high schools and invention conferences \xe2\x80\x8bSimilar to the Shark Tank (R) model Aitheon Labs will fund top community ideas and the inventor will have their idea developed and marketed by Aitheon All IP will remain the ownership of Aitheon through the distribution will be through agreement with the inventor Aitheon believes that all people can contribute to make the community better and that everyone has something to offer Competition Major corporations are investing heavily in AI According to Bloomberg in July 2017 Toyota spent $100 million on AI & robotics According to TechWorld com 11 tech giants are heavily investing in their own specialized AI programs The current marketplace is built for businesses who have expensive technical integration teams The majority of these AI teams are built to increase profits for these large corporations shareholders There are a few smaller organizations trying to help steer AI away from big businesses for their own micro purposes In contrast Aitheon is an innovator in the AI market We are making AI available to all people and businesses Aitheon believes in sharing collective intelligence for the greater good The global AI and robotics market is growing at breakneck speed One source says \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bWorldwide spending on robotics and related services will more than double by 2020 growing from $91 5 billion in 2016 to more than $188 billion in 2020\xe2\x80\x9d (*1a) A new update to the International Data Corporation (\xe2\x80\x8bIDC\xe2\x80\x8b) \xe2\x80\x8bWorldwide Semiannual Commercial Robotics Spending Guide estimates worldwide purchases of robotics including drones and robotics related hardware software and services to total $97 2 billion in 2017 an increase of 17 9% over 2016 IDC expects robotics spending to accelerate over the five year forecast period reaching $230 7 billion in 2021 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 8% The world of robotics and AI is at a point of fragmentation and competition where the big companies can compete and the rest of the world is left behind Is it any wonder that so many people have been concerned about robotics when they do not have access and will likely never have access to them because of the robotic business oligarchies of the world The world 10 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 has reached a tipping point with AI and robotics Businesses will soon require access to AI and robotics just to stay competitive and innovative The fourth industrial revolution is being led by Aitheon Aitheon will not only sell its own software hardware robotics and AI solutions Aitheon will also serve as a marketplace for all AI Robotics Control software and control hardware from all companies and competitors Aitheon will help to license and sell their software when possible to assist existing businesses to capture market share and grow their own vertical We are interested in serving the greater good and making AI accessible to all Revenue Model The key to the Aitheon ecosystem is spreading development and advancement costs across a wide range of companies rather than to have each company pay for grassroots development It is easier for many to pay a lower price and receive a higher value than to have one company foot the bill for an entire development and then try to pass that development along to its customers For this reason Aitheon is based on a multi faceted primarily lease financial model The reason that Aitheon is considered an ecosystem is because of its ability to provide much more than a traditional platform marketplace or integration The ecosystem allows everyone to share the costs and also receive the benefits \xe2\x80\x9cMany Hands Make Light Work \xe2\x80\x9d The services are \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8b\xc3\xa0 la carte\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d since not all businesses need all Aitheon modules robotics or human assistance \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon revenues are only payable through it\xe2\x80\x99s tokens for any of its services Because Aitheon is a multi faceted ecosystem there are various forms of revenue to build the Aitheon community to add additional services features products improvements and give back to the community through philanthropy Aitheon Digibot Services Revenue Aitheon charges organizations a monthly subscription fee for their desired services Aitheon Digibots are likely to be employed as monthly subscription only with differing levels of service needed A single cart street vendor does not need the same tools and equipment that a printing company requires and for this reason the services are \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8b\xc3\xa0 la carte\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x9d Aitheon Specialists Program Revenue Aitheon Specialists will earn Tokens on the system for services performed These Specialists will pay a small service charge for their payment to be processed but they may also opt to engage in additional services from Aitheon to improve their qualifications These additional services will be at a low cost to present a low barrier of entry Specialists may participate in education such as cross border certified education university skills certifications individual Pilot training services and more Robotics Rentals \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon will also produce profits by leasing of robotics and devices These leases will be based on the life expectancy of the product and require insurance The lease of the products will lower the barrier of cost of entry and adoption of the system for organizations Aitheon Pilot Program \xe2\x80\x8bAitheon Pilot contractors will earn Tokens on the system for services performed These Pilots will pay a small service charge for their payment to be processed but 11 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 they may also opt to engage in additional services from Aitheon to improve their qualifications These additional services will be at a low cost to present a low barrier of entry Pilots may participate in education such as cross border certified education university skills certifications individual Pilot training services and more Aitheon Payment Processing Program Revenue \xe2\x80\x8bThe Aitheon payment processing system will produce a simple and effective way for businesses to conduct payments for goods and services through the Aitheon ecosystem and a small transaction fee will be charged for this service Aitheon Specialized AI Development Program Revenue \xe2\x80\x8bDevelopment of AI for specialized companies whose use case is too small or specialized for large scale adoption Aitheon will partner with any AI and robotics company where there is a large benefit to the community and the ecosystem We welcome and will actively seek cooperation with existing companies to create a better ecosystem Functionality Platform Services Aitheon uses Artificial Intelligence to learn business systems and infer relationships from past transactions Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary developed AI has many different facets These facets are called Digibots These are virtual robots within the Aitheon ecosystem that automate business processes which enable organizations to focus on their core business instead of back end business tasks There are any number of tasks that the system breaks tasks into The best way to imagine these is to think of a little computer programs working tirelessly to make your business more productive Together with Specialists the Digibots work with the goal of making your life easier giving you back time to focus on business goals Aitheon Specialists Aitheon propels forward blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s existing paradigm for mining by combining mining with the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal steps\xe2\x80\x9d of AI business processes solutions AI and robotics can do only so much in executing processes \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps 90 99% The remaining 1 10% of a process requires some sort of human interaction When the Artificial Intelligence or robotic systems running on Aitheon encounter an issue they reject the task and pass it to their human counterparts We call these people Aitheon Specialists Aitheon Specialists are similar to freelancers but with client data anonymity from the specialist and specialist anonymity \xe2\x80\x8bfrom the businesses they are assisting Instead their work is authenticated by the blockchain and verified by multi blind consensus \xe2\x80\x8bSpecialists acquire accreditation to perform certain roles within the network in areas such as human resources finance and accounting procurement etc Mechbots & Devices 12 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Mechbots are all physical robots and electronic devices Regardless of the manufacturer each is integratable on the Aitheon ecosystem Aitheon takes care of the integration and can even help with the set up and commissioning of robots and devices Aitheon believes that working together and making all devices integratable into the system will enable faster adoption and allow greater community benefits from the shared knowledge Regardless of skill level users will be enabled to perform diverse tasks optimize productivity increase reliability and decrease risk for businesses Mechbots are inclusive of all robotics such as but not limited to automated material handling automated parking robotic arms robotic coffee makers cameras robotic lawn mowers robotic leaf disposal home automation and millions more Pilot Program Mechbots require teaching and need specialized assistance when they encounter an issue they have not experienced previously This is where human symbiosis comes in Technicians trained as Aitheon Pilots supervise robots all over the world to ensure proper performance even from remote locations Aitheon Pilots will be certified by Aitheon and trained in conjunction with the robot manufacturer Each pilot will have to pass a combination of testing and experience to be able to pilot the robot(s) A pilot will be cross trained on multiple types of robots Pilots become extremely useful and beneficial for companies who innovate but do not have budgets to employ large teams The utility of this system occurs when\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bthe robot cannot solve a situation and requires assistance At that point a standby Aitheon Pilot on the network would be patched through acquiring\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bcontrol over the robot to either complete the task at hand or advise correction Aitheon Pilots use a web of connectivity that will allow them to perform a virtual handshake with the robot and take over in areas ranging from but not limited to manufacturing retail self driving vehicles drones emergency services and thousands of other applications These Pilots will form a task force that will be ready to help any mechanical robot whenever necessary for the business Once the robot no longer needs the Pilot the robot can request control from the Pilot Once the Pilot grants control back to the robot the Pilot will be placed in standby mode for the next robot that needs the Pilot\xe2\x80\x99s assistance Creators Program The Aitheon Creators Program is a unique development and implementation platform as well as a marketplace for Creators Invention is often a lonely task creators who build new programs tools circuits robotics or devices often bear the cost of the development and refinement alone working in isolation with expertise in specific areas but not others Aitheon believes in the collective intelligence and collective good of all Creators and seeks to bring them together in collaboration Some Creators are able to do all tasks while others are not Some Creators will have innovative ideas other Creators will be able to physically or diagrammatically design them Some Creators will be able to build the ideas and others will be able to program or troubleshoot them During this collaboration smart contracts will enable the creators of new products features services etc will be able to have their item(s) placed for 13 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 access once vetted by Aitheon on the ecosystem Placement of the new innovation on the ecosystem will allow the Creator(s) to benefit financially as a portion of their item is sold or licensed according to the smart agreements created in the system The Creator(s) will be able to set pricing for the public to consume the item Just as Aitheon is freeing business owners from back end process drugeries we also enable the innovators to become more creative and use the community to develop the world around them Innovators usually love their inventions but need help to get their ideas to market Aitheon is that path to market for Creators As a community driven company Aitheon also allows regular users to make requests for new features and services Imagine a large company that allows you to personalize their software and ask for new features Aitheon is that company and our AI learns and adapts to your preferences At the core of the Creators program are a series of flexible processor modules that Aitheon has designed to handle the full scale of all projects creators will be able design differentiated by cost and performance We have also created a building automation kit that contains Aitheon controlled outlets light switches temperature sensors cameras and a myriad of other devices Aitheon will also be selling development Modules that link to Aitheon These devices will be available in late 2018 Purchasers of these chips can have code deposited remotely Developers can then create their own concepts and ideas The Creators Program enables individuals to write code and develop their ideas to interact with Aitheon expanding the platform The Device Manager is the home of the Creator The Device Manager is a fully functioning Web based IDE featuring multi workspace and multi project support a full linux command line interface GIT Repo support It also has the ability to synthesizing FPGA bitstreams for our Devices that have FPGA\xe2\x80\x99s and reprogramming one or all of the creators devices around the world with a keystroke We have partnered with telecom providers as well as satellite data providers to give Aitheon devices global connection A Community of Agents Services and Devices Aitheon seeks to build not merely a platform for technology but also an active community and knowledge base exchange This exchange will encompass everything from tutorials to reviews and success stories Among other things the Community layer will enable a community member to post information knowledge and content that can receive upvotes whenever the community deems the post to be valuable and enriching \xe2\x80\x8bBy leveraging the community running on Aitheon decisions about improvements features new developments and more are decided upon by committees formed by those using the components of Aitheon This allows Aitheon to grow and be responsive to its users needs Whether approval of ideas or of code vetting will occur through structured rounds of voting by token holders consensus that will ensure that Aitheon is growing and adapting to the needs of our users If an idea or a piece of code is upvoted the author will receive the right to sell her or his concept in the Aitheon community on the platform She or he will also receive rewards in 14 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 the form of Aitheon Tokens for upvotes received (The Community layer of the Aitheon platform will facilitate this rewards for upvotes system ) Ideas products code and other advancements will be sold through the Aitheon storefront to people or organizations wishing to purchase them The Creator and Aitheon will share in the profit of items sold through the storefront In our Community section people will be able to submit new ideas and vote for improvements new features new products new applications new verticals philanthropic endeavors and many more topics Aitheon will have multiple moderators for each community who will be able to supervise the community The multiple moderators will allow a consensus and appeals process for innovation and advancement of the platform Community members will be encouraged to vote for their favorite items under certain communities The more useful the item higher the ranking of an item is likely At the end of every voting cycle the highest ranked items will automatically be placed into the development queue Aitheon Management reserves the right to use the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Button\xe2\x80\x9d feature to advance certain ideas or programs that it sees will benefit the community and/or the macro ecosystem as a whole Aitheon Management also reserves the right to use a \xe2\x80\x9cModification Needed Button\xe2\x80\x9d where if management deems that an item or code will hurt the platform it will be degraded and placed back into the voting forum for the community to modify the feature/item An example of this would be in response to a proposal to invent a time machine Although this would be an interesting endeavor it is currently beyond our abilities and therefore would not be a suitable project for the platform Contributors are rewarded for participation in the forums In order to compensate moderators and contributors of good content Aitheon uses a rating system to track the quality of ideas proposed by the contributors and moderators Positive votes for an action or contribution will increase the contributors ranking Negative votes and many downvoted items will result in a lower ranking Time quantity and quality of contributions will determine the rankings This algorithm will help determine the moderators for a given community A moderator will only be allowed to moderate one community at a time The top 5 ranked individuals who accept moderator status will be posted as moderators for a given community Even moderation will be done through a consensus to allow people to help direct Aitheon improvements Possession of Aitheon Tokens (AIC) also entitles the holder to certain proportionate voting rights including voting for outstanding items \xe2\x80\x8bTo place a vote token holders will need to pay a reasonable price determined by the Aitheon Team in AIC to ensure they believe in what they are voting for These tokens will go into a community pool to pay moderators and fund community activities Technical issues that will be subject to community voting include but are not limited to \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Whether the Aitheon App will remain on the Ethereum platform or migrate to an alternative blockchain in the future (\xe2\x80\x8be g \xe2\x80\x8b EOS NEO Tezos proprietary) Which consensus algorithm to adopt How to overcome

Platform is built on swarm cluster technology for failover In Version 1 0 Aitheon will launch its platform of AI and Robotics as a service The platform is primarily written in C C++ NodeJs and CUDA The Aitheon Circular Hierarchy consists of a distributed cluster of nodes defined as users organizations agents services and robotics that use our token as a method to exchange services or mint new tokens through work Businesses and individuals can deploy these nodes to perform work on their behalf while using tokens to pay humans robots and deep learning agents on the platform for work performed For this document we won\xe2\x80\x99t be delving into the intricacies of the underlying neural networks and deep or machine learning algorithms but will be presenting a more palatable broader definition of understanding 16 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 A beginning network view of this distribution of relationships looks similar to this 17 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Over time as Aithon expands and nodes come on and off line Aitheon transitions between multiple states (a) being origination to (d) swarm intelligence clustering Depending on the nodes life or connection it may fall in an octree configuration notation (c) versus the goal of a true mesh distribution again (d) The systems are part of a neural network which allows the AI to learn from our preferences This means that the AI can help run businesses the way that you prefer or preset and configured from the ecosystem During Q2 of 2018 a \xe2\x80\x9cTech Paper\xe2\x80\x9d will be published with more information about the technical parts of the system For purposes of brevity we will not include it here but it will be posted to our website for those who wish to read the details Aitheon Back End History The Aitheon ecosystem backend AI and supportive services have been in development testing and operational phases for the last seven years in a variety of industries The Beta version of the Aitheon blockchain ecosystem will be developed over a period of ten months After complete launch of the Blockchain App (\xe2\x80\x9cBApp\xe2\x80\x9d) all transactions and parsed data will be processed by smart contracts and recorded on the Aitheon blockchain The development effort to create Aitheon will commence upon conclusion of the Token Generating Event (TGE) The roadmap for this development is set forth below The Aitheon platform will use machine learning AI to understand user needs and recommend or deploy services Aitheon makes these assumptions by using neural networks and deep learning Algorithms to evaluate user data This will be described in detail in the aforementioned Aitheon Tech Paper 18 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Because Aitheon Exchange uses blockchain technology there will be no scraping of personally identifiable information (\xe2\x80\x9cPIN\xe2\x80\x9d) and no reselling of personal data by Aitheon nor by any third party Today\xe2\x80\x99s pre blockchain platforms routinely invade an end user\xe2\x80\x99s privacy with data scrapes and data reselling Aitheon averts the risk of having credit card information being hacked or tampered with because the platform allows for transactions to occur through cryptocurrency and blockchain technology Such is not the case with existing platforms Use Cases 1 USE CASE SAMPLE RESTAURANT OWNER Party 1 A restaurant needs professional assistance with their business operations They need 1 receptionist 1 person to schedule reservations 1 cashier several wait staff timesheet management management of social media accounts assistance with accounting tax assistance supply ordering / inventory management etc Party 2 An investor would like to help this restaurant but they do not want to be overexposed financially and would like to have mundane tasks reduced in order to increase the strength of the borrower\ s ability to cover the investment Party 3 Several professionals are looking for work that will be part time on a freelance basis Governments are concerned about workers being displaced by AI and having to create universal basic income Solution Aitheon works with the restaurant in the following ways to solve their needs Aitheon has multiple artificially intelligent digital agents (Digibots) The Digibots can be employed to schedule reservations act as a cashier take orders when customers are ready assist with accounting prepare taxes and take care of inventory management in real time Aitheon\ s mechanical AI robotics (Mechbots) can be implemented to act as a host delivery driver wait on tables and even cook meals Aitheon contracts with certified professionals (Specialists) in accounting tax reservations etc to verify and if necessary assist the AI if any discrepancies are found by the Specialists Aitheon also contracts Robot Pilots to assist Mechbots to monitor those robots to do tasks The result is a restaurant owner who has world class service for their customers and the ability to engage them directly The customers are happier The investor has lower risk Freelance workers are employed With any other solutions the restaurant would need to have an IT department to implement any similar system or even systems with lesser abilities With Aitheon the client can easily implement a full solution that allows them to focus on their customers rather than the mechanics of the business and legal compliance 2 USE CASE SAMPLE\xe2\x80\x8b Archer Robotics Automated Fulfillment Company 19 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Party 1 A customer buys a product on the Aitheon platform from an Aitheon Creator with Aitheon Tokens This could be any product from any manufacturer who is contracted with Aitheon Party 2 The Product is stored at a fully automated warehouse running on Aitheon software AI and Robotics Party 3 A shipping company needs to be selected to deliver the good to the customers business or home Solution Aitheon works with all companies in the following ways and more When Aitheon receives an order our shipping AI negotiates with several shipping companies for the best price and fastest shipping The Aitheon software seamlessly handles the transaction and automatically exchanges tokens for the item between the buyer and the seller once the decision to purchase has been made The monetary transaction is then handled immediately over the Aitheon network with their Aitheon wallets The customer has a ledger of their conducted transactions and the business has their money instantly Whereas traditional financial institutions take days of weeks to reconcile accounts Aitheon completes the process in seconds Once the money has transferred wallets an order is then placed with the warehouse management system running on Aitheon The Aitheon Warehouse Management System (WMS) analyzes past trends and keeps sufficient stock from suppliers to keep the warehouse operating properly to satisfy customers The Aitheon WMS would have used robotics to unload the trailers place items on the storage shelves move the storage shelves to their locations then when needed have Charlie AGV bring the storage shelves to the picking locations use robotics to pick the product and package the product and seal the product There are many more functions and tasks conducted at the automated warehouse by Aitheon The shipping company is then alerted to come and collect the package (In the future we expect to automate the package collection shipping and delivery ) 3 USE CASE SAMPLE\xe2\x80\x8b Specialists PARTY 1 A business has Aitheon contracted for telephone reservation service but the AI is not understanding the accent of the person calling to make the reservation Aitheon Solution Once the Aitheon AI realizes that it cannot understand an individual after 2 tries the AI will hand off the call to a Specialist The Specialist is then able to understand the caller and coordinate the restaurant reservation The business does not incur an additional fee and has their service provided The Specialist has been able to mine tokens The Customer has their reservation and the data from the voice will be used to help improve the AI for future interactions and knowledge base If the customer has the Aitheon application installed on their phone the App will have a feature to keep them updated as to their reservation recommended 20 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 specials and a list of suggestions for a date nearby They can also pay directly with Aitheon tokens for their meal 4 USE CASE SAMPLE\xe2\x80\x8b Data Entry and Retrieval Party 1 A business needs to have some documents scanned that are handwritten The AI may have an issue with recognizing the handwriting The company needs the information accurately Aitheon Solution Although the Aitheon document scanning AI can understand many handwriting styles it cannot recognize all styles yet For an unrecognized font Aitheon Data Entry Specialists are assigned to transcribe the document The document is separated out so that important information such as social security number and name are never distributed together This is done so that no one

blockchain as a decentralized ERC20 token It will be created to eighteen decimal places Developed using blockchain technology to ensure smooth secure transactions between parties the Aitheon Token will enable token holders to participate directly within the network as well as spend or trade their coins with other users 22 \x0c\xc2\xa9Aitheon White Paper v1 20 Every registered user on the Aitheon platform will be issued a wallet This will be the user\ s online account which holds the user\ s private keys ( Aitheon Wallet ) These wallets are encrypted client side and exportable at any time In this way the registered end user will maintain total control of any Aitheon Tokens purchased Users will purchase Aitheon Tokens with ERC20 tokens through the EtherDelta portal which is described further below Possession of a prescribed quantity of Aitheon Tokens enables end users to participate in the Aitheon community as described in the use case discussion above Token Use and Mining The multi blind consensus process on the blockchain is used to determine the quality and accuracy of the nodes\xe2\x80\x99 work When the consensus weight becomes the clear majority the block has been mined and tokens are minted Upon token minting the tokens are distributed back to the nodes that performed the work with a weight of achievement and ranking Through this work becomes 99 99% accurate and the node network is self regulating based on the individual nodes\xe2\x80\x99 performance Bounties Bug in the Code Bounties A smart contract will set forth and enforce the terms and conditions of a bug bounty whereby any individual who identifies a bug in the open sourced code will be awarded 1000 Aitheon Tokens for making the Aitheon team aware of the bug An additional bounty of 1000 will be awarded if a remedial plan is proposed the Aitheon team implements the remedial plan and the bug is eliminated Possible Transition to Independent Altcoin In the earlier phases of Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s business Aitheon will be built on the Ethereum blockchain In later phases Aitheon will perform regular checkpoints to examine whether or not Aitheon should migrate to its own blockchain and native digital currency These checkpoints are already built into Aitheon\xe2\x80\x99s roadmap which is set forth below The checkpoints and the transition will be placed in the hands of Aitheon Token holders Aitheon Token holders will help decide the future by consensus vote If the token holders decide to mint a coin and break away from Etherium this will be the first opportunity for token holders to determine the features of a digital currency Preferential attributes from different cryptocurrencies can be added to form the \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect Digital Currency \xe2\x80\x9d There are no limits to where this type of token holder consensus can take the currency Instead of legacy Crypto coin problems Aitheon token holders will be able to make history and likely forge the coin

balancing of the ledger with expenditures possible income and possible outflows \xe2\x80\x8bWhen using the blockchain and cryptocurrency on Aitheon people and businesses will know that they are getting paid for what is being sold or paying for what is actually being purchased Credit card fraud check fraud wire transfer fraud and chargebacks disappear Transactions between businesses and customers will be simple transparent and secure with Aitheon tokens Legal Classification The Aitheon Token will be classified as a digital asset rather than a security or currency Upon and after the TGE Aitheon Tokens will have the singular utility of allowing a holder to access and participate in the Aitheon community Any appreciation in value of the Aitheon Token is incidental The token\ s utility to enable participation in the Aitheon platform and community obviates the possibility of the token being classified as a security by any agency seeking to exercise competent jurisdiction
