and incentives will be discussed Later TrueFeedBack\xe2\x80\x99s solution which uses help from blockchain technology will be analyzed TrueFeedBack\xe2\x80\x99s token economy and roadmap of the project will also be explained 3 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain INTRODUCTION A brief introduction about blockchain surveys and TrueFeedBack solution It has been more than 10 years since the emergence of Bitcoin Bitcoin was designed to be a peer to peer payment method however the technology it brought was developed further in the past years Ethereum for example introduced the smart contracts to the blockchain and that opened up new ways for using blockchain in real world cases So that the blockchain technologies are not just for peer to peer payment anymore Smart Contracts and Live Contracts enable developers to develop decentralized applications (DAPPs) on the blockchains Blockchain is still developing and its full potential is yet to be discovered so the upcoming years will show the world what it is capable of That is why so many experts state that Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s current situation is similar to the Internet in the \xe2\x80\x9990s What made blockchain technologies so popular This question does not simply have just one answer One of the biggest reasons is that blockchain transactions are anonymous Even though every transfer can be traced on the blocks the addresses are not related to any personal IDs and that makes cryptocurrencies anonymous However the traceability might cause disclosure of the identity if an investigation is carried out very carefully Therefore there are fully anonymous blockchains which were developed like Monero in which transactions cannot be traced all the way down Therefore spending money anonymously without being watched attracted many people to Bitcoin Another reason was the volatility of the cryptocurrencies Many people made a fortune due to volatile markets and that attracted too many investors into it Market cap for crypto money ecosystem has reached to approximately 850 billion USD in late 2017 This shows the growing appetite of investors into the cryptocurrencies Smart contracts and their applicability to real world businesses are also another reason for people\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the blockchain 4 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain TrueFeedBack is a survey platform where companies academicians or anyone else can create a survey and reach to users using TrueFeedBack and incentivize them In addition to that companies or brands will be able to find secret customers in their desired location or arrange treasure hunt like activities in the TrueFeedBack platform What differentiates TrueFeedBack from SurveyMonkey or Google Survey or other bounty applications will be the anonymity of users TrueFeedBack platform will not gather any information about users\xe2\x80\x99 identity and the incentives will be distributed in TrueFeedBack token (TFB) So that users will enjoy their anonymity while being able to participate in surveys and earn incentives from them This will be discussed further in later sections In the coming sections a discussion about surveys in general will be given and then TrueFeedBack\xe2\x80\x99s solution will be presented Later we will investigate our business model and tokenomics Finally the paper will be finalized with some conclusive ideas 5 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain SURVEY People\xe2\x80\x99s ideas and thoughts not individually but cumulatively shape today\xe2\x80\x99s world So the decision makers need to better understand how people think If they try to understand people\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts subjectively based on their instincts or people around them that would cost them because they would not really understand how people think However they cannot talk to millions of people in order to make a decision since it is practically impossible This is where surveys take place Surveys help decision makers to understand how crowds think by investigating a relatively small group of individuals In other words surveys aim to give a better understanding of focus groups\xe2\x80\x99 thoughts with a small number of individuals using the art of statistics Surveys do not necessarily give the correct results There are many factors that decide to the success of a survey First of all it should be well prepared and the participants should be selected carefully in order to reflect the focus group\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts It should also be done such that people answer the survey questions honestly Moreover it should be analyzed carefully to extract the correct results One can add more factors for a survey\xe2\x80\x99s success however this will not be done here within the scope of this paper in order to prevent redundancy As mentioned above surveys are able to tell many things if they are used correctly A company can analyze the market in order to understand if its next product will succeed or not or an election candidate can analyze what needs to be done to get more votes or surveys can be used to test the date of a scientific study One can easily increase the example of use cases for surveys as they are quite important 6 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain PHYSICAL PHONE ADVANTAGES Better identified focus group Good for investigating body language Controlled environment Easy to get feedback for unclear answers Better for interactive surveys Reactions of the participant can be investigated Location independent Good for post service surveys Better for interactive surveys Not much organization is needed Good for feedback Good for reaching out to large groups Little operational costs Not much organization is needed Easy to incentivize Anonymity (not in all online survey applications) Good for feedback DISADVANTAGES Surveys can be made online physically or by phone Physical polls are made by someone asking questions or handing forms to be filled by participants This traditional method has some advantages over online surveys however it is more expensive less accessible and harder to analyze and people might not feel free as much as answering questions alone The surveys that are made by phone has some advantages over physical surveys however people tend to hide their real thoughts since their identity is known and they are not quite comfortable over a phone Again they are more expensive compared to the online surveys Therefore online surveys are getting more popular every day for their ease of use low cost and accessibility to more people However there are also some downsides with online surveys Table 1 shows some of the advantages and disadvantages of different survey types ONLINE Costly approach Usually no incentive to the participant Too much organization is needed Fewer participants as compared with phone or online Lack of interest from people to participate No anonymity Costly approach Usually no incentive to the participant Lack of interest from people to participate No anonymity Duplicate participation might occur Some survey types are not applicable (face to face reaction measuring etc *) Table 1 Advantages and disadvantages of survey types Even though online surveys are getting popular they have their limitations and disadvantages as shown in Table 1 Moreover not all online surveys share the same advantages listed above Some online surveys do not even incentivize people some might use the data collected from the participant for other purposes like advertising goods services etc without getting the consent of participant and some of them might be quite open to manipulation Therefore a solid system design is needed for a survey application to be successful In the next section TrueFeedBack\xe2\x80\x99s approach to online Surveys will be discussed 7 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain TRUEFEEDBACK\xe2\x80\x99S APPROACH In the previous sections the fact that there are many factors affecting the success of a survey was discussed One of the most important factors among these is the anonymity of the participant If the user is not anonymous user\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the question will vary greatly from his/her real opinions due to emotions For example participants might fear being disclosed in a survey for the upcoming elections if they support the opposing side On the other hand they can answer more positively than they really feel for a survey about the class they took if their identity is not anonymous It is obvious that the anonymity of surveys is crucial for the success of the survey However guaranteeing the anonymity of the participant is easier said than done In physical surveys the participant\xe2\x80\x99s face is known and the participant usually fills the survey with someone\xe2\x80\x99s help or in a location where someone might be able to see him That creates pressure on him/her even though he/she might not think so and that might affect his/her answers given throughout the survey In phone surveys the participant\xe2\x80\x99s phone number is known to the survey owner and that also might affect the participant\xe2\x80\x99s answer the since participant is aware that his/her phone number might reveal who he/she is and therefore this might lead to unsuccessful results in surveys made by phone People might feel relatively more comfortable in online surveys since many believe that they are anonymous on the internet This might be the case for the online surveys which do not collect any information from the participants however these types of surveys are not able to reward participants This is not the only drawback of these kinds of surveys such surveys are not very credible since these are not regulated in any way These surveys are a better fit for amateurs or fun surveys which do not expect any serious results Finding participants is another problem with surveys People are usually not motivated to participate in surveys unless they have some interest in doing so Therefore survey owners have a hard time finding participants to their surveys To overcome this issue some survey owners incentivize participants with money gifts or a lottery ticket for a big prize in order to encourage them to participate in their surveys This might motivate people in participating in the surveys however this kind of incentives might make the participant feel obliged to make a favor in return of their gifts to the survey owner This would end up with misleading results in the survey and misleading results might harm the one who created the survey For example a product which customers would not really like might be launched based on misleading results in the surveys or a politician might think he/she has done everything well while there were things needed to be done in order to improve his/her vote count 8 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain throughout the campaign Therefore making participants comfortable and anonymous is quite important in order to get the most accurate results out of the surveys Online surveys are a better fit for incentivizing participants and making them feel anonymous However participants should reveal their identity to the survey platform in order to withdraw the money or to get the gifts/prize Sharing identity brings a trust issue with the survey platform since every move of a user can make can be recorded in the platform This enables the platform to find out users\xe2\x80\x99 answers to surveys and use that information for some purposes without the consent of the user Quite a lot of issues concerning data leakage has been reported lately In the future the users should be %100 sure that their personal information is being kept secure and their answers would not be leaked to other parties without their consent TrueFeedBack platform is designed to overcome these issues and help the survey creators to get more accurate results In order to do that one needs to solve the anonymity issue first so that one would get the most objective answers from the participants As TrueFeedBack Team we have decided that using the blockchain technology is a great solution for this problem Users only need to provide an email address and an ERC20 wallet (MyEtherWallet Trust Wallet etc ) address in order to register on our system An ERC20 address consists of numbers and letters so it does not contain any information about the user Some might object to collecting email addresses of users however users are not obliged to give an email address that contains information about their identity There are two reasons for TrueFeedBack platform to require email information first it will be used to verify that a user is not a bot and the second one is that these email addresses will be used as a channel of communication At this point we need to mention that email data of users will not be shared with survey maker only an id of user which will contain numbers and letters will be provided to the survey maker in order to see the history of a user in surveys since this information would be crucial for analyzing the data Therefore there will not be any information on TrueFeedBack platform to identify the identity of a specific user This is quite an easy solution to the problem yet it effectively solves the problem of anonymity The second problem is incentivizing users and that is also how TrueFeedBack brings the blockchain technology in game while solving this problem While creating a survey TrueFeedBack platform forces the creator to decide on a reward per participant and number of maximum participants Upon publishing the survey it goes up on the users\xe2\x80\x99 dashboards and the users are able to see the reward that they would get if they decide to participate in that particular survey There will also be a lower limit for rewards per participant in the TrueFeedBack platform Integrating blockchain on rewarding system enables the users to remain anonymous at all times and we expect many people who stand back from participating on surveys due to anonymity issues will be encouraged to participate in the surveys in our system In short the current survey systems have two major drawbacks anonymity and incentivizing As TrueFeedBack we are integrating our system into blockchain By doing so we do not force any user to share any identifying information with our platform yet we would be able to reward all of our users without any problems 9 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain Companies Survey Participants Academic Research TrueFeedBack Platform Anonymou s Projects THE CHALLANGE The most challenging problem while guaranteeing the users\xe2\x80\x99 anonymity is ensuring that people are not duplicating accounts in order to gain more money We will tackle this problem in a few ways 1 One user per device A unique encrypted ID will be given to a device while opening a session This information will be kept in our database and if a user tries to abuse the system by creating multiple users they will end up blocking all of their accounts The first time they will be given a chance to continue with only one account however another attempt will end up losing the account irreversibly Even though punishing is not preferred it might be inevitable in order to collect correct data for our clients and sustain our operations In the end no one would pay for a platform which is full of duplicate accounts 2 Limiting the minimum withdrawable amount This way is more of a psychological way of tackling the problem There is already enough risk of using bots or duplicating accounts in the system However if someone takes all these risks he/she will not be able to withdraw the reward from a single survey The minimum withdrawable amount will prevent them from cashing out from the system after completing each survey They need to complete more than one survey in order to reach the minimum amount and that will increase the chance of getting caught also since they need to do it more than once People would not want to risk their efforts since they spend some time on the system Therefore by adding a minimum withdrawable amount we expect users would behave in a more ethical manner 10 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain SERVICES AND MORE As of now we have discussed survey business its flaws and what TrueFeedBack has to offer in order to resolve those flaws Surveys are not just simple polls consisting of a few simple questions On the contrary surveys can be done in various forms and as TrueFeedBack platform we will offer almost every form of surveys to cover customers\xe2\x80\x99 needs as much as possible Traditional Online Surveys This is the core of the TrueFeedBack platform Customers will be able to create any type of questions (text type multiple choice images etc) in their survey In order to do that customers should deposit enough TrueFeedBack tokens (TFB) into their account and decide on a reward per participant Then they should select their focus group by specifying the location gender age range etc for their survey After specifying everything that is needed they can submit their survey and the survey goes live after being reviewed by the TrueFeedBack team Upon submission the survey is shown on the users\xe2\x80\x99 dashboards if they are in the desired focus group also a push notification will be sent to them if they chose to The survey will be online as much as the customer likes and then it will be concluded and all the information collected will be shared with the customer If a customer wants to make more surveys on TrueFeedBack platform on the same focus groups they will be able to see the previous answers of the participants in their surveys considering the same participant participated in a previous survey Indeed this information will be shared with a randomized id of the participant Also the email which was collected from user not being necessarily the primary email of the user will not be shared with any other parties An advanced analysis tool for surveys will also be developed in TrueFeedBack platform so that customers will not need to download data from our system and spend time on it to get meaningful data 11 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain Bounty Program In crypto many people are trying to gain money by following and participating in bounty programs of tokens Even though our bounty program is similar to other existing crypto bounty programs the quests in our bounty should be done in real life Companies grow bigger in today\xe2\x80\x99s world and they have a shop a representative a restaurant or a place in locations far away from their immediate reach to audit Moreover if these kinds of operations gain knowledge about an audit they will be more careful and the companies will not have a chance to learn what kind of service real customers are getting In the end customers decide whether a service is good or not Secret customers are working all around the world to experience the service quality they get as a real customer and they report this information back to the companies However these people are not full time employees they are usually working with an agency and they are getting jobs from those agencies Therefore they need to reveal their identity to get a job from those agencies In TrueFeedBack platform we will have a bounty program for companies or agencies where they can post these quests They will define every step to be taken for example what kind of photos or videos to be taken how detailed this information should be provided the location etc and post the quest to our bounty system Bounty hunters will be able to see the quests in their nearby location Then they will be able to complete to quest as asked and earn their rewards in TrueFeedBack tokens without revealing their identity at all There is no bounty program like this where people do not need to reveal their identity in order to be rewarded and we believe that this will attract many users who stood back until now not to give their identity 12 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain Feedback Program As cryptocurrencies become commonly used in our daily lives more and more people will use cryptocurrencies as a payment method Those people who are already using cryptocurrencies are the ones that care about their anonymity and it is quite possible that they would not want to share any information with a store a shop or a restaurant that they have paid for in exchange for the services that they receive Hence it will be a problem to get feedback from those customers That is where we would like to step in TrueFeedBack platform will make partnerships with crypto payment platforms and offer feedback services to companies via them By doing so after each successful payment to a company which is a customer of TrueFeedBack and the payment platform the payers will get a pop up feedback survey such that they will be able to rate their experience with their purchase or the service that they have received Academic Studies Surveys are also quite important in academical studies Social sciences statistics and many other study fields rely on surveys in order to conduct academic research Actually these kinds of surveys are not very different from the surveys that are mentioned in the subsection `Traditional Online Surveys` What makes them different is the service that TrueFeedBack platform will offer a part of TrueFeedBack funds will be allocated to academic researches Normally academic surveys are low on budget so they are looking for volunteers to participate in their studies and that makes it hard for them to find participants As TrueFeedBack platform we will supply funds to academic researches to reward participants so that they will find participants more easily This also helps TrueFeedBack to give back to the community with a very good cause 13 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTrueFeedBack Chain TOKENOMICS In Token

Now we will briefly discuss how the token economy will work in TrueFeedBack platform As mentioned many times in this white paper TrueFeedBack is a platform where people can participate in surveys or bounties in order to receive TrueFeedBack tokens as rewards These rewards are supplied by the survey or bounty creators who need to deposit the total reward amount plus the survey commission fee to TrueFeedBack platform before launching their survey or bounty Therefore the survey or bounty creators will be the consumers of TFB token and the demand for TFB token will not diminish by time On the other hand the users of the platform will be using the platform mainly for earning extra income Therefore we expect many of the users to sell their rewards by time Therefore consumers will always be able to find TFB tokens from the market However there is one crucial point in this ecosystem As the number of surveys and bounties increase in the platform more and more users will be able to participate and get their reward in the same day they may try to cash out as soon as they can Hence this may result in a rapid price drop in the TFB value In order to avoid this situation there will be a limit for a minimum withdrawable amount in the TrueFeedBack platform Having this limit will have two advantages It will avoid sudden price volatility due to users cashing out It will eliminate duplicate participants Commission fees from the platform will be a huge part of TrueFeedBack\xe2\x80\x99s income Constant cashing out of those tokens might cause sudden price changes as well and this should be avoided In order to overcome this problem at least 50% of the commission fees gained from the survey/bounty creators will only be sold to clients and will never hit the market Since the commissions will be quite small compared to the total rewards that are distributed in surveys/bounties we expect to sell 100% of tokens gained from the commission fees to the clients using the platform Hence we do not expect any need for selling tokens to the market Considering all this information given above TrueFeedBack platform will have a sustainable token ecosystem 15 TrueFeedBack

people\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and ideas and if they are analyzed well they would make a huge impact Also we have discussed that secret customers are playing a key role for auditing company services However the anonymity of the survey/bounty participants is not quite easily achievable today especially when the participants are paid or incentivized TrueFeedback platform is taking any identity information out of the system in order to solve this problem It implements the blockchain technology and gives the users a chance to identify themselves with an ERC20 address This address is unique so it cannot be used by another user and it allows users to be paid in TFB tokens Therefore both anonymity and incentive problems are solved with TrueFeedBack\xe2\x80\x99s approach However this comes with a price and such a system might be potentially prone to duplicate accounts However harsh actions against violation and the minimum withdrawable limit will minimize this risk Considering all these we believe that TrueFeedBack platform is the next generation survey and bounty platform and it will attract many users and clients It offers a sustainable business model that will allow making a difference 17 TrueFeedBack Chain \x0cTRUEFEEDBACK CHAIN \x0c
