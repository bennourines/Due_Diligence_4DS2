framework of interconnected applications networked systems and mobile devices essential to our daily lives It\xe2\x80\x99s the primary means by which we communicate learn create shop work share play and manage our finances We cannot imagine a world without it Yet the very foundation of this technology invented over a quarter century ago is in jeopardy It suffers from vulnerabilities in scale security and privacy and increasingly is prone to fraud Together these threats will disrupt the technology we have become so reliant upon Businesses built on centralised computing struggle to keep pace with ever increasing scale of use which drives up costs and further limits accessibility to the developing world where only the elite can profit from the advantages of connectivity Challenges in privacy confidentiality data security and integrity and centralised systems have plagued the internet today Traditional private internet related organisations have attempted to resolve these challenges only selectively as their profit motive is not aligned with that of the consumer interests The tech giants want their users to \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d them implicitly without actually addressing the underlying obstacles \xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain\xe2\x80\x9d Technology the underlying innovation that powers Bitcoin and NEM promised more robust decentralised and distributed networks thus eliminating costly intermediaries and creating a human powered interconnected network but it was not without its flaws Early versions of blockchain proved too complex insecure costly and unscalable to bridge the gap between theoretical and real world utility ProximaX (pronounced Proxima X) a blockchain based decentralised platform using the NEM Blockchain and Catapult platform intends to solve these challenges in an eco friendly distributed ledger technology using P2P internet protocols and ease of integration API driven architecture allowing DApp developers and businesses to more readily deploy and manage their solutions \x0cProximaX extends traditional Blockchain protocols by integrating a number of off chain peer to peer service components (layers) that are found in traditional SaaS and IaaS based centralised architectures like content delivery networks (CDN) and cloud offerings The primary services being that of storage and streaming media all managed and governed by a robust set of consensus protocols to ensure integrity of the network along with measuring validating and incentivizing the decentralised workforce to prosper and grow scale By parallelizing all of these services and protocols in manageable but distinct layers ProximaX solves for the cost effective conundrum in Blockchain ledger transactions whilst maintaining flexibility ease of adoption and integration security and speed All packaged within an all in one extensible framework To maintain its integrity and value ProximaX steps up the game from traditional blockchain and introduces concurrent advanced and complex consensus algorithms with a combination of 1) Proof of Importance (PoI) perfected by NEM 2) Proof of Storage (PoSt) for measuring allocation of distributed disk space and 3) Proof of Bandwidth (PoB) a costly and more precious commodity in delivery of data and streaming media \xe2\x80\x93 in a side chain Bandwidth measurement is rarely factored into mainstream blockchain projects as a reward metric to the node workforce ProximaX is changing that ProximaX further powers its utility token economy with a native token (using the NEM mosaic) XPX that allows for a sustainable marketplace for its services only possible with a best of breed blockchain engine found in NEM ProximaX is a revolution on top of the existing evolution of Blockchain and DLT with the creation of a utility rich platform and protocol in which businesses enterprises and entrepreneurial innovators can avoid costly failure prone centralised architectures yet enjoy sustainable and secure service offerings Content Delivery and Storage Streaming \x0cMedia decentralised marketplaces big data measurement/analytics IoT and flawless record keeping and Know Your Customer (\xe2\x80\x9cKYC\xe2\x80\x9d) are just a few use cases for ProximaX \x0c10 11 11 11 11 12 12 13 14 15 17 18 19 21 21 21 21 21 22 22 23 24 24 25 25 25 26 26 \x0c26 27 27 27 30 31 31 33 35 36 36 36 38 38 39 40 41 43 43 \x0cThe ProximaX protocol aims to offer DApp developers cost efficient fault tolerant multilayer P2P cloud services including but not limited to blockchain powered P2P storage and bandwidth A fault tolerant system is designed to ensure a system remains fully functional even when part of it is \xe2\x80\x98down\xe2\x80\x99 or unavailable ProximaX will build a P2P cloud storage architecture with fault tolerance and a distributed database by removing the central entity and connecting all the servers (or nodes) in a mesh configuration Failure of any single component of the mesh will have minimal effect upon the overall performance of the system ProximaX protocol will ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data passing through a myriad of nodes The use of distributed databases (DHT) ensures consistency and integrity throughout the network ProximaX distributed file management system (DFMS) interfaces with NEM blockchain and works in four scenarios 1 ProximaX Public DFMS with NEM Public chain 2 ProximaX Private DFMS with NEM Public Chain 3 ProximaX Public DFMS with NEM Private Chain 4 ProximaX Private DFMS with NEM Private Chain ProximaX will provide DApp developers with an easy to use SDK that abstracts the ProximaX protocol layer into a dynamic second layer on top of the NEM blockchain layer that can carry different unique DApp protocols This will ensure that the DApp developers can build great P2P applications with the best possible security protocols without relying on points of central authority It will empower developers to build apps and monetise in the ways they want without any unnecessary compliance pressure \x0cThis solution makes use of the NEM blockchain for value and hash transaction and the NEM cryptography framework to gain access to the ProximaX DFMS and work in a tightly integrated environment based on the above four scenarios DDoS remains one of the bigger issues in centralised client/server architectures Decentralised systems offer no lightning rod for attacks thereby expanding the attack surface almost infinitely as the system grows ProximaX will fully utilise the nature of decentralisation to obviate system outages due to malicious traffic A centralised system removes authority from the hands of users and controls all network functionality Dependency on such system means developers and creators are completely reliant platforms and need to abide by the regulations they impose Many platforms charge creators for hosting space and storing their apps and content Centralised systems also face absolute failure or downtime due to poor server access or connection time This is a crucial challenge especially for apps and cloud services A decentralised system has faster access time due to the peer to peer connections and eliminates faulty data transfers due to the public ledger that verifies all transactions and exchanges \x0cCentralised systems have inherent scalability issues as all processing must be routed through centralised nodes in a hub and spoke like fashion As systems become more decentralised and distributed scalability increases A fully distributed mesh platform with Centralised systems also face absolute failure or downtime due to poor server access or connection time This is a crucial challenge especially for apps and cloud services A Decentralised system has faster access time due to the peer to peer connections and eliminates faulty data transfers due to the public ledger that verifies all transactions and exchanges Additionally scalability is limited by the reach and geolocations of traditional data centres and hosting facilities leveraged by today\xe2\x80\x99s corporations and cloud providers The edge networks that are supposed to bring content closer to the users are thereby also limited and may actually be thousands of miles away Decentralisation extends beyond corporate domain and leverages real world people that are more geographically diverse Lastly the more middlemen the costlier Centralised corporations dictate usage costs to pay for their infrastructure and profits and pass them on to business and consumers The controlling entity of any network enjoys the liberty of monitoring and filtering content from its users This censorship can be based on personal and political agendas that mask or rewrite the truth from an audience or violate the right of free speech of the content creators Media platforms misuse this control to their advantage \x0cThough distributed Blockchain network nodes perform little to no parallel processing Blockchain nodes perform identical operations in verifying same transactions in accordance with the same rules Blockchain nodes store the entire history which is the same for all nodes These are large chunks of data The growth of HDD capacity definitely lags behind the current blockchain circumstances of storing tens of GBs of transactions data per month where the number of transactions is constantly rising Such limitations reflect on high blockchain transaction fees and limit the size of transaction data For that todays blockchains are slow expensive hardly scalable and very limited when it comes to storing information In addition current blockchain and DLT solutions force developers to augment or add offchain solutions to complete tasks that provide significant utility such as storage This can lead to the creation of centralised dependencies unless the investment in additional peerto peer services are added and coupled with the blockchain The conclusion blockchain and DLT alone cannot possibly provide the functionality necessary to allow for replacement services to transitional SaaS and IaaS architecture This has led to multiple competing bespoke implementations and ICO\xe2\x80\x99s requiring developers to potentially leverage multiple implementations versus one This increases complexity and generates friction and risk That is until now \x0cProximaX strives to provide solutions for long standing problems by creating a NEM blockchain powered platform that consists of the following major on chain and off chain protocols generating a wide range of decentralised services with infinite possibilities to the developers Illustration A \x0cProximaX is providing storage solution which is based on the Distributed File Management System (DFMS) that is essentially a peer to peer distributed architecture making the network decentralised and users free from the influence of any third party storage provider It also allows client side encryption making the data secure The system is immune to traditional threats of security and privacy as the system is based on an encrypted sharded file storage in a peer to peer network Absence of any central authority makes the network accessible 100 percent of the time as if some nodes go offline the next sufficient node takes its place The P2P decentralised cloud storage network is based on IPFS that comes with the following significant benefits High Availability Files are replicated across peers to ensure that they are always available to be consumed by any peers on the network Fault Tolerant Peers on the network allows operational continuity in the event of single or multiple peer failure or downtime This essentially means that If one peer or group of peers goes down the network storage locates the closest peer available to continue its operation Deduplication The solution will have a data compression technology that detects duplicate files and avoid copying the same file to the network Content Addressable Storage (CAS) A mechanism for storing information that can be retrieved based on its content not its storage location This essentially means that files uploaded to the network will always have a hash that\xe2\x80\x99s based on the content of the file making it uniquely distinctive from any similar files \x0cHigh Performance The distributed architecture scales better than a traditional centralised storage The storage solution will scale based on the number of peers that participates on the network The more peers who participates the more performant (in terms of storage and bandwidth) the solution will be Clustered/Distributed Peers that are part of the network ensure that the data is replicated across to maximise availability Immutability Every file uploaded cannot be removed or modified by any peers on the network This is because files are all identifiable via a hash that uses the file\ s content (known as Content addressable storage) This identification system ensures that every file version is unique and won\ t overwrite any similar file on the network Access Content Offline (caching) A caching mechanism on the consumer (client) side ensures that when a content is loaded it caches it so that it will still be available even if the consumer goes offline Multihash Protocol The solution uses multihash protocol for differentiating outputs from various well established cryptographic hash functions addressing size and encoding considerations Web Service HTTP API The P2P storage nodes will have a built in Exposed Web Services endpoints for developers to easily integrate the storage with their Decentralised Applications A P2P decentralised cloud storage network based on the IPFS solution and integrated with the NEM Public/Private blockchain technology offers many advantages that centralised cloud storage does not Client side encryption ensures data security and a \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Retrievability\xe2\x80\x9d that maintains data integrity ProximaX P2P cloud storage network can significantly reduce the impact of security breaches and infrastructure failures This open \x0cand democratised market will greatly reduce the cost of P2P cloud storage networks Moreover the data hosted on the P2P cloud storage network will be resistant to data failures unauthorised access tampering and censorship ProximaX will utilise the PeerStream Protocol (PSP) a privacy P2P messaging online presence routing real time streaming protocol that is presently in development and designed to enable secure off chain communication channels between crypto identities PSP will be used in ProximaX streaming layer to ensure users and nodes privacy At its core PSP is a designed to be a privacy routing protocol Unlike onion and I2P routing PSP will be insulated and eliminates the risk of maintaining exit nodes and out proxies PSP will serve privacy routing via entry nodes and temporary interconnected routing circuits to privately connect users DApps IoTs live and stored contents in the ProximaX ecosystem The PSP layer will ensure the following benefits to end users and DApp developers Namespaced DApp Protocols ProximaX DApps will have the flexibility to design their own unique namespaced protocols to be carried by the PSP protocol Distributed Authentication and Verification In PSP users will directly authenticate and verify one another using crypto identities rather than trusting central authentication services where service integrity confidentiality availability and authenticity cannot be guaranteed \x0cDistributed Presence The PSP protocol will enable users to announce their presence status privately without revealing any PII and meta data such as users IP addresses In the PSP protocol users\xe2\x80\x99 crypto identities will be used to authenticate and verify presence events in a distributed manner Clustered/Distributed Presence and Real time Streaming Peers that are part of the network ensure that streams and presence data are replicated across to maximise availability Private and Anonymous Routing Privacy routing and anonymous discovery to maintain maximum level of anonymity for all participants Distributed Content Creation Empowering content creators by enabling creators to stream their content directly without a middleman As a base offering ProximaX will be adapted to use NEM\xe2\x80\x99s Catapult technology to operate in NEM\xe2\x80\x99s public blockchain eventually enabling anyone to join and participate in a common network An incentivisation mechanism will be implemented to encourage more users to join and participate in this network in addition to the PoI and harvesting incentivisation already existing in the NEM public network The Proof of Importance consensus (discussed in detail in next sections) will be expanded with a secondary layer of consensus protocols measuring and rewarding storage and bandwidth contribution so that XPX rewards can be given out (a side chain may have to be created) DApp developers will be given the liberty and flexibility to design their own unique monetisation model through configurable economy models \x0cProximaX will use multi layered Consensus protocols for voting governance harvesting and to reward network nodes contributing storage and bandwidth resources to the network ProximaX nodes DApp developers and content creators will be paid in XPX tokens based on their activities on the platform as discussed in the next sections of this document Three major consensus protocols will be used to govern on chain and off chain resources services and activities \xe2\x97\x8f Proof of Importance (PoI) This is a blockchain consensus mechanism introduced by NEM The function is similar to Proof of Stake where the nodes need to \xe2\x80\x98vest\xe2\x80\x99 an amount of currency to become eligible for creating blocks However in PoI user\ s importance is determined by how many tokens they have and the number of transactions made to and from their wallet In PoI transactions volume one\ s overall support of the network and trust become factors \xe2\x97\x8f Proof of Storage (PoSt) Also called Proof of Capacity PoSt is a method where a single node dedicates a non trivial amount of disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider PoSt is very similar to Proof of Work the difference is instead of computation storage is used Proof of Storage is relevant yet considerably different from memory hard functions and proofs of retrievability \xe2\x97\x8f Proof of Bandwidth (PoB) ProximaX will use multiple oracle verification mechanisms to report and validate P2P nodes bandwidth contribution to the network \x0cIllustration B \x0cProximaX can be deployed in a private mode in the form of a decentralised privately owned network of file storage and sharing where clients can synchronise and organise files across multiple devices automatically and privately in a protected environment With ProximaX users can seamlessly and securely share their files and data without the issue of trust They will always know how and where their data confidential information and files are being used The blockchain identity verification will prevent many kinds of security problems ProximaX Dapp developers will have the flexibility to design Dapps for different kinds of content creation in the ProximaX ecosystem Where ProximaX consensus protocols will reward content creators periodically as their contents are being viewed Subscribed ProximaX users can support content creators by simply viewing their contents (ProximaX subscription and dynamically configurable economy model discussed in detail in next sections) Part of the consensus protocol will manage the filtering of illegal or offensive content While this is an open and apolitical platform it is essential to allow the clients of the system \x0cto flag and remove content If a sufficient percentage of the customer base downvotes content storage and broadcasts will be restricted In the absence of central authority this mechanism will ensure a secure and safe experience Attribution of streams is anonymous in ProximaX It will not be possible to determine the IP address or personal information of a stream creator Content viewers will enjoy the same anonymity This is the key feature of the streaming component of ProximaX total privacy and anonymity Presence and discovery will be obfuscated via privacy routes so that no server will be aware of the contents Only the end user participants will be able to produce or view the content intended for them Fraud prevention is an even bigger challenge in decentralised systems ProximaX will integrate a KYC feature to know the audience developers and content creators The KYC feature will inform the consensus layer to cut down on fraud and identify malicious nodes whilst maintaining security and zero proof privacy and anonymity as is necessary \x0cIllustration C \x0cProximaX will develop a dynamically configurable economy model that is based on periodic (monthly/annual) subscription ProximaX users will periodically use the native token (XPX) to subscribe to the network in exchange to \xe2\x80\x98ProximaX Power\xe2\x80\x99 (PXP) ProximaX will develop a system to define charge and consume user\ s \xe2\x80\x98power\xe2\x80\x99 over subscription periods Payments will take place on a side chain \xe2\x80\x98power\xe2\x80\x99 layer rather than the core blockchain transaction layer Power layer will have a consensus model tuned for higher frequency power distribution Power will be allotted to users via cross chain exchanges with the core NEM blockchain transaction layer In ProximaX there are three major parties that can expect to get paid in the dynamicallyconfigurable economy model \xe2\x97\x8f ProximaX nodes (Blockchain + Storage + Bandwidth) (ALWAYS PAID) \xe2\x97\x8f ProximaX Decentralised Application (DApp) developers \xe2\x97\x8f ProximaX Users (content providers / creators) ProximaX will provide a set of APIs for app developers to configure different app economy models For example an app developer can define distribution of the consumer users\xe2\x80\x99 subscribed power as 30% for ProximaX Network 10% for app developer and 60% for content providers Another app can be configured to charge 0% and distribute the consumer users\xe2\x80\x99 power across the network and content providers or only to the network The economy API set will have a minimum required limit for power distribution to the network nodes The higher the app pays the network the higher importance score will be assigned to the app namespace/protocol which in turn results in higher network resources quality of service (QoS) \x0cProximaX will use a subscription monetisation model where users periodically subscribe to the network to add \xe2\x80\x98power\xe2\x80\x99 to their accounts A user\xe2\x80\x99s POWER will be measured and controlled by ProximaX consensus protocols looking at network resources consumed by the user In return ProximaX consensus protocol will pay app developers and app content creators with native XPX tokens equivalent to the power spent by DApp users Instead of defining a single economy model ProximaX will provide a dynamic economy model via a configurable API set giving DApp developers the flexibility to edit and configure their own unique economy model ProximaX will provide mechanisms to enable freemium models using commercial nodes Commercial nodes in ProximaX are centralised nodes owned and hosted by the DApp developer yet connected to the ProximaX distributed network Commercial nodes will subscribe to the ProximaX platform to enable a freemium model for DApp protocols In return ProximaX will serve the DApp users for free as the commercial node will cover the network expense of carrying and serving the DApp protocol The commercial node model aims to solve two different problems to support a freemium structure and to enable flexible backend support for DApp\xe2\x80\x99s beyond ProximaX protocol capabilities Commercial nodes can be used by DApp developers to host dynamic backend business

will initially be launched by the Gibraltar company Proximax Limited Gibraltar is a crypto friendly jurisdiction with high standards of regulation and an ideal place from which to conduct the XPX token sale Post ICO a foundation will be formed similar to that established by the NEM io Foundation Proximax Limited will contribute the sum raised to the foundation for the purpose of promoting and developing the ProximaX project \x0cThe ProximaX project is an open source project that is meant to be publicly owned used and deployed The solution integrates and uses the NEM public blockchain to manage the tokens in the form of Mosaic There shall be transaction fee associated with each transaction in the form of XEM that is required to transfer XPX The XPX token arising out of this has no security instrument tied to it and is a consumptive or utility token the value of which is determined by market demand and supply The XPX token will be distributed through the Initial Coin Offering campaign The final number of XPX tokens per Stake to be issued depends on the number of Stakes subscribed \xe2\x80\x9cStake(s)\xe2\x80\x9d means the right to acquire a certain number of XPX tokens from ProximaX as more particularly described below (a) The total XPX token supply will be nine billion (9 000 000 000) (b) Each Stake shall be sold for USD$ 750 00 at the applicable NEM (\xe2\x80\x9cXEM\xe2\x80\x9d) Ethereum (\xe2\x80\x9cETH\xe2\x80\x9d) Bitcoin (\xe2\x80\x9cBTC\xe2\x80\x9d) or Xarcade tokens [as described in www xarcade io] (\xe2\x80\x9cXAR\xe2\x80\x9d) price

Stakes (a pre ICO) (the \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate Sale\xe2\x80\x9d) where private investors shall be invited to purchase large block offerings of Stakes at a discount \x0c(e) The Private Sale shall take place first and thereafter a public sale (the \xe2\x80\x9cPublic Sale\xe2\x80\x9d) whereby contributors will be able to register on the Website to purchase Stakes at USD$ 750 per Stake The Public Sale shall take place during the Public Sale Period (15 April to 25 April 2018) (f) Five billion (5 000 000 000) XPX (the \xe2\x80\x9c5 billion Tokens\xe2\x80\x9d) will be sold during Private Sale and the Public Sale (the \xe2\x80\x9cToken Sale Period\xe2\x80\x9d) Four billion (4 000 000 000) XPX (the \xe2\x80\x9cReserved Tokens\xe2\x80\x9d) shall be retained by ProximaX for distribution to the founders the core team vendors for marketing and for use by a not for profit foundation to be formed by ProximaX in order to promote and develop the ProximaX platform for the long term (g) Stakes sold during the Token Sale Period shall entitle contributors to acquire a proportion of the 5 billion Tokens only Contributors shall not be entitled to receive any proportion of the Reserved Tokens Stakes therefore refer to the right to acquire a proportion of the 5 billion Tokens only (h) The final number of XPX per Stake to be issued by ProximaX will depend upon the number of Stakes purchased by contributors during the Token Sale Period (i) A maximum of 150 000 (one hundred and fifty thousand) Stakes shall be sold during the Token Sale Period and once this target is reached no more Stakes shall be sold (j) The 5 billion Tokens shall be divided by the total number of Stakes sold during the Token Sale Period Each contributor shall receive a share of the 5 billion Tokens proportionate to the number of Stakes they have each purchased The number of XPX due to each contributor shall be calculated by dividing 5 billion by the final number of Stakes sold during the Token Sale Period XPX

technological innovation However it is just that \xe2\x80\x9ca start \xe2\x80\x9d Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a market catalyst to adoption and transformation As a driver of new currencies like Bitcoin it is purpose built On its own it is limited and requires significant additive solutions and protocols in parallel to provide useful easily adopted services that can cross the divide between a \xe2\x80\x9cpure technology play\xe2\x80\x9d to real world application and utility This lies at the crux of what ProximaX serves to solve Current inmarket implementations and developing blockchain projects have only solved for utility in small and limited implementations or have overshot the mark with largely unsustainable albeit powerful virtual machines Consider these projects as prototypes permutations in the inevitable and continual march that will produce the standards of the future ProximaX proudly stands on the shoulders of those prototypes ProximaX is a leap forward providing a holistic solution that combines on and off chain services and protocols now purposebuilt for utility and the necessary replacement of end of life traditionally centralised architectures It is a revolution Blockchain reimagined and evolved \x0cTerm Definition Artificial Intelligence (AI) Simulation of human intelligence processes by machines especially computer systems Consensus A mechanism whereby decisions are made by consensus In the context of the blockchain technology it is a mechanism whereby the decision making is automatic by computer nodes participating in the network and each verifying one another making its own decision independently and then concurring collectively The majority that agrees will decide if a transaction is valid or not Content
