markets CoinMetro is well positioned to support and understand the needs of the wider fintech space helping to drive it forward CoinMetro Estonia is headquartered in Tallinn CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s partners and Token Buyback Program Integral to CoinMetro is the relationship to our strategic partner FXPIG an established Forex (\xe2\x80\x9cFX\xe2\x80\x9d) broker FXPIG\xe2\x80\x99s proven track record and experience in providing financial services will help CoinMetro to deliver its planned \xe2\x80\x9cToken Buyback Program \xe2\x80\x9d The Token Buyback Program is one of the ways CoinMetro

The digital economy is maturing and blockchain technology is changing the way we do business The financial sector is leading the way in blockchain and digital assets While some potential uses of blockchain technology may be years away the digital economy is already here The industry needs a bridge between traditional and emerging asset classes Experienced traders have teamed up with experienced developers to build this bridge CoinMetro is much more than a crypto exchange We are a fintech company working to improve and modernize the financial services sector which is still somewhat rigid and structurally conservative in nature Such characteristics are not in keeping with other sectors in the 21st Century Put simply the market is crying out for an innovative technology driven technology savvy solution like CoinMetro Our team with its tremendous experience and knowledge in the financial services sector is ready to provide it 2 2 Competitive Landscape 2 2 1 The FinTech Sector Over the past few years the EU\xe2\x80\x99s progressive regulators have made it easier for leading challenger banks including Atom Bank Tandem Bank Monzo Starling Bank Revolut (all UK based) and N26 (based in Germany) to obtain the financial license necessary to operate The fastest growing challenger banks \xe2\x80\x94 Revolut Monzo and N26 \xe2\x80\x94 customers through viral growth strategies and without a bank charter have acquired 2 5m The other 3 companies \xe2\x80\x94 Tandem Starling and Atom \xe2\x80\x94 waited to launch products until receiving their charters which took two years To date they collectively have only 52 000 customers Challenger banks are focused on rebundling retail banking services in 2018 and creating one platform for underbanked customers \xe2\x80\x93 a market that CoinMetro is also seeking to tap into Atom Bank Tandem Starling Bank Monzo N26 Revolut B2C \xe2\x9c\x85 \xe2\x9c\x85 \xe2\x9c\x85 \xe2\x9c\x85 \xe2\x9c\x85 \xe2\x9c\x85

date a number of prevailing issues besides compliance have dogged the crypto exchange landscape with the existing major exchanges seemingly incapable of offering a fully rounded user experience and struggling for high ratings amid strong interest from the public Some of the main issues include \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Platforms being unresponsive unattractive and/or difficult to use making them inaccessible to the mainstream A poor level of customer support and/or slow response times Limited support for fiat to crypto exchanging A lack of traditionally accepted investment tools Long wait times for account opening high fees unstable uptime Lack of liquidity for a growing number of ERC 20 tokens (altcoins) and Failure to adapt to regulatory changes Lack of security and user/market trust due to irregular hacks CoinMetro has a number of high profile competitors already operating in the Crypto space including

existing players as it aims to create a solution that is easy to use accessible to all and above all provides a fullyrounded consistent experience to its user base More specifically our service will take the following areas as major focal points in all operational endeavours \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Helping to establishing and adhere to industry wide regulation The highest level of customer support 24/7 Transparency in all areas of our business Ease of access to all users regardless of their knowledge level An open door to innovation not restricting ICOs by imposing high access fees Community centrism A client journey that starts with education a key risk mitigation tool and Inclusion of traditional financial products 9 | Page \x0c2 4 FXPIG Our Strategic Partner Since 2011 FXPIG has been a public and profitable Forex brokerage company with a focus on transparency high volume traders and customer service From its inception FXPIG has operated as a Straight Through Processing (STP) broker sending all client trades for real execution on the market and earning a commission on volume Additionally FXPIG has developed a second revenue stream with its managed (PAMM) account options which allow clients to work with vetted professional traders The combination of STP and PAMM accounts has resulted in a low attrition rate of clients high long term revenue and high user satisfaction CoinMetro proposes to adapt proven aspects of FXPIG\xe2\x80\x99s unique PAMM account models to fit the contours of the digital economy through our innovative Tokenized Asset Management (TAM) features A crossover of team members and technology from FXPIG as well as our Token Buyback Program (see section 4 0 5 for further details) will enable us to bring years of industry experience existing ties and established models into the development of the user focused CoinMetro platform Our team has experience building relationships with banks and payment gateways establishing international partnerships managing liquidity working with regulators analyzing markets developing trading systems and growing a dedicated user base FXPIG has over six years of experience dealing in both unregulated and regulated environments This has made us very agile and aware of the global regulatory outlook While regulation can take years to be finalized adoption can happen quite quickly If you take the FX space as an example the retail FX industry was virtually unregulated in the early 2000\xe2\x80\x99s or simply grouped under regulations that did not fit the underlying market Today there are essentially four main regulatory bodies the CTFC in the USA the FCA in the UK the ASIC in Australia and CySEC in Cyprus The latter houses more FX Brokers than the other three combined We expect that regulation of cryptocurrencies will come in a similar wave As recent research from one international consulting firm concluded \xe2\x80\x9cFuture controls on cryptocurrencies are generally trending towards tightened regulation that focuses on requiring exchange licensing and validation as well as AML KYC and other money transmission protections \xe2\x80\x9d Companies that are unfamiliar or inexperienced with these processes will face challenges moving forward CoinMetro intends to comply with laws and regulations applicable to it in the relevant jurisdictions For more information pertaining to FXPIG\xe2\x80\x99s business model its current relative financials and a brief view at its predicted growth over the next five years please see \xe2\x80\x98FXPIG Appendix 1 \xe2\x80\x99 2 5 Registration Licensing and Regulations (Multiple Jurisdictions) It is CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s policy to be and remain with each to the fullest degree We operate compliant with all regulatory legal and a robust and structured compliance statutory requirements as applicable to our program which revolves around developing business and the industry We are procedures for and identifying assessing committed to ensuring that all staff and maintaining and monitoring all compliance third parties working with us are aware of functions and processes their obligations under the regulatory Hileman & Rauchs emphasize that the system and our own compliance program biggest challenges faced by current It is our intention to stay up to date with all cryptocurrency exchanges are maintaining rules regulations and laws and to comply relationships with payment gateways 10 | Page \x0cbanks and traditional financial institutions Based on an analysis of non public data from over 150 companies in the cryptocurrency space their study notes \xe2\x80\x9cSmall exchanges seem to have considerable difficulties with either obtaining or maintaining banking relationships \xe2\x80\x9d Running a multi faceted fintech platform means that we will require multiple licenses in multiple jurisdictions to remain compliant with regards to the services we plan to provide The CoinMetro Token Sale took place in Hong Kong and was compliant with the regulatory environment there Moving forward CoinMetro intends to provide services in jurisdictions where it is licensed or where no license is required Before the end of 2018 CoinMetro intends to apply for further licensing in several jurisdictions that cover the full range of planned services As of 9 May 2018 CoinMetro is officially licensed (FIU FRK000121) to provide virtual currency wallet services This license enables the operation of the crypto services side of our business dealing in crypto transactions legally within the territory of Estonia where CoinMetro is headquartered As of 9 May 2018 CoinMetro is also officially licensed (FIU FVR000143) to provide fiat to virtual currency and virtual currency to virtual currency exchange services within the territory of Estonia This license allows us to operate our exchange dealing in both fiat and crypto serving clients both within the EU and worldwide subject to applicable law and accept payments via multiple gateways including SEPA transfers SWIFT transfers credit cards and external wallet systems from European Union residents CoinMetro is committed to ensuring compliance with the rules standards and regulations as laid out by its regulating and governing bodies and confirms that it has developed and implemented the appropriate procedures systems controls and measures to manage and mitigate risk As a regulated business we have a deep understanding of the comprehensive compliance standards that we are obliged to meet and confirm that we have in place effective and efficient tools and controls for meeting these obligations under the current regulatory system CoinMetro goes above and beyond current regulatory requirements and has decided to use exactly the same standards as banks and other financial institutions employ Our internal Compliance Manual which spans over 300 pages is based on and follows the requirements and guidance as set by the UK Financial Conduct Authority in the FCA Handbook Our Compliance Program is defined as a system which aims to \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Identify the standards rules and regulations to be complied with Set out the policies procedures and measures for following and adhering to these expectations Audit and monitor the systems and controls to ensure compliance and effectiveness Mitigate against applicable risks and effective breaches and Train and support staff in complying with regulatory legal and contractual obligations CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s objectives compliance are to \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f regarding Ensure that compliance is at the foundation of our company and that it is an integral part of all business and company functions and processes Ensure that all staff are aware of the regulations and their obligations regarding compliance and to provide sufficient and adequate support and training on all compliance matters Adhere to all Compliance Manual policies and procedures at all times Carry out frequent compliance audits and monitoring programs to ensure that functions and procedures are compliant fit for purpose and adhered to by all staff and Appoint a Compliance Officer who is responsible for developing implementing maintaining and monitoring all compliance functions and processes within the company We are also currently in talks to begin the process of acquiring an Estonian 11 | Page \x0cinvestment firm license from the the Estonian Financial Services Authority (\xe2\x80\x9cFinantsinspektsioon\xe2\x80\x9d) This license would cover our ETCF and TAM platforms and allow us to offer these services to a wide range of countries around the world again subject to the laws of each applicable jurisdiction We will look to acquire additional licenses in order to expand our regulatory footprint and remain compliant as CoinMetro grows and as new regulations come to light around the world 2 6 Banking Partnership CoinMetro is one of the only companies in the crypto space that has been onboarded by a banking partner (LHV) for both client deposits and our companies\xe2\x80\x99 operational accounts The onboarding process for CoinMetro was very rigorous and took therefore more than 5 months to complete Within that timeframe all of our Compliance and Risk procedures were reviewed by our banking partner Currently we are in talks with several international banks to expand our banking partnerships 3 The CoinMetro Ecosystem CoinMetro is an all in one platform for the digital economy providing a link between traditional finance and the digital asset economy We are a fully stocked financial services company with products that can bring us multiple sustainable revenue streams and add real lasting value to the wider fintech sector The crypto side of the CoinMetro ecosystem is comprised of four main components 1 A set of three fast feature rich licensed crypto exchanges and trading platforms facilitating the easy buying and selling of crypto assets 2 A tokenized asset management platform 3 An electronically traded crypto fund investment gateway and 4 A turnkey tokenization framework we call ICO Express The traditional finance side of the CoinMetro ecosystem is comprised of the following main components 1 Payment ledgers 2 Debit card services 3 IBAN accounts and 4 Currency conversion including crypto to fiat and vice versa All services offered will be accessible via a streamlined secure web application which has full integration with industry leading blockchain platforms The entire CoinMetro ecosystem will be supported by 24/7 customer support Client segments initially consist of retail customers mostly Once a solid book of soft liquidity has been established on the back of retails order flow the company will look to package and sell this liquidity in blocks up the chain to a more institutional level market segment All of this will be enabled through trading technology built in house including our own proprietary internal matching engine which works in close communication with our digital wallet management system The latter is underpinned by BitGO our custom charting software which makes use of the Chart IQ libraries all of which sits on a DDoS protected network managed by Cloudflare 12 | Page \x0c3 1 Product Pricing and Range The platform is intended to be accessible from both a web browser and via our own CoinMetrobranded iOS and Android apps API access and FIX 4 4 connectivity will be available Following the approach of our strategic partner FXPIG API and FIX access will be open to anyone who requests it with no minimum volume requirements or access fees We intend that holders of CoinMetro ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary token XCM will be offered discounts on fees based on their overall XCM holdings The more XCM they own the higher the discount will be This will likely incentivize clients to buy and hold XCM further reducing the available supply and maintaining a stable market price 3 1 1 Exchange Fee Structure (Bonus) Our proposal intends that takers on the exchange or clients who place orders that are filled immediately will pay a commission on all executed orders starting from a MAXIMUM of 0 10% Makers on the exchange or clients who place limit orders below the ticker price on the buy side and above the ticker price on the sell side will receive rebates that account for up to 50% of any fee charged to the taker that eventually hits their resting orders If two makers\xe2\x80\x99 orders are eventually matched (i e neither side is matched immediately) neither will be paid a rebate but no commissions will be charged to either side 3 1 2 Tokenized Asset Management (TAM) Through TAM clients will be able to work with a manager of their choice by investing in that manager\xe2\x80\x99s token Similar to earning a commission managers will profit from fees based on the high water mark principle (HWM) (i e the highest peak in value for a given account and investors will benefit based on the growth of their investment With a few clicks investors will be able to quickly move funds between manager specific tokens XCM and other crypto or fiat assets Blockchain based tokenization will facilitate a secure and transparent process where each trade can be linked back to specific investors and managers giving users a complete overview of their digital assets at all times CoinMetro will benefit from higher trade volumes as well as a fixed percentage of the TAM managers\xe2\x80\x99 HWM performance fees 3 1 3 ETCF Electronically Traded Crypto Fund (ETCF) is one of CoinMetro s unique concepts in which our team of professional investors hand picks baskets of digital assets using a variety of metrics and baskets them into a single offering ETCFs are designed for our clients to easily diversify their portfolios without time consuming research as well as to provide liquidity to new tokens entering the CoinMetro marketplace In addition to being able to diversify into an array of specific industries our clients will also be able to invest in funds based on their risk profile 3 1 4 Crypto Academy Crypto Academy is CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s unique and comprehensive cryptocurrency educational programme that helps our clients learn the basics of blockchain and cryptocurrencies 13 | Page \x0cThe online lessons come in the form of engaging short video lectures and written materials whereas the comprehensive structure of the course allows our clients to learn at their own pace The basic educational programme is free for everyone and only requires registration on our platform 3 1 5 Debit Card To provide clients with instant access to their CoinMetro wallet balances we plan to offer a number of CoinMetro debit card variants With these cards which will be tied to unique IBANs clients will be able to withdraw cash instantly at ATM locations worldwide without the need for moving funds onto the card beforehand We will provide both a free and a premium debit card product and are currently in discussions with a number of providers The premium card will come with a fixed monthly cost However it will include a list of available perks to offset the fee Having done an extensive amount of market research in this space (see section 6 1) we are well placed to offer very low rates to our customers \xe2\x80\x93 which should aid product uptake \xe2\x80\x93 while still remaining extremely competitive in the market 3 1 6 IBAN IBAN stands for International Bank Account Number CoinMetro will be able to issue its clients instant IBAN accounts in all the cryptocurrencies available on the platform Our clients will be allowed to fund their IBAN accounts use them to send and/or receive payments as well as to activate an attached debit card (see 3 1 3) 3 1 7 Lending CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s unique lending platform is intended to give passive investors an opportunity to earn interest on their cryptocurrency balances and create potential for under capitalized traders to increase their profits Our lending platform is envisaged to work by letting lenders state their daily rate on which they are prepared to lend borrowers will be able to accept and immediately use the underlying assets as margin CoinMetro plans to offer BTC LTC and ETH lending options 3 1 8 Leverage Liquidity provider relationships fostered by our strategic partner FXPIG allows us to offer clients access to 1 50 leverage when trading non deliverable OTC digital assets either via our browser based platform or through an API or FIX connectivity Leverage on our matching engine will be capped at 1 10 initially when trading using borrowed margin by way of our give and take lending platform Higher leverage will be made available to clients with a proven track record of low risk operations on a case 14 | Page \x0cby case basis Via our partnership with FXPIG CoinMetro intends to offer FIX and API access to our exchange by way of a Prime of Prime model where FXPIG is the margin/credit provider This will give individual and institutional traders access to exchange grade liquidity spreads and execution quality paired with CFD like available leverage 3 1 9 Risk Limitation We propose that CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s underlying risk management strategy will use designated margin wallets to mitigate damages and prevent losses when trading using borrowed margin on our give and take lending platform Position losses will be covered by funds in a trader\xe2\x80\x99s margin wallet which serve solely as collateral If the net value of a trader\xe2\x80\x99s account falls below the required maintenance margin their position will be forced into liquidation To open a position we propose that a trader will be initially required to allocate 30% margin based on the desired position size Should the net value of the account fall below 15% of the value of the margin position the account will be liquidated 3 1 10 Ecosystem growth We believe that giving people additional opportunities to earn by engaging with the platform will incentivize client participation retention and enthusiasm It also ensures more liquidity within the engine which keeps spreads low and generates higher overall volumes We intend for users to be rewarded for participation in COIN and for the scope of rewarded activities to grow and 3 1 11 Decentralization and Atomic Swaps Generally cryptocurrency exchanges are at least \xe2\x80\x9csemi centralized \xe2\x80\x9d given that assets are often held by the exchange on behalf of its client base The move toward fully decentralized exchange mechanisms has begun and CoinMetro plans to take a proactive approach to this technology The CoinMetro team sees technology like Polkadot Cosmos and Aion approaching and understands that atomic swaps and cross chain communication will be extremely significant going forward change as the platform develops At release of the CoinMetro platform users will be rewarded for simply signing up to CoinMetro and creating a wallet using the exchange for the first time referring friends to the platform and completing user feedback forms designed to help the team improve the platform locked smart contracts where no third party intervention is needed to complete the transaction The smart contract will act as a form of timed escrow ensuring that both parties are protected in the event that one party defaults on the transaction It is intended that this exchange mechanism will carry fees that will be almost zero from our side as it will be considered an added service for clients who are trading smaller volumes and those that do not require immediate execution CoinMetro intends to offer atomic swap like \xe2\x80\x98peer 2 peer secure exchanges\xe2\x80\x99 using time 15 | Page \x0cusers the opportunity to buy multiple tokens at once will help stabilize prices of those tokens during initial sell swings as the token becomes tradable As with our TAM platform all ETCF\xe2\x80\x99s will be priced in COIN We believe that pricing these products in COIN will contribute to token price stability and as usage of the platform accelerates we expect to see this positively affect the underlying price 3 2 ICO Express Platform CoinMetro aims to offer a powerful turnkey ICO Express Platform that will give vetted ICO\xe2\x80\x99s access to transparent and secure funding rounds CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s team of senior engineers will formally review all aspects of token sale proposals including project feasibility idea novelty financial justification and legal compliance It is our intention that approved projects will have access to CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s complete Token Express Platform and a dedicated support team Through our proposed interface users will be able to issue tokens and ICO contracts using input parameters Tokens issued through CoinMetro will be liquid and immediately tradable on the CoinMetro exchange following the token sale The ICO Express platform will also offer an automatic smart contract mechanism capable of creating smart contracts and deploying them on the Ethereum NEO and NEM blockchains It is also proposed that the Token Express Platform will offer the option of including a client\xe2\x80\x99s token inside CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s ETCF board when launched (see paragraph 3 3 2) 3 2 1 Easy DAO Registration CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem aims to allow projects to register and deploy their business as a specialized smart contract or Mosaic on the Ethereum NEO or NEM blockchain This will allow users to formalize their business transactions without the explicit need of a \xe2\x80\x98paper corporation \xe2\x80\x99 3 2 2 Fiat and Cryptocurrency Deposits We envisage that CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s planned infrastructure and banking relationships will enable fiat and cryptocurrency deposits on one platform It is intended that users will be able to make deposits through a wide range of channels including credit card e wallet local bank deposit SWIFT transfer SEPA transfer and multiple cryptocurrencies 3 2 3 Smart Contracts Smart contracts and digital tokens will be easily issuable on the ETH NEO and NEM blockchains through the Coinmetro platform\xe2\x80\x99s planned interface As new blockchain innovations emerge there is potential to integrate new features and platforms into CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s ecosphere Smart contracts provide users with automated low fee transactions that provide a higher level of security than those that rely on standard localized databases To reduce latency all smart contracts related to live trading will be created or written post16 | Page \x0ctrade As blockchain technology becomes faster we will explore the option to write all trade data in real time inside a distributed ledger Smart contracts will manage approval workflows between counterparties and calculate trading settlement amounts with a level of accuracy not found in standard database technology 3 2 4 Quick to Market Through our vetting process and token interface the CoinMetro ecosystem aspires to foster innovation by giving projects the infrastructure and tools they need to raise funds gain support and launch atop a stable platform Tokens issued through CoinMetro will be liquid and immediately tradable on the exchange following the token sale 3 2 5 White Labeling Opportunities CoinMetro proposes creating unique white labelling opportunities for enterprise clients through our token sale platform Clients will be able to white label our digital wallet and portal setup allowing them to offer crypto and fiat payments to their own user base and token sale participants CoinMetro plans to allow token issuers to create and customize their own branded interface and backend while taking advantage of the tools such as easy token issuance provided by our larger ecosystem architecture When initial token sales end tokens will be immediately tradable on the main exchange with the option to add the token to one or more of our curated ETCF baskets for additional liquidity 3 3 CoinMetro Platform Design 3 3 1 User Interface Blockchain as an underlying protocol has the potential to radically transform the business landscape across many major industries A developer focused community is striving to advance the technology while at the same time a lack of usability is widely recognized as a major barrier to entry into what is already possible within the blockchain space A 2017 article from Cointelegraph honed in on the crucial role of user experience in relation to building sustainable businesses in the blockchain space \xe2\x80\x9cCreating user interfaces that can enable the easy application of Blockchain solutions without any special coding skills or extra computer language specialization appears to be an important aspect of industry development if Blockchain is to go mainstream \xe2\x80\x9d User experience is a core aspect of the vision for CoinMetro We aim to provide a featurerich platform that combines secure backend infrastructure with a highly intuitive front end interface Simple sign up instant access direct payment processing asset mobility and unparalleled customer support are defining features of our vision for the platform 3 3 2 Customer Support 17 | Page \x0cCoinMetro intends to include a dedicated customer support center and thorough documentation for the purposes of ensuring that the platform is suited to users coming from all levels of experience In addition to a 24/7 dedicated help desk we plan to integrate a friendly on brand AI bot \xe2\x80\x9cFrank\xe2\x80\x9d designed to assist clients with troubleshooting questions and quick reference guides CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s customer support network plans to include a live chat option via Intercom an extended FAQ section knowledge base Slack channel and supplemental videos to walk through important features 4 Security CoinMetro has established an industry leading security program dedicated to ensuring that customers have the highest level of confidence in our custody of their data Our security program is aligned to the ISO 27000 standards and will be regularly audited and assessed by third parties and customers We are in the process of getting our ISO 27001 certification and finalizing the implementation of our Information Security Management System (ISMS) in the next 6 to 9 months CoinMetro has defined roles and responsibilities to delineate which roles in the organization are responsible for operating the various aspects of our Information Security Management System (ISMS) 4 1 Key Aspects of CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s Security Program 4 1 1 Product Security \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f

critical infrastructure including CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s public key infrastructure event monitoring and authentication services Maintain a secure archive of security relevant logs and Consult with operations personnel to ensure the secure configuration and maintenance of CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production environment 4 1 3 CSIRT \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Respond to alerts related to security events on CoinMetro systems Manage security incidents and Acquire and analyze threat intelligence 4 1 4 Risk and Compliance \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Coordinate penetration testing Manage vulnerability scanning and remediation Coordinate regular risk assessments and define and track risk treatment 18 | Page \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Manage the security awareness program Coordinate audit and maintain security certifications Respond to customer inquiries and Review and qualify vendor security posture CoinMetro divides its systems into separate networks to better protect more sensitive data Systems supporting testing and development activities are hosted in a separate network from systems supporting CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production website Customer data submitted into the CoinMetro services is only permitted to exist in CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production network its most tightly controlled network Administrative access to systems within the production network is limited to those engineers with a specific business need Network access to CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production environment from open public networks (the internet) is restricted Only a small number of production servers are accessible from the internet Only those network protocols essential for delivery of CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s service to its users are open at CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s perimeter CoinMetro deploys mitigations against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at its network perimeter Changes to CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production network configuration are restricted to authorized personnel In CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s hosted production environment control of network devices is retained by the hosting provider For that reason Intrusion Detection / Intrusion Prevention (IDS/IPS) are performed using host based controls For example CoinMetro logs monitors and audits system calls and has developed alerts for system calls that indicate a potential intrusion 4 1 5 Penetration Testing CoinMetro engages independent entities to conduct regular application level and infrastructure level penetration tests Results of these tests are shared with CoinMetro management CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s Security Team reviews and prioritizes the reported findings and tracks them to resolution 4 1 6 Protecting Customer Data The focus of CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s security program is to prevent unauthorized access to customer data To this end our team of dedicated security practitioners working in partnership with peers across all our teams takes exhaustive steps to identify and mitigate risks implement best practices and constantly evaluate ways to improve 4 1 7 Data Encryption in Transit and At Rest CoinMetro transmits data over public networks using strong encryption This includes data transmitted between CoinMetro clients and the CoinMetro platform CoinMetro supports the latest recommended secure cipher suites to encrypt all traffic in transit including use of TLS 1 2 protocols AES256 encryption and SHA2 signatures as supported by the clients CoinMetro monitors the changing cryptographic landscape and upgrades the cipher suite choices as the landscape changes while also balancing the need for compatibility with older clients Data at rest in CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production network is encrypted using FIPS 140 2 compliant encryption standards This applies to all types of data at rest within CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s systems \xe2\x80\x94 19 | Page \x0crelational databases database backups etc CoinMetro stores encryption keys in a secure server on a segregated network with very limited access Keys are never stored on the local filesystem but are delivered at process start time and retained only in memory while in use The CoinMetro service is hosted in data centers maintained by industry leading service providers (AWS) Data center providers offer state of the art physical protection for the servers and related infrastructure that comprise the operating environment for the CoinMetro service These service providers are responsible for restricting physical access to CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s systems to authorized personnel Each CoinMetro customer\xe2\x80\x99s data is hosted in CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s shared infrastructure and segregated logically by the CoinMetro application CoinMetro uses a combination of storage technologies to ensure customer data is protected from hardware failures and returns quickly when requested 4 1 8 Network Security CoinMetro divides its systems into separate networks to better protect more sensitive data Systems supporting testing and development activities are hosted in a separate network from systems supporting CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production website Customer data submitted into the CoinMetro platform is only permitted to exist in CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production network its most tightly controlled network Administrative access to systems within the production network is limited to those engineers with a specific business need Network access to CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production environment from open public networks (the internet) is restricted Only a small number of production servers are accessible from the internet Only those network protocols essential for delivery of CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s service to its users are open at CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s perimeter CoinMetro deploys mitigations against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at its network perimeter Changes to CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production network configuration are restricted to authorized personnel In CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s hosted production environment control of network devices is retained by the hosting provider For that reason Intrusion Detection / Intrusion Prevention (IDS/IPS) are performed using host based controls For example CoinMetro logs monitors and audits system calls and has developed alerts for system calls that indicate a potential intrusion 4 1 9 Classifying and Inventorying data To better protect the data in our care CoinMetro classifies data into different levels and species the labeling and handling requirements for each of those classes CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s ISMS considers data classifications in its encryption standards its access control and authorization procedures and incident response standards among other security documents Customer data is classified at the highest level Data classifications are maintained as part of the asset management process CoinMetro inventories hardware software and data assets at least annually to maintain correct data classification levels 20 | Page \x0c4 1 10 Authorizing Access To minimize the risk of data exposure CoinMetro adheres to the principle of least privilege \xe2\x80\x94 workers are only authorized to access data that they reasonably need to handle in order to fulfill their current job responsibilities To ensure that users are so restricted CoinMetro employs the following measures \xe2\x97\x8f All systems used at CoinMetro require users to authenticate and users are granted unique identifiers for that purpose \xe2\x97\x8f Each user\xe2\x80\x99s access is reviewed at least quarterly to ensure the access granted is still appropriate for the user\xe2\x80\x99s current job responsibilities Workers may be granted access to a small number of internal systems such as the corporate CoinMetro instance by default upon hire Requests for additional access follow a documented process and are approved by the responsible owner or manager and tracked by CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s HR IT and IT Security Teams 4 1 11 Authentication To further reduce the risk of unauthorized access to data CoinMetro employs multi factor authentication for administrative access to systems with more highly classified data Where possible and appropriate CoinMetro uses private keys for authentication For example at this time administrative access to production servers requires operators to connect using both an SSH key and a one time password associated with a device specific token Where passwords are used multi factor authentication is enabled for access to higher data classifications The passwords themselves are required to be complex (auto generated to ensure uniqueness longer than 12 characters and not consisting of a single dictionary word among other requirements) CoinMetro requires personnel to use an approved password manager Password managers generate store and enter unique and complex passwords Use of a password manager helps avoid password reuse phishing and other behaviors that can reduce security 4 1 12 System Monitoring Logging and Alerting CoinMetro monitors servers workstations and mobile devices to retain and analyze a comprehensive view of the security state of its corporate and production infrastructure Administrative access use of privileged commands and system calls on all servers in CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production network are logged CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s Security Team collects and stores production logs for analysis Logs are stored in a separate network Access to this network is restricted to members of the Security Team Logs are protected from modification and retained for at least two years Analysis of logs is automated to the extent practical to detect potential issues and alert responsible personnel Alerts are examined and resolved based on documented priorities 21 | Page \x0c4 1 13 Endpoint Monitoring CoinMetro workstations run a variety of monitoring tools that may detect suspicious code or unsafe configuration or user behavior CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s Security Team monitors workstation alerts and ensures significant issues are resolved in a timely fashion 4 1 14 Responding to Security Incidents CoinMetro has established policies and procedures (also known as runbooks) for responding to potential security incidents All incidents are managed by CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated Computer Security Incident Response Team CoinMetro defines the types of events that must be managed via the incident response process Incidents are classified by severity Incident response procedures are tested and updated at least annually 4 1 15 Data and Media Disposal Customer data is removed immediately upon deletion or message retention expiration CoinMetro hard deletes all information from currently running production systems (excluding team and channel names and search terms embedded in URLs in web server access logs) Backups are destroyed within 14 days CoinMetro follows industry standards and advanced techniques for data destruction CoinMetro defines policies and standards requiring media be properly sanitized once it is no longer in use CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s hosting provider is responsible for ensuring removal of data from disks allocated to CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s use before they are repurposed 4 1 16 Protecting Secrets CoinMetro has implemented appropriate safeguards to protect the creation storage retrieval and destruction of secrets such as encryption keys and service account credentials 4 1 17 Workstation Security All workstations issued to workers are configured by CoinMetro to comply with our standards for security These standards require all workstations to be properly configured kept updated run monitoring software and be tracked by CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s endpoint management solution CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s default configuration sets up workstations to encrypt data have strong passwords and lock when idle Workstations run up to date monitoring software to report potential malware and unauthorized software and mobile storage devices Controlling system operations and continuous deployment We take a variety of steps to combat the introduction of malicious or erroneous code to our operating environment and protect against unauthorized access 4 1 18 Controlling Change To minimize the risk of data exposure CoinMetro controls changes especially changes to production systems very carefully CoinMetro applies change control requirements to systems 22 | Page \x0cthat store data at higher levels of sensitivity These requirements are designed to ensure that changes potentially impacting Customer Data are documented tested and approved before deployment 4 1 19 Prevention and Detection of Malicious Code In addition to general change control procedures that apply to our systems CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s production network is subject to additional safeguards against malware 4 1 20 Server Hardening New servers deployed to production are hardened by disabling unneeded and potentially insecure services removing default passwords and applying CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s custom configuration settings to each server before use 4 2 Tech Stack Image 3 CoinMetro Backoffice components 4 2 1 Web Application CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s core user interface will be built using ReactJS React is flexible and scalable making it perfect for designing interactive UIs To build a fully functional dynamic application we will supplement ReactJS with Gulp to automate tasks and manage content and template changes The combination of the two offers a powerful alternative to existing task runners allowing us to streamline our development workflow and optimize existing code 4 2 2 REST API Our platform\xe2\x80\x99s REST API will be developed using NodeJS TypeScript and Express With a keen awareness of best practices CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s REST architecture will emphasize performance 23 | Page \x0cscalability and security while remaining highly flexible simple and stable This layer is intended to provide a secure reliable connection between the frontend interface and the CoinMetro database The API will employ essential input validation to prevent cross site request forgery attacks and cross site scription (XSS) or SQL breaches We propose that main authorization will be performed using tokens in request headers with all the resource collections being processed in standalone units whenever possible The API\xe2\x80\x99s internal functionalities are envisaged to be quite complex however the external layer is planned to be been kept open and remain simple to work with Access permissions will be restricted and closely monitored with end users only able to gain access to specific portions of the full API workflow Frequent onsite security audits are intended to ensure that the API is constantly evolving based on real world production level risk analysis The CoinMetro API will be available to our partners enabling them to build third party services and applications that communicate with our core database 4 2 3 Database CoinMetro plans to use the open source document oriented database program MongoDB to handle authentication network isolation and encryption Fully elastic and natively \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d structure supportive Mongo is built to scale and is highly available by default Role based access controls enhance data security while optimized dashboards highlight key historical metrics MongoDB Atlas has been independently audited and confirmed to meet privacy and compliance standards In addition to Mongo CoinMetro will deploy PostgreSQL a powerful open source fully ACID compliant object relational database system Backed by over 15 years of active development PostgreSQL\xe2\x80\x99s proven architecture has earned it a strong reputation for reliability data integrity and performance 24 | Page \x0c4 2 4 Order Management System Image 3 Order Management System components CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s Order Management System will be a basic low level component that serves the exchange the TAM as well as the ETCF platform It will be based on Redis an in memory database that supports a high speed of write/read operations Submitted via a TCP/IP socket order queues will be optimized for high speed matching through our engine\xe2\x80\x99s Redis implementation Integration of Redis with NodeJS/TypeScript will provide cache lock and path optional backends as well as a placeholder module for easier integration of contributed modules 4 2 5 Public Blockchain Use To ensure transparency CoinMetro proposes using a public blockchain to provide accessible and immutable storage for historic values including Order Matching Engine execution times volumes slippage reports and other information related to system wide transparency Token Express data on distributed tokens token sale contribution data smart contract timelines and other data pertinent to the transparency of the platform as a whole TAM TAM managers trading statistics amount of tokens sold and at what price daily statement snapshots including profit and loss from previous days and the resulting token price 25 | Page \x0c Using NEM\xe2\x80\x99s public blockchain optional Mirror applications will let companies share their indicators reinforcing data authority via unchangeable blockchain storage It is proposed that a CoinMetro private NEM blockchain be used for storing sensitive information ensuring data immutability Even in the event of a compromised database a full NEM backup will exist containing a 100% in tact blockchain record of all pertinent data and user verification statuses 5 CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s Token Sales 2017/18 5 1 1 Pre Token Sale Summary The pre Token Sale started on December 21st 2017 and was preceded by a 10 day Whitelist campaign via telegram The pre Token Sale ended on January 11 2018 Results A total of $3 109 748 USD was contributed 52 975 457 XCM tokens were sold The total number of contributors was 2 095 5 1 2 Token Sale Summary The Token sale started on February 21st 2018 and ended on March 31st 2018 Results A total of $14 805 984 69 USD was contributed 127 665 508 XCM tokens were sold The total number of contributors was 6 978 5 1 3 Value of COIN after the Token Sale CoinMetro placed no guarantee as to the price of COIN following the sale nor that CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s exchange or any secondary market would be available It was stated that COIN price would depend on a number of factors 5 1 4 Vesting Rules for Certain Pre Token Sale Participants COIN purchased at 0 03 and 0 05 EUR are subject to a special vesting schedule to support a stable pricing environment following token distribution Participants who bought in at 0 03 EUR were informed that they\xe2\x80\x99d have access to 20% of their total purchase after an initial vesting period of 90 days following distribution The other 80% would be vested for an additional 90 days Also participants who bought in at 0 05 EUR would have access to 33% of their total purchase after an initial vesting period of 90 days following distribution It was also said that the other 67% would be vested for an additional 90 days Participants buying in at all other price points were told that they would see their purchases distributed in their entirety on the date of distribution 5 2 The Long Term Stability of COIN Many ERC20 tokens focus on speculation rather than utility which is not encouraged by CoinMetro Long term value for those tokens starts at utility and their price also relies on 26 | Page \x0csupply and demand In order to manage supply help reduce volatility and enable persons who need COIN to obtain them CoinMetro created a three pronged approach as outlined here It is planned that all fees payable to CoinMetro either on our exchange via our investment vehicles such as the TAM and ETCF platforms or for our ICO related services via the ICO Express gateway will be paid in COIN Each time a fee is paid whether it is priced in BTC ETH USD or any other currency an equivalent amount of COIN will be purchased on the exchange to cover said fees Thus the buy side on our exchange platform will be very active In the event that no sell orders are present to support the needed conversions resting COIN sell orders from CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity reserve will be added to the book at a price equal to the indicative market value We intend that holders of COIN tokens will be offered discounts on fees based on their overall COIN holdings The more COIN they own the higher the discount will be This will likely incentivize clients to buy and hold COIN further reducing the available supply NOTE This is part and partial to the LIFETIME discounts that were offered to our pre Token Sale and Token Sale contributors which are not based on their total individual contribution 5 2 1 Bonus Structure for Token Sale Participants \xe2\x97\x8f Token Sale participants are privy to private invitations and exclusive opportunities concerning all future Token Sales offered by any of CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s founders as well as special pricing on select Token Sales launched via our ICO Express Platform 5 2 2 Bonus Structure for Pre Token Sale and Token Sale Participants \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Pre Token Sale contributors will be eligible for a bonus of up to 500% based on the final COIN value should we reach our 300 000 000 COIN hardcap during the pre Token Sale/Token Sale event NOTE Although this discount is sizeable this is only for the first 2 5% of tokens sold with the discount diminishing as more tokens are sold The reality is that most larger token sale events offer substantial discounts to private investors prior to their public pre sale events so while this may appear excessive it is in fact commonplace with the difference here being that CoinMetro has decided to offer these \xe2\x80\x98friends and family\xe2\x80\x99 discounts to the community at large rather than to a small select group of private investors Once 200 million COIN are sold during the Token Sale participants will be granted lifetime discounts on applicable fees tied to services on both CoinMetro and FXPIG\xe2\x80\x99s platforms It is intended that Token Sale participants will be privy to private invitations and exclusive opportunities concerning all future Token Sales offered by any of CoinMetro\xe2\x80\x99s founders as well as special pricing on select Token Sales launched via our ICO Express Platform 5 2 3 Risk Disclaimer For the CoinMetro platform to move forward into the operational stage the Token Sale must reach its minimum sale target of EUR 3 million In the event that the CoinMetro Token Sale fails to reach this minimum COIN purchasers will be provided with the opportunity for a refund on the COIN purchased 27 | Page \x0cIn the event that the CoinMetro Token Sale reaches its goal without selling all available COIN unsold COIN will be permanently eliminated and will not be circulated/sold Token Sale participants should be aware that as with any developing industry there are risks involved (including the failure to build the intended platform) CoinMetro has worked hard to mitigate these risks by partnering with the industry leading blockchain platforms such as Ethereum NEO and NEM globally recognized payment processors such as BitGo The potential for future regulation security vulnerabilities in one of our third party service providers volatility in cryptocurrency markets and other circumstances may present unforeseen challenges that may impact the CoinMetro platform and/or the value of COIN Please refer to our Terms and Conditions for more details concerning official company policies 28 | Page \x0c6 The Team 6 1 Kevin Murcko CEO A Crypto Enthusiast before the term was even a \xe2\x80\x9cthing\xe2\x80\x9d Kevin brought transparency to Forex via his unique FXPIG brand and he continually pushes to close the profit gap between institutional and retail traders FXPIG is not the largest FX broker but that is by design based on his vision It was created to change the industry and it did just that FXPIG brought transparency to the forefront and it started a growing trend of client centric shops that actually focus on their client\xe2\x80\x99s profitability rather than their losses While FXPIG is still very unique in the FX space it is proud to see the change it helped foster as it pushes through the industry Kevin has always been a supporter of in house tech development and FXPIG remains one of the few companies in FX to develop and trade on their own technology This mantra is at the core of the CoinMetro philosophy as well With his sights now set on blockchain Kevin is ready to guide CoinMetro down a similar path one that will eventually change the way this market operates 6 2 Sylvain Legay CFO Our by the book numbers guy a corporate veteran turned startup aficionado Sylvain helped shape FXPIG into the well run FX brokerage company that it is today With a background in corporate finance in one of the most highly regulated industries the pharmaceutical industry he is a stickler for strict internal protocols which is definitely something this industry needs to pay more attention to Under his watch FXPIG was able to streamline its finances and push its revenue to record levels while weeding out unnecessary expenditures Sylvain\xe2\x80\x99s 12 year stint in pharma also showed him the need for compliance and how it plays an important role in a company\xe2\x80\x99s overall wellbeing Jumping from the corporate world to running the books of a niche Forex broker was a bit of a culture shock but Sylvain has proven to be an asset on many levels and we are happy to have him onboard this project 6 3 Ingvar \xc3\x9clpre Head of Legal Ingvar is a seasoned lawyer with several years of
