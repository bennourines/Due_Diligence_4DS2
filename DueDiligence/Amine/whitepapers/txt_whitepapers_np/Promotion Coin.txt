Especially in an era of internet economy featuring information explosion the promotion and exposure of products are the foundation for effective brand promotion and the rise of brand awareness They are as well a must for businesses to make profit Conventional promotion relations cannot match with advanced promotion capacity and profitability of the intermediate link depends on monopoly so users and promoters cannot acquire their due return which considerably contains the development of the macro economy 5 \x0cStatus quo and Problems of Promotion Promotion has become the bottle neck of economic development Complex promotion procedure with low efficiency Tedious reconciliation process and severe data contamination Tradition promotion industry lacks universal norms and is loose in structure and poorly organized Different promotion distributors have different docking cycle and rules and standards There are too many links between agents at different levels These problems have lengthened the promotion cycle and waste of resources The reconciliation and settlement processes in current promotion industry are fairly complex resulting in the fact that the settlement is not finished in time and huge amount of bad debt is caused Data and capital are kept long in stock which contribute to low efficiency of information and fund flow Lack of market analysis ability and dev iation from promotional objectives Low industry transparency res ulting in difficulty in standard management Under the current system there is information isolation Under a diversified economic structure any product has its targeted customers Yet promoters are usually not good at market analysis of product so targeted customers are not met the group with demand is not fully covered and the customer conversion rate falls between manufacturers promoters and users Transparency is lacked in promotion setting up obstacles for supervision and management As a result it can be frequently seen that manufacturers give short of quantity and are in arrears with fees and promoters counterfeit the quantity Effective promotional behaviors are hard to be protected 6 \x0cStatus quo and Problems of
