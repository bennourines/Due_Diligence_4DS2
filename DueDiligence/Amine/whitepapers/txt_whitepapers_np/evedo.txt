\xe2\x80\x8bIts inefficiency\xe2\x80\x8b is due to the\xe2\x80\x8b lack of innovation\xe2\x80\x8b in the event organizing process The coordination discoverability and doing business between the different parties involved \xe2\x80\x8bis very tedious slow & scattered over different platforms software and means of communication\xe2\x80\x8b Event organizers for instance continue to use legacy software like excel to keep track of the event project management Moreover \xe2\x80\x8btrust\xe2\x80\x8b within the industry \xe2\x80\x8bis significantly undermined\xe2\x80\x8b by the l\xe2\x80\x8back of transparency which causes uncertainty regarding the payments \xe2\x80\x8bwhich need to be made by and between the participants therein Often the \xe2\x80\x8blimited access to the required physical and human \xe2\x80\x8bresources and contacts\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bleads to\xe2\x80\x8b the involvement of \xe2\x80\x8bmiddlemen\xe2\x80\x8b that do not add value to the process but incur large referral fees favoritism to suppliers without guarantee\xe2\x80\x8b for the best price\xe2\x80\x93quality ratio and in some cases\xe2\x80\x8b fraud and significant losses\xe2\x80\x8b Here are just a few of the problems that are very real in this industry today and are experienced more often than they need to 1 Higher prices of tickets\xe2\x80\x8b due to secondary black markets 2 Time loss and poor planning\xe2\x80\x8b due to scattered event planning process across different platforms mediums software etc 3 Ticket fraud\xe2\x80\x8b that can be duplicating & selling the same ticket multiple times 4 Delayed payments to performers\xe2\x80\x8b or non fulfilment of obligations on behalf of the latter 5 Lack of one niche software \xe2\x80\x8bto bring the whole organizing process inside 6 Lack of transparency & Protection\xe2\x80\x8b for all parties involved 7 Difficulties finding new venues gigs partners and sponsors/sponsorships 8 Difficulties in finding organizing and tracking technical

advanced world where there will be fewer barriers for projects striving to make everyone\xe2\x80\x99s lives better To make this transformation reality We need to widen the acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the key industries worldwide \xe2\x80\x8bOur mission is to achieve a significant adoption of blockchain technology in the event industry and to have the EVED Tokens as the main means of value exchange therein \xe2\x80\x8bWhile achieving this Evedo will add value to everyone involved by\xe2\x80\x8b introducing tra\xe2\x80\x8b nsparency security automation and access to new opportunities for the participants in this ecosystem\xe2\x80\x8b Our expertise in the fields of software development blockchain & cryptography event planning event marketing and online advertising give Us the confidence in creating an ecosystem that will collide and combine with the existing business models and elevate the way they work The core values of Evedo are \xe2\x80\x8bTRUST CREATIVITY & EMPATHY \xe2\x80\x8bWe firmly believe that these are the key pillars of all high impact projects The potential of the Evedo Project derives from our willingness \xe2\x80\x8bto establish trust\xe2\x80\x8b among the participants \xe2\x80\x8bin the event industry\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x8b ecosystem and \xe2\x80\x8bto\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bcreatively apply the power of blockchain technology\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8btherein while taking into consideration the necessities and\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bthe best interest of each one of them\xe2\x80\x8b Prior to accessing and reading

regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c8 III INDUSTRY PROBLEMS Below are some \xe2\x80\x8bproblems encountered by the event organizer\xe2\x80\x8b over the process of organizing an event A) Booking a Venue (TIME CONSUMING and COST INEFFICIENT) If the event organizer wishes to organize an event in another country he/she needs to find the most reputable venue for this aim Finding the most suitable venue to fulfill the necessities of the specific event that will be available for booking at a particular date requires lots of scattered work The necessary efforts include \xe2\x80\x8b browsing in search engines intense communication \xe2\x80\x8b(calls enquiries by e mail) and \xe2\x80\x8blengthy and expensive bank transfers \xe2\x80\x8bfor the purposes of paying the rental costs and other fees Further there is \xe2\x80\x8ba huge set of term\xe2\x80\x8bs (terms of payment technical requirements and capacity and other limitations) \xe2\x80\x8bset by different venues\xe2\x80\x8b Comparing these terms is a very hard process\xe2\x80\x8b due to the numerous factors that need to be taken into account This makes the process of booking a venue \xe2\x80\x8bunnecessarily time consuming and cost inefficient\xe2\x80\x8b B) Finding Performers Suppliers and Service Providers (lack of access time consuming cost inefficient) Information discovery \xe2\x80\x8bregarding terms of engagement and schedule of the manager or the performer that you aspire to book for the event \xe2\x80\x8bis a very pain stacking process\xe2\x80\x8b In other cases you \xe2\x80\x8bneed to use\xe2\x80\x8b more than one middleman\xe2\x80\x8b to reach the manager/performer \xe2\x80\x8bwho adds the industry standard\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b20% referral fee \xe2\x80\x8b reluctantly or unknowingly paid by the event organizer The \xe2\x80\x8black of guarantees for payments\xe2\x80\x8b and performance makes this process even harder for both sides which leads to \xe2\x80\x8bfewer opportunities for them Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section \xe2\x80\x9cLEGAL INFORMATION\xe2\x80\x9d and find out whether you are eligible to continue accessing the information as well as to educate yourself regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c9 Finding the right suppliers and service providers \xe2\x80\x8bsuch as creative agencies technical rental companies marketing agencies HR companies liquor suppliers catering companies logistic companies etc \xe2\x80\x8brequires time\xe2\x80\x8b middlemen \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8band a lot of internal resources \xe2\x80\x8b(sometimes an unnecessarily large team) to coordinate these complex activities \xe2\x80\x8bFinding the best prices and capacity to meet specific requirements is also \xe2\x80\x8bfrequently \xe2\x80\x9cmission impossible\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x8b Moreover you can \xe2\x80\x8bnever\xe2\x80\x8b be \xe2\x80\x8bsure of the quality\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bof\xe2\x80\x8b the provided \xe2\x80\x8bservices\xe2\x80\x8b unless you are able to get valuable insights regarding the background of the services/product suppliers at hand It is \xe2\x80\x8bhard to coordinate the availability of the supply chain\xe2\x80\x8b before the event happens This is often a reason for making last minute costly changes A large portion of the profit in the industry is made through sponsorship packages which are sold to companies They are either willing to advertise their services or products on the event or just wish to support it by means of donations \xe2\x80\x8bAs an event organizer you need to go through a lengthy online search calls e mails before finding even potential sponsors that might be interested in providing funds for your event \xe2\x80\x8b How about \xe2\x80\x8bearning their trust\xe2\x80\x8b if \xe2\x80\x8bthey don\xe2\x80\x99t know you upfront\xe2\x80\x8b How are they certain of what exactly you are doing and how do you generate value for them How do they know that you are using the provided funds for the purposes that you\xe2\x80\x99ve promised On the other hand are you sure that the sponsor will actually transfer the funds and they are allocated to this aim All this uncertainty\xe2\x80\x8b leads to a lot of \xe2\x80\x8bmissed opportunities and a loss of profits\xe2\x80\x8b Sometimes this is a major cause for failure for event organizing at the early stages C) Ticket Selling and Ticket Fraud During the hectic process of coordinating the preparation and execution of the event the event organizer is also required to plan the marketing and selling of the tickets for the event This sometimes requires more than one platform \xe2\x80\x8bThe fees \xe2\x80\x8bof these platforms \xe2\x80\x8bvary between 2 and 20%\xe2\x80\x8b Moreover these \xe2\x80\x8bplatforms frequently withhold the received money for a very long Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section \xe2\x80\x9cLEGAL INFORMATION\xe2\x80\x9d and find out whether you are eligible to continue accessing the information as well as to educate yourself regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c10 period \xe2\x80\x8bof time following the event On the other side coordinating ticket availability and seat allocation is frequently a difficult task In practice the ticket selling platforms would\xe2\x80\x8b withhold the payments \xe2\x80\x8bto the event organizer until the event is finished As a result an enormous amount of\xe2\x80\x8b liquidity is taken away from the event organizer\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bwho needs to cover all expenses up front\xe2\x80\x8b This is mainly due to the fact that due to the lack of secure and transparent systems showing the exact way of spending the proceeds the ticketing service providers cannot afford to release any funds to the event organizer before the event This is often a reason for the reduced capacity of the event organizer to invest in multiple undertakings and thus to scale the business A very familiar scenario describing the \xe2\x80\x8bticket fraud \xe2\x80\x8bfactor would be the immediate sell out of all the tickets\xe2\x80\x8b following the ticket sale announcement In such cases \xe2\x80\x8bthe majority\xe2\x80\x8b or at least part of these tickets are being bought either by bots or by resellers\xe2\x80\x8b This may harm the event organizer as the higher price of the resold tickets is sometimes a reason for the \xe2\x80\x8breduced number of attendees\xe2\x80\x8b Another issue is the hypothesis in which the event is not conducted In this case the disappointed attendees often need to go to physical offices of the ticket sellers and the refund is chaotic D) No Event Organizing Process Tailored Software The event \xe2\x80\x8borganizers use mainly legacy software \xe2\x80\x8band\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bother workflow organizing tools such as \xe2\x80\x8bTrello\xe2\x80\x8b however these software solutions are neither tailored to the necessities\xe2\x80\x8b of the event industry \xe2\x80\x8bnor are providing any automation\xe2\x80\x8b and thus enhancement of the working process of the event organizer This leads to \xe2\x80\x8bwaste of time and multiple mistakes\xe2\x80\x8b which may result in \xe2\x80\x8bmonetary losses \xe2\x80\x8bas well Therefore automation is urgently needed to enhance and help its growth During the chaos of the event all information regarding its execution is lost and everything clears out only after its finish Often what transpires is not the desired result which is due to the lack of live centralized clear process traction during the event Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to

warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c11 IV EVEDO ECOSYSTEM THE SOLUTION The Events industry is a large market consisting of two essential components the business side involving all companies operating in this field and the consumers\xe2\x80\x99 side \xd0\xa2o maintain security and transparency the whole chain needs to be managed from end to end \xe2\x80\x8bEvedo\xe2\x80\x99s solution is to create two interrelated market places where organizers can bring together diverse businesses and consumers who can explore and purchase tickets services or goods removing the need for middlemen Our goal is to develop a sustainable ecosystem of relevant businesses and people related in the Evedo Platforms \xe2\x80\x8bThe use of Evedo\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain technology will enhance the transparency and freedom of negotiations and by doing so it will create numerous new opportunities and trust between all participants The enhanced direct access to all necessary resources will be a significant time and cost saving factor for the event organizers 1 B2B Marketplace Connect Collaborate with Partners & Create events The Evedo B2B Platform is designated to create the perfect environment for all businesses involved such as Event Organizers Performers Venue Owners Equipment Rentals & Sponsors The event organizer will be provided with all tools which are necessary to \xe2\x97\x8f find directly the right partners contractors and sponsors (compare fees reputation and collect data for previous performance) \xe2\x97\x8f negotiate with them and to utilize smart contracts to automate the payments made from and to the other parties under rules which are agreed by them \xe2\x97\x8f use a single smart contract that defines all payment rules around the event in detail Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section \xe2\x80\x9cLEGAL INFORMATION\xe2\x80\x9d and find out whether you are eligible to continue accessing the information as well as to educate yourself regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c12 \xe2\x97\x8f use the crowdfunding features of smart contracts to lock in the suppliers\xe2\x80\x99 rates & other relevant information to the agreement set a price for the tickets set a minimum number of tickets sold and to distribute the funds in the contract \xe2\x97\x8f follow the execution and performance of partners\xe2\x80\x99 obligations in real time while coordinating its team efforts by means of a single point of workflow entries Marketplace In the marketplace each and every one of the people involved in making an event happen is listed in their respective categories The B2B Platform is designed as an effective search engine where the event organizer can find all resources partners and suppliers by listing the details regarding his planned event The event organizer can browse & filter by multiple criteria such as dates type of event expected number of attendees specific technical equipment requirements logistics hotels staff needed on sight advertising and media coverage A very important part of making the search engine effective is the integration of calendars of everyone involved for the purposes of displaying their availability and calculating it in the process of planning To finetune this search engine we will be closely working with our early adopters and will apply our deep industry knowledge and experience Prior to accessing and reading any information

and social proof for all the partners is the rate & comments functionality It adds an extra incentive to behave and stick or arrangements on top of the smart contracts The users will be rewarded with EVED Tokens for providing insightful information Signing up When the user signs up for the B2B Platform of Evedo he/she needs to select the type of partner that he/she is willing to register as In practice the one user can have more than one role in the ecosystem however the choice of a primary one Once the user fills out the initial few fields to sign up he/she will be prompted with a small \xe2\x80\x9cpersonalization\xe2\x80\x9d feature to tailor the experience of Our platform to user\xe2\x80\x99s needs Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please

\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bEvent organize\xe2\x80\x8br\xe2\x80\x9d role But all the other partners can \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bApply\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d to be part of an event if it\xe2\x80\x99s open for applications The standard event has two key partnersVenues & Performer Once the Venue & Performer/s have agreed to be part of the event you can also invite Sponsors & Rental Companies to participate In this way we are following the natural order of the event organizing business Moreover creating trust widely depends on one\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prove to potential partners and customers that he has the capacity to generate value for them and to deliver on his promise Being able to demonstrate that you have contracts with everyone at the previous step is a crucial condition to persuade the other partners to join in on the next stage The B2B platform will provide full transparency in this process and by making the smart contracts information visible for the prospective partners Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section \xe2\x80\x9cLEGAL INFORMATION\xe2\x80\x9d and find out whether you are eligible to

partners has an integrated calendar functionality which gives them an easy overview of their upcoming jobs or obligations Businesses can use the B2B Platform to access all the resources for their workflow In the event that there are some days when they are not available for booking they can easily block off the time in a scheduling tool which contributes to the automation of the process and the search engine Events in other timezones are highlighted as such for international artists When a logged in user goes to the event section their events will be displayed here divided by

events that are in proposal but are having conflicts Upcoming These are events in post proposal and have now entered in the blockchain Repudiation These are events that are post proposal which have been put onto the blockchain where one of the users has backed out in some way and an investigation needs to occur before releasing the funding Because one of the users has not fulfilled their agreement Past These are events that have been completed Negotiation The negotiation part is crucial for the execution of the smart contract It happens in part automatically because each \xe2\x80\x8bpartner\xe2\x80\x8b sets their default criteria in their profile But it can also be discussed and overwritten by the event organizer This can be done in platform only via chat functionality to ensure the protection of both parties later on If there will be a need for a dispute for instance Merit The event page is a common ground only available to the users involved in the

\xe2\x80\x9ccheck in\xe2\x80\x9d through the platform and their arrival must be supported by multiple other users all users are considered to be peers Other users in the event will have to confirm when a peer user has \xe2\x80\x9cChecked In\xe2\x80\x9d this is part of the repudiation process presumably your attendance at the event is confirmed by your peers confirmations are rewarded with system merit Users will each have a merit system that represents their reputation in the system and is based on their success as a user in the system Filling their profile This basic and introductory set of merit points are served to new users who show promise as healthy active users in their given role of the ecosystem Filling out all the fields setting up their schedule setting rates using their calendar/inventory tools being requested in events and attending events will all promote the user in merit and reputation Participation in Events Successful events will add positive merit where and unsuccessful events will have negative merit based on their proposed value in the event (TODO hard cap/soft cap) Posting an Event It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve anyone to post an event that will likely not be a success because it will reflect on them negatively All events will be reflected on the blockchain so We want to condone only positive experiences through the platform Successful Events Prior

the information as well as to educate yourself regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c18 Merit is given upon successful events based on the attendees (or tickets sold) as well as the ratio between the positive and negative reviews which will be made only by attendees that have bought tickets In this way \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8btrolling\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d is limited and incentive will be provided for the attendees to leave reviews 2 B2C Ticketing Platform Sell & Buy Tickets for any events with 0% Commission The B2C ticketing Platform will solve most of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s problems are related to the buying and selling of tickets The biggest of these issues is the high number of unnecessary middlemen who drive up the prices of the tickets As they are less affordable fewer people choose to attend Since Our B2C platform works on the blockchain using smart contracts to verify and record information a large portion of these middlemen can be made redundant With the ticket issuer in full control of the number and type of tickets sold the money leeching activities of both unwanted ticketing bots and scalpers can be nearly eliminated Both bots and resellers are very active on ticketing platforms of all sorts today we have a solution The primary business model for existing ticketing platforms is to take commissions and cuts from all ticket sales By implementing blockchain technology in to the existing model We are able to connect event organizers directly to the attendees By taking advantage of new verification technology we are cutting both complications and costs This is done by making events both smoother to run with fewer \xe2\x80\x98moving parts\xe2\x80\x99 (people) and passing the related savings to both the organizers and attendees Organizers and attendees are not the only ones to benefit from cost savings venues and related businesses can expect to see increased returns from the greater number of events and attendees due to both higher profit margins and lower entrance costs across the industry Prior to accessing and

as well as to educate yourself regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c19 Unlike existing platforms that take commissions that cut into event\xe2\x80\x99s bottom lines We are basing our business model on revenue streams such as advertising This is what makes it possible for us to to sell tickets with 0% commission on Our cutting edge ticketing platform This makes Us unique in the industry giving Us an excellent opportunity to disrupt business as usual 3 Blockchain At initialization the event\xe2\x80\x99s metrics such as start/end times types of tickets available minimum and maximum numbers of tickets and other boundaries are set Once the event is released online it will appear on our B2C P where attendees can easily manage their tickets from a range of events run by various groups Ticket buyers can even participate in an online community all with little to no cost to themselves or the event partners Evedo does not hold the value of any event in their accounts The event sponsors and/or organizers can put money upfront when they create an event and any revenues from ticket sales merchandise sales or contest/promotional activities are all held securely in a smart contract They are then sent directly to the relevant partners/company upon fulfillment of the relevant obligations or reaching pre agreed milestones A major role in Our application\xe2\x80\x99s value is the transparency provided by the blockchain All partners can see their investments in real time have access to impartial third party deliberation when there is a dispute and can direct payments directly into their digital wallets Larger venues can benefit from access to a complete ledger of their event\xe2\x80\x99s supply chain in real time and year to year Our strategy for implementing the blockchain is to deploy the latest version of the event smart contract This will allow Us to continually refine and update Our smart contracts so that they can be as safe and efficient as possible without relying on a monolith of code Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to

Total SUPPLY 160 000 000 EVED Tokens TOKENS for Crowdsale 56 000 000 EVED Tokens / 35% of the TOTAL SUPPLY All unsold tokens will be burned Decimals \xe2\x80\x8b 18 1 Tokenomics Volatile EVED Token One of the main factors that inspired Us to tokenize the event industry is the opportunity to introduce transparency security and automation into this dynamic commercial field Both processes (event organizing and the sale of tickets) involve numerous transactions and long \xe2\x80\x98lockup periods\xe2\x80\x99 With consideration to the large Prior to accessing and reading any information

yourself regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c21 scale of the industry and the important problems which are solved through the Evedo Project We have created ideal conditions for the wide adoption of the EVED Token and accordingly steady increase in their demand due to the limited supply The following factors and functionalities will affect the intrinsic value of the EVED Tokens \xe2\x97\x8f The Purchase of Tickets Functionality The purchase of tickets through the B2C Platform will be done by means of either automatic conversion of BTC ETH or fiat currencies into EVED or by a direct transaction of EVED Tokens which are stored in user\xe2\x80\x99s cryptographic wallet These conversions will be made available with the integration of a payment gateway provided by a third part Therefore every purchase order will be a \xe2\x80\x98bid to buy\xe2\x80\x9d action on the market with a positive effect on the supply demand ratio The EVED Tokens collected in the process of ticket selling will be locked into smart contracts until the event is done Depending on the event this lockup period may vary from an average between two to six months which has a limiting effect on the supply of EVED Token on the market Our aim is to have more than 5000 small middle and large size event companies as well as individuals creating events on the platform by 2021 Each of them will be organizing in average five to seven events per year and will be strongly incentivized to sell tickets with 0% commission on the B2C Platform In this way significant amounts of EVED Tokens will be constantly held in smart contracts and hence out of circulation This is expected to tremendously drive up the value of the EVED Token because bigger events can have a very long waiting periods before the events are actually finished and the lock up periods are over \xe2\x97\x8f Advertising The Facebook business model proved that the user\xe2\x80\x99s attention is the ultimate currency and when combined with valuable data it can make any platform an efficient advertising tool When it comes to generating attention there is no better industry to be involved in than the event industry Our B2C Platform benefits from the marketing and sales activities Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section \xe2\x80\x9cLEGAL INFORMATION\xe2\x80\x9d and find out whether you are eligible to continue accessing the information as well as to educate yourself regarding the risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c22 of the event organizers they always display the logo and website of the page where tickets are available for purchase in their advertising materials In this regard the B2C Platform will be structured as a social media website where the managers artists event organizers and attendees will be able to set up profiles interact with each other form groups attending a particular type of events have community management tools and sharing their experiences etc All of the above are great prerequisites to have an enormous amount of daily use on the B2C Platform which can be used to gather data and create an invaluable tool for advertising The service providers performers music labels agencies and venues will be able to advertise their services directly to the event organizers in the B2B platform where their focus group of business clients is The EVED Token will be the only means of payment for the advertising services available on the Evedo Platforms \xe2\x97\x8f Subscription Fees As mentioned above the B2B Platform will be a marketplace where the event organizer will be able to find communicate create smart contracts and pay any service provider venue performer goods supplier agency or other professional All of the participants in this B2B ecosystem are incentivized to participate therein The event organizer can find the best prices conduct communication in a very convenient way and have use of a suite of event management tools to save both money and time On the other hand the other participants are willing to find clients and partners sell services market their goods/services by sponsoring events etc As a result a unique value proposition set which is worth paying a monthly/annual subscription fee for is generated for each business in the B2B Platform EVED Token will be again the only means of payment of subscription fees All the tokens received in this way will be used to encourage new users to join the platform \xe2\x97\x8f B2B Payments Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section

the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c23 There are numerous payments involved in the process of creating an event The event organizer needs to pre pay (partially or fully) the venue the food beverages services suppliers staff agencies performers etc Within the B2B Platform the event organizer together with its counterparties will be able to create smart contracts by setting the terms and conditions under which the release of the funds therein will be made to the respective contractor Accordingly We will be able to achieve more security and transparency for both sides which will be aware that the funds are available while still being sure that payment will be made on delivery As some of the amounts involved in B2B transactions are quite significant We will introduce \xd0\xb0 mixed payment method of a stable token and EVED Token As mentioned above the Evedo Platforms will have multiple incentives for direct payment with EVED Tokens for the services supplied therein The businesses will be incentivized to progressively accept payments made in the volatile token An example for such stimulus is the introduction of a ranking system in the B2B and B2C Platforms which is based on acceptance of EVED Tokens Moreover some businesses may elect to \xe2\x80\x98HOLD\xe2\x80\x99 EVED Tokens due to price volatility reasons Another positive aspect of the B2B transactions is that often the EVED Tokens will be held for a long period of time in the smart contracts as a guarantee for the delivery of the goods services or performance EVEDx Stable Token The creation of Our own stable token in the beginning poses the problem of liquidity To counter this we will take advantage of the stable tokens already having higher volume like USDC 2 Token Sales We are having only 2 sales private sale & IEO Whatever tokens are not sold during these two events are going to be burned All of the tokens sold through these two events will effectively be the circulation supply Prior to

DEVELOPMENT STAGES Many recent blockchain projects have failed due to a lack of business acumen and a detailed plan of action Though we are confident in our project as it stands We are actively planning for the future development of the platform to make it even better Here are the key project development stages for Evedo Achievements to Date \xe2\x97\x8f We gathered an incredibly experienced and motivated team with expertise in technology business marketing design and legal \xe2\x97\x8f We created the financial and tokenomics models with our advisors tailoring them to the needs and growth strategy for the project \xe2\x97\x8f We created the perfect advisory board whose members are actively contributing to the development of the project not only with their wide experience but also large networks of contacts worldwide \xe2\x97\x8f Evedo entered into key partnerships that are critical for the blockchain and technical development of the Project \xe2\x97\x8f We got into the Master Ventures acceleration program which helped Us to get the Project to the stage at which it currently is \xe2\x97\x8f We launched the Alpha version of the B2C platform for testing purposes as a starting point for technical development \xe2\x97\x8f Evedo launched an international ambassador program including highly motivated individuals with experience and contact networks within the event industry This will be the core pillar of Our global expansion \xe2\x97\x8f We attracted more than twenty early adopters from the industry (event organizers performers service providers etc ) who are helping Us to tailor the Evedo Platforms to be ideally suitable for their daily business necessities First Stage Finalizing the B2C Platform Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White

risks lack of reliance warranties and the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c26 The first step following the public sale of EVED will be to fully develop the B2C Platform which will be executed with feedback from Our advisors and early adopters Since We already have most of the necessary functionalities in place We will not need to spend much time on this However improving the security of the platform and enhancing it with innovative functionalities will be an ongoing process Business Development Once the core functionalities of the B2C Platform are completed we will begin simultaneous development on the B2B Platform At this point our main goal will be to scale the usage of the B2C Platform by onboarding more and more early adopters and incentivizing them to use the platform through bounties airdrops and key partnerships To this aim Our ambassador program will enhance the popularity of the brand and enable Us to test different markets and grow Our community of supporters All the tokens gathered from transactions will be reinvested into the development of the platform by using them as an incentive to both reward Our existing users and to encourage new ones to join the network One part of these incentives will be the initial amount of EVED tokens available in each new account (most tokens for the first 1 000 users decreasing for the next 5000 etc ) Uses will be able to use this bonus of EVED Tokens to purchase tickets on the B2C Platform only To benefit from this the users will be required to use a \xe2\x80\x9cshare\xe2\x80\x9d button and hence to share their purchase on their social media channels As mentioned above the social media aspect of the B2C Platform is essential for the creation and effective use of the advertising tools It is even more valuable when event organizers can track the reactions of the audience in real time and gain valuable insights To this aim users will be rewarded with tokens for activities related to the event or for tagging #evedo or #event with the event name on social media Such rewards will also be provided for taking surveys or taking part in specific ongoing activities during the event This will

in the ecosystem creating an efficient community driven marketing tool Boosting the B2B Platform Following the development of the community gathered through the B2C Platform and having developed both brand awareness and key partnerships with music labels venues event organizers and diverse brands sponsoring the event industry etc We will launch the B2B Platform on several markets that We have identified together with Our advisors and ambassadors The first users of the B2B Platform will be incentivized with a free lifetime subscription and an initial amount of EVED Tokens to be spent on advertising and other premium features within the platform The business model of the B2B Platform is based on transaction fees Therefore Evedo will introduce a referral program where users receive a referral link with the ability to receive a percentage of all transaction fees incurred on transactions made by the referred users When using the referral link the newly invited users will be granted with additional bonus EVED Tokens Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section \xe2\x80\x9cLEGAL INFORMATION\xe2\x80\x9d and find out

first and foremost since they\xe2\x80\x99re the driver for the entire industry Their problems are the most systemic of all scalping and ticket fraud Accordingly developing the B2C Platform is Our main focus during \xe2\x80\x8bPhase I\xe2\x80\x8b while also developing a sales and marketing platform for the company to build community and rapport with the customers Phase II will include building up the design and development departments as well as sales and marketing initiatives Users can look forward to the launch of the B2C Platform \xe2\x80\x8bBeta w \xe2\x80\x8b hich will have more advanced features for organizers/promoters as well as companies seeking branded marketplaces for ticket sales and community management Partners can look forward to being able to set up their profiles for the B2B Platform \xe2\x80\x8bAlpha \xe2\x80\x8b In order to participate entertainers and venue owners will be able to sign up for free to participate in event opportunities and have access to tools to focus on their craft and less on the logistics This will allow users managing their tickets to look forward to tools to scan and validate tickets in real time at the events in question In \xe2\x80\x8bPhase III\xe2\x80\x8b once we have thoroughly user tested all aspects of our \xe2\x80\x8bB2B and \xe2\x80\x8bB2C platforms we will bridge the two using our event and ticket smart contracts Partners will be able to track their investments in an event and consumers can appreciate 0% commissions and less scalping and ticket fraud Beyond then the team will continue to develop the advertising and subscription models finalize the \xe2\x80\x8bBetas of the Evedo Platforms\xe2\x80\x8b as well as continue to develop stronger safer faster and cheaper smart contracts for use with its

hereby EVED Tokens are utility access cryptographic tokens which will be accepted as means of payment for subscription fees purchase of tickets advertisement fees and other services by Evedo and by the event organizers It does not grant any additional rights such as dividend distribution profit sharing or any other rights which are typical for financial instruments and therefore it may not be qualified as such Moreover any fluctuation of the intrinsic value of the EVED Token may be triggered by future unpredictable events which would be only subject to accidental and uncertain circumstances which are not controlled by Evedo Therefore any speculative incentive to purchase EVED Tokens would be of secondary nature and such purchase is not recommended or advised for Accordingly the EVED Token holders intending to purchase EVED Token with speculative purposes are exposed to numerous risks and no laws and acts that ensure disclosure and represent regulatory scrutiny for investors\xe2\x80\x99 protection are applicable in case that unfavourable circumstances cause the reduction of the price of EVED Token despite Evedo\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to prevent such effect The EVED Tokens are also not a depository receipt in respect of shares nor do they represent bonds or other forms of securitized debt nor a contract that can be physically settled with the delivery of an underlying asset (derivatives) As their acceptance as means of payment will be limited to the Evedo Platforms the EVED Tokens shall not be qualified as assets with any financial nature but rather as contractually stipulated means of value exchange Thus they fall outside of the Prior to accessing and reading any information displayed in this White Paper please refer to the section

the non binding nature of the Evedo White Paper \x0c34 scope of the definition of a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity\xe2\x80\x9d under MiFID II and the corresponding national law of the Republic of Estonia The EVED Tokens do not represent any form of financial instrument under the Markets In Financial Instruments Directive (\xe2\x80\x98MiFID II\xe2\x80\x99) The EVED Tokens cannot be considered to be transferable securities since they do not represent shares or other security equivalent to share that would grant their holders rights to dividends voting rights or profit sharing in Evedo or other legal entity operating within the Evedo Platforms The EVED Tokens are also not a depository receipt in respect of shares nor do they represent bonds or other forms of securitized debt nor a contract that can be physically settled with the delivery of an underlying asset (derivatives) Thus they fall outside the scope of the definition of \xe2\x80\x9csecurity\xe2\x80\x9d under MiFID II and the corresponding national law of the Republic of Estonia Further EVED Tokens do not fall in the category of money market instruments as they do not represent securitised debt that their holder might receive on a maturity date The EVED Tokens are not shares in collective investment undertakings (UCITS or AIF) since the sale of tokens does not possess two of the three criteria that should be present cumulatively (\xe2\x80\x9cgeneral commercial or industrial purpose\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cview to generating a pooled return\xe2\x80\x9d) in order to define a collective investment undertaking Accordingly Evedo does not qualify as an investment firm under MiFID II asset management company or collective investment undertaking under the UCITS Directive neither is the company a manager of alternative investment fund under the AIFM Directive The cryptographic tokens sale itself does not constitute any form of regulated investment activity such as placing dealing in or
