mobile communications food delivery\xe2\x80\x94all this routine actions are transferred to smartphones and now people do not remember that there was the time when these actions were performed in another way Problem of the HoReCa global market Fast developing \xef\xac\x81eld of economics As a result HoReCa (Hotels Restaurants Catering) or the hospitality industry is the most pro\xef\xac\x81table and fast developing \xef\xac\x81eld of modern economics But the HoReCa global market is highly intensive with regard to the key market parameters capital management marketing and personnel which greatly increases the level of competition and impedes appearing of new market players 3 \x0cNeeds and Trends of the Market Today automation of interaction with the customer is the most popular and preferred solution towards which the whole market is moving However purchasing of expensive terminals and spending millions of rubles on software development is just about copying of the functionality of competitors The market feels the need of a shared cloud platform which could provide an access to orders without involving a waiter or a cashier and would not require installation of expensive terminals and development of software but use smartphones of guests of catering facilities instead Global Needs User Needs Today\xe2\x80\x99s users have already used to make their choice via a uniform platform it is very handy when you can \xef\xac\x81nd all facilities matching the required criteria at once read reviews and see ratings Instead of many applications for di\xef\xac\x80erent restaurants each of us would prefer to have one application with a uniform interface that would not require from us to sort it out over again Customers became more wellminded more often they are interested in discounts and special o\xef\xac\x80ers Their expectations have also changed requirements to dishes quality and speed of service grew up Various bank cash backs loyalty

common cash back And these points could be spent in any catering facility instead of a certain one What if it were possible to learn about promotions in restaurants within a uniform ecosystem What if users were getting push noti\xef\xac\x81cations on promotions in their favorite restaurants without downloading an application for each of them 5 \x0cDelizia Application Delizia is intended to address
