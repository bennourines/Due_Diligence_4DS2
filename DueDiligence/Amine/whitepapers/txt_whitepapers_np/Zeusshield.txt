important tool for transferring risks By nature it is a form of mutual assistance between different groups People transfer the risks that they cannot or do not want to bear to the insurer collectively and thus pay a small but regular amount in exchange for enormous economic guarantees In this way risks are transferred in the form of insurance Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology It is accessible to the public inalterable and unforgeable and therefore has the potential to help humankind turn the concept of an\xe2\x80\x9cInternet of value\xe2\x80\x9d into a reality Blockchain is a fundamental technology for our species\xe2\x80\x99 next phase of development and will affect all walks of life with its simple but perfect technical design Considering their compatibility in many aspects blockchain technology and insurance could be highly complementary to oneanother Blockchain insurance a new insurance model is developing rapidly and will become an important part of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s makeup revolutionizing the traditional industry 2 Insurance markets Table 1 Global Growth in CAGR of Premiums by Region As living standards rise demand for insurance is ever increasing This model of mutual assistancethat distributes risks through financial means has become widely accepted and is now consideredan essentialpart of daily life Life insurance vehicle insurance cargoinsurance and various other insurance products have penetrated society and become strong guaranteesof a happy life Meanwhile the insurance industriesofmajor countries of the world have achieved revenuesexceeding one thousand trillion dollars Even in the economic downturn the insurance industry registered an uptrend and became a major driving force for the global economy The abovechartis Munich Re\ s forecast for the mean annual composite growth rate of insurance premiums in the world\xe2\x80\x99s various emerging economies 4 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain 3 Industrial weaknesses Although the insurance industry is still an emerging industry in a global sense more and more weaknesses have been identified within it as society develops rapidly andapplication technologiesare continually upgraded and replaced An analysis of the insurance industry shows that the main problems facedby the industry today include 3 1 Multiple layers of agents increasesintermediary costs The traditional insurance industry relies too much on agents undermining customer interests The Internet blockchain industry can reduce intermediary steps minimize premiumsand enhancethe user experience 3 2 Malicious fraud Utmost goodfaith is a fundamental principle of insurance which all contract parties are required to abide by In practice however utmost good faith cannot be objectively evaluated ratherit is established on a trust system Insurance companies for example may conceal their contract terms out of self interest while applicantsmay cover up their actual situations in order to gain lower premiums Moreover the law of large numbers determines that insurance operations must realize data sharing across a broader scope As insurance companies pursue enormous interests however information asymmetry between firms easily occurs Intentional concealment or uncooperative attitudes increasemoral hazards in society particularly the probability of insurance fraud 3 3 Serious lack of diversity in insurance products Many insurance products available on the market have very poor specificity and applicability and the insurance clauses are not compiled stringently enough thus hardly satisfying the needs of applicants Thislack of product diversity has also increased market competition prevented effective distribution of social resources and even resulted in the massive waste of resources 3 4 Moral hazards Moral hazards have always been a big headache to insurers For instance a car owner may drive less carefully after taking out vehicle insurance therefore the insurer has to pay out morein indemnities and the car owner suffers losses too\xe2\x80\x94this is a scenario where no party benefits 3 5 Regional restrictions In view of the differences between the insurance industry supervisory systemsofdifferent countries the freedom to procure insurance products across national borders is significantly restricted 4 Solution In recent years points of correspondence between new technologies and the insurance industry have emerged We hope therefore to restructure the insurance industry on the basis of blockchain and AI technology and establish a new insurance ecosystem We can summarize this restructuring in the following steps 5 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain 4 1 Digital identity + smart contracts We will provide a technical solution usingblockchain to all insurance companies and upload the insurance business data to the chain We can use the authenticity and inalterability of information on the blockchain to address the problem of self identification The digital identity established on the blockchain can\ t be altered removed edited or forged Such digital identitiesinclude but are not limited to those of natural persons and may be expanded to covervehicles airplanes and other physical objects thus providingall physical entities that require them withcredible digital identities Meanwhile the Zeus Shield system also allows for smart codedinsurance contracts and more convenient insurance plans Combining smart contracts withdata management in fields like vehicles traffic accidents electronic medical records and personal informationto provide revolutionary indemnification services An example is combining smart contracts and flight data management to provide a new kind offlight delay insurance\xe2\x80\x94there is infinite room for growth in this area Such a blockchain solution can substantially save operating costs for insurance companies eliminate unnecessary intermediary steps and enhance the insurance experience 4 2 Artificial intelligence module Insurance industry data used to be complicated and the ability to integrate it was not available As a result the potential value of such massive data was wasted With the continual deepening of research in the AI sector people are gradually coming to realize the potential value of such enormous data resources In the Zeus Shield system we will design the AI module and analyse the information in databases to help insurers increase their performance\xe2\x80\x93price ratiosand provide the insured with smart insurance packages and a stable secure and trustworthy claimsprocedure Coupled with AI technology the Zeus Shield system will have the following advantages 4 2 1 Individualized policy and pricing In traditional actuarial research the target of research is general statistics with individual cases seldom studied All policyholders are deemed to have the same level of risk which is not strictly reasonable Due to technical reasons point to point insurance models cannot be realized With an additional AI module the Zeus Shield system offers an accurate risk control plan and a pricing model and customizes insurance policies for different customers For instance the car owner with a history of drunk driving will have a higher risk factor while the car owner without previous traffic violations will have a lower risk factor for traffic accident insurance 4 2 2 Targeted marketing More accurate marketing is possible through the analysis of information in databases For instance refund insurance can be recommended to users with sensitive skin 4 2 3 Development of new insurance products 6 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain With the popularization of the Internet people are facing more diversified risks and their demands for insurance tend to be characterized by low insurancevalues high frequency and fragmentation AI technology can assist in the design of various insurance products provide users with rich insurance packages and enhance user experience 4 2 4 Smart claimhandling and verification AI modules offer great assistance at the stage of claim handling and verification Taking the insurance platform of Ant Financial Services as an example\xe2\x80\x94image identification technology is one of the key applications of claim verification At the claims stageof consumer insurance over 90% of the identification and judgment work is completed by backend technology 4 3 P2P insurance market As the plan moves forward we will establish a P2P insurance platform that combines AI technology In the future this platform will serve the insurer and the insuredsimultaneously It will take the system\xe2\x80\x99s originalZSCas a medium to establish a diversified and highly individualized insurance ecosystem The ZSC system can be defined as a decentralized insurance agency platform We can provide insurers with new insurance concepts and insurance solutions on the chain We can optimize the modes of execution of traditional insurers reduce their operating costs prevent losses from fraud and increase user bases Meanwhile we will also serve policyholders satisfying their needs for risk transfer and providing individualized insurance package solutions Policyholderswill be able tochoose any insurance product on the platform through the system terminal Moreover the AI based platform willalso be able to offer new insurance concepts to insurance suppliers As a platform we witness the contract process between the insurer and the insured and levy necessary handling charges and commissions As the method of payment ZSC will be partially used to construct the bottommost insurance and reinsurance capital pools and provide the services to traditional insurers making more in service fees thus generating a beneficial cycle AppStore or Taobao can be referred to regarding the main operating modelfor the platform See 6 4 2 for a detailed description of the capital pool module 4 4 Summary According to relevant research statistics FinTech had an applicationindex of 33% in 2017 which shows that financial technology has moved from the early adopters phase in 2015 towards the early majority phase (Rogers Adoption/InnovationCurve classification) FinTech companies are continuallyraising theirstatus on the market and can already influence industrial standards and consumer expectations With the continuous updating of technologies FinTech will thoroughly revolutionize the traditional financial industry and become an indispensable part of our daily lives 7 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain As FinTech\xe2\x80\x99s two coretechnologies blockchain and AI have attracted an enormous amount of interest across the world In the 27th European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC) in Finland on June 12 2017 Mr Pekka Soini head of the National Technical Innovation Bureau of Finland emphasized the importance of blockchain technology and AI and included them in the four core technologies of the next 10 to 20 years As an important branch of the financial industryand due to its unique features the insurance industry is naturally compatible withblockchain and AI technology In the future the AI based blockchain insurance models will address the weaknesses of the insurance industry and bring peoplea new insurance experience Such an insurance model is fully based on an information society and will provide distributed contextualized and digitalized new insurance services 5 Why Ethereum 5 1 Ethereum Ethereum was initiated by whiz kid Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and 2014 with the aim of developinga next generation encrypted currency and decentralized application platform which started development in 2014 The whole Ethereum system is realized by open source code and its core is the public blockchain platform based on Ether the special encrypted currency On this platform Ethereum provides a decentralized Ethereum virtual machine to make it convenient for third party developers to realize Ethereum based smart contracts An Ethereum virtual machine allows thirdparty developers to easily and conveniently reuse the blockchain core system as defined by the Ethereum and focus their R&D work on the application of blockchain For that reason more and more individuals teams and companies are favouring Ethereum based R&D and the use of distributed applications This is leading to diversification of the Ethereum ecosystemand the creation of diversified applications When comparing it to otherblockchain technologies the Ethereum platform has the following main features Smart contracts the contract programs developed by third party developers can be stored at a node on the Ethereumblockchain and run at that node For the purpose of operation the program operator needs to pay commissions to the miners or stakeholders of the node where the program is located Uncle blocks it incorporates the short blockchains that have not been included on the mother chaindue to relatively slow mining speeds Directed acyclic graph (DAG) related technology is adopted Proof of stake it is an improvement on the current POW (proof of work)based mining algorithm and can save considerable computer resources needed for mining and avoid the network centralization arising from integrated circuits for special applications 8 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain 5 2 Smart contracts If blockchain is the core technology that Ethereum uses for data processing the smart contract system is the core technology that Ethereum uses for the processing of various applications The crucialthing supporting the smart contract system is the Ethereum virtual machine It provides a set of Turing complete programming languages that are similar to the assembly language that can execute the code of any complicated algorithm for the bridging of data processing and application processing As it is very painful for a developer to directly use this set of Turing complete languages for programming Ethereum provides one senior language Solidity which is similar to C/C++ Today Microsoft\ s main software product\xe2\x80\x94Microsoft Visual Studio\xe2\x80\x94has started to offer the Solidity programming language to program developers Based on the Ethereum virtual machine and Solidity programming language a third party developer can develop an Ethereum smart contract Put simply each contract is a distributed application based on the Ethereum blockchain system When a developer launches a contract on the Etherum platform this contract is like an application agent living in the Ethereum platform It has its Ether address for Ether transactions data exchangesbetween the founder and other users and execution ofapplication with complex logic for example establishing one Ethereum based token system and one decentralized autonomous group To allow an equivalent value system to be more effectively and conveniently reflected in an application based on Ethereum platform the Ethereum smart contract system is designed according to the following principles Simplicity as the data processing part of the blockchain is already packaged at the bottom layer of the Ethereum platform an ordinary programmer can perfectly develop a simple smart contract and create a distributed application with complex logic This will finally help to lower the technical threshold for blockchain based development and promote the process of opening up Ehtereum to all users Generality based on the Ethereum virtual machine a developer and even an ordinary Ethereum user can establish any smart contract or transaction type that can be accurately defined Modularity the system makeup of Ethereum is designed to be as modular and divisible as possible The benefits of this design areit can be continuously improved based on the internal functionality of Etherum and its performance can also be improved Meanwhile the whole system is stable scalable and secure and allows for the continuous proper operation of smart contractsbased on the Ethereum virtual machine without making any changes Non discriminatory the Ethereum platform does not voluntarily restrict or block smart contracts of any given type it does not attempt to object to the unwanted application of a specific type The cost of running the application is the payment for the corresponding trading expenses according to the program\ s calculation steps 9 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain 6 Zeus Shield System 6 1 System framework According to the above mentioned weaknesses and development bottlenecks of the insurance industry and relying on the advantages of blockchain technology we have designed a smart insurance management system based on the Ethereum platform\xe2\x80\x94the Zeus Shield System As Figure 1 shows the Zeus Shield System primarily comprises four parts\xe2\x80\x94Zeus Shield Coins (ZSC) of the Ethereum ERC 20 protocol a database management subsystem a module management subsystem and a webpage and smartphone based Zeus Shield client Figure 1 Zeus Shield System (a smart insurance management system based on the Ethereum platform) 6 2 Zeus Shield Coins Zeus Shield Coin (ZSC) is a token developed on the basis of the Ethereum ERC20 protocol which allows ZSC to be conveniently launched onto a key global digital currency exchange platform ZSC is used to establish an insurance capital pool and a reinsurance capital pool in order to improve cash flows frominsurance contracts This service can be provided to insurersas required As this project progresses the insurance ecosystemwill gradually improve As the original token of the system ZSC will offer more and more functions 6 3 Database management subsystem In order to increase the efficiency of data processing based on the Zeus Shield System all textbasedinformationwill be stored primarilyon the Ethereum platform Image and video files will be encrypted and safely stored on a service independent from the Ethereum platform 10 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain Figure 2 Zeus Shield Database As Figure 2 shows the database on the Ethereum platform has four main parts\xe2\x80\x94the insurance receiving units database the insurance supplying units database the insurance contracts database and the self defined insurance products database As the bottom layer of the Ethereum platform is based on distributedblockchains the confidentiality security and inalterability of relevant data in the four parts can be very effectively guaranteed 6 3 1 Insurance receiving units and insurance supplying units databases Insurance receiving units and insurance supplying units are two key user types of the Zeus Shield system As the name indicates the insurance receiving unit is the physical entity that receives insurance services A specific insurance receiving unit may be an individual family company or community After the Zeus Shield system is launched online we will be able to establish more types of insurance receiving units according to actual business demands Correspondingly the insurance supplying units refers to the physical entities that supply insurance services On the basis of the equivalent value system of the blockchain and in contrast to traditional insurance systems the Zeus Shield system provides an open platform that allows different types of insurance supply units to provide their insurance services For instance an insurance supply unit may be an insurance company a team comprising multiple individuals or combinations of individuals and insurance companies 6 3 2 Insurance contracts database The insurance contracts database stores the corresponding insurance contracts or agreements signed between different insurance receiving units and insurance supplying units Each insurance contract defines the corresponding insurance premium transaction mode and indemnification mode Thanks to the security and inalterability of the Ethereum blockchain the Zeus Shield system can prevent insurance receiving units being affected by timing geological or human factors when the claimconditions are satisfied and enable them to receive insurance payouts 11 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain quickly and conveniently 6 3 3 Self defined insurance product database The insurance services needed by insurance receiving units and insurance supplying units are stored in the self defined insurance products database The type and model of insurance can be proposed by the insurance receiving unit according to actual demand or provided by the insurance supplying unit according to its market analysis Once these services are defined the Zeus Shield system will provide them to its users The user may then sign the corresponding insurance service contract via the Zeus Shield system The executed insurance service contract will be included in the insurance contracts database 6 4 Module management subsystem The Zeus Shield system provides different modules for smart database management and smart support for insurance services wherein the three main modules are an AI module a capital pool module and a client interface module 6 4 1 AI module The AI module delivers two main features\xe2\x80\x94big data analysis and increased analysis efficiency through parallel computing 1 Big data analysis Big data analysis as a feature of the AI module offers multiple smart features to Zeus Shield system users\xe2\x80\x94for example customizationof special insurance services insurance package recommendations smart selection of insurance products insurance product risk analysisand image identification during indemnification Big data analysis is adopted primarily because the Zeus Shield system provides one set of open features for self defining insurance products so that insurance products can be developed in a more extensive flexible scalable and market oriented manner However an ordinary insurance service developer (insurance receiving or insurance supplying unit) faces a very important problem\xe2\x80\x94how to establish a complete and accurate business model including insurance premiums insurance indemnification conditions and amounts to be indemnified Meanwhile the insurance receiving unit faces a further important issue\xe2\x80\x94how to find an insurance product that suits its actual needs from a multitude of insurance products while guaranteeing its highest performance\xe2\x80\x93 price ratio 2 Parallel computing Big data analysis is primarily conducted via deep learning in the Zeus Shield system sinceblockchain systemsbased on distributed network architecture have the capacity for natural parallel data processing anda hot topic of research in the field of deep learning today is machine learning and parallel computing The main purpose of machine learning is traininga neural network (e g convolutional computing) viacaptured data to establish a data module and thus help the system to effectively forecast the 12 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain corresponding feedback after the capture of new data\xe2\x80\x94for instance in the service customization recommendation and service selection and recommendation mentioned above (see the annex for detailed descriptions of deep learning) To increase the validity of the forecast however it is necessary to use large amounts of data and repeated data learning and training If a single threaded mode is adopted as the training mode considerable resources (e g CPU GPU memory and time) will betaken up thus introducing a mode that requires parallel computing As the blockchain and smart contract system of Ethereum are based on a distributed architecture with multiple nodes it helps to distribute the learning data and learning procedures to different Ethereum nodes for parallel data learning 6 4 2 Capital pool module The Zeus Shield system will record and analyse each insurance business and the ZSC capital circulation Relevant analytical results will help the insurance supplying unit to make a detailed and accurate calculation of incomefrom thepremiumsof its insurance products According to the actuarial results the Zeus Shield system will support two different insurance and reinsurance capital pools\xe2\x80\x94unit level capital pools and system level capital pools A unit level capital pool needs to be supplied and maintained by each insurance supplying unit The insurance supplying unit may gatherincome from premiums into a capital pool and adjust its insurance services on a real time basis according to the income from premiums calculation In this way the capital pool can continuously ensure income from premiums is higher than the costs of indemnity payments In this way the insurance supplying unit can maintain a stable capital pool with capital surplus and stable growth The capital surplus will be partially used to cover indemnity expenses with the remaining part used for other insurance operations to generate more income The Zeus Shield system will establish a system level insurance and reinsurance capital pool which primarily works to support insurance supplying unitsin the reasonable handling ofrare cases when the capital pool is not enough to covercosts of indemnity payments thus protecting the legal rights and interests of insurance receiving units 6 4 3 Interface module The interface module contains the client interface and the Ethereum external data interface wherein the client interface enables the system user to conveniently rapidly and securely use the Zeus Shield system via its client The Ethereum external data interface primarily works to allow the system to communicate with the external data server 6 5 Zeus Shield client The Zeus Shield client is an application for exchange and communication between the system and its users We will develop a webpage and smartphone based client for our users Meanwhile we will also provide an open applicationprogramming interface (API) for the convenience of thirdparty developers 13 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain 6 6 Zeus Shield system\ s operating logic Put simply Zeus Shield system is an insurance based P2P market platform See Figure 3 for the Zeus Shield system\xe2\x80\x99s operating logic regarding specific insurance supplying units and insurance receiving units Figure 3 Zeus Shield System\xe2\x80\x99s Operating Logic For insurance supplying units it is first necessary to apply to Zeus Shield Blockchain Technology Development Co Ltd for a space in the system Applications will be examined and approved on the basis of multiple factors\xe2\x80\x94such as the supplying unit\xe2\x80\x99s capital support and reputation Once approved the insurance supplying unit needs to transfer a certain amount of capital into the blockchain based digital currency system to establish the supply level capital pool The inbound capital may be in Ether or ZSC Thereafter the insurance supplying unit may produce and display different insurance products through the Zeus Shield system and potential insurance receiving units can choose from them When an insurance product is selected the insurance receiving unit needs to sign an insurance contract with the corresponding insurance supplying unit and pay relevant expenses in a digital currency either ETH or ZSC The payment comprises three parts the first part is paid to the insurance supply unit the second part is the service charge paid to Zeus Shield Blockchain Technology Development Co Ltd at a certain ratio the third part is the transaction fee which shall be paid in ZSC only The used ZSC will be recycled by the system to establish a system level capital pool Moreover if the insurance supplying unit needs to use the system level capital pool it has to pay certain service charges to Zeus Shield Blockchain Technology Development Co Ltd 14 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain 7 The Zeus Shield

parallel computing The main purpose of machine learning is to establish a data module that helps the system to effectively forecast corresponding feedbacks after capture of new data bytrainingneural networks using already captured data\xe2\x80\x94for example in applications such as the customized service recommendations and service selection recommendations mentioned above However to increase the validity of forecasts it is necessary to use large amounts of data and repeated data learning and training If a single thread mode is adopted as the training mode considerable resources (e g CPU GPU memory and time) are taken up thus introducing a mode that requires parallel computing As the Ethereum blockchain and smart contract systemare based on a distributed architecture with multiple nodes it helps to distribute the learning data and learning procedures to different Ethereum nodes for parallel data learning Figure 5 Forecasting Image Content via Deep Learning Big data analysis based on deep learning primarily includes modelling and prediction (also known as\xe2\x80\x9cinterface\xe2\x80\x9d) Modelling refers tolearning from existing data to find outabout its specific data mode and thus establish a modelfor forecasting new data In practice the most appropriate model is adopted on the basis of various models acquired in order to analyse the newly acquired data and forecast its unique data mode as Figure 5 shows 20 \x0cZEUS SHIELD Blockchain Figure6 Nerve Net and Impacts of Weight of Neuron As Figure 6 shows the basic principle of modelling is to repeatedly train the system through various different algorithms of the neural network in order to accurately calculate the impact or weight of each neuron on the next neuron from the input layer to the output layer in the neural network The primary neural network algorithms include deep neural networks (DNN) deep beliefnetworks (DBN) convolutional neuron networks (CNN) and convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN) Different neural network algorithms give rise to different problems primarily involving accuracy and time of computing Now we will take DNN as an example to introduce how deep learning goes on DNN networks are based on the principle of a discriminative model A backpropagation algorithm is adopted for learning and training and the most important part is updating the weight of each neuron in the following formula According to Figure 6 and the formula above we know that wij (k t) represents the impact of neuron i in layer k of the neural network on neuron j in layer k+1 of the neural network wherein \xce\xb7 is the learning rate and C is the cost function The selection of cost function is related to the type of learning (e g supervised learning non supervised learning and enhanced learning) and the activation function On the basis of this function AI modules can perform repeated learning according to the input data and finally calculate an accurate weight 21 \x0cZEUS SHIELD
