\xe2\x80\xa2 DFS PREDICION SLOTS \x0c\x0cpage number SECURITY FEATURES 21 SECURITY BACKGROUND A common feature of blockchain type systems in particular is the use of secure client side hardware to hold private keys and perform signing operations with them Combined with a zero tolerance approach to transaction rollbacks this is one of the ways they reduce overheads by attempting to ensure that transaction authorization is robust and secure and thus that signatures are reliable One of the defining features of blockchain technology its use of secure client side hardware to hold user\xe2\x80\x99s private keys This means only users with the private key can gain access to token\xe2\x80\x99s within a wallet making transaction rollback impossible and irreversible Blockchain Security Benefits \xe2\x80\xa2 Assets are protected from central node hacks as long as users secure their own private keys \xe2\x80\xa2 Single point failure resistance due to decentralized nature of the network \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction transparency \xe2\x80\x93 signatures prove which devices were used to sign off on an action There can\xe2\x80\x99t be any back doors or administrator tools which can create transactions on behalf of someone else \xe2\x80\xa2 Devices that integrate fingerprint readers and other biometric authentication could further increase trust by making it harder for employees to share/swap devices A smartphone or tablet could be also used as a transaction authenticator ABOUT ERC 20 TOKEN Ethereum the popular cryptocurrency and blockchain system is based on the use of tokens which can be bought sold or traded There are several different tokens which may be used in conjunction with Ethereum and these differ from ether which is the currency native to the Ethereum blockchain Tokens in this case represent digital assets that can have a variety of values attached They can represent assets as diverse as vouchers IOUs or even objects in the \x0creal world In this way tokens are essentially smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum blockchain One of the most significant token standards of all for Ethereum is called ERC 20 which was developed about a

Ethereum tokens to follow meaning that this par cular token empowers developers of all types to accurately predict how new tokens will func on within the larger Ethereum system The impact that ERC 20 therefore has on developers is massive as projects do not need to be redone each me a new token is released Rather they are designed to be compa ble with new tokens provided those tokens adhere to the rules Developers of new tokens have by and large observed the ERC 20 rules meaning that most of the tokens released through Ethereum ini al coin o\xef\xac\x80erings are ERC 20 compliant ERC 20 Speci\xef\xac\x81es Six Func ons ERC 20 de\xef\xac\x81nes six di\xef\xac\x80erent func ons for the bene\xef\xac\x81t of other tokens within the Ethereum system These are generally basic func onality issues including how tokens are transferred and how users can access data about a token ERC 20 also prescribes two di\xef\xac\x80erent signals that each token takes on and which other tokens are aQuned to Put together this set of func ons and signals ensures that Ethereum tokens of di\xef\xac\x80erent types will typically work the same in any place within the Ethereum system This means that almost all of the wallets which support the ether currency also support ERC 20 compliant tokens \x0cCon\xef\xac\x81guring the network The network(distributed network) is made up of nodes running ERC 20 tokens There are several networks in blockchain technology Centralized Network Decentralized Network Distributed Network This network consist of the following components a Nodes communicating using AMQP1 0(Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) over TLS(Transport Layer Security) Nodes use a relational database for data storage b A permissioning service that automates the process of provisioning TLS certificates c One or more notary services A notary may itself be distributed over multiple nodes ERC 20 token system have the applica on ranging from sub currencies represen ng assets such as USD or
