to ensure anyone can prove their veracity Surprisingly there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a universal equivalent for safeguarding digital data Much of the world\xe2\x80\x99s important information is stored digitally and is susceptible to modification by system administrators or hackers When data is sent over the Internet the recipient often can\xe2\x80\x99t verify when the data was created or if it has been modified from its original state Problems with data integrity and digital record keeping are particularly severe in regulated industries such as healthcare insurance and financial services where data corruption or tampering has significant legal and reputational consequences Tierion is building a universal platform for data verification Tierion works by creating a proof that links data to a transaction on a blockchain This is called anchoring Anyone with this proof can verify the data\xe2\x80\x99s integrity and timestamp without relying on a trusted authority Tierion launched in 2015 and has become the most widely used platform for anchoring data to the blockchain Tierion\xe2\x80\x99s key innovation was making it simple to anchor a virtually unlimited amount of data to a single blockchain transaction Tierion\xe2\x80\x99s launch also marked the introduction of the Chainpoint protocol the first standard proof format for anchoring data to a blockchain Several open source projects and multiple vendors have adopted the Chainpoint protocol In July 2016 Chainpoint 2 0\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b was published It featured several improvements including the use of JSON LD\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b and anchoring into multiple blockchains Tierion formed the Chainpoint W3C Community in September 2016\xe2\x80\x8b3\xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint is the first technology of its kind to receive public support from a major Internet standards organization\xe2\x80\x8b4\xe2\x80\x8b To continue our mission to secure the world\xe2\x80\x99s data we\xe2\x80\x99re launching the Tierion Network Chainpoint has been upgraded to version 3 0 and now runs as a service on the Tierion Network Together they provide a universal platform for data verification that operates at massive scale Microsoft is joining Tierion in running a core part of the network infrastructure Anyone can join the Tierion Network by running a node Each node improves the network\xe2\x80\x99s scalability and reliability Along with this new distributed architecture a token is being introduced The Tierion Network Token (TNT) provides an economic incentive to secure the network infrastructure and serves as a method of settlement between parties to access network resources Each Node serves as a mini Tierion Node operators can provide users with services using conventional payment and delivery models

Proof of Existence\xe2\x80\x8b6\xe2\x80\x8b in 2012 This system and others like it publish a hash of a document in a Bitcoin transaction Hashes allow computers to compare arbitrarily complex data and determine if they are identical By comparing the hash of a document with the hash published in the blockchain it is possible to prove the document existed before the timestamp of the block containing that Bitcoin transaction Why use Bitcoin Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s security model is enforced by the entire network instead of a trusted central authority Once a transaction is confirmed it becomes part of an immutable ledger that is distributed across a global network of nodes It is practically impossible for a malicious agent to alter data on the blockchain Shortcomings These early systems had several shortcomings and never achieved significant commercial adoption 1) Not Scalable\xe2\x80\x8b One document hash was published per Bitcoin transaction Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s current network throughput is approximately three transactions per second\xe2\x80\x8b7\xe2\x80\x8b This is far too low to support the world\xe2\x80\x99s applications 2) Cost\xe2\x80\x8b In June 2015 the cost of anchoring data into Bitcoin was approximately $0 03 USD In June of 2017 that cost has increased over 100x to $3 40 USD 3) Inaccurate\xe2\x80\x8b Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s block time accuracy is \xc2\xb1 2 hours\xe2\x80\x8b8\xe2\x80\x8b This means the timestamp of the block could be an hour before a transaction was published Time travel violates the laws of physics These limitations made it impractical and cost prohibitive to anchor large volumes of data in the Bitcoin blockchain Tierion overcame these obstacles and made it simple to link a virtually unlimited amount of data to a single transaction on the blockchain For the first time developers had an easy to use and affordable service for anchoring data at scale Chainpoint provided a standard proof format and open source tools for the creation and verification of Chainpoint proofs \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 4 \x0cUse Cases Since launching in June 2015 Tierion has been used by many organizations in a wide variety of industries Several open source projects have adopted the Chainpoint protocol Here are some examples that demonstrate how the technology is being used Microsoft\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bAttestations &

integrity of data for clinical trials For each industry specific use case Tierion delivers three core capabilities Trust anchor In cryptographic systems a trust anchor\xe2\x80\x8b10\xe2\x80\x8b is an authoritative entity for which trust is assumed and not derived The Bitcoin blockchain is particularly well suited to serve as a trust anchor No authority controls the Bitcoin blockchain Once a transaction is confirmed it becomes part of an immutable ledger that is distributed across a global network of nodes Erasing or modifying this data is virtually impossible Tierion provides a scalable means to use multiple blockchains as a trust anchor Data integrity Data Integrity is the assurance of the accuracy and consistency of data Organizations with sensitive data need to prove it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been corrupted or manipulated by insider threats or external hackers Tierion provides a global mechanism for verifying data integrity Timestamp Public blockchains make poor timestamp authorities because of their low time accuracy For example Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s block time accuracy is approximately \xc2\xb12 hours Trusted timestamps are accurate but require you to trust the time provided by an authority Anchors to a public blockchain provide a low accuracy but trustless timestamp Chainpoint solves this dilemma by including multiple trusted timestamps and multiple trust anchors in each proof This allows Chainpoint proofs to simultaneously possess accurate and trustless time attestations \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 6 \x0cTierion Network Developers

nearly two year track record and has been used by thousands of organizations The application will continue to operate Current customers will be able to migrate to a new version of Tierion The Tierion Network and Chainpoint Service has been operating in private beta with our partners An open beta is planned to launch in August which marks the two year anniversary of Tierion\xe2\x80\x99s launch Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure is planned to come online shortly thereafter The Tierion Network is planned to launch before the end of 2017 \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 8 \x0cChainpoint Service The Chainpoint Service is a global utility for creating and verifying Chainpoint proofs that runs on the Tierion Network This section of the white paper provides a detailed technical overview of Chainpoint 3 0 It is organized into four sub sections Benefits\xe2\x80\x8b benefits of the new Chainpoint 3 0 service Chainpoint Proofs\xe2\x80\x8b an overview of the elements of

Benefits Chainpoint\xe2\x80\x99s new distributed architecture provides several significant advantages 1) Scalability\xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint uses a highly scalable architecture that is designed to generate millions of proofs per second 2) Accuracy \xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint includes time data from Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with anchors to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains allowing Chainpoint proofs to simultaneously possess accurate and trustless time attestations 3) Responsive\xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint responds immediately when a hash is submitted Proofs are automatically upgraded as they are anchored to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains 4) Trust\xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint periodically anchors into the decentralized Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains This allows the Chainpoint proofs to inherit the security properties of multiple blockchains 5) Cost Effectiveness \xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint\xe2\x80\x99s scalability makes it cost effective for the world to anchor data to a secure public blockchain This is particularly relevant as Bitcoin transaction fees have increased more than 100x in the past two years and are likely to continue to rise 6) Global Calendar \xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint servers work in consensus to generate a global publicly auditable blockchain called the Chainpoint Calendar This makes it easier to verify Chainpoint proofs and audit the network \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 9 \x0cChainpoint Proofs Each Chainpoint proof contains a set of operations that cryptographically link a hash to multiple blockchains These links are called anchors Chainpoint proofs are verified by replaying the operations and checking each anchor for an expected value The new proof format has the flexibility to support the inclusion of external data multiple hash types and branches Chainpoint proofs can be verified with any Chainpoint compatible verification tool Figure 2

anything about the input This makes hashes useful for proving the existence and integrity of data while keeping the source confidential hash_id & NTP timestamp Chainpoint uses Network Time Protocol (NTP)\xe2\x80\x8b11\xe2\x80\x8b to keep time synchronized with a worldwide network of atomic clocks Chainpoint generates a unique identifier for each hash it receives This hash_id is an RFC 4122 Version 1 UUID\xe2\x80\x8b12\xe2\x80\x8b which contains a high precision timestamp that reflects the NTP time A \xe2\x80\x8bhash_id\xe2\x80\x8b is included in the cryptographic operations thus the

Chainpoint proof generation process Hash Submission Submit a hash to a Chainpoint service Each submission may contain 1 1 000 hashes Hashes can be hex strings between 40 and 128 characters This allows submission of common hash types such as SHA 1 SHA 256 and SHA 512 SHA 256 is encouraged Chainpoint immediately returns a RFC 4122 Version 1 UUID with an embedded NTP timestamp that uniquely identifies each hash Hash Processing The submitted hash is combined with the UUID to create a new hash This mixing of data acts as a cryptographic nonce and ensures that Chainpoint processes unique hashes even when duplicate hashes are submitted Next the hash is combined with the NIST Beacon data to create another new hash This makes it possible to prove that the hash was submitted after the NIST Beacon values were published Hashes are then sent to an aggregation service \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 19 \x0cAggregation Chainpoint periodically aggregates hashes into number of parallel Merkle trees This hierarchical aggregation allows for handling massive numbers of hashes The Merkle root from each tree is periodically sent to the Chainpoint Calendar A Merkle inclusion proof is generated for each hash and stored These partial proofs are continually appended with new data throughout the proof generation process Calendar Consensus The Calendar is a blockchain that is kept in consensus between multiple Chainpoint Servers This ensures that a single global calendar blockchain can be used to verify Chainpoint proofs Calendar data is organized into blocks These blocks are stored as records in a distributed cluster of CockroachDB databases\xe2\x80\x8b17\xe2\x80\x8b Writes to the calendar are enforced by a leader election using a cluster of Consul\xe2\x80\x8b18\xe2\x80\x8b servers Calendar Blocks The Chainpoint Calendar periodically aggregates Merkle roots into a new Merkle tree A new set of Merkle inclusion proofs is generated and appended to the existing partial proofs The root of this Merkle tree is written to a \xe2\x80\x8bcalendar block\xe2\x80\x8b Anchor Blocks Calendar blocks are periodically anchored to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain This is done by publishing a transaction that commits an anchor block hash to a transaction on the blockchain Confirmation Blocks Chainpoint monitors the blockchain When each \xe2\x80\x8banchoring transaction\xe2\x80\x8b receives a sufficient number of confirmations a \xe2\x80\x8bconfirmation block\xe2\x80\x8b is added to the Calendar Each \xe2\x80\x8bconfirmation block contains the data needed to finalize each Chainpoint proof Proof Completion After a confirmation block is written Chainpoint appends partial proofs with the final data Complete Chainpoint proofs are now available for retrieval \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 20 \x0cChainpoint Service Infrastructure The Chainpoint Service is designed to run as a global network that operates at massive scale The network involves the interaction of several classes of participants Core Core is a network of partners that run the full Chainpoint Service stack maintain the global calendar and anchor data to the blockchain Nodes Nodes provide additional scaling mirror the global calendar and audit Core Each node that joins the network improves scalability and reliability Anyone can become part of this distributed network by downloading the software and running a Node Chainpoint Clients Clients can connect to a Node or directly to Chainpoint Core via an API Figure 5 \xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint Service architecture diagram \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 21 \x0cChainpoint Service Design Goals Scalable Chainpoint is designed for virtually unlimited scale In contrast to other blockchain based systems throughput increases as nodes are added to the network Reliable Chainpoint is designed to have zero downtime and consistently return proofs in a predictable timeframe Chainpoint Core is distributed across independent data centers and geographic regions to ensure availability and redundancy Chainpoint Nodes form a decentralized network to create and verify Chainpoint proofs Secure Anchoring allows Chainpoint to inherit the security properties of multiple blockchains Modifying the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain would cost an attacker millions of dollars and becomes increasingly difficult over time Economic Efficiency Chainpoint is designed to be inexpensive or free for most network participants Increases in network throughput scales independently of blockchain transaction costs Open Anyone can join the network by running a Chainpoint Node Nodes mirror a copy of the calendar data and can independently verify the full chain \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 22 \x0cChainpoint Core Chainpoint Core is a network of partners that run the full Chainpoint Service stack to create and verify proofs read and write to the global calendar and perform anchoring operations Each Core Member operates one or more clusters of servers Each cluster is called a service cluster Figure 5 \xe2\x80\x8b Chainpoint Core Member diagram Core Members have the resources to run scalable systems with high availability and near zero downtime The first three service clusters will be available at Chainpoint org Microsoft is first organization to join Core and will be hosting a service cluster Global Calendar The Chainpoint Calendar is a blockchain that is created by Core and audited by Nodes The calendar provides several benefits Reduced Costs One Core Partner anchors for everyone on the Chainpoint Network A single transaction can be used to anchor millions of proofs This makes Chainpoint inexpensive or free for most network participants Faster Response The full proof generation process can sometimes exceed an hour due to variations in the time it takes to mine Bitcoin blocks Each Chainpoint proof is anchored to the calendar within seconds of hash submission Chainpoint then returns a partial proof that is automatically updated throughout the proof generation process This eliminates the need to wait for Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions to confirm \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 23 \x0cProof Verification The calendar provides a single source of data for verifying Chainpoint proofs Anyone with the calendar data can fully verify every Chainpoint proof without having to run a Bitcoin or Ethereum node You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about servers going offline and parts of your proof becoming impossible to verify Those with advanced security requirements can cross check the calendar data with their own Bitcoin or Ethereum nodes Auditability A global calendar makes it possible for anyone to audit Core and independently verify the validity and integrity of the chain Each block is signed with a provider specific public key and the chain is periodically anchored to Bitcoin and Ethereum Chainpoint Nodes Each additional Node increases the total capacity of the network to create and verify proofs Nodes are able to receive and process hashes pass hashes up to Core receive partial proofs from Core and generate final proofs Additionally Nodes mirror a copy of the calendar and continually audit the chain Node Operators Anyone can join the Chainpoint Network by running a Chainpoint Node Proof Generation Each Node provides an HTTP API that is a subset of the Core API Hashes submitted through this API are aggregated into their own Merkle tree at regular intervals The Merkle root of that tree is submitted to Core Each hash sent to Core may be used to generate thousands of proofs per Node Thus each Node significantly increases the network\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to generate proofs Verification Nodes store a local mirror of the global calendar in real time This allows Nodes to provide the same proof verification API as Core Every Chainpoint Node can fully verify every Chainpoint proof Real time Calendar Audit Nodes mirror the calendar data in real time Nodes validate that each block in the chain is internally consistent and signed with the public key of the Core Partner Periodically Nodes verify that the entire chain is valid all the way back to the genesis block and report these results to the network \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 24 \x0cEconomics When Tierion was first released in June 2015 the cost of anchoring data into the Bitcoin blockchain was approximately $0 03 USD In June of 2017 that cost has increased over 100x to $3 40 USD Ethereum transaction fees are following a similar pattern Figure 5 \xe2\x80\x8b Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction fees in $USD Rising transaction fees have made it too expensive for individual developers and most businesses to anchor data Based on current market prices anchoring one transaction every ten minutes to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains costs $181 332 per year These costs are projected to continue to rise The Tierion Network makes anchoring data economically viable for all The Chainpoint Service scales to anchor a virtually unlimited amount of data with a minimal footprint on the blockchain \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 25 \x0cTierion Network Token The Tierion Network Token (TNT) incentivizes network participants to operate and secure the network infrastructure Chainpoint is the first service available on the Tierion Network We have plans for future services that will be built on top of Chainpoint and will announce these services in the future Core Members Core Members incur significant costs to operate server clusters TNT provides a method to recoup these costs Core Partners earn TNT for anchoring data into the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains Periodically Core\xe2\x80\x99s consensus algorithm elects a leader that can create an anchor block which requires them to spend BTC or ETH to publish a transaction The Core Member that creates the anchor block receives a block reward as well as the tokens paid to Core for that anchor block Nodes Nodes earn TNT by mirroring a copy of the calendar and publishing an API endpoint for proof creation and verification Nodes are periodically audited to prove they have a current copy of the calendar that can be used to verify a Chainpoint proof Nodes that pass the audit have a chance to win the reward for that period Periodically nodes spend TNT to send data to Core for anchoring Each node has a local mechanism for constructing Merkle trees and generating proofs By sending a Merkle root upstream each node can create thousands of Chainpoint proofs using a single anchoring transaction Nodes may charge for generating and verifying proofs Node operators can also build services and charge at a price that\xe2\x80\x99s independent of the value of TNT A fixed supply of TNT will be created during a token sale using the ERC20\xe2\x80\x8b19\xe2\x80\x8b standard The token sale and our partner commitments guarantee that for the first year users will be able to send limited amount of data to Core at zero cost \xc2\xa9 2017 Tierion Inc All rights reserved 26 \x0cConclusion As the world relies more and more on digital data it becomes increasingly important to identify the source of information and verify its authenticity This is especially pressing for companies in regulated industries such as healthcare insurance and financial services These organizations are trusted with safeguarding huge volumes of critical data Proving the authenticity of information within these industries is currently slow cumbersome and expensive The Tierion Network will fundamentally improve how the world secures and shares data By providing a \xe2\x80\x9cProof Engine\xe2\x80\x9d for the Internet everyone will be able to prove with absolute certainty when data was created or if it has been modified from its original state Additionally Tierion provides an ultra secure trust anchor that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on trusted authorities The vision for the Tierion Network stretches beyond the initial Chainpoint offering This is just the first step in a longer journey We\xe2\x80\x99re building a global network for data verification that operates at Internet scale Incentives are built into the ecosystem to ensure the network\xe2\x80\x99s reliability growth and development By running a node developers will improve the network\xe2\x80\x99s scalability and earn tokens which grant access to a growing array of services We see the Tierion Network as a solution to the problem of trust on the Internet The seemingly simple innovation of using hypertext to link HTML documents led to the creation of the World Wide Web Similarly linking data to the blockchain will create a global standard for verifiable data The implications of this seemingly simple innovation could be groundbreaking There is a fundamental gap in the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s trust infrastructure The root of trust for all systems relies on trusted authorities Tierion closes this gap and makes it possible to create a better Internet where proof replaces trust as the foundation for security For more information
