into the digital era Marketing like all industries has the opportunity to transform itself by effectively engaging with the huge flows of data generated by billions of smart devices Whilst the technology used by marketers is highly advanced marketing methods themselves are still stuck in the stone age Theoretically all activities in the digital world leave a trace Advertisers dream of being able to track consumers throughout the journey from first impression to final purchase however this currently isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible because consumer\ s digital traces are locked in \xe2\x80\x98data silos\xe2\x80\x99 This is due to a lack of cooperation between websites and poor data interoperability Data is a valuable resource so we are using the blockchain to facilitate trustless data sharing so advertisers are able to track individual users across devices and platforms Whats more for the first time consumers will actually be paid for the usage of their data Proton Network is a public chain for the digital marketing industry dedicated to achieving the two most desired goals in the field 1 Cross application unified identity (UID) 2 A Blockchain digital marketing ecosystem \x0c05 2 Industry Situation & Major Challenges Five years ago the SSP+DMP+DSP system started trying to further improve the accuracy of digital marketing by using a series of analytical models based on cookies to define effective user flow patterns Sadly the system was affected by fatal issues such as the short lifecycle of cookies and the inaccessibility of data between websites and applications The ultimate results of digital marketing were not satisfactory The original goal of bringing digital marketing to an attributional analysis level eventually failed Proton will not Notes SSP = Supply Side Platform DMP = Data Management Platform DSP = Demand Side Platform Figure 1 Advertising Industry landscape by Lumar Partners \x0c06 2 1 UID System Consensus and Achievement Years of wasted marketing budgets have led advertisers to the realization that they need unified identifies for their customers Alibaba Tencent and other giants have consolidated a large number of sites and applications into their ecosystems via acquisitions By doing so the tech giants are able to connect data silos among members of their ecosystem and create a UID system This strategy achieved effective precision digital marketing in two years Lets take Alimama\ s Uni Marketing as an example Alibaba integrates Taobao Tmall Alipay and other start ups within the Alibaba Group in order to connect the data across Alibaba\xe2\x80\x99s whole ecosystem They can then achieve highly precise digital marketing capabilities Alimama has helped Friso Dyson Estee Lauder and other brands instantly improve marketing results by 1 2 to 3 8 times Therefore effective UID will fundamentally change the whole industry dynamics But what do you do if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay for the quasi monopolies of Alibaba and Tencent \xe2\x80\x9c In two week period since product launch Friso acquired 3 8 times more consumers and 1 5 times larger the coverage of target population through Uni Desk by Carat \xe2\x80\x9d Case Study from Morketing an Industry Vertical Media 2 2 UID Walled Gardens Unfortunately the success of the data giant also represents their monopoly in the market This phenomenon is also called a Walled Garden by industry experts Many advertisers cannot afford the high costs charged by these data giants and most independent applications and media cannot exchange data with each other due to mistrust Furthermore a number of unique and efficient user analysis and rendering models have failed to achieve business value due to a lack of common standards for formatting data Worst of all customers have been totally neglected and have never really benefited from the whole process \x0c07 2 3 Huge Market Potentials and Opportunities According to the Internet marketing report released by the IAB United States the online advertising market reached 280 billion yuan in the first half of 2017 in the United States alone and the global Internet advertising market has exceeded 1 trillion yuan According to Global Digital Marketing Spending Report issued by Statista in 2018 global internet market size will surge to over 2 trillion yuan starting from 2019 This represents a huge growth market for new UID based advertising methods outside of the giants One which could assist and empower all involved parties to jointly accomplish an industry upgrade for such a huge and thriving market This is the mission of Proton Network Spending in billion U S dollars 3 354 8 3400 3 043 4 2 698 5 2550 2 292 5 1 946 1700 1 617 850 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Figure 2 Global Digital Marketing Spending 2015 2020 (Statista Reports) \x0c08 3 Proton Network The first public chain for digital marketing The Proton network will be the eco system consists of service providers in advertising industry advertisers and end users who use Proton\xe2\x80\x99s API or products and will utilize the Proton Token as a medium of exchange to facilitate all transactions for services in the Proton network so that all users of the Proton network can deal efficiently with each other by means of a unified form of exchange 3 1 Value Definition & Vision Proton provides a low cost UID system solution and and an effective incentive mechanism to website operators and applications developers through blockchain technology All parties can share data confident it will be managed in a trustworthy way Everyone will realize more gains from the precision targeting sites will be properly credited for bringing users users will be paid for their data and advertisers will get superb information In addition the Proton network aims to create a blockchain digital marketing ecosystem Besides the advertisement market we also hope that all players in the digital marketing value chain can use our UID based solutions for their own area of focus Service Providers A wide range of companies agents DSP / SSP\xef\xbc\x8fDMP platforms Ad exchanges BI teams etc They can upgrade existing systems via Proton\xe2\x80\x99s API to access all round authorized user profile data with support of the ecosystem The more accuracy during the campaign the more income for the service provider Publishers Publishers can easily tap into Proton network via an SDK API or the Proton empowered SSP network Publishers are able to use the authorized profile data providing more customized service for their users \x0c09 Advertiser Advertisers can access the entire ad campaign process via a Proton empowered DSP portal They can trace and measure the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s result in real time across the network and reward publishers and end users automatically End User Users will for the first time ever have full control of their data and can make a profit off of it They enrich information give consent to brands and advertising service providers and receive rewards and discounts through Proton Client DApp Thus fully protecting their personal data privacy and gaining a fair return from brands 3 2 Core Concepts UID (Unified Identity) The unique ID of each user throughout the entire network Proton uses this ID for crossproduct cross platform user tracking and profile cross matching preventing the formation of Information Silos\xe2\x80\x9d UID can be treated as a unified identity in the whole ecosystem or as a key to link the unified profiles (UP) Proton network the UID is the key concept it is also the key for data exchanging across different areas In order to build a complete UID data system across the whole network the Proton classifies UIDs into three different levels Top level The user is verified and authorized through Proton client side Dapp Second level The user is registered from the publishers/media in the ecosystem These IDs are generated from matching the encrypted standardized identity information Third level IDs Generated through matching of collected multi dimensional data For example Mac address cookies etc This is the current industry standard Publishers and the advertisers will no longer have to lead users to follow their pre set process to complete a transaction nor encourage users to click on the corresponding ads They can even trace back VIP consumers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior to optimize and modify the advertising strategy accordingly \x0c10 Case Study Ticket App[C] conducts a campaign in order to acquire customers It advertises on travel content App [A] expecting users to click on the ads at the end of the article to jump to App[C] for submitting orders In most cases the actual situation is that the user browses the travel articles about Singapore in App[A] then closes App[A] opens a browser[B] and searches for tourist routes in Singapore for more information They then close browser[B] and reopen the ticket App[C] for booking An order is eventually submitted but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be traceable to a non UID backed system Media App[A] does not receive the advertising revenue it deserves Advertiser [C] is unable to understand and trace the source channel of the users If Ticket App[C] campaign comes under Proton network it could\xe2\x80\x99ve clearly tracked the source of users and their footprint to adjust the campaign at any time Media [A] can therefore quantitatively measure previously unrecognized value On top of that the user gets paid in Tokens for the usage of their data Expectation\xef\xbc\x9a A Ticket App[C] Ads Purchase C Reality\xef\xbc\x9a A Content App[A] Content App[A] Browser App[B] Ticket App[C] Search Purchase Ads Proton Solution\xef\xbc\x9a UID D A B C Figure 3 Example of how UID works UID \x0c11 UP (Unified Profile) The profile contains basic information and behavioral data Tagged data generated from the analysis process Based on UID system Proton can easily identify the most valuable customers for their advertisers Within Proton network every user will have their independent UP in each application Their UP stores user\ s basic information (gender etc ) key behavior defined by products and existing labels produced by publishers etc Third party companies can obtain encrypted data for analysis once its authorized by the user Publishers can easily tap into the Proton network via an API and automatically collect data or they can enrich a users profile by using the Proton API with another publisher Each UP of the user has an independent Key which is stored as a Proton UID So in the Proton network a user\xe2\x80\x99s global profile means the data set of all connected UPs Example App[A] is a news App User[B] will generate huge amount of actions in App[A] such as browsing favoriting forwarding liking and commenting App[A] also has a personal page function for collecting User[B]\xe2\x80\x99s information When App[A] is connected to the Proton by SDK User[B]\xe2\x80\x99s actions basic information will be automatically recorded and encrypted Proton will generate an independent Key for that as a User[B]\xe2\x80\x99s UP on App[A] User[B]\xe2\x80\x99s UP on App[A] browse Like Comment Personal Info User\xe2\x80\x99s action & info will be recorded and encrypted UP Figure 4 Example of how UP works \x0c12 UA (Unified Attention) UA is a comprehensive measurement system to evaluate user attention based on their UP the advertising content and user behavior (click and duration etc ) UA is used to quantify how long a user spends on certain content Based on the measurement a fair and reasonable value distribution system can be designed to balance the interests of advertisers publishers and consumers UA serves as a basic unit of measure in the Proton giving advertisers and service providers a quantitative measurement of the user\xe2\x80\x99s interest UA version iterations are continuously updated based on different smart contracts Depending on the industry and its standards service providers or advertisers can also join the ecosystem to develop their own UA standard smart contracts Case Study User[A] browses advertising content[C] in App[B] then the UA is generated through the industry specific UA smart contracts by entering the following data User[A]\xe2\x80\x99s UID User[A]\xe2\x80\x99s UP (which can also be considered [A]\xe2\x80\x99s UP in another App) Content[C]\xe2\x80\x99s Corresponding tags and data The user\xe2\x80\x99s current browsing behavior on App[B] User[A] UID\xef\xbc\x9aPTT532 Content[C] Tag & Data User[A] UP\xef\xbc\x9a532 Smart Contract UA User[A] on App[B] browses Content[C]\xe2\x80\x99s UA App[B] Behavior \x0c13 3 3 Industry Upgrade via UID Solution As the infrastructure of digital marketing the Proton network will integrate data from existing players on the market Through a simple plugin API publishers and end users can join the ecosystem They\xe2\x80\x99ll share data and thus forming a unified user profile At the same time insights generated from data analysis can empower publishers and provide value to the advertisers Through Smart contracts enterprises will not need to worry about mistrust Publishers and data management platform can exchange data seamlessly within the ecosystem The introduction of a token provides a useful medium of exchange between parties It also encourages more enterprises and users to join the system and speeds up the construction of the entire ecosystem Data Rights Collaboration Data Values Supply Side Demand Side Token Online Behavior Data Company

unified data format These things lead to high communication and software development costs Mistrust is the major obstacle for publishers to exchange data with each other However with the Proton network architecture each publisher can conduct fast secure low cost data exchange Proton Solutions Through setting up rules in the smart contracts the network can simultaneously solve the problems of data leakage and high development and communication costs Achieve the optimal balance between data offering and return via smart contract and token mechanism Standardize data format to eliminate additional development costs \x0c15 Example Step1 User register APP1 and APP2 respectively user is recognized and labeled with UID PTT532 Step2 APP1 and APP2 stores user profile for this particular user respectively Step3 APP1 and APP2 exchange encrypted user profile via smart contract on Proton network Step4 The user\xe2\x80\x99s advertisement and content viewing behavior will be processed to a UA after analyzing their user profile (UP1+UP2) and the corresponding viewed advertisement Step5 Based on calculated UA and preset smart contract the advertiser will pay the publisher and reward end user automatically User UID\xef\xbc\x9aPTT532 APP 1 APP 2 Ads Content Ads Content Smart Contract UP1 UP2 User behavior User behavior UA The advertiser will pay the publisher and reward end user

computing with optimized queue design in order to meet the industry needs Hard shield protection to secure the source data from credential stuffing attacks Encrypted data storage with support of IPFS Amazon S3 AliCloud OSS etc Application Layer Proton SDK or API will be embedded into Apps and Websites to create a unified user profile Proton Dapp for unified user information management users can adjust at any time through the App Vertical industry App are encouraged to be developed based on the Proton network Service Layer This layer mainly provides interfaces for small payments querying data exchanging and attention measurement data etc Data Analysis Layer Provide fundamental data interface support data query for service layer and raw data query for data analysis partners \x0c17 Foundation Layer The foundation layer of the proton network is an independent public chain to support smart contracts and the consensus engine Storage Layer Peer to peer data storage layer for decentralized storage of user basic information behavior trajectories and profile data etc 3 6 Proton empowered Ecosystem With fundamental support from the Proton network the existing ecosystem is empowered to evolve into a brand new one We can encourage all stakeholders in the current digital marketing landscape to contribute without undermining the existing interests The Proton network which works in tandem with large service providers and mobile apps can quickly reach and dominate the marketplace resulting in a huge eco network effect 4 Proton Token Circulation Proton Token also known as PTT is going to be used as the medium of exchange for the circulation of value between various parties of the entire eco chain within the proton network and acts as the medium of settlement of value transfer and circulation internally The use of PTT will encourage the healthy development and growth of the internal economy and ecosystem of the Proton network and will improve the efficiency of ecological operation Various examples of the use of the PTT is provided below 4 1 PTT use case Advertisers can quickly settle with Publishers and Users through smart contracts Settlement amongst Publisher / Advertiser /Service Provider during data exchange Brands distribute incentives to reward user loyalty Settlement of product transactions within future eco system Encourage and incentivize more users outside of the ecosystem to join in Can be used to pay for and stimulate the computing power and storage contribution \x0c18 4 2 Value of Token Reduce cumbersome transaction calculations Establish the standard for advertisement payment within the ecosystem this establishes value because advertisers will buy PTT to pay for advertisements Basic exchange document for future DApp developed based on proton chain i e Token which is based on the Proton Chain brand is specially issued for its loyal customers PTT Pay Sale PTT Proton Fundation PTT Mining Proton Network Purchase PTT

PTT\xef\xbc\x88into\xef\xbc\x89 \x0c19 4 3 Ways to obtain PTT Following the establishment of the Proton network participants are compensated with PTT for contributing various resources to the Proton network This is done in two ways 1 Provision of Computing Power Each time a smart contract is summited on the Proton Network the one who initiates the contract will have to pay a small amount of PTT Other users in the Proton network are rewarded for contributing computing power used for analytics and accounting in the settlement of such smart contracts (since these are settled by means of a consensus mechanism) For example if Enterprise A invokes a smart contract for settlement with Enterprise B Participant C will act as the settlor of the smart contract based on the consensus mechanism and then C receives a small amount of PTT paid by the Proton network as a reward 2 Provision of Storage Space The Proton network will require relatively large data storage capacity for the purpose of its designed and will therefore allow users to contribute data storage space and be compensated relatively Users will also be compensated with a small amount of PTT each time if any data stored is been requested \x0c20 PTT\xe2\x80\x99s case studies (without consideration of computing power and storage payment ) Case Study I One example is how enterprises can pay data providers for requesting their data for advertisements During a campaign specific individual data is generated and stored when an individual interacts with the advertisement This data will be marked with corresponding right to related parties If it is marked as income right then each time such user data is been used the owner of such data will be reward with PTT as a form of payment as settled in the smart contract For example if User A owns 30% and Company A owns 70% of such data\xe2\x80\x99s income right then Company B wishes to use the data and is a charged 10PTT Company A will receive 7PTT and User A will receive 3PTT Case Study II PTT is also used in advertising transactions between two or more parties For example Company A set a total advertising budget of 100PTT where every single click of its advertisements will pay out 1PTT If Company B and Company C nominated as service provider within the smart contract where Company B achieves 80 clicks and Company C achieves 20 clicks Company B will receive 80PTT and Company C will receive 20PTT \x0c21 5 Technology & Deployment Overview Application Layer Web Sites/ Portals Advertisers/ Agents Mobile APP\xef\xbc\x9aSNS/ IM/Video/E commerce

forecasting data query etc \x0c22 5 3 Data Analysis Layer Unlike traditional analysis the data analysis layer of the Proton Network introduces a modular data analysis service In addition to the service modules provided by the Proton Network itself third party data analysis services may also be accepted into the ecosystem The Proton Network data analysis layer provides a series of data analysis services based on raw data Since user authorization data is often complex disorderly and can not provide valid information and blockchain technology itself can not provide the ability to analyze complex data This layer should introduce independent semantic data analysis services and use smart contracts for the implementation of supervision dispute mediation service settlement and distributed service evaluation for the two or more parties of the service Third party data analysis service providers will provide customized data analysis services based on the encrypted data authorized by users and publishers (for encryption principles and hierarchical principles please check details in the data storage layer) The data analysis service will use off chain mode which uses mature data analysis tools such as data cleaning correlation analysis entity analysis machine learning data modelling text processing and semantic comprehension and provide complete and accurate UA and UP combinations for service requesters The publisher/ advertiser will use the analysis results for accurate advertising and feedback objective results The entire transaction and dispute handling are on blockchain so the provider could improve the algorithm to form a closedloop The precise acquisition of User Profile (UP) is based on the user\ s authorization and hierarchical encryption of data usage so providers improve algorithms and form closed loops to fully guarantee the privacy and data security of users Efficient data analysis modules can take full advantage of effective high quality data \x0c23 Data analysis tools 3rd party Data analysis 4 Data Correlation Entity Machine Data Text Semantic Cleaning Analysis Analysis Analysis Modeling Processing Comprehension 6 Off chain

9 Publisher/Advertiser to get the result and apply 10 Publisher/Advertiser distributes the distributed evaluation result to the foundation layer of blockchain or applies for arbitration and closes the loop to improve the service quality \x0c24 5 4 Trust Foundation Layer The trust foundation layer is a core layer that distinguishes Proton Network from all existing UID systems This layer provides a P2P network based on blockchain technology using cryptographic algorithms to ensure data security and confidentiality The consensus mechanism will be different from the traditional POW (Proof of Work) to take more suitable approach for Proton Network applications similar to the DPOP (Delegated Proof of Participation) or DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) approach The incentive module is the engine that drives the exchange of value between parties in the decentralized system Proton Network provides token based incentive modules Though the foundation layer Proton Network system service layer runs smart contract on the Turing complete virtual machine with related integration of modules on analysis layer In the long term Proton Network hopes to reduce the threshold of cooperation between parties and realize the seamless connection of the industry ecosystem 5 5 Data Storage Layer Proton data storage layer will be based on a unified data storage interface also compatible with mainstream distributed storage services and cloud service storage Existing cloud computing services also collapse to weight nodes in globally distributed network nodes As shown in the following figure each point can communicate with each other CN means there are N nodes in the system C1 C2 C1 CN C2 Figure 12 Data Storage CN \x0c25 User data stored in the Proton Network will be divided into two layers one for the off chain raw data which is a large volume of data and can use the existing structure or non structural database to store then use on chain pointer addressing call Another part of the user data is called meta data or data about data such as user identity user raw data pointer the original data usage records authorization records that can be stored by on chain On chain storage of data can be audited by stakeholders and cannot be tampered with 5 6 Data Privacy Because on chain data storage needs synchronization with the whole network sensitive and private data such as users\xe2\x80\x99 original data pointer users\xe2\x80\x99 original data call records which are stored encrypted online this data and information can only be accessed by the user or user specified parties The other part of the information such as identity information can be stored online without encryption because it is anonymous User off chain data is stored in a server provided by a different third party which is trusted by the user or user\ s own private cloud The following possibilities exist for on chain and off chain data storage The on chain data user keeps the private key which can be updated synchronously by the Proton blockchain node after encrypted It can be a strictly selected node provided by the user private cloud or Proton Network Off chain data encryption is stored in the storage layer which is compatible with the mainstream distributed storage service The existing cloud computing service will also collapse to a weight node in the global distributed network node The benefits of doing so take full advantage of the existing storage architectures improve their structural weaknesses and provide possible ways for system evolution Only the user has the right to access and control the private key \x0c26 2 Interaction with SC Block Chain 1 Publish SC 3 Token Generation Data User 4 Key Request 6 Receive Keys 7 Data Analysis Requests 8 Information on Interests Key Servers 5 Token Veri\xef\xac\x81cation Data Owners Resource Server Figure 13 Data Privacy Management Different from the traditional C/S architecture and central node storage the main advantages of a distributed storage structure supported by the blockchain are It is possible for user data stored by various third party service providers to be uniformly called and processed under fully user control For a certain user the relationship between a third party service provider and the user is C/S A user may select multiple third party service providers to complete different types of services like shopping travel entertainment and so on \x0c27 6 Business Analysis 6 1 Income Streams In order to maintain the day to day operations of Foundation the business models of Proton Network are as follows Transaction Fees Each transaction on the entire Proton Network is charged an extremely low transaction fee in PTT The fees are managed by the Proton Network Foundation and sold to advertisers with predefined price Certification and Authorization Fees Under the Uni Marketing ecosystem built via blockchain technology on Proton Network many service providers will emerge in many subdivision market to provide value added services such as User Data Analysis Advertising Forecast Brand Loyalty Degree Management Brand Customer Data bank Management Proton Network Foundation will charge a fee for its annual audit 6 2 Competitive Analysis The major issue in digital marketing industry such as unidentifiable fake flow data silos unfair profit sharing are well known and exist for a long time Different teams propose their own solutions based on their own interests This chapter mainly discusses and differences between Proton Network and other solution BAT (Basic Attention Token) BAT is proposed by Brendan Eich JavaScript & Firefox founder and his technical team By developing a Brave browser monitoring users\ attention anonymously and motivating content providers using BAT token BAT eliminates middlemen and reduce fraud and content providers can get more income At the same time users can block junk advertisement and get fewer but more precise advertisements while advertisers spend less achieve more \x0c28 However BAT has the following limitations Centralization BAT can only circulate via Brave browser a centralized product developed by itself Moreover importantly it ONLY works when users content providers and advertisers are online simultaneously And they will face huge resistance during the promotion since their goal is to remove the middle layer of advertisement industry so to make multilateral collaboration impossible Limited market BAT use browser and browser plug in ignoring the usage habits of Internet products in many other countries overall the world For example Chinese people use Apps for much longer than browsers Subject to fraud BAT does not have a compelling anti cheat solution Instead it will motivate users to cheat as BAT token rewards based purely on user browsing and length of stay Low scalability Brave browser is a DApp based on ERC20 protocol Richer application scenarios (such as high frequency advertising exchange center) will be limited to the speed of the Ethereum itself Technology Business Team BAT Proton Blockchain Technology DAPP based on ERC20 Public Chain Layer Application Protocol Data Collection Within Brave Browser Whole Proton Eco system Advertising Performance Moderate Good Relation with existing eco system Compete Empower Scope of application Limited Whole Internet Team member Tech Focused Tech Focused + Industry Resources Fig1 Proton & BAT \x0c29 According to current data of Coinmarketcap com the total market cap for BAT is over 600 million USD(DATE) and listed as top 50 crypto digital currency in the world With the advantages on technology business model and team We believe that Proton Network will attract more attention and get recognition from digital marketing professionals and capitals once it is released Comparison with existing data driven digital marketing platform Apart from BAT team trying to quantify users\xe2\x80\x99 attention and build up self developed product a lot of other teams work on solutions that can improve advertising performance using data analysis techniques Alibaba Baidu and Tencent also have similar initiatives with themselves\xe2\x80\x99 eco system Single product

blockchain uni marketing data system base on UID Proton Network has incomparable advantages in multiple aspects business model technology experience industrial resources and professional team Unique Vertical Market Experience and Resources Internet Advertisement is complicated and unequally distributed In order to make a difference it requires not only strong technical support but also a clear direction to unite others within the industry Proton network is built upon the recognized theory of \xe2\x80\x9cUnimarketing\xe2\x80\x9d combined with the blockchain technology Our key to success is that our team leaders were fully involved in the project that established and commercialized the UID system instead of starting from the beginning Our Chief Strategy Consultant Shuaimin Wang was the former general manager of the media innovation department in Alimama He was also the head director of \xe2\x80\x9cUni Desk\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a commercial product of Alibaba group which utilized the \xe2\x80\x9cUniMarketing\xe2\x80\x9d concept He participated in both the design of the framework and the process of commercialization which stimulated the brand transformation from pure \xe2\x80\x9cMedia Buying\xe2\x80\x9d to AIPL uni marketing During his 15 years of front line work experience he has accumulated enormous industrial resources and unique understanding of the situation which will lead the Proton team stay focused and advance rapidly Confirmed UID System Test Partner Bangtuike Technology Development Pty Ltd is founded in 2015 and located at On Bangtuike content will be processed through NLP layer and analyzed by LDA model which were developed by Bangtuike to obtain its topic The system will also tell the \xe2\x80\x9cemotion\xe2\x80\x9d of the content via D2V and then abstract keywords to establish a keyword matrix for future mapping purposes \x0c31 Bangtuike and its API embedded Apps have already implemented the basic UID system Due to its experience in the digital market artificial intelligence and data mining Bangtuike will participate deeply in the development of Proton Network Together with the first batch of partners in the industry they will become the first group of Internet applications that connect into the Proton SDK network Gene of Ecosystem and Network Effects The Proton Network takes full consideration of the existing industry challenges and the pain points of various participants pertain to building up technical structure and anchoring the right market positioning Served as a public chain of digital marketing Proton Network will perfectly solve the distrust between disparate participants by taking advantage of blockchain decentralization and unalterable features Due to the design of collaborative data analysis modules and crosschain interconnection mechanism the attempt to empower the ecological service providers will be fully achieved While starting the project development Proton Network will launch out the collaboration with top tier industrial advertising monitor companies and DSP\\SSP After the integration of APIs and data by a serial of developmental service providers one partner is able to complete
