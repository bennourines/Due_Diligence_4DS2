Token Project JCT Project realizes a platform which allows visitors especially from overseas to search and to experience various Japan \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d by using the blockchain technology There exists virtually no project with this kind of objectives regardless of whether based on the blockchain technology or not JCT will create a platform generating totally new values This platform will then provide to its participants with clear benefits by leveraging three factors of the blockchain technology to be described later Besides from the onset the JCT project will involve experienced business entities as group companies to leverage the platform and also plans specific affiliations which will be released soon Moreover this platform includes a mechanism to minimize the excessive liquidity of tokens in exchange markets by assuring the siphoning off of tokens from the market in accordance with the platform usage Furthermore the initial token to be issued will be approximately 30 million and the token volume will be gradually increased up to 2 500 million over a course of a decade by monitoring the platform growth This project is led by a management team of entrepreneurs with listing experience of multiple corporations with depth of business development experience and leading art directors of Japan This management team is supported by powerful partners Cybex one of the most influential advocates of the Blockchain industry born in China and Monstar Lab Inc which holds multiple global R&D centers This the JCT project is the first project in Japan backed by actual businesses a strong development system and a management team with deep experiences 2 \x0cMarket Potential 2 Though Japan possesses the world\xe2\x80\x99 s richest sightseeing resources and contents there are relatively few visitors from overseas and it is yet hard to approach this potentially rich \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d for them Where on earth can we find truly good restaurants and experiences unique to Japan There exist obvious gaps The \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d covered in the JCT project include hotels restaurants events experiences and making things Not \xe2\x80\x9cthings\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cdoings\xe2\x80\x9d In addition this is a rich market yet untapped promised for growth by Japan of mature yet of large economy targeting for the citizens of Asia of the most rapidly rising income levels Moreover there will be an Olympic held in Tokyo in 2020 which is one year and half after the start of actual service offerings by JCT Key Business Factors 3 Key terms to make up the JCT projects are the followings \xe3\x83\xbbThe visitors to Japan reserve \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x86\x92Issue of tickets or reservation rights and generating and managing their future credits \xe3\x83\xbbPlatform for ticket distributions JaCKET \xe3\x83\xbbTokens serving as fees to perform the ticket distributions and cash assets JCT token Management Team 4 The team started the JCT project holds deep knowledge and accesses to these Japan contents through the most prominent quality magazine about Japan contents \xe2\x80\x9cDiscoverJapan \xe2\x80\x9d And besides the team includes ones who have done in depth operations about experiencing through travelling restaurants and events engineers who have led the industry about the blockchain technology moreover ones who have launched several platform businesses and prominent venture capitalists who have accumulated success stories on investment One of those managing the overall project has founded and listed several corporations of market capitalizations of over 100 billion yen 3 \x0cTechnological Focus 5 The JCT platform amongst Blockchain technology is characterized by the three following features \xe2\x80\x9cRecords focused on the clarification of the right holders\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated fulfillment of rights based on \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIncreased security level and decentralized management based on distributed exchange technology\xe2\x80\x9d We believe these three features focus on the most essentials among blockchain and its related technologies The JCT project is aiming to achieve innovative success on each feature By also establishing a cooperation structure with Cybex advanced in distributed exchange technologies blockchain will be leveraged on higher level as well as by integrating effective data for the JCT platform into an Oracle existent off chains will be tapped in at the same time In order to resolve the scalability issues of Ethereum which will be adopted for JCT tokens we plan to shift to a more advanced blockchain technology and assume specifications enabling a seamless transition Benefits of Blockchain Technology 6 By combining the three key features of the blockchain technology described above the JCT project will realize the secondary market of reservation tickets for \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d This implies the possibility of resale By doing so the \xe2\x80\x9cticket purchaser\xe2\x80\x9d side would be able to make reservations with minimized considerations for the future uncertainty and putting the secondary market in place would also allow the possibility of last minute reservations On the other hand the \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d provider side would relish the benefits of business advancements such as improved convenience of offerings improved certainty of collections and improved lessons for price setting The JCT project also is aiming to create an economy beyond borders by leveraging its characteristics of crypto currency being able to maintain and to exchange the values beyond the borders of countries and legal currencies 7 Promotion of JCT Token utilization and generation of actual demands by turning into points The tokens which will be issued in the JCT project into which financers will invest and which are planned to be distributed at exchanges will not only function as various fees but also plan to be used as assets to purchase \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d or as payable compensations for selling \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover in order to encourage the actual demands for JCT tokens some settlements coming from distributions on the platform of the JCT project will be made with JCT JCT necessary to establish this settlement will be automatically bought from the market This implies that JCT will be forced to siphon off from the market in accordance with the amount of contents in distribution which props up the JCT token distributions In order to encourage distributions with JCT transaction fee margins between settlements by FIAT and JCT will also be established This establishment of transaction fee margins would be based on the essential advantage of the blockchain based mechanism vs existent settlement systems such as credit card 4 \x0cEstablishment of Eco system 8 In addition this circulation of JCT tokens will be offered not only to visitors to Japan from overseas but also to \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d providers in Japan We are also considering localizing the platform of the JCT project into Japanese language so that Japanese residents are able to use the platform as end users as well in the future Then an eco system through JCT tokens will expand more and the actual demands for JCT tokens will be expected to grow continuously At the same time in the JCT project various affiliations for increasing the business volume of contents on the JCT platform are planned to proceed in the future Expansion Strategy for Content Coverage 9 At the initial stage the JCT project will be centered on appealing event contents unique to \xe2\x80\x9cDiscoverJapan\xe2\x80\x9d DiscoverJapan is a magazine focused on introducing Japan from various perspectives and is a combined media of paper and digital with a decade of establishment as a position of high class magazine On top of this we will promote partnerships with a number of restaurants and hotels in Japan and is aiming to increase the total amount of distribution Currently we are under negotiation with possible external affiliations which will be released in turns Ultimately we aim to create an environment where each individual would be easily able to release contents and to further expand content postings Project Phase 10 This the JCT project will be launched in four phases 1 From July 2016 to November 2017 Project launch phase 1 ) In December 2016 Start of prototype operation limiting to B to B function 2 From January 2018 to June 2018 Project Design Phase 1 ) In April 2018 Team expansion 2 ) In July 2018 Completion of the first version of whitepaper and the official HP 3 Form July 2018 to January 2019 Project Development Phase 1 ) In July 2018 Completion of the development of JCT Token 2 ) In August 2018 Issuance of JCT Token 3 ) In December 2018 Release of the Closed\xce\xb2 version ticket creation features for originators 4 From February 2019 onwards Project Full scale Phase 1 ) Release of the \xce\xb2 version 2 ) Release of the secondary market 3 ) Provision of credit management early credit posting support service and more 5 \x0cToken Allocation and Inhibition of Excessive Liquidity 11 The JCT project will not raise funds from general investors All the funds will be raised by the funding members and their supporters And tokes allocated to the funding members and the supporter will be set with step wise lockups In doing so we plan to ensure a step wise liquidity in accordance with the JCT platform growth Thereby the ultimate total issue will be 2 500 million however the maximum of initial tokens to be circulated will be approximately 300 million and thereafter there will be controlled stepwise expansions Information Disclosure and Business Risk 12 Blockchain industry Among JCT members there exist some entrepreneurs who own experiences of leading closed corporations to publicly traded corporations and moreover of raising them up to the level of a market capitalization of far over 100 billion yen With these experiences we aim at an appropriate information disclosure and at establishment of a favorable relationship with the community generated by this information disclosure As essential to the project it is necessary to lead the project launch by the operation side during the initial phase but the operation side recognizes these risks and plans to spread these risks to communities and markets as soon as possible Upcoming Schedule 13 1 From June 21 to 28 Private placement 2 In September 2018 Listing of CYBEX 3 Plan to execute AirDrop 4 Trial service for concierges and tour guides in Japan also as a system test 5 At the end of the year 2018 Plan the second execution of AirDropService in 6 From the end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019 Go live 7 Around the spring in 2019 Plans the third execution of AirDrop 6 \x0c1 Market Potential Japan is the country possessing the world\xe2\x80\x99 s richest sightseeing resources and contents The number of tourists from overseas to Japan is increasing every year and is expected to increase further in the future The Japanese government also predicts 40 million tourists by the year 2020 In fact there are relatively few visitors from overseas compared to the rest of the world and it is yet hard to approach these potentially rich \xe2\x80\x9cJapan contents\xe2\x80\x9d for them There exist obvious gaps The JCT project targets on a markets growing precisely because of these existent gaps Moreover we focus on \xe2\x80\x9cJapan contents\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cdoing = experiencing\xe2\x80\x9d including accommodations \xe2\x80\x93 hotels and minsyuku traditional Japanese inns cuisines\xe2\x80\x93 restaurants and experiencing \xe2\x80\x93 events and making things selected in the result of the increased visit frequencies to Japan and the increased ratios of repeated customers Figure Normal GNI in $ horizontal axis & Number of foreign tourists \xe2\x80\x93 vertical axis Comparing Japan with France and Thailand possessing the world\xe2\x80\x99 s richest sightseeing resources and history and culture For the normal GNI the number of tourists to Japan is considered to be at a singular position Reference \xe2\x80\x9cThe World Bank 2016\xe2\x80\x9d Currently the number of visitors with repeated visits not the first visit to Japan are increasing As a result there is a shift from the consumptions of things to the consumption of doings Although the opportunities to experience \xe2\x80\x9cJapan\xe2\x80\x9d itself are increasing it is also the fact that Japan is not yet readily available to these expectations Japan is the country possessing the world\xe2\x80\x99 s richest sightseeing resources and contents and at the same time is the rich market yet untapped promised for growth by Japan of mature yet of large economy targeting for the citizens of Asia of the most rapidly rising income levels 7 \x0c2 Key Business Factors Key terms to make up the JCT projects are the followings A\xef\xbc\x89Visitors to Japan reserve \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x86\x92Issue of tickets or reservation rights and generating and managing their future credits B\xef\xbc\x89Platform for this ticket distributions JaCKET C\xef\xbc\x89Tokens serving as fees to perform the ticket distributions and cash assets \xe2\x80\x9cJCT\xe2\x80\x9d token The right to experience \xe2\x80\x9ccontents\xe2\x80\x9d visitors to Japan which are key business materials for the JCT project will be converted into electronic tickets and offered to users as reservation rights By connecting the reservation rights converted into electronic tickets to purchasers\xe2\x80\x99 unique wallets or accounts the ownership of ticket will be clarified avoiding foul uses and property losses This ticket ownership could also relatively easily be sold and transferred to the third parties by the user choice With these factors in mind we aim to resolve the ownership issues existent in ticket sales as well as to expand the market with enhanced convenience by electronic ticket conversion B\xef\xbc\x89Platform for the ticket distributions JaCKET JaCKET is a ticket market for experiencing \xe2\x80\x9cJapanese culture\xe2\x80\x9d leveraging the blockchain technologies JaCKET will provide a place where originators content providers will create rights to experience to be converted into electronic tickets and will sell to foreign visitors and Japanese wishing to experience attractive Japanese cultures Moreover JaCKET will also provide a platform function as \xe2\x80\x9cthe secondary market\xe2\x80\x9d where purchased tickets for experience could be transferred and sold with any price within a predetermined range to acquaintances or to third parties JaCKET will eliminate the risk of identification control arisen from foul ticket acquisitions and will incorporate the distribution of margins gained at the secondary market to originators content providers In these respects JaCKET is a revolutionary platform also resolving the issues of resale markets 8 \x0cJaCKET signifies \xe2\x80\x9cJa panese ti CKET\xe2\x80\x9d This is not a mere ticket but is a logo and a name of the platform representing both respect to content originators generating tickets and approach to end users accessing to these tickets C\xef\xbc\x89Tokens serving as fees to

activities foul activities and the membership facts of Blockchain projects 14 \x0c4 JaCKET the platform of JCT focuses on the following three features \xe2\x91\xa0 Leverage the characteristics of records and public ledger focused on the clarification of right owners Technological Focus Blockchain Technology By utilizing JaCKET platform ticket outline and information on rights will be recorded on blockchains Then whenever tickets are distributed whereabouts of the ticket ownership will be recorded with the transfer of rights which enables the proof of the right ownership JaCKET platform provides ticket authentication mechanism at the content originator side and user who are purchasing tickets or whom these rights are transferred will be able to check in smoothly at the site of ticket in use In addition capitals collected as ticket fees will be pooled under specific conditions by Smart Contracts and allocations of revenue will automatically be executed as the event comes into effect As claim owners of revenue would be recorded on blockchains third parties would be enabled to purchase the future claims which should be rightfully received by originators as content providers before the claims are settled Therefore the third parties who have become anew right owner of the future claims could collect as considerations for the claims JaCKET platform emphasizes the recording of this future claim right Based on this mechanism development of services such as early settlement for the future claims are planned in the future In addition several measures to enhance the possibility of holding contents subject to tickets are also planned and will be released in turns As a result content originators would be able to collect some capitals before the holding of events promoting content development and simplifying content offer and eventually speeding up the JCT economy expansion 15 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa1 Automated fulfillment of rights based on Smart Contracts On JaCKET platform fulfillment of rights by Smart Contracts will be automatically applied based on transaction rules set for each registered \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontent\xe2\x80\x9d This enables surely and quickly the reception of ticket sales amount fee settlement collection of cancellation fee and so forth which so far used to be of large burdens or risks Especially this would improve drastically the situation in which collections are not necessarily executed based on a cancellation policy and would resolves the issues of the content originators such as hotels and restaurants Users who have purchased tickets sold on JaCKET could resell these ticket rights to acquaintances or to third parties with a newly set distribution price At this moment resale with a higher than the regular price could come into effect depending on the contents At present even if resale with a higher price comes into effect there is no contribution back to content originators However on JaCKET platform if resale with a higher price comes into effect additional fees gradually increasing in accordance with incremental revenue occurred will be applied and a certain ratio of them will be allocated to content originators This series of charging of fees and sharing with content originators will be allocated by Smart Contracts based on predetermined transparent rules Besides the dead stock of tickets is an extremely serious problem for the content originators In addition on JaCKET once the period predetermined as a ticket information reaches the service leveraging Smart Contracts of automatically selling the ticket rights to the JCT operation will be offered This will enable to always collect some amounts if end users made cancellations which minimizes the sales risk for originators 16 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa2 Increased security level and decentralized management based on distributed exchange technologies JaCKET market place will by leveraging the blockchain technologies unique to DEX \xe2\x80\x9cCybex\xe2\x80\x9d already proved in distributed exchange operations enable highly real time transfers and verifications of ticket ownerships irrespective of such scalability issues in Ethereum Also in order for JaCKET to take a more decentralized role JaCKET marketplace is aiming to achieve trustless interactions between ticket owners and third parties willing to purchase tickets in the secondary market In order to achieve these three objectives the JCT project will cooperate with Cybex and Monstar lab The JCT project has researched on various cases of distributed exchanges driven by the thoughts that distributed exchange is what the trading platform really should be like Then we selected \xe2\x80\x9cCybex\xe2\x80\x9d as our partner already started distributed exchange operations from the standpoints of its technological reliabilities and its advanced concepts about security amongst each research subject we have deepened our discussions have signed a tie up in January 2018 and have been investigating together into the innovative product leveraging blockchain Moreover the development of the JCT project is expected to be on a massive scale thorough knowledge on business process from ticket purchase to holding events and also progressive knowledge on development of off chain parts are required Therefore the JCT project has selected Monstar Lab Inc as a possible partner corporation for such development we started our discussions from the beginning of the year 2018 and we have established a formal structure in April 2018 Cybex of progressive knowledge on blockchain and Monstar Lab Inc of rich experience in business processes these two partners will support as the two wheels of the JCT project 17 \x0cCYBEX is a decentralized exchange that Under the philosophy of Creating a seeks to improve liquidity of mechanism for utilizing diversity and crypto assets that\xe2\x80\x99 s more transparent changing the world with technology and secure than the centralized We are operating in 21 locations in 12 counterparts currently in the market countries The digital partner division today CYBEX is an ecosystem that\xe2\x80\x99 is offers the best teams from their own built and operated by a network of like bases and worldwide partner engineer minded partners across the globe in a networks to support the planning decentralized network development and operation of customers \ app and Web services We are also working on a case that utilizes block chain 18 \x0c5 By combining three key characteristics of the blockchain technology described above JaCKET will realize various benefits for both the user side and the content originator side Benefits of Blockchain Technology Bene\xef\xac\x81ts for the content originators 1 ) Lower the hurdle to introduce contents of Japan to visitors from overseas In the past for content originators the hurdle used to be extremely high to realize a series of flow from selling their original contents to people outside Japan ensuring the delivery of its right as a ticket and providing experience in Japan JaCKET will provide a platform where it is easily perform a series of procedures of digitizing tickets by registering content information of publishing content information to outside Japan and of collecting ticket fees which would enable content originators more easily to introduce contents toward outside Japan 3 ) Flexible Design of tickets to adopt to market needs There are various needs in the content market such as hotels restaurants and events and the ways of providing contents in the industry used to vary including old methods such as paper procedures And it was not always possible to introduce in responding to business categories or to substance and advantages of each content JaCKET will provide content originators with an attractive mechanism of proofing content ownership setting a cancellation fee period setting ticket assuming the secondary market buying up tickets by JCT operation and so forth by designing tickets responding to these various markets and flexible and easy for element set up 19 \x0c5 ) Distribution of ticket revenues in the secondary market In the past the opportunity to receive sales revenue of contents was restricted to only once for originators On JaCKET platform will provide content originators with an extremely appealing mechanism as a contract where if users who purchased tickets resell to third parties with a higher price a portion of the revenue will be contributed back to originators Bene\xef\xac\x81ts for end users 2 ) Easy access to the valuable and hidden contents in Japan JaCKET will provide motivations to deliver attractive valuable contents existent in Japan to people more proactively seeking contents By appealing the platform to content originators the possibility to encounter contents formerly invisible will increase on JaCKET and along with easier settlement JaCKET will provide simpler access to contents in Japan 4 ) Flexible schedule setting and planning for a trip In the past visitors from outside Japan needed to set in advance schedules and plans in detail JaCKET will allow flexible trip planning by far with a platform responding to various forms of usage such as ticket purchase in advance or at the last minute by flexible ticket designs and cancellation or resale to third parties of tickets purchased in advance 6 ) Automated settlement with extremely high transparency Events planned during precious trips to Japan are of upmost importance for travelers JaCKET will realize high transparency for settlement by the proof of ticket purchase recorded on blockchains Therefore ticket purchasers on JaCKET would not need to worry about additional settlement or non settlement 20 \x0c6 Purpose of Token Usage JCT will establish two types of eco system using Blockchain <Eco system with JCT token> ERC20 compliant tokens using Smart Contracts on Ethereum network will be issued and \xe2\x80\x9cJCT token \xe2\x80\x93 hereafter simply as JCT\xe2\x80\x9d will be available throughout JCT eco system centering on JaCKET marketplace \xe2\x80\x9cJCT\xe2\x80\x9d will be mainly used for the following purposes a As a settlement method at the purchase of electronic tickets reservation rights b As an alternative to fee settlement at event holdings and content sales c As a settlement of sales to event organizers and content sellers d As a distribution of award for purchasing tickets e As a reward for effective information in the community or for marketing collaboration \xe2\x80\x9cJCT\xe2\x80\x9d will become the core of eco system by expanding the range of use in the future For this reason we will consider a shift to a new Blockchain technology in the future for real time property by increased speed of transfer for reduction of transferring fees and for up take of the blockchain technologies ever developing in the future <Eco system with Cybex ticket contract> In order to clarify ticket rights an eco system leveraging JaCKET market place hereafter simply as \xe2\x80\x9cJaCKET\xe2\x80\x9d employing the Blockchain proprietary to Cybex of experience in DEX distribution exchange system \xe2\x80\x9cJaCKET will mainly provide the following functions a Registering events and posted contents b Issuing electronic tickets stating rights of content usages c Selling tickets and collecting fees of ticket usages d Implementing automatically rights such as revenue allocations by Smart Contracts e Providing an inexpensive settlement system by JCT and FIAT \xe2\x80\x9cJaCKET\xe2\x80\x9d will provide a ticket distribution system as a core of JCT economy and generate the world market price of contents on JaCKET In order to do so we will proactively proceed with cooperation with existent businesses and other crypto currencies as well as with integration of market data collected and stored in JaCKET into an Oracle 21 \x0c7 Establishment of Eco system Through the expansion of distributions on JaCKET by providing attractive Japan contents leveraging the strong content networks possessed by the JCT project members we will encourage the expansion of actual demands of JCT and will establish a trustless network satisfying the supply from the provider side of events and contents and the demand from the ticket purchaser side Moreover JCT will also be distributed as an award through the content distribution process This distributed JCT will be automatically bought up any time by the market As a result a mechanism to increase the scarcity of JCT in the market as well as to always generate actual demands for tokens along with content distributions is internalized This allows that JCT will always be siphoned off from the market based on rules whenever content distributions occur By improving convenience for providers of events and contents using JaCKET these strategies will have positive impacts on the quality and the volumes of contents posted as we as will promote the increases of the utility value and of the market price of JCT in use Besides by a series of flow of the utility value of JCT being expected to increase relative to the increase of attractive contents and JaCKET usage being promoted through JCT purchase from the market also for ticket purchasers as well the eco system through JCT will expand more and a virtuous circle of ever growing actual demands for JCT will be generated At the same time the JCT project plans various affiliations for increasing the business volume on the JCT platform in the future 22 \x0c8 In the JCT project we will expand handling content in 3 steps \xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89 Tieing up with DiscoverJapan Arranged by DiscoverJapan the JCT project will be centered on appealing Expansion Strategy for Content Coverage unique events We plan to prepare a number of contents to experience Japan \xef\xbc\x882\xef\xbc\x89 Partnering with restaurants accommodations experience service businesses We will promote partnerships with a number of restaurants and hotels and business entities possessing networks with these facilities in Japan and is aiming to increase the total amount of distribution Currently we are under negotiation with possible external affiliations and will plan to release in turns \xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89 Posting individual talents Ultimately we aim to create an environment where individuals with talents in Japan would be easily able to post and sell contents Specifically chefs athletes craftspeople artists personalities and so forth What is DiscoverJapan In Japan where there are very few media covering the information on the Japanese culture \xe2\x80\x9cDiscoverJapan\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9clong established\xe2\x80\x9d magazine with the concept of \xe2\x80\x9ctextbook of Japan\xe2\x80\x9d first published in 2008 upon requests from people overseas DiscoverJapan has been communicating charms of rich cultures which Japanese people should be proud of such as traditional crafts traditional performing arts cuisines and spiritual features as entertainments suitable for people of today and has grown as media of both paper and digital with more than one hundred thousand readers every month DiscoverJapan is a powerful media entrusted projects by the Japanese government and local governments uniquely positioned itself and highly focused on mining contents of Japan DiscoverJapan covers a wide range of Japanese culture and has already established various experiences and events with their sources of interviews and distributions and with their networks By leveraging these networks of DiscoverJapan initial events being planned are followings 23 \x0cCuisine Restaurants We ensure the seats to fully entertain the best of all Japanese cuisines \xe2\x80\x9cWasyoku\xe2\x80\x9d We also plan to assist in communications manners and etiquets with craftspeople and chefs Experience Events There exit many events to experience the Japanese culture We will prepare events to taste the best of visits to Japan such as viewing Sumo wrestling tasting \xe2\x80\x9cChankonabe\xe2\x80\x9d a traditional Japanese hot pod for wrestlers tea ceremonies flower arrangement Judo and more\xe2\x80\xa6 Accommodations and cultural facilities We will prepare opportunities to feel historical architectures continued since ancient times These opportunities will satisfy not only general travelers but also inquisitiveness of people aspired after expertise 24 \x0c9 The JCT project will be launched in four phases Project Phase 25 \x0c10 The total number of JCT issue will be 2500 million However as 540 million equivalent to 30% of them will not be issued until the year 2020 the virtual number of the issue would be 1 250 million for the time being and as lockups will be set with some rules for all the tokens except for AirDrops so the maximum amount of tokens that may be Token Allocation and Inhibition of Excessive Liquidity distributed will be less than 300 million As a certain liquidity to JCT is necessary for the success of the JCT project we anticipate some distributions will occur after the start of distribution at the JCT token exchange However in order to avoid excessive liquidity each token is locked up This lock up is planned to offer as a system function Although very few AirDrops free offerings of JCT are planned to be divided into three occasions The first AirDrop will be in September after the anticipated start of distribution at the exchange the second will be at the end of 2018 before the start of distribution at an additional exchange and the third will be in the spring of 2019 before the start of distribution at another additional exchange Still as these AirDrops are aiming to improve the visibility of the JCT project and to secure supporters in the community we will accept exceptionally domestic applications 26 \x0cThe detail of the token allocation to each purpose will be as followings Token Allocation for establishing the project framework 17% We will possess 310 million JCT for using JaCKET and for promoting JCT usage as follows \xe3\x83\xbb Business alliances for gathering contents and ensuring sales capacity of contents 220 million \xe3\x83\xbb Entry incentives for promoting entry of content originators 80 million \xe3\x83\xbb Expansion of the visibility of JCT and number of owners through AirDrop 10 million Token Allocation for ensuring necessary funds and initial liquidation for the JCT project 43% We will possess 780 million JCT for alliance strategies in order to realize the expansion of eco system which is the long run objective of the project and for ensuring the token liquidation Token Allocation to Funding members and JCT operation team 10% The funding members and team members engaged in the JCT project operation will possess 170 million JCT equivalent to 10% of the total number Token Allocation to secure and adjust liquidity to the market 30% We will possess 540 million JCT for securing and adjusting liquidity to the market as well as for the system expansion and improvement along with the expansion of JCT token economy These tokens will not be issued until January 2020 From January 2020 onward the maximum numbers of 25 million every four months will be issuable In other words they will be issued gradually through ten year time from January 2020 till the end of 2029 These tokens aim to buffer possible lack of liquidity as a consequence of forced buy up of JCT from the market along with the expansion of JCT token economy as the most important However depending on distributional situation in each JCT exchange only a portion of them or none at all might be issued The JCT project team assumes that the expansion of JCT economy would exceed 3% annually Therefore we perceive that additional currency supply of 25 million tokens every four months equivalent to 1% of the total number which amounts to approximately 3% annually would not suppress unilateral increase of the currency value and in other words there is a high chance that the token price will continue to increase Of course this would be influenced by amount of content distributions and external environments greatly and no one can say anything definite or there are more things unpredictable Nevertheless as issuing additional tokens lawlessly would lead to actions of missing the token value as a rule additional token issue will only be possible with maximum of 25 million every four months 27 \x0c11 Information Disclosure and Business Risk Team members of the JCT project think that current information disclosures on crypto currency in general are not sufficient On top of obviously information disclosure on the progress of system development wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 t it be necessary to disclose information required to assess business progress of this project and to be exposed to judgments on whether it should be discussed how the token value would be assumed After the service launch important points in assessing the value of JCT are how much contents are using JaCKET platform and how much contents are distributing Particularly as JCT will be forced to siphon off from the market for settlements of points and fees whenever contents distribute it is important to share the amount of content distribution with the community Therefore the JCT project team will consistently disclose information on the amounts of content postings and of content distributions There also exist some risks as the JCT project is not specialized in developing protocols on Blockchain and we will describe these risks as following Geographical Concentration This project places emphasis on providing values from Japan Therefore if tourism and transportations in Japan are thrown into confusion in case of wars or natural disasters the execution of this project could be affected Operational risk of Launch Period \xc2\xb7 Risk involved in content development Although the value of JaCKET platform is expected to increase in accordance with the expansion of content coverage as this is a new project the amount of content coverage might not be very large at the start of the project In order to accelerate the launch the operational side plans to provide contents As a result until the platform will be launched a substantial portion of content offerings would be relied on the operational side \xc2\xb7 Safety risk of deposits On JaCKET platform money paid by end users as a compensation for reservation will be managed by the operational side until paid to content originators The operational side considers money trust or deposit into a SPC account in order to manage these money safely but there could be a situation where full bankruptcy remote from the operation would not be possible Legal Risk In Japan the legislative system on crypto currencies are still on work order and its full picture is not yet determined Therefore depending on the progress and the detail of the legislative system establishment the JCT project could possibly be affected 30 \x0c12 Disclaimer This whitepaper hereafter this
