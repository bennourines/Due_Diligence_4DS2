\xe2\x80\x9d The system based on blockchain technology enables online payments to be initiated by one party and paid to the other without any financial institutions acting as intermediaries This document is widely considered to have started the blockchain movement With the development of Bitcoin over the past decade its underlying application technology blockchain has become widely known researched and applied According to statistics there are currently over 2 000 types of digital currencies worldwide With the popularity of Bitcoin and the rapid development of blockchain technology the expansion of the digital cryptocurrency industry was inevitable Furthermore cryptocurrencies have become one of the hottest investment assets in the world today Along with the popularity and development of digital currencies digital exchanges have also emerged in huge numbers As of 2018 competition among exchanges has grown increasingly fierce as demonstrated first from Binance\xe2\x80\x99s Huobi\xe2\x80\x99s and OK\xe2\x80\x99s innovative mechanisms for distributing bonuses and listing tokens to FCoin\xe2\x80\x99s now allowing one to receive bonuses for \x0cholding coins\xe2\x80\x94 exchanges are getting increasingly creative in terms of how they attract users As an important entry and ecological center for blockchain projects exchanges have become an important battleground for large capital funds as well There are currently numerous ways to utilize exchanges to one\xe2\x80\x99s economic advantage further demonstrating the intense competition among exchanges However many problems in the industry have also been exposed due to the focus on it For example trading platforms are chaotic investors don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to choose from the overwhelming selection of products offered in the market and high transaction fees complicated usage processes and various types of security risks still plague investors Similar to the rise of the internet the positive side effects of competition are that they introduce a formal and steady development process for the entire industry until quality user friendly products emerge 1 2 Investor Demand and Pain Points 1 2 1 Difficult and Confusing for Users to Choose from the Multitude of Existing Exchanges At present most investors are introduced to exchanges when they start investing in digital assets However the current exchange industry is fiercely competitive with more than 10 000 in existence internationally With each exchange having a different set of rules for listing tokens \x0cthere is no single exchange that can cater to the needs and demands of all users Hence selecting an exchange that suits his needs is the first problem an investor encounters Moreover with the differences in national regulatory policies most exchanges choose to protect themselves by disabling IP As a result a large number of users who do not use VPNs can\xe2\x80\x99t even access them In addition if users end up using the services of an exchange that is unprofessional and technically deficient their accounts and assets might be jeopardized as well 1 2 2 Lack of Legal and Compliant Channels for Converting Digital Assets to and from Fiat Currency Since countries have very different regulatory policies for cryptocurrencies the use of fiat currency to purchase digital currencies has become a top demand in most countries Presently aside from a small number of countries online credit cards can be used to purchase a limited selection of digital currencies Most countries use online and offline OTC markets to conduct digital currency transactions However these methods not only have limits but also introduce users to unnecessary account risk Converting from fiat to cryptocurrency and back has become the biggest pain point for the entire industry 1 2 3 Inability to Make Purchases in Real Life with Cryptocurrencies \x0cDigital currency has realized part of its purpose of being a peer to peer medium for value exchange However the ultimate goal is for cryptocurrencies to be incorporated in to our daily lives Currently digital currency holders cannot use digital assets for daily purchases and consumption Taking into account that it is not convenient to even purchase them in the first place cryptocurrencies are as of this moment essentially just a digital item with a monetary value symbol attached to them Cryptocurrency holders urgently need to open a channel connecting the digital world and reality 1 2 4 Cumbersome and Complicated Trading Procedures Many of the mainstream exchanges in the cryptoindustry allow for digital currency transactions and essentially transports traditional trading techniques and concepts to the crypto arena such as K line MACD pending orders and bidding These relatively professional and esoteric trading methods make it difficult for most investors who do not pay attention to technical indicators to utilize them Therefore it is necessary to simplify the trading process and lower the threshold for buying and selling digital currencies while ensuring reasonable costs to users 1 2 5 Numerous Accounts and Scattered Investments \x0cIt is not uncommon for investors to possess multiple accounts rendering account management difficult and inefficient Even worse investors sometimes lose or forget account information as well as waste too much time and energy transferring funds in between their accounts 1 2 6 Questionable Security There have been numerous incidents in which cryptocurrency exchanges and more importantly investors with tokens on these exchanges suffered losses due to security problems There were also a few occasions in which exchanges themselves were reported to have stolen funds from investors In the first half of 2018 for instance there were more than ten incidents in which exchanges suffered attacks and losses In short exchange users and their assets are not well protected So how do you properly protect investors\xe2\x80\x99 assets How do you compensate investors for property losses they suffered due to the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings In addition as competition in the exchange market grows more exchanges will perish and be eliminated Under these unfavorable circumstance selecting a safe and reliable exchange has become an industry wide issue 1 2 7 Regular Investors Cannot Optimize Transaction Profits The conventional strategy for investors to maximize \x0cprofits is to buy and hold Only a negligible number of investors actually use quantitative or programmatic tools to trade However many users currently due to external influences and misinformation tend to buy high and sell low making it difficult even for professional investors to secure a steady revenue stream In addition the place of transaction\xe2\x80\x94exchanges\xe2\x80\x94 provide tools to investors that are too simplistic generally one is only allowed to transact using price limits or market price The industry lacks a platform whereby users can have access to relatively professional yet simple to use tools Investors who experienced the 2017 digital cryptocurrency market are most likely aware that there are differences in trade pair prices between exchanges There are many reasons for these differences For example some trade pairs on Bithumb were at one point 30% higher than other exchanges allowing arbitrageurs to earn a substantial amount of risk free profit However these opportunities are not accessible for ordinary investors especially given how the market is slowly becoming more efficient at eliminating these price differences To take advantage of price differences as an ordinary investor one needs professional tools to facilitate this endeavor 1 2 8 Limited Channels to Secure Value Appreciation Resulting in A Waste of Resources Most investors in the crypto industry have a positive \x0cattitude towards the development and prospect of blockchain technology so they choose to buy and hold cryptocurrencies However most investors deposit their tokens in their wallets or exchange accounts which actually represents a huge waste of resources and opportunity cost The tokens would be put to much better use if they could be invested to earn additional profit similar to traditional financial markets Compared to the investment channels available to fiat currency those available to digital currencies are primitive and still in the early stages of development Investors urgently need specialized products that can help their portfolios appreciate in value 1 3 Bitcloud Pro\xe2\x80\x99s Mission and Vision The blockchain industry is developing rapidly and investors and developers within this industry are still working diligently to define this industry Ultimately no

price is 0 0050478 Say the user sets the minimum selling price to 0 005080 and the sell proportion to 10% When there is a bid that is greater than or equal to 0 005080 Bitcloud Pro will automatically sell 10% of Seele to the bidder This process will be repeated until all of the Seele tokens have been sold \x0cPart 4 Computing Mining Ecosystem The power mining mode is an important component of the Bitcloud Pro ecosystem By transforming the user s operating behavior on the platform into computing power the user will automatically mine Bitcloud Pro\xe2\x80\x99s BPRO The mining proceeds in turn allows users to enjoy the services and benefits on Bitcloud Pro Consumption of BPRO helps maintain the normal operations of the entire token ecosystem 4 1 Method for Acquiring Computing Power The method in which computing power is acquired is positively related to the user s activity on the platform which currently includes but are not limited to the following (1) Trade using Expert Advisors and Currency Flash (2) Trade on Bitcloud Pro and take advantage of its API links with major exchanges (3) Use Bitcloud Pro to invest in digital money fund products (4) Hold a certain amount of BPRO tokens (5) Invite a friend The inviter and the invitee will receive commissions via their generating computing power (6) Increase in membership rank within our system will increase their corresponding computing power (7) Participating in activities hosted on the Bitcloud Pro platform \x0c4 2 Mining Rules Bitcloud Pro is committed to creating a fair and open computing mining model which in turn encourages users to increase their activity level on the platform and boosts revenue streams The rules for computing mining V1 0 are as follows (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) The platform maintains three kinds of computing power basic trading and competing Basic computing power refers to the computing power acquired from other behavior besides executing trades such as using Bitcoin to deposit coins inviting friends etc Trading computing power refers to the computing power generated by the user when using API trading and intelligent trading (size and volume of trade) This part of the computing power is only valid for one unit of time the next unit of time will restart calculations Competing computing power is derived by combining the values of basic and trading computing power within one unit of time Currently one unit of time is equal to one hour In one hour depending on the user s level of activity the competing power will continue to change Bitcloud Pro will simultaneously calculate the total amount of power within the computing pool The dynamic mining difficulty is used to calculate the number of BPROs that can be extracted by one unit of computing power At the end of one unit of time the mining details will be announced \x0c(6) (7) (8) and the user s mining income will be credited to his account The basic power computing part will take multiple snapshots in one unit of time Ultimately the part that can be converted into competing computing power is the weighted average of the values obtained from multiple snapshots For every unit of time Bitcloud Pro will publicly display the BPRO quantity total computing power mining difficulty mining pool address etc and will gradually write the entire process into a smart contract to ensure that the entire mining model is truly decentralized Details of more specific mining rules will be clearly stated on our official announcement channels Bitcloud Pro reserves the right to interpret mining rules 4 3 BPRO Usage Scenarios BPRO will serve as an important medium of exchange on the entire Bitcloud Pro ecosystem The usage scenarios of BPRO will continue to evolve with the development of Bitcloud Pro s business and functions BPRO\xe2\x80\x99s specific usage scenarios are but not limited to the following \xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89 Deduct transaction fees when utilizing intelligent trading and Currency Flash \xef\xbc\x882\xef\xbc\x89 Purchase Bitcloud Pro s VISA Consumer Card \xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89 Deduct transaction fees for converting between fiat and digital currency \x0c\xef\xbc\x884\xef\xbc\x89 Bitcloud Pro VIP status depends on one\xe2\x80\x99s BPRO level \xef\xbc\x885\xef\xbc\x89 Deduct commission fees for investing in digital money fund products \xef\xbc\x886\xef\xbc\x89 Can be used to cover service fees when executing API transactions \xef\xbc\x887\xef\xbc\x89 Can be used to cover service fees when executing strategic and advanced quantitative transactions \xef\xbc\x888\xef\xbc\x89 Bitcloud Pro will expend all profits on the intermittent repurchasing of BPRO tokens which will then be transferred to a POW mine pool until the pool reaches maximum capacity After BPRO s anonymous payment public chain goes online the aforementioned tokens will be returned to the community as POW mining rewards \x0cPart 5 Profit Model As a wealth appreciation platform for blockchain assets Bitcloud Pro s revenues and profits are mainly generated from transaction fees paid by users when they trade tokens use our VISA Consumer Card convert between fiat currency and cryptocurrency and consume investment related services our platform will provide \xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89 Transaction fees Bitcloud Pro s Expert Advisor will charge a transaction fee API transactions will charge the corresponding service fee which will take the user s VIP status into account (there are different VIP levels) fiat currency exchanges will incur charges depending on the size of the transaction \xef\xbc\x882\xef\xbc\x89 Fund management fee The platform will independently launch a series of blockchain investment fund products with the support of professional third party institutions and will charge certain fund management fees depending on the type of product offered and VIP level \xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89 VISA Consumer Card Bitcloud Pro will earn service fees via its issuance and selling
