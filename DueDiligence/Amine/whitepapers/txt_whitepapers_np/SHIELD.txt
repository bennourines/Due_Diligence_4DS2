b SHIELD FUTURE PROOFING THE BLOCKCHAIN \x0cSHIELD WHITE PAPER VERSION 1 0 2 THE SHIELD TEAM ShieldCoin@protonmail com https //ShieldCurrency com ABSTRACT In order to create \xe2\x80\x9cquantum proof\xe2\x80\x9d peer to peer addresses the SHIELD protocol will replace ECDS with Lamport Winternitz or BLISS signatures To facilitate the continual development of the SHIELD protocol as well as other projects specified in this document SHIELD will be subject to a self supporting development cycle The SHIELD currency will further distinguish itself with the implementation of a custom PoS scheme (PoS Boo) operating on a network of Masternodes the activation of these masternodes will also enable enhanced transaction capabilities such as PrivateSend and InstantSend \xe2\x80\x8b Keywords

the blockchain technology developed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 Since the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s genesis blockchain technology has seen exponential growth and application across a variety of industries however the blockchain still faces many critical challenges that must be addressed and overcome before mainstream adoption can be achieved SHIELD intends to solve these problems by creating the first truly secure anonymous peer to peer cryptocurrency resistant to both 51% attacks and the future threat posed by quantum computing while maintaining unparalleled transaction times with minimal accompanying fees 2 PROBLEMS TO SOLVE When Bitcoin was first introduced Bitcoin was regarded as an innovative technological breakthrough This is exemplified in that much of the fundamentals of what Satoshi created can still be found at the core of many cryptocurrencies developed today One such fundamental is block mining or more specifically block mining with one single algorithm This aspect of blockchain technology has led to the development of specialised hardware (ASICs) that have the ability to hash one algorithm to an extreme level of effectiveness rendering GPU mining obsolete The drawback of development design decisions made by Satoshi as many cryptocurrencies have since come to realize is that mining is not always a \xe2\x80\x9cfair\xe2\x80\x9d process for all participants Further information can be found in \xe2\x80\x98Section 3 Multi Algorithm PoW Mining\xe2\x80\x99 Quantum computers have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years and will likely be made available to the public in the near future Whether these quantum computers will be restricted to research groups governments industry or made accessible to the general public quantum computing will eventually become available to individuals with nefarious self interests While this technology will undoubtedly greatly improve the lives of many there are many legitimate reasons to be concerned with its increasing availability One such reason is the vulnerability found in modern day cryptography allowing them to be efficiently cracked by future quantum computers For many cryptocurrencies this advance in computing ability could create an effectively inoperative blockchain \xe2\x80\x8bHow the SHIELD currency will address this problem is outlined in \xe2\x80\x98Section 4 Quantum Resistance\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x8b Industry dominant corporations such as Facebook and Google have become increasingly effective at knowing who their users are and what their users want While this may not currently be a major concern to the majority of the general public this pervasive \x0c2 trend has created a world in which organisations can watch evaluate and track both existing and potential consumers Currently there are multiple existing cryptocurrencies that claim to keep their users anonymous such technology would prevent both corporations and governments from being able to track your spending habits The problem with the vast majority of cryptocurrencies is that they are not nearly as effective at maintaining user anonymity as they claim This results in scalability and practicability which is low or at times non existent \xe2\x80\x8bWe will talk more about maintaining user anonymity in \xe2\x80\x98Section 5 Privacy Features\xe2\x80\x99 Many competing cryptocurrencies available today contain promising roadmaps and some alternative cryptocurrencies even have incredibly talented creative developers Unfortunately without funding many of these coins will never see the completion of their projected goals and mission Without a constant income stream produced by the project maintaining a full time development team can become increasingly difficult This is the last thing we want at SHIELD as we truly believe in our mission our objectives and our commitment to the SHIELD community In order to counteract the funding problems commonly faced by many cryptocurrency projects we intend to implement features to SHIELD (and platforms around SHIELD) that can assist us with funding \xe2\x80\x8bYou can read further about our innovative funding solution in \xe2\x80\x98Section 6 Funding\xe2\x80\x99 Another problem we have identified is the increasingly high power consumption required by miners to allow coin minting and transaction confirmation through the \xe2\x80\x98Proof of Work\xe2\x80\x99 (PoW) protocols that Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies currently utilise PoW was innovative in 2009 when Bitcoin was conceived and still achieves the intended purpose for currencies today unfortunately the economic and environmental cost of the continued use of blockchains that rely on PoW protocols for network consensus is extremely high and growing at an exponential rate \xe2\x80\x8bThis problem is efficiently solved with our Proof of Stake scheme which you can read about in \xe2\x80\x98Section 9 PoS Boo\xe2\x80\x99 \x0c3 3 MULTI ALGORITHM PoW MINING Through the use of multiple PoW algorithms SHIELD has improved upon the blockchains equal distribution of rewards as well as the ability to resist a 51% attack Multi algorithm mining provides a method of allowing multiple and varied types of processing units to mine for blocks our approach enables both GPUs and ASICs to mine together in harmony on the SHIELD blockchain The distribution of rewards per algorithm is consistently proportionate to the total block reward over time For example should the x17 algorithm accumulate 300GH/s of network hash while the blake2s algorithm accumulates only 50MH/s both algorithms will receive the same number of coins per hour This system improves 51% attack prevention due to the fair and equal nature of block distribution each algorithm follows its own \xe2\x80\x9cschedule\xe2\x80\x9d meaning 51% of the hashing rate is needed for each algorithm to succeed in executing such an attack An integral element of this multi algorithm system is the way in which each algorithms difficulty is individually adjusted Difficulty adjustment is managed by the \xe2\x80\x9cDark Gravity Wave v3\xe2\x80\x9d scheme (DGW) although originally developed for the Dash currency DGW has since been successfully implemented in other cryptocurrencies DGW manages network hash spikes and network hash drops more efficiently than the conventional difficulty calculation making it more difficult for malicious miners to quickly mine coins without first processing transactions 4 QUANTUM RESISTANCE Current cryptocurrencies are generally not quantum proof due to their use of ECDS (which is vulnerable to Shor s Algorithm) Current transactions which use ECDS reveal the users address in the process exposing the crackable ECDS signature Cracking such a signature would allow unauthorized access to any and all funds associated with that address creating a potential threat every time a transaction is made The SHIELD protocol will introduce Lamport signatures or similar schemes to enable the quantum proofing of transactions and addresses on the SHIELD network Lamport digital signatures are based on hash functions which are not vulnerable to Shor s Algorithm creating an additional layer of security for SHIELD users \x0c4 5 PRIVACY SHIELD\xe2\x80\x99s Project Perdu has recently been re evaluated to ensure the correct path forward is maintained Early plans called for the implementation of the Wraith Protocol devised by Verge Currency However due to Wraith Protocols relatively low specifications we have decided to instead use PrivateSend (developed by Dash) The decision to utilize PrivateSend is advantageous as development plans to implement masternodes will be more easily aligned This change in direction will optionally improve the transaction speed via InstantSend Although PrivateSend is an improvement implementing the PrivateSend feature alone will not make transactions entirely private to address this Zerocoin or zk SNARKs/zk STARKs implementation is under consideration Further details regarding this aspect of SHIELD will be announced in Q2 2018 To ensure location privacy is achieved in addition to the blockchain transaction privacy SHIELD will use Tor/I2P wallets/nodes that obfuscate the end user\xe2\x80\x99s IP address and location 6 FUNDING SHIELD\xe2\x80\x99s self funding mechanism may involve using a percentage of the masternode and mining block rewards If this path is chosen the percentage will be very small as we only need to keep the team afloat and the remaining funding will be used for marketing We will also have some external sources of support which will be made by creating and joining platforms that help both developers and users For example SHIELD has received many donations from our supportive community which has enabled the development progress to date furthermore SHIELD is currently receiving support from various mining pools This community support will help progress the SHIELD project forward indefinitely throughout the roadmap SHIELD did not have an ICO or a premine unlike many of our competitors who have chosen this path at SHIELD we believe a strong active community will allow SHIELD to grow and expand more organically and adaptively \x0c5 7 APPLICATION SECURITY Security is and always has been a core fundamental of the SHIELD currency We always strive to improve the security functionality of SHIELD demonstrated in the aforementioned quantum proofing protocols Throughout the development of the SHIELD currency we have identified multiple security flaws predominantly in user interfaces in many applications that interact with the blockchain For this reason we aim to have all of our original products tested on multiple levels Using the open source community gathering pen testers to test applications individually and having all members of the development team check the code ideally acknowledging each commit before being pushed (not just for official updates) From our experience using the SHIELD Discord bot we have observed that with a secure backend the link to the frontend is one of the most important aspects of a secure application 8 INTEGRATION The integration of a new technology with existing or purpose built platforms can be integral in determining SHIELD\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate usability and applicability We will be using many popular free platforms such as Discord Twitter Facebook and more in order to improve the SHIELD user experience Integration on these platforms will be achieved through the development of plugins and \xe2\x80\x98bots\xe2\x80\x99 providing users with the ability to send SHIELD to friends followers or influencers without the need to request a wallet address Deeper integration may include the development of platform specific wallets negating the need for users to have dedicated PC wallets in order to access their SHIELD currency Integration initiatives intended to achieve a more wide spread level of public consumption will also be pursued through a combination of networking and reaching out to organisations to develop additional use cases for SHIELD This increased applicability will be vital in ensuring a stable coin price is maintained in the future \x0c6 9 PoS BOO Project Boo is SHIELD\xe2\x80\x99s own PoS scheme modeled after Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s PoS Casper With the introduction of a risk factor for malicious stakers the Casper scheme improves significantly on \xe2\x80\x9cPOSv3\xe2\x80\x9d The progressive nature of the protocol makes execution of attacks exceptionally difficult such as the 51% attack A malicious attacker would need to hold the majority of all minted coins while running the risk of potentially losing them all when launching such an attack The finality is mainly determined by stake and risk factors which is why theoretically it would be difficult to execute a attack successfully even with 51% of circulation (Figure 2) A similar attack situation would be dire for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin Project Boo will also solve the problem of transaction censoring With PoW a block miner can \xe2\x80\x9cchoose\xe2\x80\x9d not to mine a block containing certain addresses thereby censoring that address from the network Since block creators are chosen at random and validators are global with this PoS scheme censoring addresses from the network becomes exceptionally difficult (with the added bonus that if you try to force the network you will likely lose your stake) 10 FUTURE STUDY Throughout this white paper we have discussed some possible features and specifications that are not yet finalized While some features such as \xe2\x80\x9csharding\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRSK Smart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d are slated on our roadmap but are not mentioned in this document This is due to the current state of the SHIELD currency project which has gone through a period of heavy development and careful consideration This white paper is not the representative of the finality of the SHIELD development plan The SHIELD team will release multiple white paper revisions aiming to improve approachability and readability while also providing updated details on aspects of the project as the developers see necessary \x0c7 11 CORE SPECIFICATIONS Note these specifications include future plans We will use the following specifications
