b \x0c(ZENZO Ecosystem Whitepaper v1 0) ZENZO CHAN Hi my name is ZENZO Chan Welcome to the ZENZO Ecosystem and enjoy your stay For The Gamer By The Gamer Through Blockchain ZENZO is building a free market ecosystem with emphasis on eliminating redundancies of recycled game titles and mechanics The ZENZO platform is for the gamer by the gamer through blockchain technologies enabling a peer to peer network with built in voting for game development mechanics roadmaps and tournament rules This shared governance system will also enable spectators and players to design their own tournament rules and monetize participation through buy ins and sponsorships The ZENZO community unites to decentralize the world of game development and eSports \x0cElements eSports & Tournaments ZENZO Arcade & Marketplace ZENZO Eternal (Game) ZENZO Hatchery (Incubator) ZNZ Coin (Cryptocurrency) \x0cPRoblems Non Transferable Digital Assets & Minimal/No ROI Recycled Game Titles & Game Mechanics (Lack of Uniqueness Creativity and Gamer Collaboration) Lack of Resources and Direction for Indie Games 80\xe2\x80\x99s babies were fortunate to experience the pinnacle of gaming as the rise of PC multiplayer games in the late 90\xe2\x80\x99s gave way to eSports This competitive landscape created a virtual atmosphere where personal identity became a subjective term and people were admired for their skill and intellect not their social prowess It\xe2\x80\x99s well correlated that mental health motor skills and intellect are significantly improved by challenge driven multiplayer games especially those of strategic integrity Unfortunately the current culture of gaming presents very little innovation as capitalistic attitudes have all but killed the ingenuity of gaming Video games have been demonized for years and ever blamed for violent behavior in youth from the early 2000\xe2\x80\x99s until today Additionally video games are also sometimes looked at for causing personality defects in gamers Many uninformed parents blame video games for perpetuating antisocial behavior in their children with a direct correlation to a lower IQ However research by many top psychologists proves both negative schools of thought to be categorically untrue \x0cResearchers from the Department of Psychology at the New York University (NYU) conducted a study detailing the potential link between intelligence and performance in one of the most popular video game genres in the world (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas MOBAs) The study was able to unearth the correlation of performance with fluid intelligence to astounding results Not only do MOBAs encourage socialization with the 100 million registered active players it also encourages gamers to propose intricate tactical offensive and defensive strategies MOBAs are a far cry from the simplistic nature of the video games of the 80\xe2\x80\x99s Furthermore the IQ of most subjects in the study actually increased over a set amount of time Today these intellectually stimulating games are permeating the global market and the demand for new product is at an all time high Video games are becoming more and more lifelike in terms of graphics and gameplay However the well is unfortunately starting to run dry Gamers are being led to the same games which have dominated the market for the last 20 years With the strides in technology you might be under the assumption that new games are being released each year equipped with the same magic For example take DOTA (Defense of the Ancients) a powerhouse in the gaming industry Sadly gamers were gifted DOTA 2 with a perfunctory update on gameplay and a battery of new skins but nothing more Unfortunately companies who thirst for wealth are leaving the fundamental needs of the gamer for innovation by the wayside ZENZO proposes games that are being created for the gamer by the gamer \xe2\x80\x94 games that can incorporate a groundbreaking take on tired genres with new breakthrough technology The possibilities are endless and who better to revolutionize the gaming industry than the gamers themselves Funding for video games has always been traditionally problematic Although most of the heavy hitters like Nintendo ($9 billion) Activision ($7 billion) EA ($5 billion) UBISOFT ($1 7 billion) and many more make monumental amounts of money gamers are not seeing anything particularly innovative from them It appears as if these companies are selfishly holding on to the profits to continue their obscenely wealthy status instead of wowing the gamers in the ways they long to be wowed Furthermore it\xe2\x80\x99s less risky to create newer games when these companies are turning incredible profits with titles that have been in circulation for years With this greedy mentality it is nearly impossible to persuade companies to take a mitigated risk on a game without an already built in fan base This has lead to the development of a multitude of crowdfunding platforms While the sentiment behind these sources may have the right idea they are customarily unpredictable and leave the contributors with an array of empty promises and an overall lack of desired results or worse exit scams \x0cSolutions Immutable/Transferable Digital Assets Blockchain Technology Users have full control and access to their assets anonymous purchases (no credit/debit card address personal identity & info required) traceability and accountability of resources (distributed open ledger) Inclusive Diversity Mechanics (IDM) Community involvement and collaboration for game development\xe2\x80\x94working in open communities discussing ideas and giving suggestions & feedback Resource Generation & Allocation Provide resources in the form of community developers artists funding and marketing through the ZENZO Hatchery Blockchain has become quite the buzzword of late yet many people may not understand the importance of utilizing these tools in the gaming industry By using distributed ledger technologies gamers can effectively trace profits back to the ZENZO Hatchery where the community and ZENZO team are tirelessly working together to create new products in addition to tracking the status of the cryptocurrency treasury fund Gone are the days where gamers are left with a hope and a prayer that the established companies will create the next MOBA which will be the game of the decade ZENZO gives the power back to the people and allows them to actually vote on which games will be incubated as well as make rules for tournaments In addition gamers will eventually be able to propose changes to how the games are structured \x0cThe ZENZO Hatchery provides unique functionality to the ZNZ cryptocurrency as developers must provide unique ways to increase ZNZ utility in order to be funded Profits yielded from these games also fed back into the ZENZO Arcade tournaments the gamer\xe2\x80\x99s free market and ultimately back to the hatchery for future games Unfortunately the story for beloved games of the past follows a similar thread After a wildly successful debut the bigger companies simply slap a new name on the same concept This gives gamers false hope for future innovations and turns once inspired gamers into bored cynics However ZENZO has found the solution to this problem is a decentralization of power In addition to creating unique products ZENZO will install a system of shared governance which will allow ZENZO to work with the public to make more appropriate decisions The ZENZO community will decide how tournaments will be run as well as the appropriation of funds This puts an end to one body of decision makers dictating the future of the gaming industry and again put the gamer in control by providing products they actually want to engage with Time is money but unfortunately the hardcore gamer isn\xe2\x80\x99t reaping the benefit of time spent dismembering their enemies Through the ZENZO Ecosystem users will be empowered to engage in free market trading that allows them to easily exchange earned items skins or resources for ZNZ that can easily be exchanged for fiat or alternative currencies and assets This free market also allows the gamer to test their entrepreneurial spirit as they are given the ability to host their own tournaments and profit off of their success In addition to modern gaming ZENZO Arcade allows gamers to travel back to retro times where they can play their all time favorite games Unlike a traditionally slotted arcade ZENZO will allow independent developers to submit games to the ZENZO Hatchery where members will have access to a plethora of unlimited playables ZENZO will have and host tournaments that include ZNZ high score rewards The video game industry isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere anytime soon However gamers no longer have to be subjected to the same tired games they\xe2\x80\x99ve been sleepwalking through for years Not only will ZENZO give control back to the gamers it will utilize groundbreaking technology to revolutionize a fatigued industry whose fundamental goal is turning a profit Science has already proven game play exponentially increases intelligence in gamers Why not expand the reach of the industry and create scholars who also know how to properly time a disable\xe2\x80\xa6or bury an IED from threatening your team\xe2\x80\x99s FOB from incoming

discounted games increased privacy and digital product delivery Additionally retro and new indie arcade games will be available for play through the ZENZO Arcade Alpha ZENZO Arcade will initially support uni directional marketplace purchasing of games directly from the store and its relative administrators Other benefits include one click instant purchases (with their products delivered both via email and directly within the arcade s account interface) The ZENZO Arcade uses a multi platform account system to remove excess transactions and further simplify the process A Discord account acts as the medium of authentication and account ownership and the arcade also includes a simple 2 factor authentication pin code system The current accepted forms of payment are ZNZ and BTC Initial gaming platforms capable of being listed on the arcade include Steam Xbox Playstation and Microsoft Windows Beta ZENZO Arcade will become bi directional allowing any and all users to buy and sell games via the arcade s escrow system This includes safety measures and reputation (identity systems to encourage fair and seamless trades) and guarantees penalties to unfair or intentionally malevolent actors on the platform Fiat options will be enabled and will promote market thickness by utilizing a portion of fiat fees to buy ZNZ which will then be parceled between the ZENZO Hatchery for future use and the burn pile for combating inflation Additional payment methods will also be integrated \x0cALL PHASES MARKETPLACE FREE GAMES Digital Assets Vi d e o g a m e s e r i a l k e y s

\x0cZENZO Coin ZNZ Governance Coin ZENZO (ZNZ) is a form of digital currency built on blockchain technology ZNZ can be transferred anywhere around the world without the interference of a 3rd party and with minimal fees ZENZO is self funded through a uniquely transparent premine that guarantees continuous development and effective utilization ZENZO is a Proof of Stake based network allowing anyone with a ZNZ balance to gain rewards and secure the network The ZENZO Ecosystem and Blockchain will serve as the foundation for all applications and platforms launched throughout the project Some parts of ZENZO will exhibit a shared governance model allowing users to share in decisions made in the progression of development Consensus Algorithm The ZENZO Blockchain is built on the Proof of Stake consensus model which aims to provide the utmost security and a decentralized network By allowing anyone with a stake to validate blocks rewards will be earned holdings will be grown and the network will be strengthened Proof of Stake effectively creates incentives without the need of exhaustive hardware This particular consensus algorithm is more environmentally friendly and efficient due to low power costs and is sustainable with low end machinery Masternodes Masternodes are full node wallets running on the network with a locked collateral of 15 000 ZNZ These nodes are the backbone of the ZNZ Blockchain because they secure the network as well as the platforms which operate fluidly within the ecosystem Masternodes provide and maintain extra tools on the network such as SwiftX for faster transactions and the governance system for network consensus \x0cZENZO ETERNAL ZENZO Ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s Official Game ZENZO Chan\xe2\x80\x99s origins are unknown Upon discovering her monks from a
