mankind\xe2\x80\x99s view of the world has shifted from being that of immediate surroundings to one in which distant or even imaginary places are now commonplace in the daily digital explorations of users around the world In a swirl of images text video and raw information humanity is growing increasingly connected However despite this sharing of information there is still a barrier between the users and the information The screen the conduit through which so much human experience and knowledge has flowed is now the barrier This is a barrier which is being gradually ground down by virtual reality (VR) Key Industry of the 4th Industrial Revolution Virtual Reality (Hereinafter VR ) VR is known as one of key industries in the era of the 4th industrial revolution Thanks to recent advances in technology the boundary between the real and virtual worlds is eroding Advanced image processing and telecommunications technologies are making it possible for near photorealistic displays in VR headsets Through this medium it is possible to visit sites you could not access bodily such as the surface of the moon or the bottom of an oceanic trench Gaming travel business education and nearly all other industries can benefit from integration with this cutting edge field VR will make it possible for people to experience that which has never been possible World VR Market Size and the Future Prospect VR has been often regarded as the key element of the 4th industrial revolution since 2014 when Facebook the world\ s largest social network service provider acquired Oculus VR for 2 3 billion USD The size of the global VR technology related market is growing annually and the amount of corporate investments and governmental assistance is significantly increasing According to the data from SuperData Research the leading gaming market survey firm it is anticipated that the world VR market will grow from 3 6 billion USD in 2016 to 12 1 USD and 40 4 billion USD by 2018 and 2020 respectively View on the VR Market and Recognition of Current Problems The Oasis City Project Team believes that simultaneous growth of both contents and hardware based convergent technology is required for the vitalization of the VR market and industry As a measure to fundamentally solve current problems the Oasis City Project Team is aiming to establish the Oasis City Platform to support hardware technology that will help translate the delicate human movements to the VR world in real time Meanwhile the platform will be based on a blockchain billing economy system that will allow for the transparent reward and distribution systems as well as serve as a powerful DRM management system OASIS CITY LIGHTPAPER \xc2\xa9 2018 Copyright OASIS CITY 01 \x0cWe welcome you to OASIS CITY The Oasis City Project Team aims to actualize the Oasis City Platform which was inspired by Ready Player One a science fiction novel by Ernest Cline Ready Player One depicts a story of a boy who faces an adventure in a virtual reality gaming world in 2045 In the VR world realized through this platform we are expecting that physical space will no longer be our limitation through the balanced development of hardware and software The platform has the unlimited potential and innovation identical to that of \xe2\x80\x98Ready Player One\xe2\x80\x99 and it will become a part of our daily life

\xc2\xa9 2018 Copyright OASIS CITY SOON 02 \x0cOrientation of Contents in OASIS CITY The goal of the Oasis City Project Team is to facilitate a breakthrough from existing VR contents which are typically produced by a single designer for a single platform into a world in which all VR content is available cross platform This will allow a richer user experience and greater interaction between the various constituent developers working together to build our shared virtual worlds To support the creation of these assets the Oasis City Team will create the Oasis City Token which will serve as a blockchain based payment asset in the Oasis City Ecosystem The unique nature of the Oasis City is that all assets within this virtual space will be directly tied to the blockchain making it possible for developers to introduce the concept of scarcity to their produced items designs or experiences Unlike other games where developers have had problems with runaway inflation oversupply of specific drops or people scamming for gold the Oasis City Platform will solve these problems through introducing block chain based asset management Tangible Content Oasis City\xe2\x80\x99s content will help create realistic VR experiences in which the users freely walk run and touch various elements within the platform rather than staying in one particular spot The users can experience tangible content that can satisfy the user\xe2\x80\x99s five senses by exploring a specific space just like FPS or arcade games OASIS CITY LIGHTPAPER Interactive Content Through the use of AI and pre programmed behavioral algorithsm much of the content within Oasis City will respond directly to the presence of the users For example when an animal (VR content) makes an eye contact with the user the animal may gaze at the user or approach the user \xc2\xa9 2018 Copyright OASIS CITY AI Content By combining the artificial intelligence technology to VR content the elements of VR content respond like real creatures and change their actions according to each situation and variable For example a dog can run to the owner after seeing the owner or react and keep an eye on the stranger 03 \x0cOASIS CITY Entertainment Hub Recently there has been a shift from a simple producer consumer business model to one in which the majority of the public become \xe2\x80\x9cprosumers\xe2\x80\x9d where they both create and consume content However it is still difficult for the public to enter the entertainment market due to limitations including but not limited to social status age and look regardless of their talent Oasis City\xe2\x80\x99s Entertainment Hub which utilizes VR technology is the solution that can help the public to enter the entertainment market and generate various creative content At the Entertainment Hub anyone can show their talent regardless of their social status age and look based on the anonymity in the VR world This will allow people to become who they really want to be in the virtual world regardless of who they are in the real world OASIS CITY LIGHTPAPER \xc2\xa9 2018 Copyright OASIS CITY \ A highschool principal who dreams of becoming a comedian\ \ A mountain village
