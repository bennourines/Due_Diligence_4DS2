proportional impact such as attracting customers and achievements Influencer refers to a person who has a very strong influence and sending power among SNS called youtuber blogger and instagramor We consider those micro influencers that can catch niche target segments with high probability could be more important it is also important to approach to audiences who have higher possibility to get

by issuing and selling proprietary digital tokens It is not the form of transferring equity like stock procurement but just like to purchase type cloud funding we will do what we simply sell tokens At the time of this token sale it is not recognized as virtual currency When you circulate in general through handling at virtual currency exchanges it becomes virtual currency In other words as a strict definition ICO is not a method of fund procurement but method of selling cryptographic currencies in a broad sense Regarding the purchasing side it is not investor who invests in the project but Purchaser of token At the present moment PATRON coin is not a person who can use it as a payment for a price for an unspecified person There is no exchange market with statutory currency bit coin and other existing existing No 1 virtual currency refer to Article 2 (5) 1 of the fund settlement method) and the timing of the listing on the virtual currency exchange is also uncertain and undetermined so the above definition is also applicable to PATRON\ s ICO process 8 \x0cTable of Contents \xef\xbc\x91 What is PATRON \xef\xbc\x92 Market \xef\xbc\x93 Business Model \xef\xbc\x94 Management Plan

essential to build a new credit infrastructure utilizing technology We are \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Media Share Ring Economy\xe2\x80\x9d What is expected is the use of block chain technology By using a
