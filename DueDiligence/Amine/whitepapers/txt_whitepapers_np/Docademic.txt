is a single globally sourced healthcare service platform for the public that begins with free Human Doctor AI assisted Video Telemedicine service (DOCADEMIC APP) already in use in 20 countries by thousands of users and an associated suite of AI assisted tools and social network for the medical community (Docademic for Doctors) Combined these produce the highest level of free basic quality healthcare allowing any individual to access the benefits and knowledge of healthcare that technology now permits The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM\xc2\xb4s DOCADEMIC APP is built on top of DOCADEMIC\xc2\xb4s existing patient data routing and AI assisted technologies soon to be blockchain enabled With its simplicity of use It becomes the ultimate resource for anyone who needs orientation in a health related issue \xe2\x80\x94a one touch system that connects any patient with a Doctor through Video Telemedicine for free from any country a user is located in All patient information will be secured on a blockchain and represents a perfect On Ramp to healthcare services on a blockchain In comparison other healthcare related blockchain projects don\xe2\x80\x99t have an effective On Ramp to healthcare services With our free Telemedicine service we can get the masses to benefit from blockchain technology in Healthcare The DOCADEMIC PLATFORM\xc2\xb4s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network offers Ongoing Medical education Patient referrals Tools for doctors everyday practice and Real Time Reporting of epidemiological data for our clients and researchers Serving all client sizes and requirements The DOCADEMIC Platform combines it\xe2\x80\x99s DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network to derive high end services such as real time geographic epidemiological data reporting Automated AI Driven treatment and diagnosis suggestions for Doctors in institutions or private practice massive access to patient populations for preventative campaigns and DOCADEMIC\xc2\xb4s advanced proprietary Tools such as its AI assisted Electronic Health Record and Digital Vademecum A universal native Token the MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY MTC is the fuel that will power all services DOCADEMIC provides We are already in MTC \x0c6 talks with Healthcare institutions Governments and partners to make MTC the preferred Token for their own upcoming and existing medical services as they migrate to decentralized platforms We envision MTC will be used in the broader Healthcare industry and any other industries for various purposes including payment and remittance The end goal DOCADEMIC is building a solid global Healthcare utility\xe2\x80\x94an advanced platform the entire patient population and medical community will use to great advantage where anyone can participate as users and Token holders DOCADEMIC will become a complete healthcare ecosystem for the worldwide patient/Doctor population with digital access MTC \x0c7 02 Background MTC \x0c8 When Satoshi Nakamoto brought Blockchain into the world in 2009 few visionaries understood the disruptive shock wave that would start to reshape the Healthcare industry Like the Internet and Gutenberg press it promises to distribute power and control of information among individuals and remove it from the clutches of the elite Since Bitcoin went from a market cap of zero to $70 billion powered by blockchain technology This is just the beginning The market cap of all Crypto Tokens combined stands at over $140 billion\xe2\x80\x94with the surrounding infrastructure and ecosystem likely worth a lot more Most Crypto Token value so far has come from speculation and trading Many are looking to find the \xe2\x80\x9cnext Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x9d Almost every day new Crypto Tokens comes to market to seek fortune on hundreds of exchanges worldwide and thousands more will follow Utility of these tokens is key to their success New and old industries powered by millions of individuals and new businesses will build their entire foundations on these decentralized Crypto Token based ecosystems From ordinary payments to important health data sharing huge institutional transfers fundraising and investments smart contracts and new services that are just being imagined into existence\xe2\x80\x94 disruption is coming at a rapid rate Healthcare is a fundamental part of this transition and possibly the industry that will be benefited the most The new way of accessing healthcare is here Democratization of health has begun The power and utility are now in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands Here\xe2\x80\x99s a few interesting statistics The global healthcare expenditure market processes $1\xe2\x80\x932 trillion in transactions per day Cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s daily share in all its industries including healthcare is relatively smaller at around $2 billion \xe2\x80\x94although it sometimes reaches $4\xe2\x80\x936 billion While there are 58 countries in the world with universal healthcare there are over 100 Countries with no universal or free healthcare Healthcare services that use crypto tokens and blockchain are just being born When we look at these figures they MTC \x0c9 indicate that the crypto healthcare market is going to continue an upward trend as more healthcare services start using blockchain technology We as human beings all need this revolutionary innovation Enter DOCADEMIC A successful healthcare technology company with an impeccable reputation and healthcare industry pedigree As of September 2016 we are the first global healthcare technology company in the world to have launched a free video telemedicine service currently active with verified users in 20 countries Yes Docademic has Doctors on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week serving the public in these countries Our DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS platforms are the most advanced in the world with the most widely used service reaching peaks of over 7 000 patients served in a month With over two centuries of combined experience in Healthcare and technology DOCADEMIC\xe2\x80\x99s team understands the industry inside out In fact we understand it enough to know current healthcare methods are becoming obsolete Large healthcare institutions simply cannot keep up with innovation And we\xe2\x80\x99re only just beginning\xe2\x80\x94read on to see how we plan to grow this exponentially and why our people are the ones to deliver THE HEALTHCARE ACCESS PROBLEM Amid the massive economic activity in the healthcare industry participants face many challenges At DOCADEMIC we have identified ONE fundamental element to address It\xe2\x80\x99s an element so crucial it often gets manipulated to the advantage of the elite yet it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to the health and growth of worldwide healthcare services That element is ACCESS Healthcare Access is the lifeblood of the healthcare industry Access covers short term health solutions and basic needs of individuals\xe2\x80\x94 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s associated with chronic disease or the common cold A hospital can have the largest facilities in the world and the best run medical service for patients BUT if at any point in time a patient needs immediate care and is unable to reach the hospital or pay for its services then that patient is in trouble The history of the healthcare world is littered with such casualties Its future doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be Accessibility problems triggered many of the MTC \x0c10 Global Health Crisis\xe2\x80\x99 most traumatic events A major recent shock occurred when the Ebola virus spread throughout West Africa caused by a lack of knowledge and fear The panicked reactions by residents transmuted to local governments leading to the viruses further spread The Digital healthcare world is pouring its creative energy into this explosion of new Blockchain and AI Technologies and exciting business models But access\xe2\x80\x94that less headline grabbing yet fundamental element\xe2\x80\x94is getting left behind What if an individual\xc2\xb4s most significant healthcare service is tied to a specific set of rules that prevents a patient from considering seeking medical help or self medicates without quick access to a healthcare provider They could be in serious trouble This issue already exists today The largest healthcare providers in traditional healthcare are global hospital chains governments and other healthcare institutions such as Keyser Permanente UnitedHealth Group and Aetna Can DOCADEMIC achieve the same status in the Crypto Health economy We believe we can Read on to find out how MTC \x0c11 03 Docademic Platform MTC \x0c12 Welcome to DOCADEMIC built to provide free quality basic healthcare access to the world\xe2\x80\x99s patient population DOCADEMIC is expanding DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS a single globally sourced healthcare platform with an associated suite of services which will enable the highest level of access and medical advancement In the process this will allow anybody to tap into all the opportunities the new Crypto health economy has to offer The DOCADEMIC Platform will be managed and operated by Sidrese SA de CV established under laws of Mexico DOCADEMIC PLATFORM Currently the accessibility landscape for patients is fragmented The top healthcare providers all offer the same ways to access healthcare and no one healthcare provider differentiates in any one method of access Furthermore accessibility and the best prices for a given healthcare service can shift from one provider to another At any time the best way to get medical attention might be in a local hospital or government service The ailment may be avoided with home treatment but there is no way to find out MTC \x0c13 for sure and internet searches are questionable at best The same is true for all patients who have chronic disease In a sense the various healthcare providers are accessibility Silos They offer great service in some areas once there but their accessibility is limited to clients who have the means to reach them and know of their benefits While most of the healthcare providers offer easy access in certain basic services (ER lab studies etc ) there is no real time convenient and highlyaccessible on ramp into the healthcare world for patients of minor ailments or with the lack of knowledge to determine if they need to go see a healthcare provider Patients such as pregnant women patients with stage 1 cancer young adults elderly etc Separately each patient\xc2\xb4s needs may be different but collectively they represent a large untapped source of clients that desperately want and need a qualified on ramp into healthcare services The DOCADEMIC Platform brings together an entire global network of medical services and makes them accessible to everybody The DOCADEMIC Platform through its DOCADEMIC APP provides an unparalleled and powerful method of orientating health services and products to Individuals and institutions\xe2\x80\x94as well as to Token Issuers and Token Holders MTC \x0c14 3 1 DOCADEMIC APP 3 1 1 Intelligent medical assistance engine The DOCADEMIC Platform\xe2\x80\x99s DOCADEMIC APP offers an easy to use interface that aggregates the services of artificial intelligence\xe2\x80\x99s various analytical benefits and assists Human Doctors who are present 24 hours a day into a single highly user friendly application allowing users to solicit medical assistance in the place and time of one\xe2\x80\x99s choice as well as follow up on treatments they receive and take and share their health record through blockchain with doctors of their choosing The DOCADEMIC APP solves two important problems that limit patients in the healthcare world Accessibility Silos and Underserved Markets As mentioned above Accessibility Silos are pockets of healthcare providers like hospitals and clinics that exist because access in certain locations is not readily available to those people who live far away or want healthcare service at hours when the accessibility silos are not operating Underserved Markets are markets that in isolation are not wealthy enough to support the cost of traditional medical services People in the countries that only have Accessibility Silos and Underserved Markets would like to be able to have full access to healthcare services in their home countries but there is no highly accessible on ramp into the healthcare world for them The Accessibility Silos and Underserved Markets problems are solved by connecting these healthcare services into a single point of access and by allowing patients to be orientated to a cure at home or the correct healthcare providers and healthcare services MTC \x0c15 Under the hood the DOCADEMIC APP is a composite of two diagnostic services Internal AI diagnosis An artificial intelligence trained by our doctors to supplement and optimize the diagnosis of a patient\xe2\x80\x99s symptoms derived from the information it is perceiving from the patient through speech and text and is constantly improved External Aggregated Medical Doctor Diagnosis A real time team of Doctors that have all the information we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from giving the service throughout several countries Each Doctor in this service is linked to a system that compiles the treatments medications and healthcare providers that are added to the network MTC \x0c16 The DOCADEMIC Platform\xe2\x80\x99s DOCADEMIC APP supports giving medical advice in the country of one\xe2\x80\x99s choice To understand how useful this is it is helpful to understand that most healthcare services in the world are composed of a Basic primary care (The first contact with a doctor ) and a Secondary care (the doctor or service you are referred to after the primary care doctor diagnosis you) It is also possible to get medical care at secondary care services and bypassing the primary care service For example a Male European patient wishing to get medical attention for a pain in his neck can choose to go to a pharmacy and buy pain relief medication When he requests medical assistance in the DOCADEMIC APP He learns that the pain may be more than just neck pain because the related symptoms of fatigue he describes to the doctor determine he may have thyroid cancer While a Woman from Singapore using the DOCADEMIC APP can describe to the doctor her symptoms of her recent pregnancy and from the diagnosis that is determined through the internal artificial intelligence and the insight of the Doctor he acquired through use of the DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS social network it is determined she has preeclampsia and should go immediately to a hospital or she runs the risk of losing her baby 3 1 2 The Architecture Underpinning DOCADEMIC Platform\xe2\x80\x99s DOCADEMIC APP are three technologies that are already used by DOCADEMIC daily 1 User matching Engine (UME) 2 Cross diagnosis HUMAN AI Engine (CDHAIE) 3 Smart patient Routing (SPR) User Matching Engine (UME) Built from scratch by combining decades of experience in programming technology the DOCADEMIC APP\xc2\xb4s User Matching Engine (UME) can process several million transactions per second making it one of the most advanced patient matching engines in the health industry MTC \x0c17 The UME has been engineered to be hyper scalable to support a very high number of markets (patients from many countries) and offers native support for several languages around which a powerful diagnosis System for these patients has been built All these features coupled with \xe2\x80\x9cbuilt to fail\xe2\x80\x9d resiliency make the DOCADEMIC APP\xc2\xb4s UME one of the best in the healthcare market Cross diagnosis Human AI Engine (CDHAIE) The Cross Diagnosis Human AI Engine allows for quick effective and clear diagnosis of patients When a patient diagnosis is initiated and the demand for medical attention on the DOCADEMIC APP is high the Doctor receives real time suggestions from the AI for more complete and rapid diagnosis of the patient on the other side of the Video Telemedicine call For example if a patient calls and starts explaining symptoms such as fatigue running nose joint pain the Doctor has multiple possible diagnosis\xc2\xb4 for that patient The CDHAIE automatically performs an analysis of the symptoms to narrow down the diagnostic possibilities so a more accurate diagnosis is confirmed It is also constantly adjusting in real time to decisions and corrections as well as the latest clinical guides of the doctors to reflect the best method of treatment and diagnosis It should be mentioned here that this service is not only limited to Medical services and expands onto psychological services For example using the DOCADEMIC APP\xc2\xb4s emotional service (Cool Emotions) for psychological treatment it becomes possible to provide treatment between a patient and a Psychologists Furthermore adding a Psychological service allows for matches between Medical and Psychological treatments for wartime trauma Smart Patient Routing (SPR) The Smart Patient Routing Technology maintains quick referrals for all major healthcare providers throughout the countries where the services are given When any of those healthcare providers changes it\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in DOCADEMIC Platform\xe2\x80\x99s DOCADEMIC APP\xc2\xb4s patient referral services database MTC \x0c18 When a patient referral is given on the DOCADEMIC APP and no match is available locally the Smart Patient Routing Technology checks to see if there is a match for the service needed available in a nearby area If so it automatically routes the patient in to the service of the neighboring region Features and Success factors

to receive ongoing medical education reduce diagnosis errors and increase ROI since it lowers costs for Doctors and patients DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS includes an electronic health record Digital Vademecum and over 600 medical journals and a social network exclusively for Doctors as its core offering Users are now able to share their insights receive patients learn from the latest clinical procedures and use tools that integrate AI without even having to pay for these services and tools or depend on their medical institutions to provide it for them DOCADEMIC PLATFORM users will gain the following benefits 1 Reduction of Counterparty Risk DOCTOR users of the DOCADEMIC Platform will rest assured that the information available is compliant with regulators DOCADEMIC is regulated in the United States of America known as one of the strictest health regulators in the world 2 Increase in Efficiency DOCADEMIC Platform\xc2\xb4s Doctor users will be able to update their knowledge of other treatments without having to search for the world\xc2\xb4s medical journals directly Journal updates will be done via DOCADEMIC\xc2\xb4s real time posting technology and should be instant for Doctors as soon as the articles are published 3 More Accurate diagnosis for their patients Doctor Users of the Docademic Platform will have the ability to view and select diagnosis suggested by the integrated AI derived from the different official clinical guides This will allow Doctors to better take advantage of inefficiencies in the sometimes slow integration of recent developments in treatments in the healthcare system MTC \x0c20 3 2 1 Direct Market Access The Docademic Platform allows its users to leverage DOCADEMIC Smart Patient Routing (SPR) technology and connectivity to all reputable medication and medical device providers and get Direct Market Access through our Docademic Marketplace to the best retailers and wholesalers of medication and medical devices With our state of the art ecommerce dashboards users of the DOCADEMIC Platform will be able to purchase consumables place orders of home delivery of medication buy equipment for their practice and keep an eye on all new products and services offered in medicine 24/7 Our Order Management System (OMS) and User Matching Engine (UME) provide unparalleled banking level performance Our OMS will provide both common and advanced order types like programmed purchases of consumables for doctor\xe2\x80\x99s offices The DOCADEMIC Marketplace will be a one stop shop for all medical and health related products and services that both patients and doctors can use 3 2 2 Data Management Data Management is one of the most difficult (and restricted) constraints when it comes to providing medical services to the market Moving health data between providers is convoluted expensive and time consuming \xe2\x80\x93 which is one of the reasons Blockchain is the future of Healthcare Over the past two years DOCADEMIC has built an extensive network of relationships with Hospitals Part of our integration strategy has been to colocate our health services with those of other health institutions by offering software integration as a standard part of our service\xe2\x80\x94and in many cases further than HL7 standard requirements\xe2\x80\x94to health institutions We have also begun working with major governments to provide health service optimization This will allow us to replicate patient institution data transfer globally This service will also be available to private practices using DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS` AI assisted Electronic health record MTC \x0c21 DOCADEMIC is planning to obtain any other permits or licenses when required Why is Blockchain technology important to the DOCADEMIC Platform Docademic gets patients health records on a blockchain starting with their first contact with a doctor through our DOCADEMIC APP Like previously mentioned the Docademic APP service is openly available to the public and is already in use in 20 countries and is completely free This is the best way to get people onto the blockchain If needed the patients can be referred to further healthcare services or products after their first contact with a Doctor on the DOCADEMIC APP All patient data secured on a blockchain Eventually the Docademic Blockchain will be accessible by third party healthcare providers and they will be able to build apps and dapps on the Docademic Blockchain More in section 4 5 Why This Innovation Matters for Healthcare Access There are many third party healthcare providers that provide only limited services The access to their services and efficiency are substantially constrained by the nature and cost of their services By providing access to these service as part of our DOCADEMIC Platform third party Healthcare providers will be incentivized to use the platform\xe2\x80\x94because it will allow them to better monetize their capital by reaching more patients in an efficient manner targeted to their services Patients data will already be on the blockchain and third Party healthcare providers can benefit by having access to the patients data through the blockchain with smart contracts In the end this provides more security for patient health information in the long term The correct way healthcare information should be in the world MTC \x0c22 source https //innovatemedtec com/ Deloitte Blockchain Opportunities for Health Care White Paper MTC \x0c23 3 2 3 Crypto Token Credit The DOCADEMIC Platform\xe2\x80\x99s DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS network will extend its Crypto Credit facility to users to leverage their existing balances for enhanced purchasing opportunities Crypto Credit facility allows Doctor users to borrow using MTC Crypto Token as collateral For example when buying equipment for their practice MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC) can also be used by patients as collateral for purchasing certain products or services in the DOCADEMIC marketplace (more on our Token in the following sections ) DOCADEMIC is also in the process of creating and official Provider of Care (PC) to expand the range of services we can offer our users in the US DOCADEMIC will also obtain any other permits or licenses when required 3 2 4 Real Time Reporting The DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS users will have access to customized patient activity statements to view detailed information about their patient\xe2\x80\x99s treatments including progress previous treatments most common medication taken and more They will be able to run reports to view all aspects of their complete patient portfolios 3 3 Other Services 3 3 1 Geo Location System Our DOCADEMIC Platform provides geographic health monitoring (GHM) of population in real time as well as our powerful direct targeted notification system (DTN)\xe2\x80\x94or near constant statistical public health monitor within our network to our public health partners We provide support for epidemics and tragedies Users of the DOCADEMIC Platform will be able to be contacted by public health officials with up to date MTC \x0c24 information pertaining to their specific health need in the case of an emergency or receive information from preventative health campaigns 3 3 2 Automated Follow up of treatments Our DOCADEMIC Platform provides follow up to the most recent treatments given to patients Users can select from scale of automated one touch treatment scores to evaluate their progress then have their health monitored by our Doctors using these strategies New strategies will be published and will be accessible by our users Historical health records performance and other details derived from these treatments follow up strategies will be available to users to aid them in the improvement of their health or the improvement of their patients\xe2\x80\x99 health Initially these follow up and health monitoring strategies will be provided by DOCADEMIC However the platform certain data and tools we use will be made available to data scientists with MTC throughout the industry allowing access to any individual or teams with the talent/skill to design and offer their own health monitoring strategies MTC \x0c25 Examples of follow up strategy use cases 1 MTC token holders can use automated treatment Follow up strategies to save on purchases of medications pertaining to their treatment 2 Talented Doctors can design their own treatment combination strategies for their patients and then use them to improve their own patient\xe2\x80\x99s health\xe2\x80\x94or share them publicly for a share of the profits and/or a fee in case other doctors or healthcare providers want to adopt the treatment strategy 3 MTC Token holders can select one or a basket of Treatments strategies and then have their treatments automatically monitored Automated Treatment Strategies will be provided only to the extent permitted by the applicable laws regulations and rules and medical ethics MTC \x0c26 04 MTC Token Sale MTC \x0c27 4 1 Token Overview The Crypto economy has given us a whole new way to build new distributed infrastructure using Crypto Tokens People are coming together to contribute to something they truly want something they truly believe in And as Token Holders they are benefiting from the growth in its utility and value DOCADEMIC through MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC) is building a healthcare utility\xe2\x80\x94a platform that the entire Crypto economy and Healthcare economy will benefit from and where people can participate in as both users and token holders MTC will be issued by Sidrese Sa De CV and may be distributed by itself and/or designated distributors Please note that MTC does not represent any equity in DOCADEMIC and does not entitle holders to any voting rights dividends or profit sharing of any entities of DOCADEMIC MTC is a Crypto Token that can be used as the fuel that powers all services provided by the DOCADEMIC Platform and DOCADEMICS\xe2\x80\x99s existing services (DOCADEMIC APP and DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS) MTC has three main functions 1 As Crypto Token users can pay for products and services on all our platforms 2 As the currency that interacts with the blockchain docademic stores patient and healthcare data in 3 As a tradable Crypto Token on the open market On top of these MTC will open to all healthcare financial and any other industries DOCADEMIC will not limit the usage of MTC nor business entities that would like to use MTC for their business Therefore any companies or organizations individuals may be able to utilize MTC as a Crypto Token such as Bitcoin Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s ETH and Ripple\xe2\x80\x99s XRP As the demand for the DOCADEMIC Platform grows the utility of MTC will increase and will allow MTC holders to use its value to \xe2\x80\x9cpay for\xe2\x80\x9d all services and functions DOCADEMIC and its partners will provide MTC \x0c28 We envision MTC could even become the preferred standard Token used to pay for all services provided by the broader Healthcare industry as participants gradually migrate to decentralized platforms DOCADEMIC is already in discussion with multiple healthcare institutions Digital Health startups and partners to make MTC the preferred payment Token for upcoming and existing Healthcare services 4 1 1 Token Utility Initially MTC value will be used for services provided by the DOCADEMIC Platform and DOCADEMIC\xe2\x80\x94to cover fees as credit collateral and to participate in further development of services like the DOCADEMIC Marketplace Also patient data stored on the blockchain will only be able to be accessed by spending MTC Since through the Docademic App we load new patient information onto the blockchain everyday throughout the world access to this anonymized data will be very useful for governments research institutions companies etc We reward doctors and patients that contribute to the data that is inputted onto the blockchain with MTC and charge whoever accesses the Data with MTC MTC \x0c29 MTC holders can use value in return for Medical prescription transaction fees and referral commission Fees DOCADEMIC Platform DOCADEMIC APP DOCADEMIC FOR DOCTORS DOCADEMIC MARKETPLACE Direct Access to healthcare products and services Other Services Direct population Health monitor Automated targeted health messaging system Advertising Tools for the healthcare industry 4 1 2 Listed Tradable Assets MTC will be tradable on popular trading platforms Having MTC listed on various exchanges is another way we expect the Token utility to increase with liquidity 4 1

Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s ERC 20 Token Standard By Q2 2019 Docademic will create its own blockchain (Docademic BLOCKCHAIN) that will have specific Healthcare industry requirements already built in Currently none of the existing blockchains (including Ethereum) offer sophisticated tools to build any meaningful or scalable Healthcare services on top of their blockchains (other than basic services such as payments and transfers) All DOCADEMIC services will be migrated to the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN and the existing ERC 20 based MTC will also be exchanged to the newly created MC (Medical Cryptocurrency) on the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN The Docademic BLOCKCHAIN will provide a more sophisticated Healthcare industry programming language for the design and construction of smart contracts that will allow Healthcare institutions and Digital Health startups to build decentralized Healthcare services on top of the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN When we launch in Q2 2019 the Docademic BLOCKCHAIN will have the following features 1 KYC/AML 2 Node Management (Region Restrictions) 3 Healthcare Service Features MTC \x0c34 Docademic is creating a Healthcare services based blockchain that will be powered by MC As more Healthcare services utilize the Docademic blockchain we anticipate MC becoming the cryptocurrency of choice by a growing ecosystem of healthcare service providers thus causing the utility of MC to grow MTC \x0c35 05 Who Benefits MTC \x0c36 5 1 Individual and Institutional investors Access to Great Technology Over the years Docademic has built state of the art high availability

have a free quick easy to use option to get basic medical attention face to face with a Doctor and Doctors have tools that help them in their everyday practice Access to the worlds health services and products The ever increasing number of Digital health services presents both a significant opportunity and a challenge to reach these services for investors and traders alike Between USD 1 and 2 trillion in transactions are done daily in across millions of healthcare providers This presents a sizeable opportunity for traders and investors who want to tap into the value that can be obtained with decentralized healthcare services The chart below shows healthcare spending in the worlds markets according to the world bank MTC \x0c37 Reduced Risk The challenge lies in having access to all healthcare services in an efficient and secure manner with as little difficulty of data transmission as possible At the time of writing it is quite difficult (even impossible) to fully take advantage of these opportunities due to several factors These range from technology limitations healthcare data restrictions unreasonable prices capital inefficiency and an overall lack of clear integration DOCADEMIC through its integrated plan to use its current technologies and MTC tokens provide a solution that takes advantage of Blockchain and Artificial intelligence to achieve an efficient on ramp for customers to healthcare products and services Access to Professional Grade Services The services that the DOCADEMIC Platform offers are already powerful when used on their own but they can have a much stronger impact when coupled with our Medical ecommerce platform direct targeted notification system and sophisticated reporting tools Access to all health services the DOCADEMIC Platform provides will no longer be the exclusive privilege of the few We are launching a fully open super connected platform that will allow anybody anywhere to participate and benefit from the Healthcare services that new digital health markets and current Healthcare providers have to offer This is real democratization of Health 5 2 Token Holders The DOCADEMIC Platform will also provide token holders
