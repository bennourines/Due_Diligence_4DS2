for the publishers based on cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies By publishers we include mobile app publishers desktop software publishers web apps publishers and content creators who have control over their publishing platforms Our goal is to help publishers get the most ROI for their apps or websites while ensuring the best experience for their users leading to a win win situation Project history The Leviar project started as an effort to build DRM over blockchain but it went through a major team overhaul and a new team was assembled New objectives were fixed before building the DRM system they are the subject of this paper The ecosystem 2016 was one of the biggest years in the history of the mobile apps and digital games market This vast market which hit $88 3 billion in 2016 is growing at a tremendous rate and it keeps incorporating new media and platforms thus expanding its reach Going far beyond the traditional demographic the audience of mobile users is now one of the most valuable and engaged demographics and brand owners are paying attention In this report we look back at the major data and insights of 2016 and 2017 with an eye on a massive 2018 \x0cThe apps and games market has started to mature and now more closely resembles traditional games publishing requiring a new look into how we are monetizing those apps and how to make the user experience better The market we are targeting covers multiple ecosystems that do overlap in some areas Those ecosystems are mobile publishing desktop software publishing and web publishing Each of these sectors already has monetization approaches as shown on the figure below (\xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d is included as a category in itself because publishers gain status and recognition even if there is no monetary income or if the data generated by use is what the publishers do monetize) in next sections we are going to explore each of these approaches and go into their pros and cons App purchase By \xe2\x80\x9capp purchase \xe2\x80\x9d we mean being paid money for the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s right to own or use an application The application may be a desktop app (software like Adobe Photoshop or a game like GTA V) a mobile app (a paid app or paid game like Monument Valley 2) a SAAS web app (like Salesforce basecamp com) or a content website (wsj com the Wall Street Journal site) In app purchase In this model the app is usually free and the publisher earns money by selling items add ons merchandise etc This approach is very common with video games \x0cAdvertising In this model publishers enter into contracts to display certain ads to their users to promote the advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s offering Usually the publishers get paid by CPM (cost per mille) and the value depends on the keywords used and the demographic targeted by the advertiser Free The free apps model can be divided into multiple categories An app may be free because its cost is paid for by some organization or institution that distributes the app for free Or the app may be used as a reference for the publisher or the developer to gain a reputation that leads to some paid work If it does not fall into the first or second categories then the customer is the product which means that the publisher is interested in collecting users\xe2\x80\x99 data for further exploitation (for other integrated products or a simple sale) The problem Digital publishing has gone through many phases and waves since its beginning It was an exploding sector especially after 2008 the year mobile apps were introduced to the public and the concept of the app store was brought to the public by Apple During that gold rush publishers started to make money on apps of all types many of questionable quality and a lot of them succeeded in making fortunes in those early days many still do But in recent years developers have had a harder time making money from paying apps as the most recent data point to a continuous decline in the purchase of paid apps across the board while we have noticed a rapid rise in free apps This phenomenon is due to many factors but there are two main reasons One is the noticeably high quality of the new free apps and the second is the rapid growth of the mobile advertising business to the point where publishers can earn more money through advertising than through app sales As all apps users know the advertising model is broken It is plagued with many challenges and difficulties The only parties really profiting from it are the middlemen And no matter what advertising networks say no one likes to see ads either online or on their mobiles The problems and challenges that face the advertising industry are \x0cEffectively targeting high value sources of growth The propagation of ad blockers (even Google is getting into ad blocking) The advertising business is cornered by few actors that control the market and prices Increasing costs Elusive audiences Ad fraud The complexity of the advertising ecosystem and technology Evaluating the effectiveness of content and brand marketing And we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget the negatives of the ads on the end users Ads are getting more intrusive every day Ads are very disruptive for the user experience people simply hate being distracted while using their apps no matter what platform they are on \x0c\x0cAds represent a big security concern Much slower page load time and unnecessary data usage Ads might contain offensive/inappropriate content Most ad networks do compromise the user\xe2\x80\x99s privacy Many ads are misleading Pop ups are the worst of the breed For the free apps model the story is a little different Not many developers can afford to build and maintain a totally free app The apps that are exploiting user data (the Googles of the world) are in a class of their own and the diligent and careful user can\xe2\x80\x99t fully trust them because they usually don\xe2\x80\x99t respect the user\xe2\x80\x99s privacy and they profit by tracking users\xe2\x80\x99 behavior The advent in recent years of crypto assets and cryptocurrencies enabled developers to disrupt many established businesses and industries just as the web did before them One other negative aspect of the advertising business is the current revenue structure The CPM/CPC of different ads depends largely on many factors such as geography keyword (topic) and age and sex demographics This structure has created a strong incentive to publish content targeting high CPM/CPC regions (like the USA) for some topics this divide in pricing can create a void in apps aimed at areas and topics that are less demanded by advertisers \x0cSo if we can find another way to monetize apps that can level the playground so and African developer wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to target the US Market to earn a decent \x0cThe opportunity The rise of cryptocurrency technologies and the large demand for them gave many publishers the motivation to use their apps and website to mine cryptocurrencies on their users\xe2\x80\x99 devices either computers or mobile devices Most if not all of those apps do website mining without users\xe2\x80\x99 consent And this is not good if not illegal The idea of mining cryptocurrency on a user s browser to monetize a website was popularized by a site called Coinhive Coinhive provides a JavaScript library that can be invoked within a loaded webpage to start mining Monero as an alternative source of revenue As a service fee Coinhive keeps 30% of earned XMR and the other 70% is given to the site owner As a result the user gets an ad free experience on the webpage at the cost of some CPU cycles After the great success of Coinhive many similar sites started offering the same formula By October 2017 more than 2000 websites (unique domains) embedded mining scripts Geo location of hosts/websites those adopted in browser mining Source zscaler com \x0cGeo location of clients who accessed mining websites Source zscaler com Our immediate objective is to build a platform that will allow publishers to monetize their applications and websites by mining on their users\xe2\x80\x99 devices with their consent but with much more reasonable fees and without middlemen And this mining is done with the consent of the user End users are prompted at the first launch of the application if they want to see ads or if they want to get rids of ads by allowing a reasonable amount of mining on their devices as a contribution for disabling ads and having a better experience The challenges The main challenge in this concept (mining on users\xe2\x80\x99 devices) is technical hitting the right balance with the right amount of power dedicated to mining on the user\xe2\x80\x99s device to allow the user a good experience and earn enough cryptocurrency to make it profitable for the publisher The second challenge is to conceive a mining method that is mobile friendly and ASIC resistant as power consumption and heating are the most problematic side effects of mobile mining (these challenges will be covered in a future white paper) Leviar Platform Leviar is an integrated set of tools services and SDKs with the main object of monetizing apps Leviar is platform independent (OS/hardware) \x0cLeviar Components Payment API The Payment API is the set of APIs that allows developers to implement payment systems that accept Leviar Coin as payment The main application for this API is to be used for in app purchases or as a reward system in gamified applications Monetization by mining Developers could monetize their application using Leviar\xe2\x80\x99s client side mining SDK The mining code will be embedded with the application and will run natively on native apps and on the browser in the case of web apps The client will mine one of Leviar\xe2\x80\x99s pools and the publisher will get the coins mined in his Leviar wallet Advertising Users who opt out of the mining experience will automatically accept the displaying of ads on the app Those ads will be pulled from Leviar\xe2\x80\x99s advertising network partners and a system will be developed to figure out the payment structure between the network and developer without creating another middleman Client Side Integration SDK A client SDK library will be provided for publishers to integrate Leviar monetization functionality It will use native code on every possible platform On the web a JavaScript library will be used Marketplace The decentralized marketplace is a major milestone for the Leviar project It will be the launchpad for our DRM system DRM DRM over blockchain is the long term goal of the Leviar project Our team is working on building relationships with partners in this sector and on building all the components necessary to operate a DRM system \x0cLeviar Platform technology CryptoNote CryptoNote is an application layer protocol that powers several decentralized privacy oriented digital currencies It is planned as an evolution of the ideas behind Bitcoin The main difference between the two technologies is that Bitcoin (like most digital currencies) is less opaque than CryptoNote based currencies due to the latter s blockchain being almost anonymous contrary to non CryptoNote blockchains CRYPTONOTE FEATURES Untraceable payments CryptoNote provides users with a completely anonymous payment scheme and implements the ring signature technology which allows you to sign a message on behalf of a group Unlinkable transactions By using a variation of the Diffie Hellman exchange protocol a receiver has multiple unique one time addresses derived from his single public key After funds are sent to these addresses they can be redeemed only by the receiver and it is impossible to crosslink these payments Double spending proof Nobody is able to spend the same money twice \xe2\x80\x94 even if all his signatures are anonymous Every signature contains a key image These key images are used to prevent double spending Blockchain analysis resistance Non repeating one time addresses and mixed keys in ring signatures make the whole blockchain resistant to analysis Adaptive limits A decentralized payment system must not depend on a single person s decisions even if this person is a developer \x0cMonero\xe2\x80\x99s child Leviar started out as a Bytecoin fork but after seeing the great features implemented by Monero the Leviar team decided to adopt and switch to Monero\xe2\x80\x99s code in order to get all of Monero\xe2\x80\x99s features (because we don\xe2\x80\x99t need or want to re invent the wheel) Below we list a few of Monero\xe2\x80\x99s features that are coming to Leviar Coin Monero is currently the best known of all the CryptoNote based cryptocurrencies and it has a very engaged community With its privacy oriented features it became really popular with many online communities Monero was forked from Bytecoin in April 2014 Monero has been praised by Bitcoin core developers
