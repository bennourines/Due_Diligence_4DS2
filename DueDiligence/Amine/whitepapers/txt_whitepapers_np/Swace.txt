completing a variety of tasks The app involves a token economy An individual who has adopted the Swace lifestyle and is already enjoying the adventure that it represents Engagement scenarios Swacing Being a true Swacer daring to make a change in your life by taking part in social games sharing and socializing engaging with brands and other users and being rewarded for it all Swace offers several types of engagement scenarios based on blockchain technology Anyone can use the preconfigured frames in order to create a game following a set of rules Engagement scenarios are constantly updated Swace wallet Swace coin The Swace currency It is used within the app to enter social games as rewards for likes and votes as gifts to friends to swap for goods or services offered by partners etc For winning a social game or participating users earn Swace tokens Brands purchase Swace tokens in order to set their game The personal wallet of a Swace ecosystem member It only stores Swace coins and all of its operations history is recorded in the blockchain Coin purchases transfers from other Swacers and rewards arrive to the wallet Swace Swap The place to buy and sell Swace Coins 4 \x0cMISSION To give users positive emotions and encourage out of the box activity To empower users to be in control of their activity on social media award them importance and respect and reward them for engaging with brands VISION Swace becomes a leading social gaming platform for everyone fair transparent and on a par with the world\xe2\x80\x99s most popular platforms 5 \x0cGeneral description Engagement scenarios Internal ecosystem Technical app description Blockchain application In this section we give an overall description of the project including its technical aspects We have included a detailed explanation of the user brand engagement scenarios the app offers Here you will also find explanations regarding the internal ecosystem of the app \x0cGeneral Description Swace is a community driven initiative envisioned as a solution to the unsatisfactory experiences users and brands have with social networks each from their own perspective It is an independent platform featuring preset gaming frames brands can use to engage with users who in turn get rewards for participating and winning games The app\xe2\x80\x99s economy is based on decentralized blockchain technology and revolves around a token called the Swace Coin The app\xe2\x80\x99s main goal is to improve the interactions between users and brands It encourages a more active and exciting lifestyle for the users while having them engage with brands in a genuine and non manipulative way forming positive associations and a happier user brand relationship We want to enable users to be more adventurous and to give them a feeling of being appreciated and rewarded for the content they generate and for the loyalty they give a brand Another central aspect of Swace is the socialization between users Being a network centered around social gaming Swace encourages healthy competition while helping the users find a balanced approach to sharing and relating to what others share Instead of causing each other unpleasant envy and suspicions of fakeness Swace will empower users to support each other in games share and engage with each other and even team up for better rewards Swace target group We believe that we understand our target group well and we are making an effort to satisfy their particular needs Whether they are actively into sports into partying or in love they are all similar in several ways They are young (18 26) modern and at least a little non conforming They are very social and enjoy sharing their lives with their friends on social media For them being an influencer is an important ambition They value fun and want to improve themselves they love new technologies in their lives and easily adopt them They demand transparency and fairness because they want to be in control of their own lives Swace responds to these needs by bringing in the latest innovations and by deliberately working in as open and transparent manner as possible We are choosing to partner with brands that will match their interests and offer games that will appeal to them 7 \x0cTHE STAR Here you enter the games GAMES LIST This is where all the available and upcoming games are located GAME INDICATOR This icon shows what game your friends or other users are participating in 8 \x0cEngagement scenarios Swace develops a variety of frames in which social games can be created making use of several different technologies and exploring user motivations which tie into our core values The frames are flexible and enable anyone to create a game within them in a simple and straightforward way The array of frames offered will be constantly updated with new options offered regularly This is the central interaction of the app powering user content generation brand engagement and the token economy Swace believes that by triggering the competition instinct combined with habit building and the natural motivation of rewards the lives of users can be enriched and made more exciting which in turn will lead to greater loyalty to the brands standing behind the games Some examples of possible engagement scenarios are explained below Location Visit a specified number of locations over a given time period Snap pictures or selfies of the brand in action using provided guidelines share the images and get rewarded This type of game encourages users to effect a change in their daily routines explore new locations in their surroundings and feel adventurous \xe2\x80\x93 positive change associated with a brand name promoting active engagement with the brand The game involves habit building principles \xe2\x80\x93 repetitive interaction with a brand over a concentrated span of time helps form loyalty 9 \x0cVoting Upload a picture in response to an announced theme and try to collect as many votes as possible from other users Only the submitter with the most votes is rewarded Engaging the competitive drive and playing on the exclusivity of the reward this type of game also calls for creativity on the part of the user as the theme can sometimes be interpreted in more ways than one Augmented reality Users must find 3D objects added to certain locations using AR Collecting or spotting these objects earns them rewards The use of the exciting technology of Augmented Reality provides the users with entertainment while encouraging physical activity increased attention and curiosity as they search for the hidden objects in order to gain the rewards 10 \x0cEmotions Share moments with the brand during specified time to get rewarded Linking emotional photo worthy moments in a user\xe2\x80\x99s life to a specific brand deepens the quality of the user\xe2\x80\x99s engagement with the brand by associating these emotions with the brand\xe2\x80\x99s name Product testing The brand selects a specific audience and gives them a new product to test and get credible feedback Everyone who participates in the testing gets a gift in advance For completing the feedback process user gets extra bonus such as Honest Tester status extra Swace tokens etc The platform becomes a substitute to extremely expensive product testing research providing an opportunity to get realistic feedback from a credible audience 11 \x0cPrivate In this type of a game a brand can choose to make a game passwordprotected and/or displayed only to users with invites This way the platform can be used for the company s internal needs such as motivating or rewarding the employees 12 \x0cInternal ecosystem Brand $$$ External crypto exchanges Swace Swap ($ SWACE) Network (operation fees) SWACE SWACE External crypto exchanges SWACE User SWACE Check in fee Game participants Check in fee SWACE Game pool (Smart Contract) Contribution from brand Contribution from users Referrer SWACE New sign up Rewards The brand orders its advertising campaign (game) through a special interface There are settings the brand can choose for the game and the slots The interface then calculates the cost of the game It charges the brand s advertising budget with that sum Once the campaign is ready a smart contract is formed Any participant who wants to play the game must pay a check in fee Each challenge includes a mechanism of social verification Other users verify that the submissions match the rules of the game There are several ways to gain SWACE coins and be able to join games At registration users confirm their identity using social networks (Facebook Google+ etc ) For joining they receive a starting bundle of coins At first these coins are only usable for checking into games Only after receiving a reward the users can exchange coins into prizes or cash them out When an existing user invites a friend to join Swace they receive a reward in coins The coins become available once the invited user joins at least one game Winners Rewards External crypto exchanges Rewards Brand Brand SWACE SWACE SWACE Total token balance SWACE Another way of getting SWACE coins is by purchasing them from external exchanges Each user account connects to a wallet address The user may add the coins they purchased outside the system to this wallet Finally every time a user wins a game they receive coins as a reward Some games only have one winner who gets a larger amount of coins In others many people who have completed the game all share the reward fund Users may exchange their coins for goods from Swace s partners They visit the partner s branch choose their prize and pay in SWACE coins to the brand s wallet 13 \x0cThe process from a brand\xe2\x80\x99s perspective 1 2 3 4 5 6 Once a brand chooses to launch a Swace campaign it needs to choose its parameters The provided generator makes designing the game simple and convenient The brand needs to provide the contents of the campaign images logos brand and product names descriptions and categories as well as purchase links if relevant The content is regulated by the brief the brand provides for example \xe2\x80\x93 posts featuring the product no adult content etc The brand can target the campaign to users by age or gender where they come from and what their hobbies are The brand gets a possibility to convert FIAT to SWACE tokens using internal Swace Swap to launch a campaign The process from a user\xe2\x80\x99s perspective 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Once logged in the user sees their feed displaying currently offered games and content shares by other users they follow Selecting a game they are asked whether they wish to accept it If they do the buy in sum of tokens is removed from their Wallet and the game page is displayed According to the type of game the user then completes the requirements immediately or over the time allotted by the game If the game is several days long a countdown timer is displayed after completion showing the time remaining until the next day\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is available The user can invite friends to join the same game The user can view the feed of content submitted to the game and in some challenges help determine the winner by voting for the submission they like Once the game is complete the user receives all the reward tokens due them to their Wallet They may also receive virtual or real prizes and be informed how to collect them The user can join several challenges at once 14 \x0cUpcoming features Giphy integration (as GIFs are an extremely popular means of communicating emotions) Game leaderboard (to see where they rank and compare to their friends) Photo editing (filters adding text etc ) Simplified profile sharing (to show friends or to invite them and earn tokens) Geofilters Teaming up with other users to complete games (earning more tokens) Facial recognition (earn additional tokens for every additional person in the photo) Daily tokens (rewarding users for returning to the app every day) Sharing tokens (follow someone to send and receive tokens) Reporting users (reporting unsuitable content or behavior) Community moderation (earn tokens by helping moderate user content) 15 \x0cTechnical APP description SWACE is deployed on the cloud Its backend is containerized and built using microservices The use of microservices has lots of benefits such as faster development cycles scalability resilience cloud friendliness and high availability (with close to zero downtime) Security is guaranteed by the proper use of cloud infrastructure Due to the nature of microservices SWACE is not tied to any language or technology so we chose the right tools to do the right job Utilizing the freedom that the use of microservices gives us we chosen a handful of latest and most secure techstack including but not limited to PHP 7 2 and Laravel The SWACE social network is backed by a distributed graph database solution Security ENcription Security is one of our main concerns Correctly configuring cloud services allows us to reach the desired security levels at the infrastructure level Database encryption guarantees that personal user data is safe and secure Our production environment will be handled by an automated workflow meaning that our code is deployed automatically and nobody has (or indeed needs) access to the nodes running that code The requests made to the public API are encrypted while internal requests (requests between microservices) fall under a private network which does not have access to the internet Private key Elastic API SWACE antcipates highload and its API is ready for it The SWACE team had this in mind from the very beginning while building an elastc API Elastc meaning highly available easily scalable and extendable SWACE API has a handful of integratons planned ahead currently at the beta preview stage we will have two APIs integrated Facebook Instagram Mobile first approach high load While SWACE will have a public self service website for the end user initially it will be mobile first We have already built native Android & iOS apps These are already available for testing in a closed beta group and will be available soon in both the iOS App Store and Google Play Store With a help of our elastic API push notifications and well designed UI these apps will guarantee the best realtime user experience Real time 16 \x0cBlockchain application Blockchain implementation predictions In the modern world where digital communication is rapidly becoming as important as live interaction and where people are increasingly wary of centralized power the natural direction for technology and finance to take is towards a crypto economy based on blockchain technology whose main pillars are transparency and decentralization However blockchain in its current form is not universally applicable Its dependence on fees for every transaction makes it practically unscalable to platforms built around micropayments as users are unprepared to be charged for every action they perform on the platform Besides the transaction speeds available now are unacceptable for a micropayment scenario This means that projects such as Swace which wish to be decentralized but are based on micropayments must find third part solutions for adapting blockchain to their needs The first issue to grapple with when launching such a project is whether to create a new blockchain or select an existing one For Swace the answer is the latter We have selected to base our platform on the application layer of the Ethereum blockchain The reasons for this are centered mainly on resource management Blockchain is a complex technology and developing one from scratch would require a significant investment of time work and funds whereas Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain is ready and functioning with a well developed infrastructure and a plethora of third party solutions already supporting its tokens which enables a variety of integrations Furthermore Ethereum has already earned global trust and influence which it lends to the businesses that use it It is also flexible \xe2\x80\x93 its language is easy enough to learn that it can be adapted to smart contracts as complex or straightforward as needed The bottom line is that Ethereum is wellestablished and we can rely on it However Ethereum like other blockchains suffers from limitations in speed and high fees for low value transactions This is caused by its running on a proof of work (PoW) protocol It is well known in the blockchain community that Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s developers are currently at work on two scaling solutions known as Casper and Sharding Casper will be a tool designed to convert Ethereum from PoW to proof of stake (PoS) This will make the currencies using it vastly more cost effective As PoS protocols are less protected from malicious miners Casper will implement additional validation and security measures This will enable true decentralization as opposed to the current situation when in fact most of the power is held in the hands of several large mining groups and collusion is a real danger 17 \x0cAs for Sharding the notion arises from database technology In that field sharding means dividing a database horizontally into smaller more manageable databases while still retaining the original structure Translated to blockchain this will mean that the chain will be partitioned into smaller shards of nodes where each shard will retain full functionality while carrying its own responsibility This will mean that the technology will become subject to scaling Until these tools are developed however Swace will have to use other solutions We will use Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s ERC20 token standard to create the SWACE token The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum network like wallets development tools and exchanges and it is supported by the third party solutions we will implement to complete the Swace infrastructure and build a decentralized economy With the ERC20 tokens in place we will launch Swace\xe2\x80\x99s beta DApp on the basis of Ethereum blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s application layer and implement games created as smart contracts The verification of these games will be based on crowd votes and we will seek to achieve full automation of the games Having analyzed the use case scenarios of up to 100 000 users we will continue to develop and scale our infrastructure using such tools as Raiden Raiden\xe2\x80\x99s off chain framework would be a great solution to implement low fee fast and private transactions including micropayments Although the off chain solution is not truly decentralized it will allow us to complete the Swace infrastructure and give added value to our services until Casper PoS and Sharding arrive In addition the Plasma framework (in development by the Ethereum team) will ensure that smart contracts are implemented correctly within the infrastructure and possibly Bancor (a decentralized liquidity network supporting ERC20 tokens) or another solution will provide continuous liquidity for the SWACE token With these solutions in place we will already be able to create a decentralized app with a fully usable secure and reliable economy even while waiting for more advanced technology to become available We know what technology we intend to create and we realize the problems and limitations we are facing True there is currently no single solution available to satisfy all of our platform\xe2\x80\x99s needs many things will need to be researched developed and implemented Yet we believe that even now our goal of delivering a blockchain based product is achievable through the use of the tools we have identified Application on the platform The actual implementation of blockchain on our platform as we envision it will be based on the premise that every participant of the platform has their own Wallet There is an administrative Wallet for economy balancing purposes (should no tokens be available on offer the administrative Wallet automatically generates sale offers from its funds) each brand has its Wallet and so does each Swacer 18 \x0cWhen a brand sets a challenge a smart contract is created stipulating conditions for its execution The brand invests some tokens from its Wallet into the smart contract where they are sealed In order to participate users also contribute to the smart contract from their own Wallets Together these form the game\xe2\x80\x99s reward fund with a small part set aside for network costs Once a game is set community moderation comes into play Moderators are users with additional permissions they are the ones who ensure that the content submitted by the game participants matches the conditions set by the brand The moderator\xe2\x80\x99s reliability is verified and unreliable behavior sanctioned via their Wallet The content having passed the conditions and the community moderation the game is executed and with it \xe2\x80\x93 its smart contract The reward fund is then distributed among the participants who have matched the conditions set by the brand Reasons for creating our own coin To have a stable economy in which the proportion of tokens vs participants and games remains sustainable To ensure a sufficient quantity of tokens for onboarding new users and expanding the community To ensure further development according to our tech roadmap as our technical goals are quite advanced there must be room for flexibility in decision making such as changing the technologies implemented or migrating to a different blockchain 19 \x0cEthereum network ICO SWACE

\x0cWHY The problem Focus group Social media engagement Social media trends worldwide Reward efficiency Habit formation Winner effect The purpose of this section is to show the reasons why we created this app It tells the story of how we came up with the app describing the problems we have observed and wish to solve In addition we have collected here a review of the psychological factors in play We believe that these factors will contribute to the success of the app \x0cThe problem Digital engagement does not work Social media has been a massive worldwide success Social media marketing has not Social media promised brands a lot but is delivering little Impressions have to be bought 2% Facebook organic reach for brand pages Hubspot 2016 Yet regular engagement is scarce 7/1000 of a brand\xe2\x80\x99s followers will clock a boosted Facebook post SmartInsights 2017 Resulting in low ROI 80% of CMOs are unable to quantify the value of their social media efforts TheCMOSurvey August 2016 US Brands are left to rely on low engagement solutions passive content (static and video posts) contests (one off deals for sharing a brand\xe2\x80\x99s post) The alternatives are expensive even for big brands and entirely unreachable for small ones The problems of digital engagement can be solved Swace enables brands to engage their users in a real and meaningful way The users remain in touch with the brand keep it in mind for a while actively interact with it and develop positive associations with it Unlike passively consumed (and often annoying) advertising here the brand becomes the source of rewards and exciting pastimes When the game is long enough the user can even begin forming a habit of interacting with the brand 24 \x0cMarket comparison Given the problem described above we turned to the market to see what solutions were available for increasing user/brand engagement especially those with a focus on social gaming and/or rewards Swace Geocaching Swarm Pokemon

Yes (non(nonmonetary) monetary) Yes Having concluded from this that not all needs were currently answered in any one product we continued our market research by running a focus group We wished to see if the potential consumers were aware of the problems we had identified and saw our suggested solution as desirable 25 \x0cFocus group In order to substantiate the above findings and investigate their applicability to our situation we ran focus groups with 10 participants aged 20 23 These were young professionals characterized by their sociability and relatively active lifestyle who all own smart devices and use social media extensively We asked them about their social networking habits their satisfaction with existing networks and their opinions about a potential new network offering the features we had in mind for Swace 90 percent of respondents expressed interest in such an app 60 percent going as far as to state that they \xe2\x80\x9cwould definitely play especially if some of my favorite brands were involved\xe2\x80\x9d They were especially excited about the possibility of games involving their favorite sneaker and clothing brands as well as car sharing and healthy lifestyle games (including team sports) Only ten percent of respondents expressed uncertainty expressing the overall sentiment that such an app would only be interesting if the games were updated regularly and not repetitive Others agreed it was very important to keep the games varied and exciting The respondents described their current experience with social networking apps as satisfactory overall with several frustrating factors such as over curation (\xe2\x80\x9cnothing is genuine anymore\xe2\x80\x9d) and the sense of being manipulated and exploited by the larger networks (\xe2\x80\x9ceveryone is obsessed with likes and shares so much so that one can feel like just a number\xe2\x80\x9d) They felt that they had almost become goods by being exposed to so much advertising as though corporations were making money simply from their presence regardless of the content they created or the opinions they expressed A more personal approach would be welcome they said 26 \x0cWhy join as a user You receive rewards in the shape of cryptocurrency and other prizes for the things you do and the content you create And you get the first reward simply for registering You no longer have to put up with the exploitation and censorship of Facebook and other mainstream social networks You are not a number and you do not need to be bombarded with ads You can engage with brands you like be rewarded for the interactions and even become an influencer by sharing with your friends and introducing them to the brand You can have new and exciting things to do exciting new technologies to try and fun ways to change up your routine Why contribute There will be many ways to use the coin within the ecosystem to reward others for good photos to join games to exchange for partner goods to give to friends etc The product is ready and will be launched in its first market as soon as July 2019 Contracts have been signed with 17 international companies which all believe in Swace Why initiate a game This is an opportunity to truly engage with customers through innovative games that cut through the background noise of overwhelming advertising A possibility to form user habits and positive associations with your brand An excellent way to naturally communicate your brand through influencers and recommendations as users generate content for the branded games and share it with their friends 27 \x0csocial media engagement statistics Social media has traditionally been considered a strong tool for brands to grow community engagement and user loyalty However the tool is far from perfect and is proving difficult to navigate With social networks constantly updating their algorithms and users developing mistrust for the information to which they are exposed online brands find that the efficiency of their social media advertising is no longer satisfactory To begin with according to recent surveys the percentage of brands that believe they are able to measure the efficiency of their investment into traditional advertising is decreasing every year \xe2\x80\x93 from 42 percent in 2015 (already quite a low percentage) to 38 percent in 2017 If the ROI is impossible to measure it becomes doubtful that the large budgets allocated for social media advertising are justified Do brands believe they can measure SM ROI According to socialexaminer com survey 40 30 20 10 0 Definitely yes Yes Unsure No Definitely no Specifically the largest player in the field Facebook is difficult to quantify in terms of effectiveness as its latest algorithms prevent most of the content published by brands from being displayed to users and users are not too delighted with the way information gets filtered and manipulated When asked whether they believed their Facebook marketing efforts were effective only 42 percent responded in the positive This number also decreased (by 4 percent in just one year) Most marketers responded either that they did not know (going back to the issue of ROI measurement) or that they believed their Facebook marketing to be ineffective 28 \x0cThe marketers were further asked whether they had experienced decreased exposure in Facebook news feeds in the past 12 years An impressive combined number of 95 percent were either certain of a decrease (53%) or unsure either way (42%) Meanwhile Gallup reports that social media has no effect on most Americans\xe2\x80\x99 purchasing decisions and it seems that people of all ages and origins overwhelmingly prefer the recommendations of their acquaintances to social media advertising when it comes to making a purchase And yet given the fact that per Nielsen reports adults over 18 years of age spend between six and seven hours a week on average using social media it is unsurprising that companies persist in trying to use social media as an advertising tool however they are looking to optimize the experience and improve the ROI they are seeing Swace aims to address this need by offering a new way for brands and users to interact through a new kind of social media which does not leave room for the information to be manipulated and in which the brand gets its message across by stimulating the users to generate their own content making it easier for other users to trust it Percent of respondents who completely or somewhat trust advertising format by generation and regions

million selfies every day At the same time Time carried out an interesting experiment ranking the world\xe2\x80\x99s top selfie taking cities Manhattan took second place with 202 selfie takers per 100 000 people but Makati City the financial capital of the Philippines was the runaway winner with 258 out of 100 000 The list included cities on every continent showing the universal appeal of the self shot photo The selfie is especially popular with the millennials a generation born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s Apparently the average millennial may take up to 25 700 selfies in their lifetime Given that each selfie is estimated to take around seven minutes that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of time spent shooting and editing self portraits every week According to some statistics the median age of the selfie taker is 23 7 and most of them are female Most of the selfies are snapped with the intention of being published on social media and the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of them go directly to Facebook followed by Whatsapp Twitter Instagram and Snapchat At the same time the percentages within the networks are different notably 74 percent of Snapchat posts are selfies The very fact that so much research is dedicated to the selfie these days reflects the increased importance and validation that society grants to this phenomenon The findings prove the universality of the effect The self shot photos may be different in different corners of the world (apparently in Bangkok and Sao Paulo people tend to smile in selfies but not in Moscow) \xe2\x80\x93 but they are popular everywhere 30 \x0creward efficiency The reason why rewards are effective is that the human brain is wired to seek out rewards and quickly learns behaviors which lead to being rewarded The reward system in neuroscience is a set of brain structures responsible for positive emotions (especially those involving pleasure) and for reward related cognition The latter consists of the ways the brain interprets rewards the way it can be conditioned to seek out certain experiences as rewarding and motivations associated with craving rewards The three primary functions of rewards are as follows They produce associative learning i e positive reinforcement through rewards can be used to condition people to behave in certain ways Associations can be formed between certain things or situations and rewards They have an effect on decision making as people seek out further rewards and make choices based on their desires They cause pleasure Extrinsic rewards (meaning such external things as wealth or appreciation as opposed to internal needs such as food and water) do not directly affect the brain\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure centers by producing dopamine Rather they become rewarding as a result of learned association with intrinsic rewards (e g money can purchase food) They are linked with the \xe2\x80\x9cdesire\xe2\x80\x9d component of the reward system and cause appetitive (actively seeking out satisfaction for a certain need) and anticipatory (basing current actions on the prediction of future rewards) behavior Wolfram Schulz (Department of Physiology Development and Neuroscience University of Cambridge) writes Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward Although it provides a good definition positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions Rewards are attractive They are motivating and make us exert an effort Rewards induce approach behavior also called appetitive or preparatory behavior and consummatory behavior Thus any stimulus object event activity or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward 31 \x0cIncentive salience \xe2\x80\x93 a process in which an attribute of \xe2\x80\x9cdesire\xe2\x80\x9d is conferred to some sort of stimulus \xe2\x80\x93 is helpful in establishing associations between extrinsic and intrinsic rewards In other words although a certain experience may not be physiologically rewarding in and of itself yet an individual can be taught to associate it with one or more of the activities that directly affect the brain\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure centers Once an association has been established successfully the individual is then more likely to seek out the experience in order to repeat the rewarding sensations It is known that once a reward has been attained it becomes even more desirable in the eyes of the individual as they already know that they are capable of reaching the reward and the consequent pleasure that it provides Professor of Marketing at Wharton and UCLA Xavier Dreze published findings in the Journal of Marketing Research with Joseph Nunes Professor of Marketing at Marshall School of Business University of Southern California where they found that members who successfully attained a reward exhibited increased effort and drive in subsequent attempts to reach a goal meaning that a reward based brand interaction is likely to cause positive associations with the brand and therefore increase brand loyalty 32 \x0cHabit formation Although it is common to interpret the word \xe2\x80\x98habit\xe2\x80\x99 as simply any behavior that repeats itself frequently the actual psychological definition is \xe2\x80\x98actions that are triggered automatically in response to contextual cues that have been associated with their performance\xe2\x80\x99 In other words the context of our lives causes us to do things we have been trained to do in certain circumstances The action of washing our hands is prompted by the contextual cue of using the bathroom \xe2\x80\x93 not because we consciously think about it every time but because we have learned to associate the cue with the action and it has become automatic The learning process according to extensive psychological research consists of repeating a certain action in the same context several times until the action becomes dependent on the contextual cues and stops being conscious or requiring motivation Thus a child may need a colorful toothbrush and flavored toothpaste to encourage her to brush her teeth but an adult does it automatically when they get up in the morning or prepare for bedtime (contextual cues) Unlike conscious intention which takes up mental resources and requires some cognitive effort habits are regulated by impulse in the familiar context Learning a habit therefore frees up mental capacity for new or more complicated activities The process of learning involves methodically transferring the beginning of an action from conscious motivated effort to a stable impulsive association with a certain cue For marketing purposes this means that habit formation can be beneficial for brands if consumers can be taught to automatically associate certain circumstances with the brand\xe2\x80\x99s product (for example reaching for a certain brand of soft drink when they are having lunch or heading for a certain store when they are in need of something) As the learning process is centered around repetition Swace\xe2\x80\x99s engagement frames requiring the user to return to a certain place or perform a certain action for several days in sequence contribute to the formation of a habit associated with the brand accompanied by the positive reinforcement of a reward 33 \x0cWINNER EFFECT A well known phenomenon in biology \xe2\x80\x9cthe winner effect\xe2\x80\x9d is partially based on the findings of the renowned psychologist David McLelland who identified three largely unconscious primary motivators of human behavior The need for achievement The need for affiliation The need for power These are the drivers that motivate both our personal and professional lives though if they do not match up with our lifestyle they can also hinder it Both the ill effects and the benefits caused by the motivators cause changes in our brains making us either less or more mentally sharp susceptible to stress and prone to repeating certain behaviors An example of the benefit of such motivators is known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe winner effect\xe2\x80\x9d It is known that an animal which defeats an opponent in a confrontation is more likely to continue facing other opponents and in fact becomes primed to continue coming out of the battles victorious The animal\xe2\x80\x99s body chemistry undergoes changes making it able to face increasingly strong enemies The changes that happen in the animal\xe2\x80\x99s body have to do with a self reinforcing osmosis between the key hormones pertaining to success and failure \xe2\x80\x93 testosterone (which causes euphoria and a tendency to take risks) and cortisol (which has to do with timidity) Wall Street trader turned Cambridge University neuroscientist John Coates writes in The Hour Between Dog and Wolf Risk Taking Gut Feelings and the Biology of Boom and Bust Biologists studying animals in the field had noticed that an animal winning a fight or a competition for turf was more likely to win its next fight This phenomenon had been observed in a large number of species Such a finding raised the possibility that the mere act of winning contributes to further wins But before biologists could draw such a conclusion they had to consider a number of alternative explanations For example maybe an animal keeps winning simply because it is physically larger than its rivals 34 \x0cTo rule out possibilities such as this biologists constructed controlled experiments in which they pitted animals that were equally matched in size or rather that were equally matched in what is called \xe2\x80\x98resource holding potential \xe2\x80\x99 in other words the total physical resources \xe2\x80\x94 muscular metabolic cardiovascular \xe2\x80\x94 an animal can draw on in an all out fight They also controlled for motivations because a small hungry animal eating a carcass can successfully chase off a larger well fed animal Yet even when animals were evenly matched for size (or resources) and motivation a pure winner effect nonetheless emerged For instance in one study a database of 630 000 professional tennis matches was examined showing that the winner of the first set had a 60 percent chance of winning the next one This shows the efficiency of a game based user experience as when users observe that the games bring them rewards they will not only be motivated to continue taking part in them (due to the natural competitive nature of most humans and the pleasure of earning a reward) but also unconsciously primed to do well in consecutive tasks which in turn will lead to habit formation and very likely cause the users to associate the positive sensations that arise from testosterone spikes with the brands setting the games 35 \x0cHOW Marketing strategy 3 pillars Core values This section is here to explain how Swace works From our marketing and core values to the way we plan to implement blockchain technologies this is where we show our work and share our methods \x0cMarketing strategy Unique selling proposition For users You do not have to feel like a statistic or a number that is for sale when using social networks You can get rewarded for the things that you do and the content you create You can spend your time with your friends in fun new ways You can become an influencer and be rewarded for engaging with brands For businesses This is an opportunity to truly engage with customers through innovative games that cut through the background noise of overwhelming advertising A possibility to form user habits and positive associations with your brand An excellent way to naturally communicate your brand through influencers and recommendations as users generate content for the branded games and share it with their friends Let\xe2\x80\x99s analyze this from the 5P perspective Product Price Outstanding innovative proven to spark interest in potential users Already developed and working Pricing is formed according to market size platform popularity and amount of users Place Promotion Distribution channels (more brands swapping Swace coins for their goods) Marketing mix of ATL and BTL with particular emphasis on certain BTL activities with digital and offline activities based on market formed habits People Three groups of people are involved in the process 1) our professional team that makes it all happen 2) a clearly identified target audience 3) businesses that want to engage this target audience 37 \x0cDuring the IEO Beta mode (releasing alpha product to get feedback and onboard first users) crowdfunding (used both to raise $ and get first users) After the IEO Market acquisition with the specifics of each market in mind Some of the marketing tactics we intend to use include ripples (using influencers) fanfare (big expensive actions) riddles (immersive experience across different platforms where the public has to solve clues in order to reveal the product or win a prize) alienation (presenting the product in an entirely unexpected situation) star prize (once in a lifetime prize to get more people to participate in the launch) zeitgeist (capturing the mood of nation and acting accordingly) Expectations regarding amount of users onboarding over time New innovations/technologies usually apply the E Rogers diffusion process curve in order to predict their diffusion into society Our innovation is more likely to adapt significantly faster as most of its features are already well known to the public and even desirable Potential to acquire users (timing) 2 5% Innovators 13 5% Early adopters 34% Early majority 34% Late majority 16% Laggards Of course much depends on market formed habits Some markets adopt new ideas faster others reject them outright 38 \x0cPartnership strategy We are looking for partnerships that enable us to increase the scale of the project First deals for challenges have already been reached and signed with world leaders in retail telecommunications beverages technologies et al The deal is premium game entrance where the brand undertakes to promote the game via its existing communication channels so that its followers are attracted to the app Attract users by offering only high quality content and fun games with attractive rewards \xe2\x80\x93 according to the research we have done (starting with most desireable brand games and rewards in each market) Choose partners for every step of the way out of market leaders in the respective fields in order to make every action as efficient and effective as possible The network effect is key for Swace as the greater the number of users the more the value of the product will increase We will have to work hard on both supply and demand side to onboard more users and make our product more valuable 39 \x0c3

own charity 41 \x0cHOW MUCH Payment token Token distribution Budget allocation Here we balance the books and show you the bottom line In this section we present the economy of the app the tokens and how they work We have included our projections of the project\xe2\x80\x99s budget and explained how we are going to use the money we hope to raise \x0cPayment token Swace token is used for a store of value of means of payment in other words a unit of account Payment tokens (synonymous with cryptocurrencies) are tokens which are intended to be used now or in the future as a means of payment for acquiring goods or services or as a means of money or value transfer Cryptocurrencies give rise to no claims on their issuer which in this case is Swace SWACE tokens are not considered securities Security tokens represent assets such as a debt or equity claim on the issuer Security tokens promise for example a share in future company earnings or future capital flows In terms of their economic function therefore these tokens are analogous to equities bonds or derivatives The individuals purchasing Swace tokens during their distribution will not acquire the right to receive passive income Swace tokens will be received only for active participation and completion of games Individuals purchasing Swace tokens during their distribution will obtain the tokens at a discounted price yet the purchase of greater amounts of tokens at an earlier time should not be considered passive income Accordingly the Swace tokens should not be considered securities SWACE tokens are not utility tokens Utility tokens are tokens which are intended to provide access digitally to a service by means of a blockchain based infrastructure and offer owners a clearly defined utility within a network It is not the case for Swace either We will create an ecosystem where the participant will be able to pay for the participation in the game and purchase Swace partners goods It should not be regarded that the token owner has acquired a service from the Swace company and now has a claim but rather that they have purchased a means of payment for further purchase of goods and services in the ecosystem 43
