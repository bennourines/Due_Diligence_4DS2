2018 3 Abstract Cryptocurrency markets are so vibrant and eventful nowadays that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to keep track of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with every single coin Crypto traders pour large amounts of effort and time into interpreting charts in different ways reading forums and Twitter feeds and gathering information about coins from other sources in attempts to predict market trends and make profitable trades Crypto markets are volatile making the task even harder Shilling and other forms of disinformation (like spreading FUD \xe2\x80\x94 fear uncertainty disorder) or even just false promises from coin developers quite often stop traders on their quest for profit \x0cCryptoPing White Paper January 2018 4 Problem In 2017 a sharp surge of new crypto traders is boosting trading volumes and rates of almost every alternative cryptocurrency (altcoins) and Bitcoin itself That also makes prices of some altcoins more volatile than before while constantly growing Bitcoin price keeps increasing traders\xe2\x80\x99 stress levels Bitcoin is losing its share in total crypto market capitalization despite of its increasing value Market capitalizations of some altcoins has already exceeded hundreds of millions of dollars and that\xe2\x80\x99s only the beginning It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to factor in all the trends events and subtleties that shape markets Making a good trade can be difficult even for experienced traders let alone newcomers New traders don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize market trends and can\xe2\x80\x99t make good trading decisions For people who just have started to trade cryptocurrencies the \xe2\x80\x9cwhat to buy\xe2\x80\x9d problem is important now more than ever \x0cCryptoPing White Paper January 2018 5 Solution CryptoPing offers a solution \xe2\x80\x94 an assistant bot that can hint that market situation changes and it might be a good time to buy a certain crypto asset Bot employs market watching and analysis algorithms that are already tested and verified in practice Users can easily sign up and activate the bot and start to get signals from exchanges right away Being experienced or new trader no user gets any advantage over other bot users because all users receive all signals at the time It\xe2\x80\x99s up to traders to weigh the market in signals\xe2\x80\x99 context and make all trading decisions by themselves To cover most of the devices and platforms and deliver signals on time we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to use messengers Everyone uses them anyway so the solution to signal delivery platform is already there the bot looks to users just like another chat contact The bot has all necessary commands to manage notifications and the interface is friendly enough even for people who have no prior experience with bots or trading Bot signals look simple yet have just right amount of information despite of complex inner works of the service itself Users receive signal messages that include \xe2\x80\x94 coin ticker \xe2\x80\x94 link to an exchange that produced the signal \xe2\x80\x94 trading volume difference for the last hour \xe2\x80\x94 change to the coin rate to BTC \xe2\x80\x94 amount of signals on the coin for the last 7 days \xe2\x80\x94 coin market capitalization value in USD This information proved to be sufficient to decide at a glance whether to look into a signaled coin All further analysis has to be performed by traders and the result will depend on their experience interests and goals Additionally we\xe2\x80\x99re building a platform for social trading that will be useful to both new and experienced traders Pro traders will be able to publish their trading results by signals daily and new traders will be able to follow pros and copy their trades for a small subscription fee \x0cCryptoPing White Paper January 2018 6 Project Project core has several parts that are responsible for \xe2\x80\x94 market data being assembled individually by coin \xe2\x80\x94 situation and trend analysis by coin \xe2\x80\x94 looking for similar coin behavior in the past \xe2\x80\x94 making decisions on signal initiation \xe2\x80\x94 generating signals and tracking their results \xe2\x80\x94 sending signals to users \xe2\x80\x94 analyzing signal quality and providing feedback for decision making system The Telegram bot is a separate part of the project integrated with the core Slack and Discord bot are available Being able to switch between signal delivery platforms is equally important for users and us the team because recent messenger bans by governments in different countries raise all kinds of concerns We have plans to release a standalone application that will receive bot signals much like messenger apps The application will be integrated with the system core more closely allowing us to develop automatic trading functionality that will be a lot less vulnerable to hacking than existing server based trading apps \x0cCryptoPing White Paper January 2018 7 Future Early bot adopters have already discovered the quality and utility of bot signals There are about one thousand of altcoins out there nobody can track everything and the bot works just right there are numerous cases when it sent signals right before a coin pump or even long before that At the moment CryptoPing is just a bot that helps with tracking price movements and coin pumps on several exchanges We want it to evolve into a platform where every beginner in crypto markets can get necessary information and community support and start trading quickly When we say \xe2\x80\x9csupport\xe2\x80\x9d we mean online tutorials following experienced traders that secure from most of risky trades and market situation coverage that is actually on point We also have plans to develop an auto trading app that will be released only after system algorithms are meticulously re tested and optimized We want auto trading to work in fireand forget mode and are looking forward to delivering steady profits to our users We are concerned that users without deep enough technical knowledge provide third party trading services with API keys from their accounts on exchanges When third party services get hacked the perpetrators gain access to users\xe2\x80\x99 API keys and start trading to their benefit using accounts of others while regular users just lose assets We will not store any keys on CryptoPing servers thus accessing them by hacking our systems will be impossible All API keys will be stored on users\xe2\x80\x99 devices only and won\xe2\x80\x99t be transmitted to CryptoPing services at all \x0cCryptoPing White Paper January 2018 8 Token and Subscription Name CryptoPing Ticker PING Initial supply 10 000 000 Platform Waves We have chosen Waves platform for a reason A lot of CryptoPing users are either new to crypto markets or to trading in general and we want our token to work on a simple platform that is easy to understand and use while Waves are very welcoming towards new people in crypto community We believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s more important to grow the community than to race technologies and win blockchain coolness competitions Subscriptions
