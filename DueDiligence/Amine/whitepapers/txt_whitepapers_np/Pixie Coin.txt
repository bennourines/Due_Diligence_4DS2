given theme such as the game which can be a representative MMPRPG In the future artificial intelligence computer graphics and human computer interface will be more combined with each other to achieve the migration of human beings to the virtual world Without a so called center and border we can go beyond time and space limitations in the virtual world Therefore the trading of all kinds of virtual goods can get rid of the real \xe2\x80\x98physical transferring\xe2\x80\x99 The Blockchain technology supports the \xe2\x80\x98transferring of ownership\xe2\x80\x99 of virtual goods The substantial transfer of \xe2\x80\x98ownership\xe2\x80\x99 of virtual props within the game and virtual currency used by social networks can be done through blockchain accounting We hope to develop a smart agreement to serve the trading of virtual goods so that in the future we can gain the legal rights of all virtual goods which lack \xe2\x80\x98entities\xe2\x80\x99 We must base on the present and focus on the future and we have realized that as the post 90s and 00s growing up they have subverted the traditional consumption cognition about virtual goods Especially in the field of games all kinds of skins and props come out endlessly and the pure virtual goods have come into the mainstream consumers\xe2\x80\x99 eyes Among a variety of games we have chosen the ACG dressing game which has great potential as the starting point in order to enable the rapid landing decentralized games to become the first user of virtual commodity trading agreement \x0c1 2 ACG dressing games The two dimensional anime which referred to the \xe2\x80\x98sub element\xe2\x80\x99 works in ACG\ s work usually means the fantasy world in the work and its assemblage of various elements The game derived from these sub elements is a ACG game Since 2015 the two dimensional games have become a hit in the world and also making the field been widely concerned Thus a great number of games produced from China\ s have stepped on the world stage and achieved very good results Among various two dimensional games dressing game is a total new kind It allows the users to collect massive game customs to match and unlock the plot by finishing every mission to make games progress Users need to pay for customs or get limited customs by lottery These games are based on a wide range of users Compared with the traditional games these games cost less and have high DAU The average amount of money each user spends on the game is not too much However due to the wide audience these games cover almost the entire female group and some male groups and the income is still very impressive 1 3 The trouble of ACG dressing games Although the ACG dressing games obtain a large quantity of users it has some problems including containing too much original contents too long devoted time many customs difficulty in collecting customs and some users cannot pay for it Thus the churn of users is increasing Set the partner Pixie Wardrobe as an example ACG dressing games are facing the following problems a Centralized plot design At present the majority of two dimensional games designing based on the idea of mission finishing model While it is steady this kind of model also kills the imagination of players and make players must repeat the \x0coperations on settled plot mechanically which ought to be full of autonomy And this could easily lose the lasting playing motion of users b Centralized profiting model The only way to make money for existing dressing games is from players\xe2\x80\x99 topping up To attract more players recharge the game has a strict hierarchy which means only players with a high spending can complete the collection While this affects the game experience and the sustainable development of the game a lot c Plagiarism To solve the problem of the low engagement of the players the Pixie Wardrobe designed and introduced a \xe2\x80\x98designer\xe2\x80\x99 model which means the players can design clothes by themselves and upload clothes pictures to the server This kind of model attracted many loyal users and have brought new experience to them However original IP goes hand in hand with the plagiarism issue Plagiarism can be roughly divided into two types 1 Pirates of well known anime or game\ s character image 2 Pirates of unauthorized material on the Internet and used as his own clothing handle map In the Pixie Wardrobe operation process there have been game designers who imitated the figures\xe2\x80\x99 clothes of well known online games Jian Wang III and was complained by Xishanju and the designer\xe2\x80\x99s account had to be locked There also have been players who stolen the business patterns of Taobao brand Lolita\xe2\x80\x99s as a handle map of their own clothing The shopkeepers had to protect their rights and the designer have to apologize on blog Centralized audit system cannot solve the problem of missing fish In fact no matter how rich the experience of auditors it is impossible to stop copying works \x0c2 Program introduction 2 1 Pixie Shopping Street We will cooperate with the game Pixie Wardrobe to redevelop a decentralized APP Pixie Shopping Street \xe2\x80\x98Pixie Shopping Street\xe2\x80\x99 is a simulation operation dressing game based on UGC mode output content Each player\xe2\x80\x99s main game interface will be a shopping streets map in which there is a player\xe2\x80\x99s own clothing store a designer office (for trading design draft) a garment factory the remaining six locations can be rented to other players to open clothing store The game interface also includes a voting window and a plot design window In the Pixie Shopping Street players can have different identities At the same time they can utilize different rights and gain corresponding rewards for each status \xe2\x80\x98Pixie Shopping Street\xe2\x80\x99 will also access the offline clothing brands and the popular design will not only appear in the \xe2\x80\x98Pixie Shopping Mall\xe2\x80\x99 after the voting of the players in the mall other clothing brands can also access the game participating in the auction and making some gorgeous design goes real Details of the Pixie shopping street will be introduced in the \xe2\x80\x98Ecology Construction\xe2\x80\x99 section of this chapter 2 2 Solutions The confirmation of massive design blueprints At present plagiarism is the most common problem among original creators which has also been criticized a lot Currently original creators in Pixie Wardrobe have uploaded 120 000 blueprints in Chinese mainland and 70 000 drawing sheets in Korea (the number is increasing steadily) However these original works are easily to be plagiarized Analyzing the color of pictures on particular applications and ranking the colored part of each picture by percentage we can get a unique color code for each picture which means the color parameter Besides we have designed a set of algorithms for this process Thus we can set up the color parameter time bound and author \x0csignature to protect the rights of original inventors The rights of all works can be employed and traced by intelligent contracts Color parameter Sample = xlnRed + ylnYellow + zlnBlue Among them x y z respectively represents the proportion of the three colors that occupying the highest proportion in a certain picture Take the examples of red yellow and blue for an example if the Sample parameters in the two pictures are exactly the same the similarity is quite high The design blueprint automatically enters the audit routine tasks which will be voted by players through the smart contract The mass jury composed of hundreds of players is far more capable of identifying plagiarism than one or two central auditors Reward designers better Pixie Wardrobe currently has more than twenty thousand designers We passionately hope that designers in the game not only enjoy the fun of the game and the happiness of sharing but also gaining the value of sharing At present each design draft uploaded by designers which is approved can be displayed in the designer mall of the game The designer who ranks high on the purchase volume list will receive a physical gift After the introduction of blockchain technology designers will obtain PixieCoin directly through the way of smart contracts which will further arouse everyone\ s passion for creation and have potential to create a virtuous circle PixieCoin can also be consumed directly in the game As the only currency in the Pixie shopping street it has all the services that the \xe2\x80\x98diamond\xe2\x80\x99 plus \xe2\x80\x98gold\xe2\x80\x99 system stands for To solve the lack of engagement of ordinary users According to the introduction of \xe2\x80\x98Pixie Wardrobe\xe2\x80\x99 project team except the designers the main driving force of ordinary players in the game is the plot and collect clothing clearance and do not participate as much as designers Through the establishment of \xe2\x80\x98Pixie Shopping Street\xe2\x80\x99 set designers can outsource the \xe2\x80\x98production and sales \xe2\x80\x98of apparel to ordinary players so that every player can fully enjoy the fun of the game \x0cBuild a long term incentive mechanism The similarity among design works is mainly subjective Introducing the blockchain technology we can ensure the rights of design manuscripts in the system but other material from outside cannot be confirmed till now The game will also launch a set of decentralized audit daily tasks after a new design draft is uploaded it will undergo at least 200 audits to see if it is similar or highly like the previous one and whether it involves pornography and violence After passing the review it may still be possible to plagiarize unpopular works In this case there is also a report button in the game Any reported work will enter the pending trial again and undergo a second audit of over 200 persons based on the evidence provided by the informant If we can confirm the plagiarism of the designer his accounts will be frozen from a period to eternity Depending on the seriousness of the situation In addition to audit incentives and clothing design mechanism the biggest highlight of the Pixie Shopping Street will be the story plot creation entrance in the game Players can create their own game script by consuming a small amount of coins to upload the script to the terminal And the player can vote to choose a good script The selected script will be converted to sub line story plot by the production team at a proper time The game setting of the sub line story plot will be accepted by the game authority and it can be used as supplement or \xe2\x80\x98surprise egg \xe2\x80\x99 of the main story Decentralized audit mechanism will also be introduced to story plot design part Real economy incentives In addition to online incentive mechanism \xe2\x80\x98Piexie Shopping Street\xe2\x80\x99 will also cooperate with some well known two dimensional clothing brands of Japan and Korea to make some popular design scripts within the game become true At the same time other apparel brands can also enter the system By consuming several PixieCoin they can bid for design scripts and the game platform will complete the benefits distribution through smart \x0ccontracts among platforms designers and apparel brands 2 3 Ecology construction Chart1 players group Designer office Designer office is a platform for the circulation of design drawings in the game Players can upload design drawings deal with second hand design drawings and participate in the auction of design blueprints Designers can use graphics software from a PC or mobile device to create their works and uploaded to the game server according to the rules after their finishing Purchase design scripts After passing the review there will be two kinds of pricing models for each design script One kind of price model is settled before purchasing the other can be discussed by the designer and buyers The former one means the price is clear and settled if you want to get it you must pay for it by that price For the latter one the designer will set a lowest price for their design draft (below this price they will not sell) then the scripts will enter the auction market \x0cChart2 bidirectional auction of design scripts For designers uploading design drawings can get Pixie coins Seeing his beloved creation gets everyone\ s approval and becomes a hit at the auction the designer will have more motivation to do it than \xe2\x80\x98brush copy\xe2\x80\x99 For ordinary players it is a perfect way to solve the problem that having no way but having willing to create By \xe2\x80\x98hiring\xe2\x80\x99 designers ordinary players can also get their own favorable clothing design drawings and settings and it is also friendly to collecting fans Pixie factory The player who has purchased the design draft can use the garment factory provided by the game and consume a certain amount of Pixie coins to make mass production of the draft design copies Other players who want to purchase this copy can only purchase from the holder of the design drafts The initial designer of the draft will receive Pixie coins as a reward from the sales profits Case one Player A spends 1 000 Pixie coins in buying Designer B\ s design script at a designer office and then sells his or her replicas to other players at a price of 3 Pixie coin giving each of the replicas 0 1 Pixie coin to Designer B \x0cPixie clothes store Personal clothes store is the core of every player\xe2\x80\x99s business Every player need to purchase design scrip and produce clothes to do business The essence of the player to make more money by buying the design draft is the visiting flux which can be divided into two parts First the design manuscript was shocked and popular everywhere thus everyone comes here to buy Second he has opened enough stores Each store will bring their own visitor flux Shops opened in the interface of others will make people who visit the interfaces become their potential customers Chart3 the conceptual map of game interface By operating own clothes store players can get Pixie coins These Pixie coins can be used to checking voting purchasing rare design script uploading design plan or script unlocking sub line game plot and social netting with other players Pixie theater We will offer players a total new virtual operation world by giving them attractive copy writing At the same time we will also connect with the physical \x0cworld and add different hot issues to the game to make players experience World Cup film festival music festival etc hot IP We will also introduce other popular games movies and other IP rights later to build a fantastic virtual world for the players Players can also create their own script The excellent scripts selected by players will set as the sub line story plot and accepted by the official game settings 2 4 Technology construction \xe2\x80\x98Pixie Shopping Street\xe2\x80\x99 will be based on Cocos2D X game engine to make game client server and the server uses high concurrency GO language The entire development process will gradually open sources in GitHub 2 5 Different participants With above setting players can own many identifications in the game and experience different game roles a Ordinary players Ordinary players mean players who do not participate in designing They can participate in the purchasing and reviewing voting and running their own clothes stores By devoting their time in community preservation they have become the consistent source for the community development In fact it\xe2\x80\x99s these massive ordinary players who make the Pixie Shopping Street ecology become true Players who made brilliant contribution can gain accumulated points and gain rewards from the system Ordinary players account for the biggest percentage and have become the most important part of Pixie Shopping Street We hope every player would enjoy the profits brought by decentralization b Designers \x0c\xe2\x80\x98Designer\xe2\x80\x99 means the player who provides the design works for \xe2\x80\x98Designer\ s Office\xe2\x80\x99 As a game mainly focusing on clothes operation the designer is the soul of the game We encourage everyone in the community to participate in the design while we will use blockchain technology to ensure that the designer\ s work would respected and the interests of the designer would not be violated c Small scriptwriter Small scriptwriter means player who provides script material for the Pixie theater They are engineers who make the Pixie shopping street up to date and energetic The sub line story plot created by small scriptwriters can be voted by all players and they can select the most popular game plot in the community This will form a virtuous circle in the community and the system will be able to create a copy of the plot fitting for the community players without purchasing d Clothes brands Clothing brand means clothes brands that Pixie Shopping Street expecting to acquire or already contracted

At present some countries in the world do not have a clear regulatory policy on the financing of blockchain projects and the public funding of digital tokens Thus there is a certain possibility for participants to undergo loss due to policy changes \x0c9 2 trading risk As a digital currency asset PixieCoin has extremely high transaction uncertainty Currently due to the lack of strong regulation in the field of digital asset transactions there is a risk that digital currencies may skyrocket deal around the clock and make trades by bankers Anyone without long term investment experience may result in loss of personal assets Investors should choose the investment model according to their own situation and experience 9 3 Coordination risk The Pixie Shopping Street project team will spare no efforts to achieve all the development goals which have been set out in the white paper At present the team has a sound technical and commercial team However there are unpredictable factors and uncertainties in the development of technologies and other issues The existing business model and the overall planning approach may not meet the market demand making it difficult to achieve profitability or meet investor expectations In the meantime as the project progresses this white paper may be adjusted If the details of the follow up progress of the project are not informed by the investors in time the investors may not understand the project due to the information asymmetry which may result in the loss of investment or influence the subsequent development of the project 9 4 Technical risks PixieCoin\ s ecosystem is built on quantum based chains the team cannot guarantee that partners will be able to utilize this technology in time and properly In addition during the process of project updating and adjustment there may exits loopholes and the technical team will continue to make up through patches \x0c9 5 Security risks Digitally encrypted currency is anonymous and difficult to be traced Thus it is easily be used by criminals or hacked or may involved in illegal assets transferring and other criminal activities Please have a fully understanding of the team background the overall framework of the project and ideas and a reasonable estimate of your own vision before you decide to participate in this project And please rationally participate in tokens public funding \x0c
