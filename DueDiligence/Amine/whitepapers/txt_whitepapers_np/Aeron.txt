people are saving up to travel around the world With modern technology evolving everyday we take a lot of things for granted We often forget how convenient travel is today Aviation plays a bigger role in our lives than one might imagine Think about this nearly 63 million jobs are provided by air travel making aviation a key component in global business Aside from the economy factor today more than ever people are willing to invest their savings into traveling as opposed to spend money shopping or going out locally Young people in their 20\xe2\x80\x9ds and 30\xe2\x80\x9ds see travel as the best investment of their money in exchange for cultural experiences According to the United Nations young people generate $180 billion annually in tourism revenue What\xe2\x80\x99s surprising is that today more than ever people are willing to travel despite any economic uncertainty Reason being tourists want to see and explore as many different cultures as they can something they can\xe2\x80\x99t do from the comfort of their own home 6 \x0cTourism is quickly becoming the world s largest industry and air transport plays a vital role in supporting this sector Conservative analysis suggests that aviation supports $892 4 billion in economic activity within the tourism industry World \xef\xac\x82eet to double in size over the next 20 years 2017 21 600 \xef\xac\x82eet 2037 43 560 \xef\xac\x82eet

airlines in 2017 Every day 104 000 \xef\xac\x82ights take off and 9 8 million passengers travel 99 1 million jobs 5 500 \xef\xac\x82ights using alternative fuel By 2037 it is expected that aviation will support 99 1 million jobs worldwide Over 5 500 \xef\xac\x82ights using sustainable alternative fuel are expected to be made by the end of 2018 The average occupancy of an aircraft is 80% higher than other modes of transport The Middle East is forecasted to be the fastest growing region for air traf\xef\xac\x81c in the next 20 years followed by Africa Asia Paci\xef\xac\x81c and Latin America 7 \x0cUber plans to test \xef\xac\x82ying cars by 2020 The Future of Aviation Going even further aviation has developed much further than we ever thought it could Private space travel is already today\xe2\x80\x99s reality In 2001 Dennis Tito got to experience travelling to space and as he would recall ten years later it was the happiest day of his life With constantly evolving technology space travel will become more accessible soon enough Richard Branson launched Virgin Galactic in 2004 The company offers suborbital space \xef\xac\x82ights to tourists as well as suborbital launches for science missions Another breakthrough in space technology was developed by Elon Musk SpaceX founded in 2002 became the \xef\xac\x81rst provider to be able to launch and recover a spacecraft from orbit We can only expect that space tourism will become the next most wanted attraction in no time According to Wired Uber s \xef\xac\x82ying cars could arrive in Dubai and Texas by 2020 More importantly Uber has signed deals with \xef\xac\x81ve companies that are developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft Pentagon backed Aurora Flight Sciences electric plane maker Pipistrel Bell Helicopter Embraer and small plane maker Mooney 8 Successful landing of Falcon 9 in 2017 \x0cProblems & Solutions Despite the fact that we came so far in exploring space there are still issues to be dealt with in air travel With over 100 000 \xef\xac\x82ights made daily serving over 2 million people safety is still a major concern Accidents related to air transport average to about 3302 yearly mainly due to human factor We looked at several common problems The key problems are that pilots may lack experience they claim as \xef\xac\x82ight log records can be easily forged This problem is worsened by \xe2\x80\x9cpay to \xef\xac\x82y\xe2\x80\x9d practices offered to pilots who would not have been hired otherwise Flight schools may be corrupt to help pilots put in hours on paper Aircraft operators also contribute to the problem by often underreporting the \xef\xac\x82ight hours saving huge maintenance costs for the aircraft With quickly developing technology aside from human factors we also face database intrusion resulting in modi\xef\xac\x81cation or distortion of data With so many systems in play\xe2\x80\x94airlines alone house data in many isolated systems from passenger service to crew management\xe2\x80\x94data exchange is not always smooth In the airline industry not only are operational integrity and revenue generation at stake when something goes wrong but even more importantly so is safety and security Protecting data privacy is a clear issue when it comes to passenger records \xef\xac\x82ight manifests and crew information Not to mention the security implications that are in play today if this data is not properly protected Blockchain technology with a security wrapper creates a very different and less risky yet transparent approach to managing and sharing this information through the use of authorized access requirements 9 \x0cCompletely new level of security established by blockchain Blockchain technology can transform pilot and aircraft maintenance logs which at best are in cumbersome databases and at worst are in paper binders The blockchain will ensure that spare parts procured are legitimate and can offer a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual copy\xe2\x80\x9d immutable record of the provenance of every part on the plane every time it has been handled and by whom from the beginning of the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s existence This visibility is profound and can take the practice of aircraft maintenance safety and security to new levels internationalairportreview com \xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain will revolutionise the aviation and airport industry \xe2\x80\x9d accenture com \xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain technology can create new efficiencies and services models for airlines \xe2\x80\x9d cryptocoinsnews com \xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain technology can improve the airline industry\xe2\x80\x9d 10 \x0cAdvantages of blockchain A solid distributed inviolable and cryptographically secure database The chain of blocks stores the encrypted code of the documents and once saved the data is recorded forever The perfect place to store property rights credentials identities (of objects or people) agreements between parties transmissions and transactions No one can falsify bribe or hack the data inscribed in the blocks of blockchain Transaction hisory is transparent to all users Blockchain supports Smart Contracts which is a computer protocol that facilitates veri\xef\xac\x81es enforces agreements and execution of a contract in an automatic and transparent way is the new standard of aviation safety Falsi\xef\xac\x81cation of data would be no longer a concern with the development of blockchain Advantages of the blockchain system are that information is safely stored and completely transparent to all the users It is secured by a multi sig authentication system preventing any alteration of vital data Our aim is to create \xe2\x80\x9cairline in a pocket\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a smart blockchain based solution The way it works is simple The pilot\xe2\x80\x99s application is used by a pilot for personal \xef\xac\x82ight logging The company application collects and veri\xef\xac\x81es data from aircraft operators maintenance organizations \xef\xac\x82ight schools and \xef\xac\x81xed base operators In case of any mismatch in data between any Aeron data source with either the Air Traf\xef\xac\x81c Control pilot or operator aviation authorities can quickly detect and eliminate the problem Aviation authorities can also detect any pilots operating with an expired license As a consumer or \xef\xac\x82ight school student you have access to the veri\xef\xac\x81ed global database through aerotrips com Blockchain can really make a difference Air travel is for everyone and it is bene\xef\xac\x81cial for every single person to get involved in making trips safer 11 \x0cHow it works In case of any mismatch in data between any Aeron data source with either the ATC pilot or operator aviation authorities can quickly detect and

com club membership 15 \x0cTill date pilot logs mainly exist in paper form with manual signatures and stamps Logs under control National aviation authorities have no universal mechanism to control integrity and authenticity of the pilot logs electronically There are no international standards or comprehensive technology for electronic logging Each country maintains its own log book formats and establishes national rules for processing and validation of the logs The legacy system is not equipped to handle the ever increasing number and variety of small aircraft and licensed private pilots operating worldwide This leads to a less than optimal experience for many people involved Aeron has a solution to this logging conundrum based on blockchain technology It will enable an online system relying on Aeron database built on Ethereum blockchain to track aircraft and pilot log records as well as ARN a utility token to enable the development of a thriving self sustaining ecosystem around the database and token holders True \xe2\x80\x9cairline in a pocket\xe2\x80\x9d featuring integrity reliability and easy validation 16 \x0cWe believe that aviation safety is closely related to record integrity Once the log records are stored in blockchain available for public audit and can\xe2\x80\x99t be forged both authorities and passengers can be con\xef\xac\x81dent that a pilot actually has the experience claimed Taking this a step further the same system can be applied to aircraft maintenance records and tracking of spare parts to con\xef\xac\x81rm that spare parts are authentic maintenance has been performed according to standards and there are no shortcuts The system described above could be supported by smart contracts that contain various log records as well as execute rental deeds or charters for the aircraft or cost sharing agreements between private pilots and their passengers combined with a sleek user interface to allow for engagement with the blockchain and a de\xef\xac\x81ned protocol to ensure transactions occur in compliance with local regulations Aeron (ARN) utility token would be required for write access to the Aeron database and other on chain events Aeron token would also have a real world application as it could be envisaged as a means of payment for small aircraft charters or promotional leisure \xef\xac\x82ights with aircraft owners having signed up for partnership arrangements with Aeron Aeron will work with national aviation authorities and international aviation agencies including EASA and FAA to promote acceptance of the electronic log records based on blockchain to demonstrate integrity reliability and transparency of record keeping A smart phone application will ultimately replace obsolete paper records and would gain a global acceptance enabling a single point of reference for licensed private pilots aircraft owners and operators aviation enthusiasts and general public interested in aircraft charters leisure \xef\xac\x82ights and pilot training 17 \x0cBlockchain for Aviation Safety Making blockchain services for aviation real Blockchain for aviation incubator Growth hack worldwide aviation strartups on

on Aeron database built on Ethereum blockchain to track aircraft and pilot log records 20 \x0cWhy we do Token Sale There are many arguments why we have chosen to do the token sale instead of alternatives ways to raise money First a token sale not only allows us to onboard participants from different regions but also to incentivise them to promote Aeron\xe2\x80\x99s products Second tokens provide liquidity since they can be traded on various exchanges after the token sale Participants can liquidate their position and bene\xef\xac\x81t from growth of token market value Finally the token smart contract enables easy distribution of tokens to participants instant payments with tokens security and transparency which would be hard to achieve without usage of blockchain technology Token Functions & Benefits We introduce Aeron (ARN) an ERC20 compliant Ethereum based token with a \xef\xac\x81xed supply of 20 000 000 ARN During the token launch a \xef\xac\x81xed amount of ARN is created and afterwards no more tokens shall be minted Aeron utility tokens are created to fund development and marketing of the Aeron project with associated distributed database online portal and applications as described in this document Aeron is built on the ERC20 token standard with a fixed supply of 20 000 000 ARN Because Aeron is built on the ERC20 token standard it allows for simple integration into users\xe2\x80\x99 wallets and is freely tradeable via direct transfers or via smart contracts It is possible that Aeron token could also be added to cryptocurrency exchanges 21 \x0cThe total supply of ARN will slowly decrease over time as tokens are taken out of circulation for example when someone with ARN loses their private keys therefore ARN will be effectively de\xef\xac\x82ationary Once Aeron receives ARN for services rendered the tokens will be put back into the circulation As a primary utility for write access to database with signing log entries and validation on the blockchain Aeron will charge a transaction fee in ARN Token Functionality Aeron (ARN) utility token will be incorporated in Aeron products It helps to enhance product usage allow contribution to the ecosystem product access and ownership ARN is a bootstrapping engagement While the token will enable access to valuable features within the Aeron platform it won\xe2\x80\x99t be limited by the Aeron mobile applications Aeron token can be utilized for the following purposes creating revenue streams for Aeron and offering additional bene\xef\xac\x81ts to the token holders 1 Subscription fee / Transaction based fee for log entries 2 Commission on paid services (in \xef\xac\x81at or ARN tokens) 3 Commission on intermediation and client introductions 4 Currency (mean of payment) for buying aviation services 5 Unlock access to \xef\xac\x82ight schools offers from pilots and aviation companies To incentivise participation in the ecosystem and expand our reach we will offer a seed quantity of Aeron tokens to \xef\xac\x82ight schools aircraft operators and aviation companies signing up with Aeron Once seed tokens are exhausted we expect a steady demand for tokens from the users Compared to \xef\xac\x81at based payments for Aeron fees and commissions we will offer discounts should the fees be paid in ARN facilitating further demand As an example once a \xef\xac\x81xed base operator at a certain air\xef\xac\x81eld renders services (refueling etc) to a pilot referred by Aeron commission can be paid in ARN with a 20\xe2\x80\x9430 % discount Aeron tokens will be the currency of aerotrips com club offering premium access to offers from aviation companies special incentives and discounts 22 \x0cWe created ARN with a clear vision that token must work must be viable secure well funded in\xef\xac\x82ation protected work better than other coins and do something unique as well These are key elements to the solid foundation More of that we believe that ARN will bring improvements to society as well as short and long term gains to investors As a long term vision at the \xef\xac\x81rst stage of project development ARN tokens would be used within the Aeron platform and at the second \xe2\x80\x94 they will became the standard token in aviation Roadmap for Aeron token application is the following Unlock access to \xef\xac\x82ight schools offers from pilots\xe2\x80\xa6 Buying access to premium app features Currency for buying aviation services Membership club and access to discounts Currency for buying aviation supplies First stage (2018 2019/Q1) Second stage (2019/Q2 2020) The Aeron token contract address will be published at https //aeron aero After token sale ARN will be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges providing liquidity Major exchanges already on board are Binance and HitBTC with others on negotiation stage 23 \x0cAeron user base 400 000 300 000 200 000 100 000 0 2018 2019 2020 B2B B2B + B2C B2B + B2C Consumer market would drive us to constantly develop new features within Aeron platform and perform marketing campaigns addressed to specific niches Functional expansion will help to power Aeron\xe2\x80\x99s vision of building an \xe2\x80\x9cairline in the pocket\xe2\x80\x9d Demand for Aeron services from consumer market will directly in fluence aviation professionals They will use Aeron more frequently and more responsibly At that B2C market would boost B2B market so more companies will integrate Aeron platform to fulfil consumer demand It will make a positive impact on ARN token value as a utility token for aviation professionals to access the range of Aeron services offerings 24 \x0cAeron Projections 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 3 250 000 32 500 162 500 325 000 487 500 650 000 Airlines 2 226 22 111 223 334
