b Ledger of Everything Global decentralized location service infrastructure that benefits all White Paper V3 0 0 GoWithMi Team 2019 08 \x0cAbstract GoWithMi aims to build a distributed map ecosystem through blockchain AI and GIS (Geographic Information System) technology which enables anyone (any node) to initiate and autonomously perform use update and maintenance of maps without depending on any centralization organization in the entire process The maturity of 5G IoT Edge AI and other technologies as well as the breakout of blockchain reveal the advent of the new era of Internet of everything which will become the third generation of the Internet after the first generation of PC Internet and the second generation of mobile Internet The spatial location information of people and things in the real world need map to realize digital so that they can be perceived by the digital universe In this sense the map is the \xe2\x80\x9cLedger of Everything\xe2\x80\x9d that records the spatial location It provides a connection service from the real world to the digital world by recording the \xe2\x80\x9cspatial location\xe2\x80\x9d which the real world mapped to the digital world Just like the original intention of the Bitcoin was to break the \xe2\x80\x9cpayment monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d GoWithMi was originally designed to break the \xe2\x80\x9cmap monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d In the first and second generation of the Internet the map is in the hands of a handful of Internet tycoons represented by Google This triggers a series of obvious drawbacks abuse of personal information leak of personal privacy [1] arbitrary price hike of map service that businesses need[2] or even shut down of map service [3] and so on If this situation stay unchanged the Internet of everything will still be threatened by \xe2\x80\x9cmap monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d To change this situation and break the map monopoly GoWithMi explores the \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralization\xe2\x80\x9d practice mainly from technology and community governance 1 GoWithMi\xe2\x80\x99s main chain \xe2\x80\x93 the technical realization of peer to peer map network Gaia Gaia is a peer to peer map network completely Map data update map service provision and maintenance can be initiated from any node in the network and cooperate as needed throughout the whole network without any centralization mechanism The TPS or supporting governance mechanisms of the existing blockchain projects such as BTC ETH and EOS cannot meet the application needs in non financial scenarios We propose the spatial geographic computing architecture (GeoMesh Computing Architecture) to allow the data structure and core algorithm in the map industry to combine with the peer to2 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cpeer (Peer to Peer) network and consensus mechanism of the blockchain in their \xe2\x80\x9cgene level\xe2\x80\x9d so as to provide a peer to peer map network that combines the map service with the decentralized self organization of blockchain The detailed method is \xe2\x9a\xab Designing a new basic map data structure GeoMesh which enables basic map data to be segmented into a large number of discrete and small sized GeoMesh data \xe2\x9a\xab Designing a consensus mechanism like PoW (PoCW Proof of Compilation Work) that allows multiple nodes to create and update map data by mesh (Mesh) like block by block ledger keeping \xe2\x9a\xab Realizing a peer to peer network mechanism that allows GeoMesh to be synchronized between nodes on demand \xe2\x9a\xab Reconstructing the core algorithm to allow the node to provide a complete map service in a specified area based on the currently cached GeoMesh rather than synchronizing all map data \xe2\x9a\xab Designing a proof mechanism (PoG Proof of GeoMesh) to enable the node to prove its map service capability simply through the effectively cached GeoMesh \xe2\x9a\xab Designing a ledger keeping consensus design for blockchains in nonfinancial scenarios (DPoG) that allows all nodes to maintain the same voting rights and map service obligations to the ledger keeping nodes Based on the designing philosophy of GCA (GeoMesh Computing Architecture) Gaia will coordinate the computing resources of all nodes in the whole network effectively Compared with the PoW consensus the PoCW makes those node computing power which are participated in this consensus spend in the map data compilation a service benefits the map service and let the computing power game between the nodes can be used to ensure the consistency of the core map service resource GeoMesh Based on the results of the PoCW work the entire network nodes can synchronize the GeoMesh on demand to ensure the consistency of the entire network map service (PoG) and the fairness of the accounting node election (DPoG) Based on the planning of such computing power under the premise of ensuring data consistency service consistency and fair governance the computing resources of most nodes of the whole network can be released to the map service itself thereby increasing the TPS of the network by a thousand times or even thousands of times compared with that of the existing public chain 3 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0c2 The organization and governance of the map ecosystem and other business that goes with the main chain Gaia including \xe2\x9a\xab An AI and human machine collaborative data collection network combining Token and Edge AI that could shorten the single data data collection time from ten minutes to ten milliseconds \xe2\x9a\xab A decentralized governance mechanism for map data rights which takes into account both the investment efficiency and investment efficiency of map data \xe2\x9a\xab A decentralized governance mechanism for core ecological business resources that ensure optimal utilization of core resources If BTC is a Peer to Peer version of \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial ledger\xe2\x80\x9d then GoWithMi is the Peer to Peer version of \xe2\x80\x9cLedger of Everything\xe2\x80\x9d The blockchain revolution represented by BTC ETH and EOS reveals the possibility of participants playing positive sum game based on a distributed network to co construct ecology GoWithMi hopes to extend this kind of \xe2\x80\x9cself governance\xe2\x80\x9d in positive sum game to non financial scenarios to decentralize the \xe2\x80\x9cledger keeping rights\xe2\x80\x9d of the map \xe2\x80\x9cLedger of Everything\xe2\x80\x9d thus build the next generation of global decentralized location service

service infrastructure by building a global human machine collaborative map network and reshaping the map ecosystem through blockchain AI and GIS technology Meanwhile as a decentralized map component for all public chains GoWithMi is dedicated to facilitate blockchain industry to empower transportation travel accommodation e commerce advertising gaming location intelligence autonomous driving and other large scale application scenarios that rely heavily on maps Vision Internet infrastructure like map services should be designed and managed as public product GoWithMi\xe2\x80\x99s main chain Gaia will fill the global capital and technology gaps allowing people in emerging markets to build a map network through idle computer or even idle phone rather than purchasing many expensive servers allowing people to update and improve map services by themselves according to their own needs rather than relying on large international companies to collect bulk data empowering blockchain and Internet developers around the world with a map dAPI that will not leak privacy will not be forced to raise prices and shut down empowering all businesses that need maps including transportation travel accommodation and e commerce with a low cost and high quality underlying map service that never shut down 7 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cChapter II The Challenges and Solutions for Blockchains in Non financial Scenarios Data and Computing Power The requirements for scalability and data storage for blockchains in nonfinancial projects far exceed the existing blockchain projects Baidu Map needs to provide 120 billion location services per day [4] that\xe2\x80\x99s about 1 388 889 TPS every minute which is 86 806 times of Ethereum 347 times of EOS and 694 times of TRON The Gigabyte level data storage required for map data is also significantly larger than the existing ledger data storage size Obviously it is difficult to meet such computing and storage needs under the existing blockchain technology framework and consensus In this whitepaper we introduce the GeoMesh technology architecture which enables the peer to peer map network to solve both the computing and storage needs of the map service and propose a complete decentralized solution for all key services of the map service For details please refer to Chapter III Consensus in the Real World From the perspective of game theory the existing blockchain consensus can be abstracted into a positive sum game based on distributed systems Whether under the PoW or the PoS consenus the game behaviors of participants has been abstracted into extremely simple behaviors such as calculation of SHA256 hash and the mortgage of stake However existing Internet services require a lot of collaborative work in the real world The complexity of such collaboration cannot be abstracted into simple behaviors Although we can set up mortgages competition and other measures to motivate and punish participants participants\xe2\x80\x99 learning costs and cognitive biases in work in the real world will still lead to unexpected outcomes in the consensus driven human collaboration 8 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cFortunately the outbreak of the AI technology revolution brings us a new possibility We can standardize and streamline the behavior of all participants with the aid of AI algorithm By cooperating with Edge AI hardware AI could automatically assist to complete the work that would otherwise take participants hours or even days to learn Participants can complete the data collection work that meets the requirements simply by taking the equipment to the designated area Such humanmachine collaboration makes the consensus driven collaboration in reality as elegant as PoW in BTC Governance of Map Data Most Internet services can be considered as an extension of their data applications and data is the core production material of the Internet Most of the existing blockchain governance can be understood as the governance of \xe2\x80\x9cledgerkeeping rights\xe2\x80\x9d Most projects do not design and answer the question of how to govern the ownership and the maintenance obligation of data The core production material of map is map data Based on its spatial characteristics GoWithMi maps all the rights and maintenance obligations of the map data to different pieces of virtual lands that are corresponding to reality Each piece of land becomes a space node (GoZone) Based on such data governance design we have transformed the global map data governance into spatial node governance based on independent regions We are fortunate to b design a spatial node governance mechanism based on \xe2\x80\x9cHarberger taxes\xe2\x80\x9d In the digital space world \xe2\x80\x9cHarberger taxes\xe2\x80\x9d does not have real world constraints so we could govern the rights and obligations of data elegantly through the governance of spatial nodes 9 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cChapter III The Main Chain Gaia Distributed Storage and Distributed Computing SETI@home SETI@Home[6] is the world\xe2\x80\x99s best known and largest distributed computing project It began to use distributed computing to analyze electromagnetic waves from the universe and find extraterrestrial civilization in the 1990s The success of SETI@Home proves the feasibility of providing services through distributed computing Inspired by SETI@Home Gaia regarded map service as a public course that the international community could participate in the same way as finding extraterrestrial civilizations and provide global decentralized location service infrastructure through the integration of idle computing power IPFS IPFS is a master of successful open source distributed systems in recent decades providing an excellent distributed storage protocol solution for subsequent projects Gaia focuses on the development of distributed map services on the network transport layer It can be considered as a distributed map network that realizes some IPFS protocols in some sense which is exemplary for the distribution transformation of the subsequent Internet projects Map Technology and Spatial Geographic Grid Computing Architecture Background Knowledge of Map Technology In general map technology can be divided into two parts \xe2\x9a\xab Map Data Compilation A series of data collected from the real world such as road shape traffic rules the name and location of POI (Point Of Interest) cannot be directly used by commercial level map services To reorganize the data structure different indexes need to be added based on different map service needs For example POI name 10 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cqueries needs to add inverted indexes POI peripheral queries or map displays need to add spatial indexes and path calculation needs to convert road data into multiple layers of strongly connected directed graphs These tasks are generally weeklylevel because they are full scale structure conversion of existing data \xe2\x9a\xab Map Service The map service provides a series of location based services such as place name query map display path calculation and route guidance on the basis of generating map data though compiling the collected data All map related business services can be regarded as the combination of these basic map services Obviously we need a complete and exclusive transformation of the map technology to provide a peer to peer map solution Spatial Geographic Grid Computing Architecture (GCA) The spatial geographic computing architecture (GCA GeoMesh Computing Architecture) proposed in this white paper represents a technical system and architecture design for distributed map services of which the design philosophy is inherited from Grid Computing [7] \xe2\x80\x9cMesh\xe2\x80\x9d could better illustrate the spatial properties of the map services in the geographic information industry GCA aims to design a new map service based on P2P network Through the redesign of the basic map data structure the map data can achieve distributed production based on PoCW (Proof of Compilation Work) consensus While the map data consistency among the network is guaranteed each node synchronizes data on demand and achieves the network wide consistency of the map service through the network wide consistency of the map data so that most nodes of the entire network no longer waste valuable computing resources on competing the ledger keeping right under PoW Instead the resources are devoted to the map service itself thereby increasing the TPS of the network by a thousand times or even thousands of times compared with that of the existing public chain The core idea of GeoMesh is to make the map data which organized through GeoMesh the core service resource in Gaia network All nodes can prove their own 11 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cmap service capability (Proof of GeoMesh) by themselves by storing and maintaining a part of GeoMesh data And from the perspective of Gaia network each node\xe2\x80\x99s holding of service resources like GeoMesh is the proof of the contribution to the map service Each node uses the effective holding of GeoMesh as a stock to vote for the ledger keeping nodes in the network This is called DPoG (Delegated Proof of GeoMesh) In general the Spatial Geographic Computing Architecture (GCA) can be divided into the following parts \xe2\x9a\xab A new basic map data structure GeoMesh which enables basic map data to be segmented into a large number of discrete and small sized GeoMesh data \xe2\x9a\xab PoCW (Proof of Compilation Work) consensus mechanism that allows multiple nodes to create and update map data by mesh (Mesh) like block by block ledgerkeeping \xe2\x9a\xab A peer to peer network mechanism that allows GeoMesh to be synchronized between nodes on demand \xe2\x9a\xab The core algorithm goes with GeoMesh that allows the node to provide a complete map service in a specified area based on the currently cached GeoMesh rather than synchronizing all map data \xe2\x9a\xab A proof of the node\xe2\x80\x99s map service capability (Proof of GeoMesh) The node could prove its map service capability simply through the effectively cached GeoMesh \xe2\x9a\xab A ledger keeping consensus for blockchains in non financial scenarios (DPoG) that allows all nodes to maintain the same voting rights and map service obligations to the ledger keeping nodes The map service features access aggregation Hardly do the taxi driver in Beijing need to know the location of the Los Angeles supermarket Access aggregation makes GeoMesh enjoy a very high cache hit rate thus making it possible to provide citylevel map services with a single node with limited GeoMesh The core of GeoMesh\xe2\x80\x99s data structure is decoupling and parallelizing map data Decoupling means that an independent GeoMesh data can provide the data needed for map services in a few square kilometers without any other data Parallelizing means that several adjacent GeoMesh data can provide all the data of the map service in the corresponding range in parallel without any additional processing means 12 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cFigure 1 GeoMesh segements the map data The data structure features of GeoMesh allow map nodes to synchronize and cache GeoMesh as simple as the way IPFS nodes cache images In terms of network structure I designed a two level node structure which is Root Node and Edge Node Any hardware device including server PC or mobile phone can be a node to participate in the Gaia map network They can choose to become one kind of node or both kinds of nodes at the same time Figure 2 A demonstration of Gaia nodes 13 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cRoot Node and Automatic Compilation Root Node The \xe2\x80\x9croot\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9croot node\xe2\x80\x9d comes from the root name server [8] It uses the role of the root name server in the Domain Name Service (DNS) [9] to analogize the role of the root node in the Gaia network In the actual operation of the DNS system most of the domain name resolutions do not need to access the root name server and the mapping relationship of the toplevel domain (TLD) [10] has been cached in the nodes of the DNS system But we can rebuild the entire DNS system based on the root name server at any time In the Gaia network GeoMesh data is generated between the root nodes through PoCW GeoMesh will synchronize to the Gaia nodes as needed Most of the map service requests do not require the root node either The root node\xe2\x80\x99s role in Gaia is more like a provider of rules than a provider of services Data Compilation Workload Proof (PoCW) Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s PoW mechanism provides a very good example of how to maintain the data consistency among the whole network Based on the \xe2\x80\x9cone CPU one vote\xe2\x80\x9d principle the decision of the \xe2\x80\x9chonest majority\xe2\x80\x9d is expressed as the longest chain which outruns other competing chains thus ensuring the ledger data of the whole network is consistent Proof of Compilation Work (PoCW) inherits the design principle of PoW It makes the data compilation of map production a legder keeping process and the GeoMesh based data compilation and production a block production process it also makes the decision of the \xe2\x80\x9chonest majority\xe2\x80\x9d expressed as the longest chain thus ensuring the map data consistency among the whole network Automatic Compilation and GeoMesh The automatic compilation of map data without human intervention is the premise of the de centralized production of map data So far there is no map data automatic compilation project available for commercial use worldwide We need to make different modifications based on the data compilation of different map service modules Fortunately we are \xe2\x80\x9cstanding on the shoulders of giants\xe2\x80\x9d 14 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cSpatial index technology is relatively mature in the map industry Quadtree [11] has almost become the industry standard Web Mercator projection [12] and GeoHash [13] provide very good references in application The inverted index technology is also relatively mature and a large number of existing projects such as Solr [14] and ElasticSearch [15] provide good references for creating real time index The difficulty of GeoMesh technology lies in the automatic compilation of path planning of which the purpose is to transform the road network composed of all roads into a strongly connected directed graph [16] so as to use the Dijkstra algorithm [17] or the A* algorithm [18] to obtain the optimal path from location A to lacation B Although \xe2\x80\x9cboundary node\xe2\x80\x9d technology allows road network data to be segmented based on spatial index without additional indexes the inspection of road networks and even the production of strongly connected directed graphs require human intervention for a long time which is almost the most labor intensive part of the indoor operation in traditional map business Fortunately the advancement of the algorithm makes full automation possible Tarjan\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm [19] allows the system to automatically detect \xe2\x80\x9cisolated subgraphs\xe2\x80\x9d on the road network preventing drop dead halt in path computation Contraction hierarchies algorithm[20] provides a way to rarefy road network without losing any optimal path between higher nodes making the high level road network possible which the automatic compilation and production of mainland level path calculation requires Figure 3 Multi layer bidirectional A* pathfinding algorithm that is almost the industry standard 15

provide nearby map services based on their own hardware network conditions and geographic location The maps could range from a city a country or to the whole world Edge nodes can be deployed on servers PCs and even mobile phones We call it \xe2\x80\x9ceverything could mine\xe2\x80\x9d Proof of Service Capability (PoG) PoG is a mechanism that allows Edge Nodes to prove their map capabilities through the effectively cached GeoMesh After Gaia guarantees the map service consistency through GeoMesh data consistency based on proof of compilation workload (PoCW) the spatial index of GeoMesh in parallel directly describes the range of map services that can be provided In this way Edge Node can prove its service capability by caching such service resources of GeoMesh which referred to as PoG (Proof of GeoMesh) Gaia matches the Edge Node which proves its service capabilities through PoG with the nearby corresponding map service needs Peer to Peer Network and GeoMesh One of the original design purposes of GeoMesh data structure is to make the size of the map data conform to the transmission requirements of the P2P network In the PoC (Proof of Concept) test one single GeoMesh data can be controlled at around 800K and can provide map display and path planning services within the range of 3 6*2 4 square kilometers 16 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cFigure 4 The available map area of 800k GeoMesh in the PoC test With GeoMesh as the carrier the global map data is transmitted and stored in the P2P network in a distributed way Each node only needs to synchronize and store the required parts Gaia\xe2\x80\x99s map service will be provided by a large number of edge nodes scattered around the world Since real time synchronization is not required the node\xe2\x80\x99s own computing power is used to provide map services In this way Gaia provides low cost map services with no TPS limit theoretically Map dAPI Based on the P2P map network Gaia can provide a secure and transparent map service that never ends which we call dAPI Any blockchain project Internet company or individual developer can deploy their own edge nodes based on open source code in the future The deployment environment can be a secure environment chosen by the developer After the edge node is connected to the network the developer only needs to pay Gas to get the map service 17 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cFigure 5 dAPI based on P2P network Gaia provides decentralized map dAPI in a completely transparent way eliminating the possibility of evil conduct at the center Ledger and DPoG The Governance of Ledger keeping Right and GeoMesh We tried to design a consensus to govern the ledger keeping right on Gaia so that each node\xe2\x80\x99s right to vote for the ledger keeping node is related to its contribution to the entire network map service GeoMesh provides a simple solution to directly link the map service capability of each node to the nodes\xe2\x80\x99s effectively cached map data So the contribution of each node to the whole map network ecology can be abstractly quantized into the node\xe2\x80\x99s effectively cached map data in GeoMesh format Service Voting Proof\xef\xbc\x88DPoG\xef\xbc\x89 DPoG can be considered as a variant of DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) in essence except that we convert the interest brought by the holding into the interest brought by service resources held by the nodes (GeoMesh) Each node obtains voting rights to the ledger keeping node based on the valid GeoMesh cache thereby unifying their rights and obligations in Gaia 18 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cChapter IV Human machine Collaboration in the Real World Data Collection and Map Information like the location of the store the name of the road etc need to be collected and processed by people to form the original data in the electronic map in a standard format The map industry refers to such work as \xe2\x80\x9cmap data collection\xe2\x80\x9d In traditional map enterprises the biggest cost comes from data collection Both Chinese American companies finish this work through intensive labor Even Google can\xe2\x80\x99t invest enough manpower and material resources in each country in the emerging markets to ensure that map data quality in emerging markets is the same as in developed countries This is why Google Maps can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver map services of the same quality throughout the world Distributed data collection does not have this problem Through the management of consensus and incentives we can break through the organization and management limitations in traditional industry and let people all over the world participate in data collection The Governance of Distributed Data Collection Most governance of distributed cooperation can be considered as the establishment of a self assessment system All self assessment systems can be easily divided into two parts self declaration and verification by others So distributed data collection is also divided into two phases \xe2\x9a\xab Collection phase (self declaration) After collecting the data the data does not immediately enter the compilation process The collector needs to mortgage his or her own token to inspire others to verify \xe2\x9a\xab Verification by others After the collector mortgages the token it will attract other participants to verify the data If the data is verified to be true both the collector and the verifier will acquire incentives If it\xe2\x80\x99s verified to be false the verifier will split the collector\xe2\x80\x99s mortgaged token 19 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cToken driven Edge AI and Distributed Human machine Collaboration Edge AI can be considered as a distributed revolution in AI computing freeing AI computing power from the constraints of the center and providing it to edge devices We believe that Edge AI is naturally driven by Token and this Token driven Edge AI is naturally combined with human involved data collection activities We will use GIS and Edge AI technology to create an ecological spatial data mining machine The carrier can be AI hardware for car near space vehicle or even satellite We\xe2\x80\x99ll make map data collection process standardized automated and efficient to let the consensus algorithm perfectly facilitate human to participate in collecting map data in the real world thus realizing perfect human machine collaboration interpersonal collaboration and machine collaboration Figure 6 AI collaboration of token driven Air ground integration The AI data collection protocol will be open to third parties making it possible for all Edge AI devices to participate in data collection 20 / 42

will automatically identify the traffic signs lane lines intersection turns POI along the way and other spatial data that maps need The AI hardware shortens the time of collecting one single unit of map data from ten minutes (collected completely by human) to ten milliseconds which greatly accelerates the data collection process The Near Space Vehicle The near space vehicle will continue to hover at a fixed altitude of 20 000 meters for several months with a \xe2\x80\x9cgaze\xe2\x80\x9d range covering large cities Figure 8 Aerial view of a near space vehicle 21 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0

can be obtained directly through the picture Figure 9 Image sent by the near space vehicle With near space vehicle you can get the basic display data of a city in a few days or even hours and can detect all events in the city in real time from traffic jams to social events (demonstrations riots) and even natural disasters (tsunami volcanoes) 22 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights

two hundred years ago when the landlord holds the core production material land All the dividends acquired in the industrial revolution since 1750 were in the hand of the landlord and the wages of the working class hadn\xe2\x80\x99t changed for one hundred years The same story is happening in the Internet ecosystem where large Internet companies control data the core production material in the Internet economy and gain a lot of benefits yet the Internet users can\xe2\x80\x99t get any return After making the distributed management of data technically possible through Gaia we need to provide a mutually beneficial data governance system Decentralized Land Governance Mechanism Harberger taxes Harberger taxes is essentially a \xe2\x80\x9cself assessment system\xe2\x80\x9d for the land\xe2\x80\x99s value Through the owner\xe2\x80\x99s self assessment of land prices and forced circulation trading Harberger taxes takes into account both investment efficiency and investment efficiency in a decentralized way To be specific any landowner can declare the price of his land in accordance with his own ideas and pay taxes according to the price Meanwhile anyone can purchase the land at the price set by the owner If the owner declared a low price to lower the tax his land will soon be bought by others if the owner declared a high price to prevent others from buying the land he or she has to pay a high tax continuously Based on such a game the owner will declare the price of his land reasonably and eventually transfer the land to the person who can truly maximize its value Harberger taxes manages the rights and obligations of land in an elegant way Neither there will have \xe2\x80\x9cpublic land effect\xe2\x80\x9d resulted from unmaintained and overdeveloped shared land nor \xe2\x80\x9cland monopoly\xe2\x80\x9d where owners refuse to fulfill their obligations and just reap the benefits 23 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cSpatial Data Node and Map Data Management We believe that Harbiner taxs can also be used in map data management The detailed approach is to divide the areas on the map into virtual land of map data according

user traffic 20 years development from PC Internet to the mobile Internet proves that the world\xe2\x80\x99s top level traffic only has four types e commerce social information and map Only applications in these four areas can serve hundreds of millions or even billions of users for years Especially in the era of the third generation Internet of everything represented by IoT+5G+Edge AI the map will become the only top level traffic that will connect more than 50 billion IOT devices The trend of Internet development in the past two years is the exploration of monetizing these top level user traffic Pinduoduo (Nasdaq PDD) which monetizes the traffic in social and Qutoutiao (Nasdaq QTT) which monetizes the traffic in information provide us with good references Traffic Management and Distributed Business User traffic is as precious to the Internet economy as oil is to the industrial society We need to manage this core resource more fairly in a more distributed way Distributed business is such a governance method The detailed idea is to abstract traffic conversion services such as discount coupon and advertisements into resources without threshold that everyone can bid for and the highest bidder get to use the resources In this way the resources will be transferred to the merchants with higher conversion efficiency 25 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved

service is required when the smart contract is involved in the real world scenario such as decentralized cab hailing decentralized take out and decentralized e commerce If dAPI need to solve issues of using smart contract to mobilize the people and things in the real world like calculating driving route dispatching the delivery man to fetch the take out real time display of the cargo\xe2\x80\x99s location etc we need space oracles to solve the problem of letting smart contracts perceive whether people and things effectively complete services The main reason why the space oracle cannot be replaced by the centralized map is related to the blockchain smart contract\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cself declaration verification by others\xe2\x80\x9d design After a node performs the smart contract it still needs verification from other nodes This means the space oracle needs to give the verification node verifiable and tamper resistant historical spatial data Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s

system and network architecture are the same as the blockchain the production of GeoMesh can be considered as a block generation behavior in essence which supports the complete traceability of its

own map a HUB that connects its own real world information and digital information on competitors\xe2\x80\x99 servers As a distributed and completely neutral location service infrastructure Gaia will free large Internet companies from the meaningless competition of \xe2\x80\x9creinventing the wheel\xe2\x80\x9d other than providing a safe low cost solution for small and medium sized developers Privacy Map and Interest Map With GoWithMi providing a decentralized universal underlying map solution segmented map application scenario becomes possible which otherwise could not be realized due to the high sunk cost \xe2\x9a\xab Privacy Map Just like the browsing tracks on the Internet people\xe2\x80\x99s tracks in space sometimes involve privacy issue Gaia\xe2\x80\x99s distributed map makes privacy map possible Map service that based on open source verifiable and distributed nodes completely eliminates the possibility of user information being hijacked by the bottom layer And for the upper layer MPC (multi party computing) or zero knowledge proof technology allow users to use the full map service without revealing their spatial location It is worth emphasizing that the closed source code of centralized map and the \xe2\x80\x9cblack box operation\xe2\x80\x9d of the central server deployment make it impossible for centralized map to prove its protection of user privacy For centralized map claiming to realize privacy map is an ostrich policy \xe2\x9a\xab Community of Interest Map 40 / 42 GoWithMi White Paper V3 0 0 All Rights Reserved \x0cThe current map is more
