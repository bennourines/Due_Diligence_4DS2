of commercial projects together with leading commerce and application platforms in various industries gradually form a blockchain economy system to improve industry efficiency To accelerate the development of Usechain ecosystem and lead the industry into blockchain 3 0 we will work with community \x0cPART I INTRODUCTION 1/74 \x0c1 Blockchain Industry Blockchain technology and industry have made great progress since 2009 Bitcoin and Ethereum have brought about innovative ideas and concepts such as\xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized currency\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x9csmart contracts\xe2\x80\x9d into the world of blockchain technology The potential blockchain and cryptocurrency have allowed society to be autonomous and secured However performance inefficiency poor scalability and high technical threshold blockchain technology to only be applied in have limited cryptocurrency trading and exchange Although many underlying blockchain communities have made tremendous contribution to optimize the technology blockchain has not yet to be adopted by the mass market like Internet because of the lack of commercial support and weak connection with market The potential huge market value of blockchain industry has not been fully recognized 2 Blockchain Industry Bottlenecks The birth of Bitcoin started the era of blockchain 1 0 A finite total supply and a declining production make Bitcoin a store of value and digital gold chased by investors However Bitcoin is also widely criticized for low transaction performance and high consumption of power 2/74 \x0cBlockchain 2 0 is based on Ethereum Though the exchange of different cryptocurrencies becomes easier and is not limited in Ethereum using smart contracts\xef\xbc\x8cEthereum also proves to be an effective crowd funding platform which provides a channel to connect blockchain technology and industry development with capital investment and a gateway to develop and build blockchain industry globally Apart form token creation and distribution Ethereum has not yet to provide a platform for value exchange that can be adopted by the public in their daily life Many blockchain companies are continuously exploring the solution with actual commercial value for blockchain technology In the world of blockchain people need an ecosystem that can be adopted into their daily live \xef\xbc\x8c support various transaction scenarios and bring value to the public Presently there are many bottlenecks in the development process of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency The 3 major problems are listed as below 3/74 \x0cLow performance Even though existing blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum play a crucial role in blockchain ecosystem However they have not yet been adopted into people\xe2\x80\x99s live like how Alipay does Under the existing blockchain technology structure Bitcoin and Ethereum can only support 7 and 25 transactions per second respectively which are tremendously low as compared to the number of transactions that VISA supports The slow transaction speed of existing blockchain systems makes it difficult for mass market adoption Anonymous environment In the existing blockchain industry the core of blockchain technology application is center upon the term anonymity The on chain address of cryptocurrency account does not have any association with the real identity off chain making it a channel for criminal activities such as money laundering drug trafficking smuggling and illegal fundraising Most applications under daily scenarios need the support from KYC and AML so that existing anonymous cryptocurrency need get approved to be applied for a wide range of applications 4/74 \x0cHigh technical difficulties Currently it\xe2\x80\x99s still difficult to build mainstream decentralized applications that can be flexibly and swiftly deployed on existing blockchain platforms The development of underlying public blockchain has high technical difficulties that requires the support of multidisciplinary and technological resources The stage that current blockchain technology is in is similar to the early stage of Internet which means It is by a small crowd of enthusiasts However due to technical bottlenecks and complications it is difficult for mass adoption Hence there is no public blockchains cryptocurrency or decentralized platforms that have been widely adopted Currently the centralized solutions still dominate the market and our society 5/74 \x0c3 Vision The rapid development of blockchain industry and technology focuses on the characteristics like transparency security decentralization irreversibility network consensus etc which has laid an ideal foundation for large scale transmission of value Internet makes large scale information transmission possible We believe large scale transmission of value should be as easy as transmitting information and the security during transmission will not compromise With more global communities established the participation and resources investment are pushing the whole blockchain industry to blockchain 3 0 It is believed that blockchain 3 0 is the era when blockchain is the mainstream technology to change the way how human explore and innovate the development mode Also It\xe2\x80\x99s the time when large scale ecosystems taking blockchain as the infrastructure and decentralization as the core foundation will expand sharply users are reached by large scale Dapps and cognition of human will be thoroughly changed 6/74 \x0cTo increase adoption and utilization of blockchain technology cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain system need to be improved in \xe2\x80\xa2 Performance and scalability Provide efficient transaction process management and support for millions of Dapps and billions of users \xe2\x80\xa2 Identity based Establish a connection between the on chain addresses and the off chain identity to meet requirements of KYC and AML making it possible to be massively adopted in daily consumption loans insurance etc \xe2\x80\xa2 Low technical barrier The continuous optimization and enhancement of smart contract more sophisticated and flexible definition of application protocol and promotion in accessibility can provide a user friendly interface for existing Internet technologies and low cost and low risk docking mode for mature technologies The Usechain foundation is establishing the first blockchain ecosystem that satisfies the above conditions and can be applied to the mass market The system has features like a new underlying framework of blockchain technology and real identity It is also built on a high performance secure and reliable infrastructure and can transmit massive value 7/74 \x0cBased on solid technological foundation and the high performance and secure infrastructure centering on sole identity mapping Usechain will be able to be applied to a wide range of applications scenarios requiring identity With the competitive advantage from commercial field and renowned business schools Usechain can continue inputting high quality resources and uniting leading companies and application platforms under the motivation of Usechain foundation assisting the global community to stimulate the development of the Usechain ecosystem and leading the industry into blockchain 3 0 As the Usechain ecosystem continue to be improved the behavioral data generated by people events and objects within the identity based ecosystem will be transparent open and irreversible Under the precondition of privacy security traditional identity information changes from being scattered and fragmented to being aggregated to individual based Individuals can create value in the ecosystem by continually investing time attention assets etc and get returns from the ecosystem The identity value in the ecosystem will be given back to owners who possess the original rights after all participants reach a consensus which will eliminate oligopoly and interests center making it a possibility to truly build a decentralized\xe2\x80\x9cvirtual society\xe2\x80\x9d 8/74 \x0cPART II TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE 9/74 \x0cDue to numerous bottlenecks in efficiency and usability it is difficult to use existing blockchain platforms to create applications scenarios for mass market 1 Design Objectives Usechain will develop the first mirror identity blockchain ecosystem by starting from design innovation from the perspective of blockchain infrastructure This is to improve efficiency of transaction verification to meet infrastructure requirements for mass market application decrease deployment cost of smart contracts and increase the flexibility and usability of them Besides virtual machines will be optimized to simplify development and commissioning process reduce resource consumption and lower barriers to participate in Usechain will be designed to handle large scale transactions to meet demands from millions of users at the same time and to manage the huge range of commercial and social applications on the platform 2 Architecture Design and Innovation The architecture design of Usechain includes application service application components application protocol and core framework of underlying public blockchain 10/74 \x0c11/74 \x0cTo achieve the vision and goal of Usechain including improving the transaction efficiency to support its platform applications in the mass market The Usechain foundation proposes an innovative solution for blockchain that Usechain will be based on mirror identity which and include innovations in both security and performance The innovation in design can be divided into network layer data layer consensus layer incentive layer and smart contract layer Each level can serve for a certain quantity of applications meet the specific needs of different applications and provide foundation for individuals and enterprises with the possibility to quickly and securely implement various application and business models with low cost Some of the key innovations are designed as follows Multi level authentication mechanism Using cryptography solution Usechain establishes a multi level correspondence mechanism between the on chain address and the identity of authenticated users Only mapping relationship is recorded on the chain and no other information is exposed which completes the authentication process without damaging privacy security 12/74 \x0cRPOW consensus mechanism Based on current algorithms and secure high performance and anti attack Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) built by hardware the Randomized Proof of Work (RPOW) consensus algorithm can achieve high frequency transaction verification on the premise of a lower energy consumption and fair environment for mining At the same time through the combination of decentralization and distributed ledger it is possible to communicate synergetically and resist attacks At the same time it can reach the level required by application in terms of scale speed and cost Network sharding technology With The KaZaA P2P protocol introduced Identity Network Sharding (INS) and Identity Transaction Sharding (ITS) strategies designed network sharding can be realized based on the account address of users The transaction of a specific address can be confirmed within the sharding which the address belongs to which erases the need for confirmation by all nodes in the network In that way transaction can be confirmed in shorter time and bearing capacity will also be increased under the condition of resisting double spending attacks 13/74 \x0cIdentity Virtual Machine The Identity Virtual Machine (IVM) is a new standard for building high performance smart contracts that can be defined and sandboxed with some adaptations Usechain will build an intermediate communication layer so that IVM can interact with the underlying blockchain external APIs and sub chains or even be directly programmed based on the intermediate communication layer to make up for the shortage of Ethereum virtual machine and build smart contracts which are efficient in execution and can interact with external data to help extend the application scenarios Light node client The adoption of higher level Merkle Tree BCMT is used to achieve transaction and status verification reduce the amount of data light node clients need to synchronize and verify the accuracy of transactions or data 14/74 \x0cOnline fault tolerance When a specific node encounters a conflict or fork the disputed accounts and blocks will be frozen based on the sole identity mapping Other nodes as will continue the usual transactions and generate blocks The disputed blocks and accounts will be judged by a specialized committee board For more technical details please download the Technical White Paper 15/74 \x0c3 Innovative Solutions Consensus Algorithm Revolution Usechain is using blockchain technology to achieve genuine commercial value and contribution to society It analyzes Bitcoin and Ethereum network from multiple perspectives iincluding security performance risk resources investment and user\xe2\x80\x99s participation Usechain combines the different technical and competitive advantage of existing blockchain models and proposes one of the most feasible consensus algorithm called Randomized Proof of the Work (RPOW) based on identity mapping to explore a new solution for blockchain As the first mirror identity blockchain system not only lowers the risks and problems brought by the fact that some individuals will control most of the nodes because of the overflow of anonymous addresses but also brings possibility to the consensus algorithm of RPOW To maximize the commercial value and social contribution Usechain undergoes comprehensive upgrades in the following aspects which makes it different from all existing mainstream technology in blockchain 16/74 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 High level Security Based on POW random algorithm with intellectual property rights can reduce the centralization degree of hashing power It can also resist double spending attack and attack started by 51% hash power and greatly reduce the probability of fork which ensures the security and impartiality of network to the most degree \xe2\x80\xa2 High Performance Through random algorithm Every block will give different difficulty to all miners to adjust the distribution of virtual harsh power which can dramatically increase the efficiency of transaction confirmation based on POW and lay the foundation for realizing the consumer use \xe2\x80\xa2 Low Energy Consumption Based on the characteristics of identity mapping the blockchain network can greatly reduce the dependence on hashing power and reduce consumption of computing resources and the energy consumption 17/74 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Public Participation Under the precondition of being secure and efficient Usechain will be able to support mining through mobile devices due to low resource and energy consumption allowing the public to participate in the ecosystem In the future Usechain will build secure high performance attack resistant and hardware based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to achieve a high level consensus algorithm of RPOW to further enhance security and performance The hardware will be adopted into people\xe2\x80\x99s daily life and widely applied on mobile devices such as phones Pad PDA or even smart watches bands and other smart devices 18/74 \x0cPART III USECHAIN ECOSYSTEM 19/74 \x0c1 Ecosystem Value Usechain has a leading team in blockchain technology that will work closely with partners and experts from global technical communities to establish a the first high performance mirror identity blockchain With the deep connections with top business schools Usechain has rich resources in various industries and will collaborate with reputable companies to create identity based applications The goal is to create an identity based blockchain ecosystem with the most advanced technology richest application scenarios and largest user community 20/74 \x0c2 Ecosystem Architecture A Users Individuals assets things and objects can use the verification mechanism and service applications in the Usechain ecosystem to complete mapping of address and identity verification It also helps to confirm and preserve users \xe2\x80\x99rights which can accumulate the value of identity by continually generating transparent and public behavioral data 21/74 \x0cB Application Participants Individuals and organizations can endorse identity verification for others based on their identity certification and contribute to the development of Usechain ecosystem Service providers however will be able to develop their own related business applications and to further expand their businesses based on the structure and system of Usechain C Technology Participants As the most essential participants in Usechain ecosystem the Usechain developing team is fully responsible for the architecture framework the development and operation of protocols the coordination work with partners in technology and continually optimizing the ability to operate in underlying public chain network layer and application layer and protocol layer within the ecosystem 22/74 \x0cIndividual has zero cost in learning and low entry threshold to tokenize identity Usechain will develop a channel to seamlessly connect the real and digital world to establish a high efficient secure unbounded and decentralized tool for value transmission and digitalize all things Within the identity ecosystem it has created a variety of diverse and flexible value transition channels which enables the transmission of value regardless of forms in high efficiency within the system This can be applied in many scenarios such as fan based or content based token economy the sharing of rights and interests with regards to trusted individual as well as the affirmation of sizeable assets Usechain foundation will also set public accounts and balance the price by buying in with other stable cryptocurrencies 23/74 \x0cScenario I Cryptocurrency Payment Users can use cryptocurrency stored in wallet for payment These payments will be processed in a decentralized peer to peer network without the involvement of centralized systems users can use cryptocurrency and digital discount coupons for payment In such payment method merchants can save on the transactions fees when using credit cards This also helps to achieve point topoint payment worldwide UST can be used to purchase digital coupons and merchants can use it as a promotional strategy by adjusting the limit of UST accepted 24/74 \x0cScenario II Decentralized Financial Services Usechain analyzes the behavioral data using identity mapping addresses to construct an open and transparent identity value and trust system The distributed ledger technology (DLT) is applied to broadcast the entire process in the blockchain network Hence the impact on identity credit status rating will also be permanently recorded on the blockchain As a result the cost to breach such credit rating system is too high The decentralized point to point transaction dramatically improve the efficiency in execution allowing individuals to have convenient secure and flexible access to provide and enjoy a range of inclusive financial services such as loans crowd funding and others 25/74 \x0cSubsequently everyone can perform mutual authentication The information recorded on the blockchain cannot be amended or deleted which makes the decentralized system reliable and trustworthy In conjunction with the personalized identity token users can even provides loans to others using tokens with identity mark which enables safe and efficient transfer of value between each other within the decentralized ecosystem Scenario III More Credible Sharing Economy Regardless of sharing a car a bicycle an apartment or an investment the crucial problem in a sharing economy is trust which however can be resolved by applying blockchain technology 26/74 \x0cTake Airbnb for example a stranger living in your home will definitely cause you concerns However if his/her previous behavioral data is broadcasted on the blockchain and will not be deleted or changed People can easily determine and conclude if the he/she is trustworthy before reaching a deal Under such circumstances individuals will pay more attention to their own behaviors Apart from the existing advantages of being transparent and local within the shared economy Usechain can use such economic model to provide sharing economy with higher level of credibility and mutual trust In addition any businesses using the sharing economy model will be linked to a realistic verified and immutable identity and a ledger of with similar characteristics Transaction histories are accessible to all parties Any misbehavior or misconduct will face absolutely transparent investigation 27/74 \x0cScenario IV More Efficient and Secure IoT Applications With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices it is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 6 58 smart devices attached to each person Particularly smart devices will be able to replace us in some of our day to day activities through smart IoT However IoT devices encounter various problems such as security risks privacy issues and high cost for operation because of being highly centralized Under the ecosystem of identity based Usechain it not only provides high performance secure and decentralized solutions but also featured characteristics such as high efficiency low cost in authentication and reliable identity verification for scenarios 28/74 \x0cwhich require identity based authentications like bicycle sharing car sharing NFC payments and others Scenario V Unattended Investment and Equity Management Many studies have shown that in the recent 100 years no investment returns in the stock markets can outperform that of passive index fund investment Many of the active funds are not only unable to generate high returns but also charge 1 3% exorbitant transaction fees revealing low management transparency asymmetry information and significant lack of trust The Usechain platform allows users to set up a decentralized fund to conduct passive investment in the market portfolio index Each transaction is transparent and there is no management fee Withdrawal is based on the net asset value minus a certain fixed transaction fees 29/74 \x0cIn addition the rights of beneficiary can be digitalized transferred or given allowing flexible usage for different purposes Scenario VI Decentralized Insurance Usechain will provide convenience for the self help in community Decentralized distributed ledger technology (DLT) allows people to build confidence in mutual aid accounts Every user in the community can use UST to participate in an unattended insurance fund There will be no premium collection and the investment in insurance funds is set in advance according to the algorithm This can be used in life and medical insurance Every participant will receive the corresponding guarantee insurance payout and a deduction to be made on the necessary expenses for notarized documents 30/74 \x0cSince all information is recorded on the blockchain chances of scams are greatly minimized thus reducing premium to near zero Scenario VII Decentralized Exchanges Currently there are hundreds of centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency market These exchanges acting as intermediaries to provide a platform for arbitrage trading have been revealed for market manipulation as well as setting high transaction fees to make profits They store users\xe2\x80\x99 digital asset and data in a centralized storage system which exposes users not only to threats from hackers but also the potential operational risks that exchanges might encounter First of all our public chain is decentralized with thousands tps and scalable This will be the bases for us to build a decentralized exchange We will also use RPOW to have a randomized central 31/74 \x0ctransaction matching service and a decentralized clearance and settlement serviced That is matching of buy and sell is still by a single dealer but the dealer is chosen randomly among a group of dealers The basis of our design is still based on RPOW Using a high performance identity based blockchain Usechain will be able to build a idecentralized exchange focusing on security efficiency and better user experience It ensures thatusers\xe2\x80\x99 asset will not be lost and remain intact n their accounts throughout the whole transaction process providing service for massive and low cost transmission of value and adequate liquidity for exchanges Decentralized exchanges will become the best trading platforms for personalized identity tokens Traditional financial assets such as stock gold etc can be converted into tokens As the Usechain ecosystem continues to grow the number of participants and resources will also increase to provide sufficient liquidity for decentralized exchanges in the future 32/74 \x0cScenario VIII Digital Content Production and Trading Content creators can perform copyright registration of their works based on blockchain technology and broadcast in the network to reach a consensus When copyright is violated the reliability to ensure the time when copyright is confirmed can be achieved by adding timestamp with the help of blockchain technology At the same time you can also apply for a judgement by voting With the help of characters brought by identity blockchain misbehavior will be broadcast within the network making the cost to violate copyrights and negative effects be enormous 33/74 \x0cAny content whose copyright is confirmed can achieve the transmission of value through exchanging UST in a decentralized and high efficient way You can even build your Usechain system centering on the value of individuals by issuing personalized identity tokens Scenario IX \xef\xbc\x9aTuition Fund With the gap between the rich and the poor widen many students are unable to afford the high tuition fees Usechain community is able to establish a tuition fund to provide interestfree loans and help students with financial pressure to complete their studies 34/74 \x0cEvery year alumni can donate cryptocurrency to establish funds In turn students who need financial support can apply for the interest free loans After graduation students can use their diploma to apply UST for repaying their student loans The diploma can also be used to build identity based tokens to repay the debt gradually Each year the tuition fund will issue interestfree loans to needy students At the same time loans that were borrowed before will be paid back at specific deadline If accounts do not have sufficient UST or equivalent amount of identity tokens it will automatically be extended for one year The priority to pay back will be based on the date when loads are applied If there are surplus funds left in the account it will be used to repay loan in advance After all loans and tuition fees are paid off the rest will be used to grant scholarships to students enrolling in the next following year There will not be any repayment for scholarships The major risk in student loans may be that students are unable to repay the debt However as blockchain technology is reliable insecuring the network and any data broadcast on thit is irreversible the likelihood for students not to pay back loans will be greatly reduced 35/74 \x0cScenario X Blockchain Games Through mapping real identity onto blockchain online communities can be established on blockchain network to create relationships and form teams One of the characteristics blockchain technology has is that it can still survive without the existence of its creator One possible application of such scenario will be the virtual self existent on blockchain 36/74 \x0cScenario XI Market Forecast UST will start by using renowned schools as evidence of trust to provide personalized token verification later it will provide verification for all participants and launch the UST derived ArrowDebreu Coin to commemorate Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu the two famous Nobel Prize winners in economics In 1954 Arrow Debreu first proposed that any economy could complete the market by adding a deterministic function of event states Following the AD model our system can add AD token to trade any commodity and verifiable events such as the price of a computer or the prediction of the US presidential election Token prices can be used to collect information from all over the world to reduce information asymmetry and help entrepreneurs to make more effective investment strategies At the same time investors can actively participate the development of global economy 37/74 \x0cPART IV USECHAIN GOVERNANCE 38/74 \x0c1 Usechain Foundation The Usechain Foundation (\xe2\x80\x9cFoundation\xe2\x80\x9d) is a non profit organization established in Singapore and is committed to developing Usechain advocating governance transparency and promoting the security and

party increases the level of security reliability and accuracy this audit cannot serve as any form of warranty including any expressed or implied warranty that the UST Smart Contract is fit for purpose or that it contains no flaws vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the complete loss of UST Tokens C Regulatory Risks The Blockchain technology including but not limited to the issues of tokens may be a new concept in some jurisdictions which may then apply existing regulations or introduce new regulations regarding Blockchain technology based applications and such regulations may conflict with the current setup of UST Smart Contract and the concept of UST Token This may result in substantial modifications of the UST Smart Contract including but not limited to its termination and the loss of UST Tokens as well as a suspension or termination of all UST Token functions 71/74 \x0cD Taxes Token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the
