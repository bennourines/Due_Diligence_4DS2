 ABSTRACT
 eSports is the new buzzword in the gaming industry that boasts a USD 137 9 billion market 
 According to Newzoo competitive play accounts for 60% of the total market share driving
 the eSports market to a 37 8% year on year growth of USD 900 million 
 With the rise of competitive games and eSports the need for verified gamer identity also
 grows in demand Gamer Identity that encompasses the gamer’s play history stats and
 reputation is now imperative when it comes to recruitment team management amateur to
 pro discovery tournament entry and more 
 However game companies holds all record of gamer activity Without the game company all
 data pertaining to the gamer cannot exist independently To add tournament stats that
 significantly contribute a team’s and/or pro gamer’s resume is stored by fragmented
 governing bodies As a result all parties within the gaming industry spend tremendous
 resources in terms of both time and cost to bridge the gap between gamers gamers and
 eSports teams gamers and tournament organizers and ultimately between gamers and
 game companies 
 So why doesn’t a service of the likes of LinkedIn exist for gamers 
 PlayerOne proposes to build a gamer identity standard powered by blockchain technology 
 In effect gamers will be able to consolidate all their gaming aliases on the blockchain under
 PlayerOne ID Without precedence we are shifting the ownership and use of gameplay stats
 to the gamer 
 To date the gaming industry has been unable to create a common gameplay database due
 to conflict of interest by competing parties We recognize that blockchain technology
 presents a unique means to entrust game data to be stored and to be reliably utilized by all
 pockets of the gaming industry 
 At PlayerOne we envision our protocol to lay the groundwork for a reliable gamer database 
 a New Trust Layer whereby gamers and related industry participants can reduce costs while
 instilling value in gamers’ experience

 BACKGROUND
 A gamer’s pseudonym was originally intended to serve as a frame of reference for individual
 achievement i e leaderboard As games transitioned from individual to group play on PC 
 mobile and console alike interactions added humanistic depth to the pseudonym creating a
 virtual identity Today 7 out of 10 gamers 1 4 billion and counting play MOBA (Multiplayer
 Online Battle Arena) or Battle Royale games including but not limited to League of Legend 
 Counter Strike Global Offensive (CS GO) Overwatch PlayerUnknown’s Battleground
 (PUBG) and DOTA2 
 The rise of online multiplayer games have also given rise to eSports in the mainstream The
 eSports market has grown 33% year over year and is projected to reach 1 billion players &
 viewers by 2023 To put it simply one third of gamers worldwide follow eSports 
 Counter to the rapid growth of popularity in eSports persists fundamental problems the
 industry struggles to address The absence of reliable storage and use of gamer data
 continue to give rise to controversies surrounding social and economic costs at the expense
 of both gamers and game companies

 PROBLEM
 Gamer to Gamer
 All games that require multiplayer strategy and tactics start with team/clan formation at the
 most basic level involving two parties a team seeker (player) and the member seeker (team
 captain) 
 Before joining a team players look into a team of interest and investigate style of gameplay 
 stats existing members and reputation of the team captain Likewise it is imperative for
 team captains to have a general understanding of the interested player’s stats 
 achievements activity and reputation Unfortunately both parties rely on haphazardly
 gathered information due to the lack of a standardized data representing either party 
 Player Discovery
 Upon speaking with an eSports pro team it was evident that consistent training of both pro
 and amateur players is essential 
 In traditionally recognized sports each player’s overall play history and statistics from
 amateur to league are managed through official governing bodies organizations and
 leagues Despite the staggering year on year growth of eSports the gaming industry lacks
 an organized body that keeps record of gamers’ stats from amateur to pro In addition to
 gaming companies owning the relevant statistical data crucial data contributing to gamer
 aptitude such as tournament entry and results are kept by fragmented governing bodies 
 During our talk with the pro team management we’ve also gathered that the the only
 effective yet susceptible means of player discovery and recruitment relies on gamer
 networks Due to the lack of organized and reliable gamer data not only is discovery and
 recruitment reliant on blind good faith and word of mouth but is also ultimately costly and
 time consuming when considering all the resources that goes into forming a strong team 
 Staggering Social Costs
 Death threats sexual harassment and trolling are common occurrences in gaming
 communities According to Venturebeat (2014) 47% have been cyberbullied and 63% of
 female gamers have been sexually harassed 74% of Ditch the Label’s 2017 survey said
 they would like the issue of cyberbullying to be taken more seriously and addressed 
 Cyberbullying comes at a cost for both gamers and game companies While a regrettable
 number of gamers are pushed to abandon games they’ve paid to play upon being prey to
 cyberbullying and in extension due to the lack of active monitoring and regulations
 surrounding cyberbullying game companies struggle to satisfy the needs of the said gamers
 due to the cost of losing gamers by ban 
 7
 The same immoral and unethical behavior that impede goodgame extends to cheating The
 penalty for using hacks and cheats in Counter Strike 2002 for instance was a mere 24 hour
 ban from the game Proving to be futile Valve Corporation the creators of Counter Strike 
 enforced lifetime bans for the same offense by 2005 This effort was also ineffective as new
 accounts were created by the same offenders As a result in May 2016 Valve had gamers
 register their phone number as a form of authentication and any account associated with the
 registered number that had an infraction would be banned 
 While these actions by Valve along with others in the industry are intended to be
 preventative it served ineffective merely chasing the tail of an established culture of gamer
 negligence The fragmented gamer data stored by competing entities that keep data siloed
 only exacerbates the culture of abuse and negligence 
 Game Developer
 As the competition between game companies grow marketing costs grows in tandem with
 profit loss As of now marketing costs are predominantly spent on user acquisition and
 retention 
 In the current advertising market structure gaming companies hire advertising agencies to
 improve brand visibility and access to ad inventory While game companies rely heavily on
 advertising intermediaries for ad release ad agencies struggle to address issues related to
 ad fraud According to Business Insider a near USD 16 4 billion of ad budgets was spent on
 counterfeit traffic and bots on the global digital advertising market in 2017 alone This figure
 more than doubled from USD 7 2 billion the previous year According to the World
 Federation of Advertisers the cost of fraudulent advertising worldwide is expected to
 increase to USD 50 billion over the next decade 
 In order to achieve cost effective user acquisition marketing efforts need to shift to the end
 user the gamer To date it is evident that gamers are an effective means of marketing by
 gamers’ word of mouth be it social media and/or streaming channels 
 In line with the aforementioned trend a number of gamer to gamer recommendation
 platforms have surfaced in the past years However even with gamer initiated platforms the
 fundamental threat of ad fraud persists Mainly amid gamer initiated recommendation
 platforms exists a network of abusers Differentiating true participants to cherrypickers is
 prevalent In other words it is impossible to differentiate true gamers’ respond to marketing
 efforts from abusers who participate as cherry pickers for the sole purpose of reaping the
 rewards alone 
 Now imagine an automated gamer profile service that live updates all gameplay stats In the
 profile section appears a ‘special invitation’ page where an inbox receives numerous
 invitations from game companies based on my gamer profile vis a vis my gameplay Under
 my sole discretion I choose from which game company I’d like to receive promotional invites
 and choose to participate Imagine upon my choice to participate I receive relevant rewards
 accordingly The more loyalty I display the more rewards can be claimed Imagine these
 rewards as token that are spendable in game to improve my gameplay experience Now
 extend your imagination where I chose to add my record of participation to my gamer profile 
 8
 feed where a reference program is automatically initiated where a community of gamers
 linked to my profile feed can also join and receive rewards as I too continue to increase my
 pool of rewards 
 As described in the above game companies must embody a fresh perspective to achieve a
 revolutionary cost efficient solution for user acquisition That is by truly bridging the gap
 between game company to gamer reach 
 SOLUTION
 Gamer ID Permanence
 Most gamers identify with a unique ID throughout a number of games in part because we
 thrive to be recognized and identified for unique skill and gameplay Simply put gamer ID
 represents a virtual self inside the game Gamer ID is also a representation of multifarious
 aspects of gameplay including but no limited to the game’s genre avatars and characters 
 favorite skins clans ranks team and friends To that note it is self explanatory as to why
 gamers may feel discontentment when identities are taken or copied 
 But what happens to my gamer id when a game ceases to exist 
 At the moment game ids are stored and owned by game companies resulting in game
 identities existing at the full discretion of the game company not the gamer 
 Gaming stats are not only a set of data but also a valuable asset that represents gaming
 experience and aptitude Whether the game survives or not gamer IDs should be able to
 survive with the gamer and be recognized for the unique gameplay associated with it 
 PlayerOne present a solution for gamer id permanence that exists at the sole discretion of
 the gamer 
 PlayerOne A gamer identity standard powered by blockchain
 To address the problems laid out in the aforementioned section gamers need a reliable 
 trustless identity standard A decentralized gamer LinkedIn powered by blockchain will allow
 gamers to consolidate multiple gamer ids under a unique PlayerOne ID to connect and
 manage skills stats and reputation based on gameplay 
 9
 Image 1 PlayerOne Concept
 10
 The core value of PlayerOne lies in connectivity Trust is imperative to build effective
 connectivity amongst all parties within the gaming industry PlayerOne will implement
 blockchain technology to provide the gaming industry with a trustless system of trust 
 Blockchain a trustless network
 Blockchain technology ensures a network of trust without a central authority governing each
 transaction and access to data The following three points below demonstrate how
 blockchain allows for trustless trust to be achieved through PlayerOne 
 Reliable Data
 Once activities linked to the gamer ID is verified by the Oracle and recorded on the
 blockchain the said data is immutable and irreversible To add given that the data is
 recorded on multiple nodes all verified data stored on the blockchain is safeguarded from
 any single point of failure 
 Neutrality
 For reliable storage and use of data the data must maintain industry neutral and distributed
 amongst data contributors (not a single entity a monopoly) Blockchain technology makes it
 possible for a decentralized data protocol to store and share data without relying on a
 singular central authority 
 Trust to Data Contributors
 In order to store data on the blockchain data contributors must be a verified private key
 holder In extension third party access to data is at the sole discretion of the private key
 holder the data contributor In the case that use of data generates monetary profits 
 proceeds will automatically be rewarded to the data contributor as defined by the smart
 contract that executes each transaction under full transparency 
 11
 PLAYERONE
 Vision
 We envision PlayerOne to lead in creating the global standard for gamer identities how they
 are searched and verified To that end PlayerOne will provide a lucrative universal gaming
 currency 
 Mission
 PlayerOne will build a trustless gamer database to support a reliable gaming environment for
 all parties involved in the gaming industry In effect we plan to build a standardized
 infrastructure where games and related services can operate and flourish cost efficiently 
 and where gamers can experience enhanced entertainment and monetize gameplay 
 Image 2 PlayerOne Identity Protocol

 USE CASE
 PlayerOne ID protocol can be used to improve existing game services and platforms or be
 used to develop new services In this section use cases for PlayerOne ID Protocol will be
 explained in detail Use cases below can be implemented by PlayerOne team by various
 partners in the game industry 
 Image 3 Protocol Use Case
 Game Marketing
 Once PlayerOne establishes a stable number of daily active users (DAU) PlayerOne will
 open a platform that supports marketing for businesses Given that PID profiles provide
 accurate targets for advertisers we expect to deliver an effective advertising model Also 
 game companies will be able to reduce their advertising costs reserved as commissions to
 ad intermediaries (about 20~30%) by directly inviting PlayerOne users through the system If
 game companies apply PID as their login method they can run accurate analytics to
 measure response to marketing efforts by cross checking with PID LTV (Life Time Value) 
 PlayerOne game marketing system can also contribute to improve game company’s sales
 directly For example PlayerOne can provide a payment function for game companies that
 implements PID login system It will allow PlayerOne users to purchase game or game items
 with PlayerOne tokens and eventually expand PlayerOne’s ecosystem 
 Gamer Search
 The demand for finding gamers from channels beyond those provided by game companies
 is increasing There are three main reasons that contribute to the rise in demand 
 13
 1 Dissatisfied with random in game matches
 2 Aversion towards cyberbullying by unknown matches
 3 Difficulty in coordinating play time
 Gamers looking for friends outside the game tend to turn to game communities However 
 most game communities operate through forums and/or postings making it difficult for
 gamers to communicate live with each other To add in order to familiarize with a matched
 gamer’s skill users must go through inconvenient steps and search for gamer IDs on
 alternative platforms to view in game achievement history 
 As PlayerOne ID Protocol’s first use case PlayerOne is preparing a ‘Gamer search’ service 
 Since PlayerOne ID (hereinafter PID) is already connected with gamer ID and in game stats 
 it will be possible to search and find gamers with enhanced convenience Even if you do not
 know the opponent’s in game ID you can easily find and communicate with gamers who are
 also looking for a friend The concept of PlayerOne’s gamer search method is explained
 below 
 ● One Process search filters (levels achievement) mutual verification real time
 matching
 Reputation
 Reputation data based on P2P is an important data PlayerOne must develop Reputation
 data will play an important role in solving problems in the game industry such as verbal
 abuse trolling use of cheats and etc which both gamers and game companies struggle to
 address to this day In addition data pertaining to reputation can be a significant point of
 reference for recruitment 
 Players connected by gamer search service can write recommendations to each other after
 a match similar to leaving endorsement reviews on Linkedin We have chosen this format
 because we believe the result of a positive campaign (more rewards to users with positive
 reviews) will be more effective 
 Gamers writing recommendation can rate their game skills and gameplay 
 Recommendations will appear on both PID profiles Simply put since everyone can search
 and check matched profiles by achievement reputation number of recommended reviews 
 number of friends and more Gamers who have a history of receiving recommendations are
 authorized to write recommendations and they will be rewarded once the recommendation is
 submitted Gamers with more quality recommendations will be displayed at the top of the
 gamer search result 
 Team Management
 As more gamers play competitive games which require forming teams millions of teams are
 created in conjunction with a million that disappear on the daily basis It is within bounds to
 say that the victory of team based games depend on team management Interviews with 
 14
 gamers and team managers who are looking for new teams or members both express the
 need for a comprehensive history of gamer records 
 Information needed by each group is as follows 
 A Team seeker
 ○ Team achievement gameplay style and preferences
 ○ Team manager information
 ○ Team member information
 B Member seeker
 ○ Gamer skill and aptitude
 ○ Record from previous team (activities contribution transfer history etc)
 PlayerOne aims to provide an integrated team management system for team manager as
 shown below 
 ● Recruiting gamer search system team page transfer fee
 ● Team seeker evaluation game record achievement reputation data
 ● Communication sharing information scheduling match times
 ● Evaluation and dismissal activity record data for team members dismiss teammates
 with poor contribution 
 ● Tournament tournament participation prize distribution
 Image 4 Team Management System
 The team management system we propose will be synchronized with the gamer search
 system When a team manager uploads the conditions of recruitment on the system this
 information will be added to the gamer search database This will spontaneously solve the
 current system of recruiting a new member To add teams recruiting a new member can
 invite verified players by checking their own gamer database 
 In future development phases a function of proposing fees for scouting and transfers will be
 added Team managers will be able to use PlayerOne token as a means of payment to scout 
 15
 outstanding gamers while gamers will be incentivized to groom their PID profile and
 monetize on gameplay 
 To support the recruitment function a team page will be added to the platform Team pages
 will display information depicting team preferences team managers and members 
 achievements and tournament histories 
 Team activity records generated by PlayerOne’s team management system will also
 strengthen individual gamer’s profile by providing information that is not provided by game
 companies For example team preference and longevity of membership and team transfer
 records can be used as an important indicator to evaluate the gamer 
 Community based eSports League
 As more teams use PlayerOne’s team management system we plan to organize an
 community based eSports league 
 Once the tournament system is synced with the team management system tournament
 history player verification tournament result and prize payment functions will be available in
 a single integrated service In effect improving the accuracy of search and result verification 
 in game data video playbacks and community votes 
 Moreover PlayerOne plans to open tournaments guided by rules proposed by community
 members and add to traditional eSports tournaments On PlayerOne regular tournaments
 will be scheduled where prizes can be paid in PlayerOne tokens and sponsorships 
 Tutoring
 Gamers spend tremendous time and effort to level up Recently gamers have been turning
 to Youtube and Twitch to learn tips from veteran streamers and professional gamers 
 On that note we recognize a potential for growth with game tutoring service to take a
 foothold in the ever growing games market Gamers can directly learn tips and strategies by
 forming a team with tutors to play games or by watching videos playbacks with a coach Our
 outlook on gaming tutoring services that include but are not limited to live voice chats and
 game recording platforms is tangential to professional gamers’ efforts to manage their fans
 and donations through in addition to streaming platforms 
 Game tutoring falls in a service sector that can grow organically with PlayerOne The core
 function of gamer search system can also be used for tutor search where PlayerOne tokens
 can be used as payment 
 PlayerOne profiles can further represent a resume for game tutors Gamers can search
 tutor’s PID for their information such as game history and reputation to decide whether the
 tutor is qualified or not before paying for tutorial services Gamers can earn tokens by
 reviewing qualified tutors’ coaching abilities after each session

 Image 5 Protocol & Business Layer
 TECHNICAL DETAIL
 PlayerOne Identity Protocol
 As gamers register on PlayerOne gamers can own a unique identity called ‘PlayerOne ID’
 (hereinafter PID) PID creates a blockchain account linked to the PID account The reason
 why PID account is created separately from blockchain account is to make it simple for
 everyone to search and view 
 In game ID registered by gamer is verified by PlayerOne’s game ID validation process 
 When in game ID is verified this ID is connected to the PID and data is recorded on the
 blockchain whenever gamer activity is generated 
 Irrespective of whether PlayerOne or any game company terminates its service gamers’
 record is preserved on the blockchain permanently Given that the gamer owns their 
 17
 blockchain account (public key and private key) gamers will be able to access and utilize
 their game record permanently 
 
 Gamers can use PID for various purposes including connecting with other gamers P2P
 commercial transaction participating in tournaments identification method for transferring to
 other game teams etc When the PlayerOne API is released all parties engaged in the game
 industry such as game companies game communities item markets eSports associations 
 professional gamer teams can use PID to process verification and login In addition all
 parties can view gamer’s record by searching PID and send friend requests team transfer
 requests and participate in beta test Rights to receive or accept such requests are at the
 gamers sole discretion 
 Tiers of Verification
 PlayerOne supports a three tier system of verification Based on the level of service range
 they wish to use users have the option to choose among these tiers of verification 
 First tier verification allows quick access to the service by requesting minimum verification
 from the users An outside messenger called OAuth (Open Authentication) which
 implements phone number authentication is used in this verification tier As a result 
 PlayerOne can only accept registration from users who are verified by their phone number
 authentication without collecting their phone numbers When users pass this messenger
 OAuth authentication they can register their IDs in various games they play 
 Second tier verification requires users to verify their in game aliases with PlayerOne In
 order to verify their in game aliases users will take a screenshot of their in game page
 depicting their in game ID and achievements by using the PlayerOne application Captured
 image will be automatically sent to the PlayerOne server compared with the game ID and ingame stats registered in the first tier verification step Second tier verification is completed
 when in game aliases registered in PlayerOne and the actual in game ID match with each
 other Users who completed second tier verification will be marked with ‘Verified ID’ on their
 gamer profile Also Their PID and blockchain ID will activate a private token wallet to receive
 rewards 
 Third tier verification is applicable for PID to real world ID matching For example identity
 authentication for gamers participating in tournament or when ID theft related disputes occur 
 it is imperative to go through KYC authentication (identification issued by government 
 mobile phone verification) When game ID theft is reported reporter’s KYC is processed first
 and then the KYC of reported user’s authentication is processed 
 ● Tier One Registration Register in game ID access to basic service
 ● Tier Two Verify game ID create blockchain account token wallet activated
 ● Tier Three Participate in game tournament
 Game Data Oracle
 The nature of blockchain technology allows for immutability permanence and transparency 
 also known as ‘Network of Trust’ However blockchain smart contracts cannot judge 
 18
 whether data being recorded on the blockchain is true or false If unverified false information
 is recorded on blockchain the advantages of blockchain implementation can backfire At
 PlayerOne we recognize the importance of adding an Oracle to bridge the real world with a
 reliable yet trustless blockchain layer 
 Gamer identity represents a multitude of gamer activities Gamers are engaged in different
 channels such as game streaming platform game marketplace and game communities 
 PlayerOne will provide a comprehensive gamer identification by utilizing raw data from
 verified external platforms providing OAuth and API (Application Programming Interface) and
 creating additional data generated internally 
 ● External platform OAuth and API Game ID achievement data social
 channel(YouTube Twitch) social indexes (number of subscribers viewers)
 ● Internal data Number of friends reputation team team transfer history tournament
 participation records
 Multiple ID Resolution
 In order to prevent multiple PID creation PlayerOne will utilize messenger OAuth such as
 Kakaotalk Wechat Line which has mobile phone number verification system for registration 
 If any user tries to create a second PID game IDs that are connected with previous PID
 cannot be connected with the newly created PID In other words newly created PID must be
 connected with a new in game ID Therefore game records associated with game IDs that
 were connected to an existing PID will be lost It is possible to change game IDs that are
 connected under PID but history of changing the game ID will be also displayed under PID 
 This will prevent malicious attempts at changing game IDs 
 Blockchain Platform
 In order to prevent malicious attacks and reward block creators most blockchains charge
 fees for every transaction recorded on the blockchain However blockchain services that
 serve the public like PlayerOne must be able to process thousands of blocks per second on
 blockchain In this case charging a transaction fee for each record comes at a major
 obstacle to scale up
 Instead of taking risks of developing a new blockchain and delay service release PlayerOne
 will develop our services on the EOS blockchain Upon due diligence its become evident
 that the EOS blockchain best suites our service in terms of having no transaction fees and
 allowing for low latency Changes in selection of blockchain platform may occur in the future
 depending on the conditions and progression of our platform development If necessary 
 PlayerOne may develop its own blockchain 
 EOS is a smart contract platform for public services On the EOS blockchain service
 providers cover all the transaction fees by staking EOS so that users are not charged
 transaction fees In addition to transaction fees TPS (Transaction Per Second) can pose a
 major problem for blockchain services EOS Blockchain uses ‘Delegated Proof of Stake
 Consensus’ introduced in Bitshares and Steem In October 2018 EOS blockchain 
 19
 announced that it requires 0 5 second to create a new block and can processes over 3 000
 transactions per second

 Image 6 Platform Structure
 TOKEN MODEL
 PlayerOne Token (henceforth ‘PLO’) is an EOS based utility token that can be used as a
 means of payment within the PlayerOne and its affiliate partner services PLO is transferable
 between individual users and exchangeable at exchanges 
 In order to promote a healthy circulation of utility tokens we recognise that one tokens
 must be organically earnable on the service layer and two tokens must have value as a
 means of purchase Given that PLO will be earned predominantly by gamers it is imperative
 to create an environment where PLO is spendable on gamer related services and goods 
 To expand our ecosystem PlayerOne will build an economy based on PlayerOne Token 
 Components mentioned below will operate in conjunction with another and contribute to the
 statement above 
 ● PlayerOne Token PLO
 ● Gamer Power Index GP
 ● Level System
 ● Service & Marketplace
 21
 PLO
 PLO is an tradeable utility token to which participants are rewarded on PlayerOne PLO can
 be exchanged between individuals and at exchanges 
 GP
 GP is the numeric representation of participants’ activity within the ecosystem The amount
 of tokens rewarded depends on GP count 
 Level System
 Levels are an extrapolation of the users’ GP and represents status In addition to token
 rewards users gain privileges and benefits according to their level 
 Service & Market Place
 PlayerOne will provide a marketplace where PLO can be used for payment 
 TOKEN ECONOMY
 Encouraging Participation
 In order to accelerate and growth in terms of both number of users and active participation in
 the ecosystem PlayerOne users can earn PLO as rewards through taking various actions as
 listed below Activities that grant rewards will expand and change as the PlayerOne services
 develop 
 ● Profile Building Linking in game aliases Linking social media and streaming
 channels (e g Youtube Twitch) Purchase history reputation add friends and team
 activity 
 ● Tournament participation PlayerOne sponsored
 ● Recommendation Review played games recommend and invite friends
 ● Response to Marketing Join early bird offers beta tests and respond to various
 marketing efforts
 ● Event Participation
 The amount of PLO rewarded is determined by the user’s GP GP is a numerical algorithm
 that represents the users’ contribution to the ecosystem Higher the GP trhe more the PLO
 rewards GP is not a fixed number but a metric that is continuously subject to change
 according to the gamers’ degree of activity In other words when a gamer’s activity is
 stagnant GP will reduce and reflect in amount of tokens rewarded 
 Apart from monetary rewards gamers’ influence and access within the community is critical 
 Playerone will implement a level system divided into five tiers to reflect GP (Diamond 
 22
 Platinum Gold Silver Bronze) Higher within the level system users will be given benefits
 including discounts event invitations closed beta tests and will be granted privileges as an
 administrator within PlayerOne communities The purpose of the level system is to maintain
 consistent gamer activity 
 Expansion of Token Use
 PlayerOne will provide services within the platform to promote a healthy circulation of PLO to
 increase and maintain PLO value We recognize that utility tokens are subject to substantial
 loss of value without a diverse extension of use cases which leads to user earnings being
 cashed out at exchange As a measure to prevent this PlayerOne will curate an array of use
 cases of PLO as listed below The list may expand and change with the development of
 PlayerOne services and functions 
 ● Personal (Profile) PR Boost ID visibility and search results promote team and post
 team recruitment openings
 ● Service Fee Premium team management tools (e g recruitment calendar page
 design)
 ● Trading Transfer fee coaching fee donations
 ● Marketplace Gift cards (Steam Google Play App Store etc ) Gaming show and
 tournament tickets Merchandise Blockchain games discount and promo codes (ingame currency internet cafe webtoons VOD etc )
 Encouraging Token “HODL”
 In conjunction with expanding token use it is also important to keep PLO within the
 ecosystem To do so the amount of PLO held by an account will affect GP In other words if
 the users PLO amount in their account goes down so will their GP GP count will as
 mentioned above then affect the users amount of token rewarded and level which further
 affects users’ benefits and privileges However we will implement a system where PLO
 payments within the PlayerOne ecosystem will be protected from GP loss given that PLO
 use within the ecosystem will return to the PLO reward pool 
 Expansion of Token Demand
 With the growth of PlayerOne user the demand for gamer acquisition access to data and
 thereby purchase of PLO will increase PLO purchase will mainly take place on the business
 to business level The preliminary set of use cases are as listed below 
 ● Advertisement
 ● Game Data API Access/Subscription Fee
 ● PlayerOne ID API Access/Subscription Fee
 ● Tournament Sponsorship
 When it comes to cryptocurrencies we understand that companies are faced with issues
 reconciling payments legally To address this industry wide issue PlayerOne will provide a
 fiat to crypto payment solution Once payments are made in fiat currency PlayerOne will
 transfer the equivalent amount of PLO to the purchasing account which can then be utilized 
 23
 for ecosystem expansion purposes To deal with PLO value fluctuation on a business
 standpoint PlayerOne will provide a mechanism to stabilize the purchased value of PLO for
 business use To better understand please advise the case scenario depicted below 
 Let’s assume that the customer acquisition cost (CAC) is set at USD 1 and 1 PLO is
 equivalent to USD 1 Now assuming that the business purchases 1000 PLO for USD 1000
 assuming CAC to be set at USD 1 PlayerOne will fix CAC to value of PLO upon purchase 
 In other words even if the value of 1 PLO fluctuates to USD 0 5 the business is guaranteed
 1000 users not 500 However let’s assume the value of 1 PLO increases to USD 2 In this
 case PlayerOne will provide the business to adjust CAC to the value of PLO upon purchase 
 and will be able to increase Return on Investment (ROI) to 2000 By doing so PlayerOne
 plans to minimize the risk of potential fluctuations of PLO value and maximize the benefits
 of the business’ ROI 
 PLO transaction made in the marketplace is critical to maintain PLO circulation within the
 platform Game companies will be able to sell games and items on the PlayerOne
 marketplace When a user makes a purchase in the marketplace PLO will be transferred
 from the gamer’s account to the game companies’ account This way game companies can
 earn PLO spend on PlayerOne services and fees and receive a 30% discount on a monthly
 basis
