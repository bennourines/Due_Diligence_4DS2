focuses on extensive technological innovation and diverse fields of application FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain network has been designed to actualize the real \xe2\x80\x98decentralization\xe2\x80\x99 and contribute to the advancement of the blockchain ecosystem by enhancing the independence and scalability of DApps As an unprecedented type of blockchain FLETA allows more freedom and efficiency in developing and providing services With the goal of maximizing the potential of blockchain technology FLETA came up with a breakthrough It all starts from our unique and original blockchain structure which distributes subchains in a layered chain for each DApp Through Block Redesign verification speed becomes faster and data volume is reduced In addition block generation speed has been reduced with more transactions processed per block FLETA provides the function to create a customized subchain for each DApp where the transaction of its token and assets can be made Run through its own network each DApp can update independently based on its own governance frontend and backend development environment Additionally high speed block transaction is made possible through parallel processing and instant confirmation of observer node High GAS price and functional degradation of DApps have also been resolved Other innovative technologies such as a multichain structure parallel sharding and a new consensus model (PoF) contributed to resolving problems which the current blockchain ecosystem is facing FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s innovative technology and platform will play a leading role in the spread of diverse DApps throughout the industry and in advancing the blockchain ecosystem Project Background This year marks the tenth anniversary of Bitcoin which is a firstgeneration cryptocurrency using blockchain technology Market capitalization of Bitcoin reached 112 billion dollars and that of the overall cryptocurrency market is more than twice that figure 1) For the first 8 months in 2018 a total of 18 7 billion dollars was made from ICOs which is three times that of same period last year In 2016 there were 43 ICO cases and that number has surged to 770 this year already 2) It is expected that by the end of the year there will be over 20 times growth compared to two years ago Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 3 References 1)http //www coinmarketcap com 2)https //www coinschedule com/ stats html year=2016 \x0cEthereum which emerged in 2014 adopted turing complete language for smart contract actualizing the various potentials of blockchain Subsequently blockchain app platform emerged giving the idea of the blockchain ecosystem The utilization of blockchain went beyond cryptocurrency and started to be utilized in various industries including finance and public organizations Despite this fact blockchain based DApps are still hard to find The reality is that the DApps which actually provide services are in their initial stages Blockchain is arousing interest in decentralization and is also is being discussed as an alternative to resolve data monopolization along with startups who are coming up with innovations It is global giants however who are investing the most and the Big 3 Bitcoin Mining Pool comprises 60% as the mining of cryptocurrency already became another field for corporations 3) In theory the attack of the 51% became feasible Blockchain is still undervalued as a field only for engineers In terms of technology the utilization and development of decentralization is inconspicuous except for the voting process Various consensus mechanisms or voting systems are being introduced In order for the blockchain technology to contribute to the real \xe2\x80\x98decentralization\xe2\x80\x99 the advancement of the blockchain ecosystem must precede FLETA believes that such an environment starts from DApps being able to function independently without going through a centralized mining group and being a decision maker Based on this belief FLETA has started its journey to realize true decentralization by forging a complete and independent DApp ecosystem This white paper will give you an idea on our thought process to support an independent DApp ecosystem and to raise applicability of blockchain technology in industries so that the technology can go beyond being just hype Our profound ideas and their results are described in this paper Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 4 References 3)https //bitcoinchain com/pools \x0cVision FLETA project aims to provide a service platform like Google Android or Apple iOS in blockchain supporting the efficient development and operation of DApps for constructing blockchain based applications ecosystem along with continuous technological innovations This includes resolving the issues in developing and operating DApps through Ethereum or EOS and providing a perfect decentralized economy through DApp independence and scalability It starts from simply lightening the burden of GAS or STAKE and increasing transaction speed Ultimately the goal is to construct a sustainable ecosystem with the users by achieving combining and expanding the objectives of all projects FLETA team has already come up with original and innovative technology upgrading the core of the blockchain technology We proudly introduce our newly advanced platform which realizes our vision through technological innovations Projects of FLETA FLETA is a blockchain service platform with enhanced efficiency and independence of DApp development and operation along with infinite scalability It provides a groundbreaking unprecedented blockchain structure allowing DApps within platforms to operate independently and freely First we maximized the function of blockchain technology This was possible due to increased transaction speed high freedom and low development cost which in turn enhances the efficiency of DApp development and operation Secondly we provide a distinguished token economy which guarantees the independence of DApps Last but not least FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s advanced blockchain technology and DApp independence open the door to infinite scalability Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 5 \x0c1 Maximizing Functions of Blockchain Technology FLETA came up with a new consensus model Instead of the existing model PoW (Proof of Work verify calculating process) or PoS (Proof ofStake verify stake) FLETA developed a new consensus model to prevent unnecessary fork This new model is called PoF (Proof of Formulation) in which consensus is made on block mining procedure and blocks are generated in designated order This allows block\xe2\x80\x99s dissemination range to be reduced resulting in faster block generation and dissemination Moreover observer node enables instant confirmation and prevents fork In turn network becomes stable and transaction speed is increased When new tokens are generated in FLETA their own transaction chains are created and blocks are processed through PoF consensus model and token economy Thus the mainchain and each subchain of DApps are not mutually influenced operating independently in a parallel structure FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s sharding model is novel model of sharding operating in complete independence so that data is not mutually shared This system enables each and every chain that is generated to operate as a mainchain Additionally the independent chains work under the same address system which in the eyes of users could seem as if one address is being processed with one wallet In fact however many shards operate independently to promptly process the transaction Cross transactions among shards are not used but instead wallet separates the shards itself so that users are lightened of the burden of choosing to which shard they should transmit the transaction Execution fee is decided regardless of the number of shards used in a transaction making the user not recognize the shard in the transaction process 2 Distinguished Token Economy DApp tokens in FLETA are mined under certain token economy system of DApps depending on their own parameter value Additionally the mining reward and execution fee can be customized based on the preference of each DApp This function is made possible after the initial generation of token through the Smart Contract which is called Token Update on the rewarding system is made through the update in Smart Contract using DApp governance which concurrently means that update can be done without fork swap wallet update or any pauses Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 6 \x0c3 Scalability Achieved through Multichain Structure FLETA consists of a mainchain and many subchains that operate on top making a multichain platform altogether Not only the blockchain but the data chain is expanded when DApps are added Building on it is the separation of data through which infinite scalability is attained Maintaining and managing subchains are the responsibilities of Formulator of each DApp and subchains can be accessed through seed node as listed in the main chain Thus synchronizing the Formulator group resolves maintaining and accessing issues of other multichain structures Each subchain is allocated exclusively to the pertinent DApp which signifies that DApp manager is given free rein to carry out functions like update and data migration In addition execution fee can be paid with each DApp\xe2\x80\x99s token and if the DApp manager insists there might be no execution fees at all Through such features a multichain that guarantees DApp independence in every way from function data and token mining has been developed Thus FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s multichain system overcomes the shortcomings of the existing chain systems Innovations of FLETA The four technological innovations and three platform innovations in which blockchain functions are maximized token economy is distinguished and scalability is expanded are as follows 4 Technological Innovations 3 Platform Innovations New Block & LEVEL TreeVerification Ultra High Speed TPS New Consensus Model PoF (Proof of Formulation) Infinite DApp Scalability Independent Multichain Structure Token Economy Parallel Sharding Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 7 \x0c1 Four Technological Innovations of FLETA 1 1 New Block & LEVEL Tree Verification Method FLETA newly designed and upgraded the block structure which is the core of the blockchain technology Blocks that were 560 bytes in one transaction have been reduced to under 360 bytes leading to faster transaction speeds This is the most fundamental approach to enhance the transaction speed without making changes in protocol or design such as consensus algorithm and sharding model Additionally FLTEA adopted LEVEL Tree verification method replacing the existing Merkle Tree verification method This also is a technological breakthrough that enhances the real transaction speed itself The replacement results in more than 5 times faster verification speeds With the new block & LEVEL Tree verification method FLETA actualized more than eightfold transaction speed increase compared to the prior blockchains Moreover FLETA employs a Hybrid method combining UTXO and Account UTXO which can be used right away without creating an account And Account which can be used with less execution fee and data They both coexist in harmony to enhance both usability and efficiency Additionally DApps are able to provide new types of data and service in a chain level not a smart contract level through a plug in system of Account type and Transaction type 1 1 11 Block Structure Redesign U S P(United States Patent) Application Number 62717703 The block structure is the basis of blockchain technology directly leading to the processing speed and storage volume FLETA redesigned the block structure to reduce blocksize increase processing speed and reducing index volume needed for operation Blocks consist of a block header and a transaction list the latter taking up most of the volume Thus reducing each transaction size concurrently leads to reduced blocksize volume network traffic and block processing time Vin and signature takes up the biggest volume which indicates the coins to be used In Bitcoin vin is indicated with Transaction Hash and the used Txld and N Additionally many possessors can put coins in the vin of one transaction meaning that the numbers of signatures required are equivalent to the number of vins 32 Bytes of Txld 4 Bytes of N and 65 Bytes of signature results in a total of 101 Bytes per coins Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 8 \x0cIn FLETA Txld is indicated with block height and transaction location within the block reducing the Txld to 6 Bytes and N to 2 Bytes Moreover only coins of one possessor can be used in one transaction to reduce the required number of signatures Statistics show that the average transaction size is 560 Bytes including approximately 3 vins and 3 vouts By changing it to FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s new block structure the size reduces by 43% resulting in 320 Bytes Making use of the block height and transaction location within blocks give various advantages in operation as well The existing verification method utilizes Transaction Hash thereby requiring Index DB to find the original transaction Thus in Bitcoin 50 GB Index is required to process 100 GB data However in FLETA a large Index is unnecessary as the Txld indicates the coordinates of the transaction and addition Index DB is not used in the process 1 1 21 LEVEL Tree Verification In the traditional Merkle Tree data structure data is transmitted through P2P (peer to peer) or use din verification process of data exchange in a database like Cassandra This is mainly used when relatively big volume over 1 MB has to be processed by the node Also when only a proportion is recognized not the whole Merkle Tree clear verification is hard to be make Thus in order for clear and correct verification to take place the presence of the entire Merkle Tree is a prerequisite and entails a whole lot of calculation Even if Merkle Tree guarantees the verification in a practical level a lot of memory and calculation is required for SPV (Simple Payment Verification) FLETA employs LEVEL Tree method clustering 16 blocks as one unit to hash and hash that unit into 16 parts This is a much more efficient system making a tree where the hash process of the transaction is simplified and each level has 16 subunits Using this tree system makes 1 route 16 level 1s 256 level 2s 4 096 level 3s and total transaction list of 65 545 (In the serialization process 2 Bytes is used to limit the maximum number transaction variable can be 0 65 535) Way less memory and calculation resources are utilized guaranteeing verification of transaction with less resource and network communication in mobile devices in which tree is saved 1 1 31 Light Node LEVEL Tree not the entire tree is saved in light node and it requests information in need to the full node If LEVEL 3 Tree data is saved only 16 Hash and 1 Transaction is sufficient to search specific transaction or verify the validity Therefore even if there is low memory it can be used with very fast verification process Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 9 \x0c1 2 New Consensus Model PoF (Proof of Formulation) FLETA came up with a new consensus model replacing the existing models like PoW (Proof of Work verify calculation process) or PoS (Proof of Stake verify stake) and preventing unnecessary Fork The new consensus model is PoF (Proof of Formulation) generates blocks in a designated order agreeing on the block mining order This allows the block generation and dissemination to be faster as the dissemination range of blocks are reduced In addition instant confirmation is made possible through the observer node 1 2 11 Consensus Algorithm PoF (Proof of Formation) U S P(United States Patent) Application Number 62717695 Consensus algorithm is one of the most fundamental parts of the blockchain network This verifies the validity of the generated blocks and guarantees the authenticity within the network PoW (Proofof Work) PoS (Proof of Stake) and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) are the mostly commonly known algorithms PoW algorithm raises the level of difficulty through mining competition resolving the issue of civil attack or double spending attacks PoS algorithm resolves the issue of high power consumption of PoW as the mining reward is allocated proportionate to the amount of coins In DPoS algorithm the token possessor uses the block generator or the witness system to carry out mining and verification resolving the transaction speed issue That is in a general blockchain network blocks can be generated simultaneously from networks all over the world Thus it uses a method in which block generation time is adjusted through level of difficulty in order to prevent Fork resulting in a serious reduced speed of the blockchain FLETA resolves the issue with an innovational design as the Formulator group reaches a consensus on the block mining order The block generation process of FLETA consists of a block generator and a synchronization group The Formulator group shares and confirms the block generation sequence in the network and carries on the block generation following the shared and synchronized sequence The highest rank Formulator generates the blocks and the next blocks are generated by the runner up continuing this circulatory process Ultra high speed transaction mechanism is provided and a stable block generation is executed FLETA came one step closer to decentralization through the PoF consensus model and complemented the setbacks of the existing algorithms by actualizing an ultra high speed transaction speed Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 10 \x0c1 2 2 Block Generation through Formulator Group Verification The block generation order of PoF (Proof of Formulation) follows the score rank of the Formulator group The highest node is allocated with the role of block generator and 2nd ~10th ranks are given the role as a synchronization group The block generator generates blocks signs and then sends them to the next observer node Next the observer node uses the public key of the next highest ranked block generator to confirm blocks and signatures Observer node confirms at least 3 of the 5 blocks through signatures The next synchronization group receives the blocks and confirms the entire transaction record and observer node\xe2\x80\x99s signature adding blocks to the blockchain and sending the synchronized result to all the connected nodes After the 1st node who generated blocks goes out of the group the 11th node comes in and the sequence begins again The order is all determined by block height so it cannot be changed randomly and also cannot be forged as every node verifies the same result Like this the synchronization group disseminates blocks lightening the traffic burden of observer nodes and block generator and disseminating the generated blocks swiftly When the generated blocks are added to the blockchain the prior 1st node automatically moves down the rank and the runner up becomes the 1st rank generating the next blocks All the nodes which receive blocks confirm the blocks and signatures As a result blocks with false transactions are denied of being added into the chain Likewise the block generation process of PoF (Proof of Formulation) reduces the time of block generation and verification uses synchronized sequence to generate blocks and prevents Fork as observer nodes verify the process realtime In addition as the block generation and synchronization are subdivided each group can focus their energy on a certain task lightening the burden of the network The synchronization group and observer node all focus on the designated role so the network overload is avoided For the most efficient block generation process the highest rank node can generate blocks continuously Limitations in block generation are initially set as default but can be amended through governance 1 2 3 Fork Prevention As a result of such an efficient and innovative system Fork is prevented When two blocks of the same height go into the observer node Fort is detected as 3 out of 5 nodes required signature Fork therefore is prevented as the observer node detects the collision in signature If observer node deviates the normal protocol due to security threats chain is put to a stop and assets are protected via Panic Protocol If the Formulator group deviates the normal protocol that Formulator is put to a stop via Formulator Ban Protocol Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 11 \x0c1 3 Independent Multichain Structure In the existing blockchain mainchain included so many DApps and the mining group had to operate the mainchain and all other subchains This easily led to the overload of the mining group On the other hand FLETA employs a structure in which each subchain independently operates its own chain resolving the aforementioned issue Thus FLETA separates function and data field so that DApps are not influenced by one another providing infinite scalability to DApps 1 3 11 Multichain Protocol Most of existing coins consist of a single mainchain maintain mainnet In this case all transactions are mutually referenced which requires all the data in order to verify the validity of each transaction FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s multichain structure however allows each DApp to have its own independent chain with separated observer node and Formulator to operate the chain independently Also that DApp\xe2\x80\x99s token is used instead of FLETA coin in creating Formulator which concurrently signifies full independence 1 3 21 Independent Chain The existing multichain and independent chain network had a lot of setbacks To start with it is hard to determine who has to operate both the mainchain and independent chain Also it is hard to determine the order of the miners when the blocks are continuously generated Lastly the problem lies in storing data The problem of determining data possessor or the problem in volume may cause a loss in connection in synchronization among networks in multichain network In FLETA seed node and observer node operate in a server accessible from outside (Public IP) synchronizing with the network and maintain the chain procedures Additionally without depending on the Formulator of mainchain each subchain constitutes a Formulator thereby operating independently even when the mainchain stops to operate 1 4 Parallel Sharding Parallel processing of transaction is a pivotal technology actualizing high speed transaction speed In FLETA transaction is allocated to certain shard according to a pre determined rule and transaction result is processed independently in each shard That is each shard operates independently without being included or mutually connected with other shards meaning each shard has its own chain One account can access all the shards with the same key and address Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 12 \x0cIn FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s new sharding model each shard operates independently as if it is a single mainchain to actualize the real sharding technology The mainchain consists of and maintains various shard chains and each chain operates independently in a parallel structure which means that double spending is not feasible in this design This in turn provides an unmatched transaction speed making all token and coin transactions fast and efficient 1 4 11 Multichain Based on Transaction Sharding Unlike single chain structure each shard of FLETA has an independent chain Thus each shard is not mutually influenced and processes in a parallel structure within an independent blockchain Shard System basically does not share data and therefore double spending is not possible in this design Independent chains of shards actualize complete parallel structure increasing the processing speed 2 Three Platform Innovations of FLETA 2 1 Actualization of Ultra High Speed TPS TPS feasible in FLETA platform is ultimately traced back to the network speed and signature verification speed Our original platform network Geolocational Balanced Peer Selection Algorithm enables blocks to be distributed swiftly and evenly This network algorithm is designed to connect peers with geolocational balance The distance is determined by ping and the lopsidedness of the network can be avoided receiving nodes by group which is generated through distance The network distance creates as much distance as possible in order to make it as even as possible to avoid lopsidedness to a certain direction If many signatures are required in FLETA transaction it can be made possible through creating a multiple signature account and putting in various addresses as authenticator when creating it To use that account all the signatures of the multiple addresses are required This clear design reduces the complexity of multiple signatures and simplifies the verification procedure secp256k1 based ECDSA signature algorithm can carry out max 23 000 verification per second in a parallel processing of 8 core CPU This requires 1 4 MB/s network speed in order for such transaction to be transmitted Thus FLETA aims to reach 20 000 TPS through our original block design Txld of FLETA uses bock height and transaction location within the block instead of transaction hash Concurrently the need for a big index Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 13 \x0cdiminishes alleviating the burden when searching for transaction Verification is made via signature so its validity is secured even without using transaction hash This instant transaction searching reduces index and data volume Through our own original parallel sharding algorithm each shard can operate independently without double spending FLETA strives to actualize a realistic number of shards in order to make an optimal DApp centered platform If 500 shards can be operated without causing problems 500Shard x 20 000TPS 10 000 000TPS can be achieved FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s innovation on speed and receptivity will continue to take place over and over 2 2 Infinite DApp Scalability FLETA employs a multichain structure with independent subchains operated through each DApp Mainnet overload is avoided even when DApps in the platform and the number of subchains increase infinitely FLETA is the one and only platform where an enormous DApp ecosystem can be sustained with no limitations thereby implying FLETA and FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s DApps\xe2\x80\x99 value to rise constantly 2 3 Token Economy DApps with token issued in the FLETA platform are operated in their own independent chain not in the mainchain That is token economy is actualized through various consensus mode selected by each and every DApp developer Each DApp\xe2\x80\x99s token can be rewarded independently through a preferred consensus model (PoW PoS or voting process is included but not limited to these) Token economy is a driving force of FLETA and its DApps providing motivation for various utility tokens to get on board with FLETA Copyright (C) 2018 First Chain Co Ltd All Rights Reserved 14 \x0cFLETA\xe2\x80\x99s Potential FLETA plans to open its first alpha testnet in October and its beta testnet in December Official opening is scheduled to be made in Q1 of 2019 We are also collaborating with prominent partners from home and abroad including BRP South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s biggest Blockchain accelerating company FLETA is planning to join Malta Blockchain Campus as FLETA has officially registered in Malta the Blockchain Island FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s technology will flourish with our global blockchain users Currently we are discussing technological cooperation with Stanford University Block Chain Research Society and also are networking with major global crypto funds and IT companies Already diverse DApps making use of FLETA\xe2\x80\x99s platform is in the process of development FLETA will strive to overcome all the setbacks and shortcomings of the existing platforms continuously upgrading protocols and boosting longterm growth by meeting the visions of various business models It is hard to foresee how the blockchain technology will eventually unfold but it is without a doubt a great tide of innovation which could bring a better life if we get on board FLETA hopes to play a pivotal role in that tide
