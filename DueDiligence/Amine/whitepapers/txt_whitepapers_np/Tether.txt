b Tether Fiat currencies on the Bitcoin blockchain Abstract\xe2\x80\x8b A digital token backed by fiat currency provides individuals and organizations with a robust and decentralized method of exchanging value while using a familiar accounting unit The innovation of blockchains is an auditable and cryptographically secured global ledger Asset\xc2\xadbacked token issuers and other market participants can take advantage of blockchain technology along with embedded consensus systems to transact in familiar less volatile currencies and assets In order to maintain accountability and to ensure stability in exchange price we propose a method to maintain a one\xc2\xadto\xc2\xadone reserve ratio between a cryptocurrency token called tethers and its associated real\xc2\xadworld asset fiat currency This method uses the Bitcoin blockchain Proof of Reserves and other audit methods to prove that issued tokens are fully backed and reserved at all times 1 \x0cTable of Contents Table of

Systems Market Risk Examples Legal and Compliance Glossary of Terms References 2 \x0cIntroduction There exists a vast array of assets in the world which people freely choose as a store\xc2\xadof\xc2\xadvalue a transactional medium or an investment We believe the Bitcoin blockchain is a better technology for transacting storing and accounting for these assets Most estimates measure global wealth around 250 trillion dollars [1] with much of that being held by banks or similar financial institutions The migration of these assets onto the Bitcoin blockchain represents a proportionally large opportunity Bitcoin was created as \xe2\x80\x9can electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party \xe2\x80\x9d[2] Bitcoin created a new class of digital currency a decentralized digital currency or cryptocurrency1 Some of the primary advantages of cryptocurrencies are low transaction costs international borderless transferability and convertibility trustless ownership and exchange pseudo\xc2\xadanonymity real\xc2\xadtime transparency and immunity from legacy banking system problems [3] Common explanations for the current limited mainstream use of cryptocurrencies include volatile price swings inadequate mass\xc2\xadmarket understanding of the technology and insufficient ease\xc2\xadof\xc2\xaduse for non\xc2\xadtechnical users The idea for asset\xc2\xadpegged cryptocurrencies was initially popularized2 in the Bitcoin community by the Mastercoin white paper authored by J R Willett in January 2012[4] Today we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see these ideas built with the likes of BitAssets Ripple Omni Nxt NuShares/Bits and others One should note that all Bitcoin exchanges and wallets (like Coinbase Bitfinex and Coinapult) which allow you to hold value as a fiat currency already provide a \xe2\x80\x8b similar\xe2\x80\x8b service in that users can avoid the volatility (or other traits) of a particular cryptocurrency by selling them for fiat currency gold or another asset Further almost all types of existing financial institutions payment providers etc which allow you to hold fiat value (or other assets) subsequently provide a similar service In this white paper we focus on applications wherein the fiat value is stored and transmitted with software that is open\xc2\xadsource cryptographically secure and uses distributed ledger technology i e a true cryptocurrency While the goal of any successful cryptocurrency is to completely eliminate the requirement of trust each of the aforementioned implementations either rely on a trusted third party or have other technical market\xc2\xadbased or process\xc2\xadbased drawbacks and limitations 3 1 2 3 For definitions throughout see \xe2\x80\x8b Glossary of Terms But has been discussed since Dr Szabo\xe2\x80\x99s proposed BitGold [5] Summarized in the Appendix here \xe2\x80\x8b Limitations of Existing Fiat\xc2\xadpegging Systems 3 \x0cIn our solution fiat\xc2\xadpegged cryptocurrencies are called \xe2\x80\x9ctethers\xe2\x80\x9d All tethers will initially4 be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Omni Layer protocol and so they exist as a cryptocurrency token Each tether unit issued into circulation is backed in a one\xc2\xadto\xc2\xadone ratio (i e one Tether USDT is one US dollar) by the corresponding fiat currency unit held in deposit by Hong Kong based Tether Limited Tethers may be redeemable/exchangeable for the underlying fiat currency pursuant to Tether Limited\xe2\x80\x99s terms of service or if the holder prefers the equivalent spot value in Bitcoin Once a tether has been issued it can be transferred stored spent etc just like bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency The fiat currency on reserve has gained the properties of a cryptocurrency and its price is permanently \xe2\x80\x8b tethered\xe2\x80\x8b to the price of the fiat currency Our implementation has the following advantages over other fiat\xc2\xadpegged cryptocurrencies \xe2\x97\x8f Tethers exist on the Bitcoin blockchain rather than a less developed/tested \xe2\x80\x9caltcoin\xe2\x80\x9d blockchain nor within closed\xc2\xadsource software running on centralized private databases \xe2\x97\x8f Tethers can be used just like bitcoins i e in a p2p pseudo\xc2\xadanonymous decentralized cryptographically secure environment \xe2\x97\x8f Tethers can be integrated with merchants exchanges and wallets just as easily as Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies can be integrated \xe2\x97\x8f Tethers inherit the properties of the Omni Layer protocol which include a decentralized exchange\xcd\xbe browser\xc2\xadbased open\xc2\xadsource wallet encryption\xcd\xbe Bitcoin\xc2\xadbased transparency accountability multi\xc2\xadparty security and reporting functions \xe2\x97\x8f Tether Limited employs a simple but effective approach for conducting Proof of Reserves which significantly reduces our counterparty risk as the custodian of the reserve assets \xe2\x97\x8f Tether issuance or redemption will not face any pricing or liquidity constraints Users can buy or sell as many tethers as they want quickly and with very low fees \xe2\x97\x8f Tethers will not face any market risks5 such as Black Swan events liquidity crunches etc as reserves are maintained in a one\xc2\xadto\xc2\xadone ratio rather than relying on market forces \xe2\x97\x8f Tether\xe2\x80\x99s one\xc2\xadto\xc2\xadone backing implementation is easier for non\xc2\xadtechnical users to understand as opposed to collateralization techniques or derivative strategies At any given time the balance of fiat currency held in our reserves will be equal to (or greater than) the number of tethers in circulation This simple configuration most easily supports a reliable Proof of Reserves process\xcd\xbe a process which is fundamental to maintaining the price\xc2\xadparity between tethers in circulation and the underlying fiat currency held in reserves In this paper we provide evidence6 that shows exchange and 4 5 6 \xe2\x80\x8bore Bitcoin 2 0 protocols will come soon like Ripple Nxt etc M \xe2\x80\x8bee Appendix section \xe2\x80\x8b S Market Risk Examples See section \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b Proof of Solvency Process 4 \x0cwallet audits (in their current state) are very unreliable (i e flaws in Proof of Solvency[6] methods) and instead propose that exchanges and wallets \xe2\x80\x8b outsource\xe2\x80\x8b the custody of user funds to us via tethers Users can purchase tethers from Tether to (our web\xc2\xadwallet) or from supported exchanges such as Bitfinex who support tethers as a deposit and withdrawal method Users can also transact and store tethers with any Omni Layer enabled wallet like Ambisafe Holy Transaction or Omni Wallet Other exchanges wallets and merchants are encouraged to reach out to us about integrating tether as a surrogate for traditional fiat payment methods We recognize that our implementation isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfectly decentralized7 since Tether Limited must act as a centralized custodian of reserve assets (albeit tethers in circulation exist as a decentralized digital currency) However we believe this implementation sets the foundation for building future innovations that will eliminate these weaknesses create a robust platform for new products and services and support the growth and utility of the Bitcoin blockchain over the long run Some of these innovations include \xe2\x97\x8f Mobile payment facilitation between users and other parties including other users and merchants \xe2\x97\x8f Instant or near\xc2\xadinstant fiat value transfer between decentralized parties (such as multiple exchanges) \xe2\x97\x8f Introduction to the use of smart contracts and multi\xc2\xadsignature capabilities to further improve the general security process Proof of Reserves and enable new features Technology Stack and Processes Each tether issued into circulation will be backed in a one\xc2\xadto\xc2\xadone ratio with the equivalent amount of corresponding fiat currency held in reserves by Hong Kong based Tether Limited As the custodian of the backing asset we are acting as a trusted third party responsible for that asset This risk is mitigated by a simple implementation that collectively reduces the complexity of conducting both fiat and crypto audits while increasing the security provability and transparency of these audits Tether Technology Stack The stack has 3 layers and numerous features best understood via a diagram 7 See section \xe2\x80\x8b Implementation Weaknesses 5 \x0cHere is a review of each layer 1) The first layer is the Bitcoin blockchain The Tether transactional ledger is embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain as meta\xc2\xaddata via the embedded consensus system Omni 2) The second layer is the Omni Layer protocol Omni is a foundational technology that can a) Grant (create) and revoke (destroy) digital tokens represented as meta\xc2\xaddata embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain\xcd\xbe in this case fiat\xc2\xadpegged digital tokens tethers b) Track and report the circulation of tethers via Omnichest info (Omni asset ID #31 for example represents TetherUSD) and Omnicore API c) Enable users to transact and store tethers and other assets/tokens in a i) p2p pseudo\xc2\xadanonymous cryptographically secure environment ii) open\xc2\xadsource browser\xc2\xadbased encrypted web\xc2\xadwallet Omni Wallet iii) multi\xc2\xadsignature and offline cold storage\xc2\xadsupporting system 3) The third layer is Tether Limited our business entity primarily responsible for a) Accepting fiat deposits and issuing the corresponding tethers b) Sending fiat withdrawals and revoking the corresponding tethers c) Custody of the fiat reserves that back all tethers in circulation 6 \x0cd) Publicly reporting Proof of Reserves and other audit results e) Initiating and managing integrations with existing Bitcoin/blockchain wallets exchanges and merchants f) Operating Tether to a web\xc2\xadwallet which allows users to send receive store and convert tethers conveniently Flow of Funds Process There are five steps in the lifecycle of a tether best understood via a diagram Step 1\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad User deposits fiat currency into Tether Limited s bank account Step 2\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad Tether Limited generates and credits the user s tether account Tethers enter circulation Amount of fiat currency deposited by user = amount of tethers issued to user (i e 10k USD deposited = 10k tetherUSD issued) 7 \x0cStep 3\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad Users transact with tethers8 The user can transfer exchange and store tethers via a p2p open\xc2\xadsource pseudo\xc2\xadanonymous Bitcoin\xc2\xadbased platform Step 4\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad The user deposits tethers with Tether Limited for redemption into fiat currency Step 5\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad Tether Limited destroys the tethers and sends fiat currency to the user\xe2\x80\x99s bank account Users can obtain tethers outside of the aforementioned process via an exchange or another individual Once a tether enters circulation it can be traded freely between any business or individual For example users can purchase tethers from Bitfinex with more exchanges to follow soon The main concept to be conveyed by the Flow of Funds diagram is that Tether Limited is the only party who can issue tethers into circulation (create them) or take them out of circulation (destroy them) This is the main process by which the system solvency is maintained Proof of Reserves Process Proof of Solvency Proof of Reserves Real\xc2\xadTime Transparency and other similar phrases have been growing and resonating across the cryptocurrency industry Exchange and wallets audits in their current form are very unreliable Insolvency has occurred numerous times in the Bitcoin ecosystem either via hacks mismanagement or outright fraud Users must be diligent with their exchange selection and vigilant in their use of exchanges Even then a savvy user will not be able to fully eliminate the risks Further there are exchange users like traders and businesses who must keep non\xc2\xadtrivial fiat balances in exchanges at all times In financial language this is known as the \xe2\x80\x9ccounterparty risk\xe2\x80\x9d of storing value with a third party We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to conclude that exchange and wallet audits in their current form are not very reliable These processes do not guarantee users that a custodian or exchange is solvent Although there have been great contributions to improving the exchange audit processes like the Merkle tree approach[6] major flaws 9 still remain Tether\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Reserves configuration is novel because it simplifies the process of proving that the total number of tethers in circulation (liabilities) are always fully backed by an equal amount of fiat currency held 8 9 See benefits of using tethers in the section M \xe2\x80\x8bain Applications See section \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b Audit Flaws Exchanges and Wallets 8 \x0cin reserve (assets) In our configuration each tetherUSD in circulation represents one US dollar held in our reserves (i e a one\xc2\xadto\xc2\xadone ratio) which means the system is fully reserved when the sum of all tethers in existence (at any point in time) is exactly equal to the balance of USD held in our reserve Since tethers live on the Bitcoin blockchain the provability and accounting of tethers at any given point in time is trivial Conversely the corresponding total amount of USD held in our reserves is proved by publishing the bank balance and undergoing periodic audits by professionals Find this implementation further detailed below \xe2\x97\x8f Tether Limited issues all tethers via the Omni Layer protocol Omni operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and therefore all issued redeemed and existing tethers including transactional history are publicly auditable via the tools provided at Omnichest info \xe2\x97\x8b The Omnichest info asset ID for tetherUSD is #31 \xe2\x96\xa0 \xe2\x97\x8f Here is a link \xe2\x80\x8b http //omnichest info/lookupsp aspx sp=31 \xe2\x97\x8b Let the total number of tethers issued under this asset ID be denoted as TUSDissue \xe2\x97\x8b Let the total number of tethers redeemed under this asset ID be denoted as TUSDredeem \xe2\x97\x8b Let the total number of tethers in circulation at any time be denoted as TUSD \xe2\x96\xa0 TUSD = TUSDissue \xc2\xad TUSDredeem \xe2\x96\xa0 TUSD = \xe2\x80\x9cTotal Property Tokens\xe2\x80\x9d @ \xe2\x80\x8b http //omnichest info/lookupsp aspx sp=31 Tether Limited has a bank account which will receive and send fiat currency to users who purchase/redeem tethers directly with us \xe2\x97\x8b Let the total amount deposited into this account be denoted as DUSDdepo \xe2\x97\x8b Let the total amount withdrawn from this account be denoted as DUSDwithd \xe2\x97\x8b Let the dollar balance of this bank account be denoted as DUSD \xe2\x96\xa0 \xe2\x97\x8f DUSD = DUSDdepo \xc2\xad DUSDwithd Each tether issued will be backed by the equivalent amount of currency unit (one tetherUSD equals one dollar) By combining the above crypto and fiat accounting processes we conclude the \xe2\x80\x9cSolvency Equation\xe2\x80\x9d for the Tether System \xe2\x97\x8b The Solvency Equation is simply TUSD = DUSD \xe2\x97\x8b Every tether issued or redeemed as publicly recorded by the Bitcoin blockchain will correspond to a deposit or withdrawal of funds from the bank account \xe2\x97\x8b The provability of TUSD relies on the Bitcoin blockchain as discussed previously \xe2\x97\x8b The provability of DUSD will rely on several processes \xe2\x96\xa0 We publish the bank account balance on our website\xe2\x80\x99s Transparency page \xe2\x96\xa0 Professional auditors will regularly verify sign and publish our underlying bank balance and financial transfer statement 9 \x0cUsers will be able to view this information from our Transparency Page which will look like For clarity we\xe2\x80\x99d like to acknowledge that the Tether System10 is different than the Tether to web\xc2\xadwallet in terms of Proof of Reserves In this paper we mostly focus on Proof of Reserves for the Tether System\xcd\xbe i e all tethers in circulation at any point in time The Tether to wallet is a consumer facing web\xc2\xadwallet operating on closed\xc2\xadsource code and centralized servers Conducting a Proof of Reserves for this wallet is fundamentally different than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined for the Tether System We\xe2\x80\x99re planning the deployment of a PoR\xc2\xadbased transparency solution for the Tether to wallet We believe it will be the most advanced PoR system in existence today It overcomes almost all of the challenges outlined in the appendix11 on this topic Mind you users can always secure tethers through managing the private keys themselves or through Omni Wallet Implementation Weaknesses We understand that our implementation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately create a fully trustless cryptocurrency system Mainly because users must trust Tether Limited and our corresponding legacy banking institution to be the custodian of the reserve assets However almost all exchanges and wallets (assuming they hold USD/fiats) are subject to the same weaknesses Users of these services are already subject to these risks Here is a summary of the weaknesses in our approach 10 11 \xe2\x97\x8f We could go bankrupt \xe2\x97\x8f Our bank could go insolvent \xe2\x97\x8f Our bank could freeze or confiscate the funds \xe2\x97\x8f We could abscond with the reserve funds See \xe2\x80\x8b Glossary of Terms See \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b Audit Flaws Exchanges and Wallets 10 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Re\xc2\xadcentralized of risk to a single point of failure Observe that almost all digital currency exchanges and wallets (assuming they hold USD/fiat) already face many of these challenges Therefore users of these services are already subject to these risks Below we describe how each of these concerns are being addressed We could go bankrupt\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad In this case the business entity Tether Limited would go bankrupt but client funds would be safe and subsequently all tethers will remain redeemable Most security breaches on Bitcoin businesses have targeted cryptocurrencies rather than bank accounts Since all tethers exist on the Bitcoin blockchain they can be stored by individuals directly through securing their own private keys Our bank could go insolvent\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad This is a risk faced by all users of the legacy financial system and by all exchange operators Tether Limited currently has accounts with Cathay United Bank and Hwatai Bank in Taiwan both of whom are aware and confident that Tether\xe2\x80\x99s business model is acceptable Additional banking partners are being established in other jurisdictions to further mitigate this concern Our bank could freeze or confiscate the funds\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad Our banks are aware of the nature of Bitcoin and are accepting of Bitcoin businesses They also provide banking services to some of the largest Bitcoin exchanges globally The KYC/AML processes we follow are also used by the other digital currency exchanges they currently bank They have assured us we are in full compliance12 We could abscond with the reserve assets\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad The corporate charter is public13 as well as the business owners names locations and reputations Ownership of the account is legally bound to the corporate charter Any transfers in or out of the bank account will have the associated traces and are bound by rigid internal policies Re\xc2\xadcentralization of risk to a single point of failure\xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xad We have some ideas on how to overcome this and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sharing them in upcoming blog and product updates There are many ways to tackle this problem For now this initial implementation gets us on the right track to realize these innovations in following versions By leveraging the platforms we have chosen we have reduced the centralization risk to one singular responsibility the creation and redemption of tokens All other aspects of the system are decentralized 12 13 \xe2\x80\x8bee section on \xe2\x80\x8b S Legal and Compliance\xe2\x80\x8b for more information \xe2\x80\x8bame as footnote #10 S 11 \x0cMain Applications In this section we\xe2\x80\x99ll summarize and discuss the main applications of tethers across the Bitcoin/blockchain ecosystem and for other consumers globally We break up the beneficiaries into three user groups Exchanges Individuals and Merchants The main benefits applicable to all groups \xe2\x97\x8f Properties of Bitcoin bestowed upon other asset classes \xe2\x97\x8f Less volatile familiar unit of account \xe2\x97\x8f World\xe2\x80\x99s assets migrate to the Bitcoin blockchain For Exchanges Exchange operators understand that accepting fiat deposits and withdrawals using legacy financial systems can be complicated risky slow and expensive Some of these issues include \xe2\x97\x8f Identifying the right payment providers for your exchange \xe2\x97\x8b irreversible transactions fraud protection lowest fees etc \xe2\x97\x8f Integrating the platform with banks who have no APIs \xe2\x97\x8f Liaising with these banks to coordinate compliance security and to build trust \xe2\x97\x8f Prohibitive costs for small value transfers \xe2\x97\x8f 3\xc2\xad7 days for international wire transfers to clear \xe2\x97\x8f Poor and unfavorable currency conversion fees By offering tethers an exchange can relieve themselves of the above complications and gain additional benefits such as \xe2\x97\x8f Accept crypto\xc2\xadfiats as deposit/withdrawal/storage method rather than using a legacy bank or payment provider \xe2\x97\x8b Allows users to move fiat in and out of exchange more freely quickly cheaply \xe2\x97\x8f Outsource fiat custodial risk to Tether Limited \xc2\xad just manage cryptos \xe2\x97\x8f Easily add other tethered fiat currencies as trading pairs to the platform \xe2\x97\x8f Secure customer assets purely through accepted crypto\xc2\xadprocesses \xe2\x97\x8b Multi\xc2\xadsignature security cold and hot wallets HD wallets etc 12 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8b \xe2\x97\x8f Conduct audits easier and more securely in a purely crypto environment Anything one can do with Bitcoin as an exchange can be done with tethers Exchange users know how risky it can be to hold fiat currencies on an exchange With the growing number of insolvency events it can be quite dangerous As mentioned previously we believe that using tethers exposes exchange users to less counterparty risk than continually holding fiat on exchanges Additionally there are other benefits to holding tethers explained in the next section For Individuals There are many types of individual Bitcoin users in the world today From traders looking to earn profits daily\xcd\xbe to long term investors looking to store their Bitcoins securely\xcd\xbe to tech\xc2\xadsavvy shoppers looking to avoid credit card fees or maintain their privacy\xcd\xbe to philosophical users looking to change the world\xcd\xbe to those looking to remit payments globally more effectively\xcd\xbe to those in third world countries looking for access to financial services for the first time\xcd\xbe to developers looking to create new technologies\xcd\xbe to all those who have found many uses for Bitcoin For each of these individuals we believe tethers are useful in similar ways like \xe2\x97\x8f Transact in USD/fiat value pseudo\xc2\xadanonymously without any middlemen/intermediaries \xe2\x97\x8f Cold store USD/fiat value by securing one\xe2\x80\x99s own private keys \xe2\x97\x8f Avoid the risk of storing fiat on exchanges \xc2\xad move crypto\xc2\xadfiat in and out of exchanges easily \xe2\x97\x8f Avoid having to open a fiat bank account to store fiat value \xe2\x97\x8f Easily enhance applications that work with bitcoin to also support tether \xe2\x97\x8f Anything one can do with Bitcoin as an individual one can also do with tether For Merchants Merchants want to focus on their business not on payments The lack of global inexpensive ubiquitous payment solutions continue to plague merchants around the world both large and small Merchants deserve more Here are some of the ways tether can help them \xe2\x97\x8f Price goods in USD/fiat value rather than Bitcoin (no moving conversion rates/purchase windows) \xe2\x97\x8f Avoid conversion from Bitcoin to USD/fiat and associated fees and processes \xe2\x97\x8f Prevent chargebacks reduce fees and gain greater privacy \xe2\x97\x8f Provide novel services because of fiat\xc2\xadcrypto features \xe2\x97\x8b \xe2\x97\x8f Microtipping gift cards more Anything one can do with Bitcoin as a merchant one can also do with tether 13 \x0cFuture Innovations Multi\xc2\xadsig and Smart Contracts Proof of Solvency Innovations Conclusion Tether constitutes the first Bitcoin\xc2\xadbased fiat\xc2\xadpegged cryptocurrencies in

and Wallets Here is a summary of the current flaws found in technology\xc2\xadbased14 exchange and wallet audits In the Merkle tree[6] approach users must manually report that their balances (user\xe2\x80\x99s leaf) have been correctly incorporated in the liability declaration of the exchange (the Merkle hash of the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s database of user balances) This proposed solution works if enough users verify that their account was included in the tree and in a case where their account is not included this instance would be reported One potential risk is that an exchange database owner could produce a hash that is not the true representation of 14 As opposed to hiring a professional auditor 14 \x0cthe database at all\xcd\xbe it hashes an incomplete database which would reduce its apparent liabilities to customers making them appear solvent to a verifying party Here are some scenarios where a fraudulent exchange would exclude accounts and \xe2\x97\x8b \xe2\x80\x9cBitdust\xe2\x80\x9d Accounts Inactive or low activity accounts would lower the chance that an uninterested user would check or report inconsistencies In some cases these long\xc2\xadtail accounts could represent a significant percentage of the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s liabilities \xe2\x97\x8b \xe2\x80\x9cColluding Whales\xe2\x80\x9d Attack There is evidence that large Bitcoin traders are operating on various exchanges and moving markets significantly Such traders need to have capital reserves at the largest exchanges to quickly execute orders Often traders choose exchanges that they \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d In this way they can be assured that should a hack or liquidity issue arise they have priority to get their money out In this case the exchange and trader could collude to remove the whales account balance from the database before it\xe2\x80\x99s hashed \xe2\x97\x8b Key Rental Attack To pass the audit a malicious exchange could rent the private keys to bitcoins they do not own This would make them appear solvent by increasing their assets without any acknowledgment that those funds were loaned to them Likewise they could \xe2\x80\x9cborrow\xe2\x80\x9d fiat currency to do the same \xe2\x97\x8b There are more attacks not discussed here Reaching Statistical Significance (reporting completeness) Even outside of these three attack vectors a database that has been manipulated may never be detected if a sufficient number of users are not validating balances The probability of getting 100% of the users to verify balances is likely zero even with proper incentivization structure for users to verify their balances Therefore auditors would need statistical tools to make statements about the validity of an exchange\xe2\x80\x99s database based on sampling frequency size and other properties Currently users have no way to receive compensation by legal means in case something goes wrong with the exchange For example when Mt Gox closed operations many users might not have independently recorded their account balances (prints screens signed messages to themselves etc) in a way that could conclusively prove to law enforcement that this exchange\xe2\x80\x99s I O U\xe2\x80\x99s actually existed Such users are at the mercy of the exchange to somehow publish a record of that hash tree or original database The proposed structure in which these audits would be performed still contains some subtle but important flaws In particular the data reporting (hash tree) on the institution\xe2\x80\x99s website gives no guarantee at all to 15 \x0cusers as a malicious exchange could publish different states/balances to different groups of users or retroactively change the state Thus it is fundamental to publish this data through a secure broadcast channel e g the Bitcoin blockchain Privacy is a barrier to entry for the adoption of an automated/open auditing system While some progress has been made towards better privacy there is no perfect solution yet Further to build up an accurate user verified liability space these users will have to report account balances with the exchange and Bitcoin addresses Some users likely would not report this information regardless of the incentive therefore providing cryptographically secure privacy whilst obtaining the reporting goal is paramount Time Series the Merkle tree hash is a single snapshot of the database at a single point in time Not having a somewhat continuous time series of the database opens significant attack vectors Additionally a time series of user reported information would also be required for piecing together the history of any reported incidents of fraud Trusted Third Parties All of the current exchange audits have relied on some \xe2\x80\x9creputable\xe2\x80\x9d trusted third party to make some type of verification In the Coinbase audit [7] that was Andreas Antonopoulos in the Kraken audit [8] that was Stefan Thomas If we absolutely must rely on a trusted third party then some audit standards and procedures should ensure this weaknesses is fortified Limitations of Existing Fiat\xc2\xadpegging Systems Here\xe2\x80\x99s a list of some of the common drawbacks and limitations of existing fiat\xc2\xadpegging systems \xe2\x97\x8f The systems are based on closed\xc2\xadsource software running on private centralized databases fundamentally no different than Paypal or any other existing mass\xc2\xadmarket retail/institutional asset trading/transfer/storage system \xe2\x97\x8f Decentralized systems that rely on altcoin blockchains which haven\xe2\x80\x99t been stress\xc2\xadtested developed or reviewed as closely as other blockchains like Bitcoin \xe2\x97\x8f Pegging processes that rely on hedging derivative meta\xc2\xadassets efficient market theory or collateralization of the underlying asset wherein liquidity transferability security and other issues can exist 16 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Lack of transparency and audits for the custodian either crypto fiat or relating to their own internal ledgers (same as closed source and centralised databases) \xe2\x97\x8f Reliance on legacy banking systems and trusted third parties (bank account owners) as a transfer and settlement mechanism for reserve assets Market Risk Examples In the collateralization method market risk exists because the price of the asset being used as collateral can move in an adverse direction to the price of the asset it\xe2\x80\x99s backing/pegging This would cause the total value of the collateral to become less than the total value of the issued asset and make the system insolvent This risk is mitigated by the custodian closing the position before this happens\xcd\xbe that is when the collateral price equals the pegged asset price then the collateral is liquidated (sold on the open market) and the position is closed A great approach with merit and used in many liquid markets across the traditional banking and financial markets However as we saw from the global financial crisis situations can arise in which the acceleration of such events causes a \xe2\x80\x9cliquidity crunch\xe2\x80\x9d and thus the collateral is unable to be liquidated fast enough to meet trading obligations subsequently creating losses With the cryptocurrency markets being so small and volatile this type of event is much more likely Additionally the overall approach suffers from other liquidity and pricing constraints since there must be a sufficient supply of users posting collateral for the creation of the pegged\xc2\xadassets to exist in the first place In the derivatives approach the price of the asset is pegged through entering one of several derivatives strategies such as swap strategies covered and naked options strategies various futures and forwards strategies Each strategy has their own strengths and weaknesses the discussion of which we won\xe2\x80\x99t engage in here To summarize each of these pegging processes themselves have similar \xe2\x80\x9cmarket risk\xe2\x80\x9d characteristics as the aforementioned collateralization method It should be noted that the two methods are not mutually exclusive and often paired in a specific trading hedging or risk management function at legacy system financial institutions Finally understand that we believe some combination of the above approaches may become a secure reliable and generally risk\xc2\xadfree process for backing/pegging assets\xcd\xbe however at this point in time this is not a direction we feel is feasible to take to ensure liquidity and price stability Further we believe that a reserve\xc2\xadbased approach will always be in existence and complement these other approaches as the entire industry grows As advances in technology continue we will evaluate and incorporate any benefits available while maintaining the guarantee of 100% redeemability 17 \x0cLegal and Compliance Tether Limited
