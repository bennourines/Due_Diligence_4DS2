Although all human beings are susceptible to diseases we continuously repeat the process of recovering our health through medical treatments However some patients suffer from incurable diseases whose etiologies are uncertain exact diagnoses are difficult and as a result complete recovery is not possible These incurable diseases include chronic diseases contracted by a large number of patients but with no complete cure and the need for lifelong management such as diabetes mellitus hypertension cardiovascular diseases and cancer in addition to rare and incurable diseases contracted by a small number of patients with a relatively small volume of epidemics data Chronic diseases are becoming a global challenge due to rapidly progressing population aging decline in physical activity and lifestyle changes such as increased intake of fat and beverages [1] According to the World Health Organization (WHO) chronic diseases are the leading causes of deaths worldwide As of 2015 40 million out of 56 million deaths were caused by chronic diseases and in addition 1 7 million patients were predicted to die before the age of 70 Moreover more than one third of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population simultaneously suffer from multiple chronic conditions which constitutes significant threats to patients\xe2\x80\x99 health and imposes enormous costs on society Specifically medical costs in patients with multiple chronic diseases have been shown to increase by around 80 percent up to 300 percent depending on age gender and health conditions Meanwhile \xe2\x80\x9crare and incurable diseases\xe2\x80\x9d are defined differently in each country but generally refer to diseases for which the exact number of patients are unknown because of their small number of patients and difficulty of diagnosis [2] As of 2016 the number of rare diseases registered on Orphanet a portal for rare diseases amounted to 6 084 and the worldwide population with rare diseases is estimated at 350 million In Korea the total number of rare diseases is estimated at around 2 000 and the affected population is calculated at 600 000 [3] \x01 It is characteristic of incurable diseases that their symptoms are controllable by medication lifestyle changes operations etc but it is not possible to eradicate or treat the underlying causes Although early diagnosis may allow the early completion of treatment these diseases cause suffering to patients and their families due to the inadequacy of knowledge on the diseases insufficient research development and support and the consequent lack of awareness toward the need for self care \x01 \x01 \x01 2 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c\x01 2 Patient Generated Health Data a clue to solution Figure 1 Exponential Growth and Important Role of PGHD \x01 Patient Generated Health Data (hereinafter PGHD) refers to health related data recorded and generated by patients outside hospitals [4] Due to the widespread penetration of smartphones and the growing familiarity of patients with smart devices the collection of diverse PGHD has become easier through the utilization of online survey mobile apps and wearable devices PGHD is a component of health data alongside genetic and clinical data and occupies more than 60 percent of health data with the ratio gradually increasing [5 Figure 1] Since the majority of a patient\xe2\x80\x99s activities occur outside hospitals information recorded at a clinical office is inevitably limited Therefore a growing importance is being placed on PGHD as information directly collected from patients and directly produced by patients throughout their struggle against diseases While PGHD has previously been regarded with less clinical value and interest compared to other types of information it fills an information niche by complementing aspects that cannot be explained by existing medical data and allows a more comprehensive understanding of patients\xe2\x80\x99 health An Accenture survey found that the number of consumers who participated in the collection of PGHD using mobile healthcare applications rose to 33 percent in 2016 up from 16 percent in 2014 [6] which shows that the volume of PGHD collected will increase exponentially in the future Therefore PGHD which includes information on patients\xe2\x80\x99 health and diseases can provide a clue to the solution for diseases that are currently incurable \x01 3 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c2 1 Patients \x01 As PGHD becomes more accessible with technology advancements patients have become able to capture their health related data independently and thoroughly As a result patients are more actively engaged in overcoming their diseases and are more interested in their own health In addition patients are able to participate in the collection of data to observe how their health status has changed with time to independently identify behaviors that influence health and to satisfy their intellectual desire to be informed about diseases and the human body by sharing information with other patients These processes allow patients to be more deeply engaged in treatments or research on their diseases and reinforce their desire to undergo treatment For instance according to a survey conducted on heart disease patients in the Connected Cardiac Care Program at Partners HealthCare 98 percent of the respondents reportedly became more aware of their diseases through PGHD and 85 percent of them came to be able to better control their diseases [7] A pilot project conducted by the Care Beyond Walls & Wires revealed that PGHD had an effect on reducing the readmission rate by 44 percent average length of stay by 64 percent and hospital cost per patient by USD 92 000 [8] As such PGHD has been shown to have an actual influence on various aspects of patients\xe2\x80\x99 struggle against diseases \x01 2 2 Healthcare Professionals \x01 Healthcare professionals make decisions on medical treatments based on data collected from hospitals However these data are created by capturing patients\xe2\x80\x99 health at a certain timepoint and therefore exclude PGHD which involves continuous changes of conditions or phenomena occurring outside hospitals Sole dependence on clinical data does not allow for a comprehensive evaluation of patients\xe2\x80\x99 health and may result in incomplete diagnosis or underdiagnosis To improve this situation PGHD collected in patients\xe2\x80\x99 daily life can be used to reduce misdiagnoses and aid the treatment of incurable diseases Furthermore healthcare professionals will be able to more comprehensively understand patients\xe2\x80\x99 health using PGHD [9] For example they may take proper actions earlier after detecting sudden changes in patients\xe2\x80\x99 health conditions and manage patients\xe2\x80\x99 health to the best possible extent by changing treatment methods if necessary In addition their continuous observation of patients\xe2\x80\x99 daily life through PGHD yield insight into patients\xe2\x80\x99 health as well as information necessary for treatments tailored for patients\xe2\x80\x99 condition which ultimately assist the improvement of patients\xe2\x80\x99 health \x01 4 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c2 3 Research Institutes \x01 Based on PGHD researchers and pharmaceutical companies can recruit test subjects more easily and diversely through online ads or social media without being dependent on hospitals or hospital based systems These collection methods can improve the speed of research and reduce the time required to establish a cohort or a data set to facilitate effective analysis For example PatientsLikeMe functions as a platform for patients to better manage their health and for researchers to easily obtain data Pharmaceutical companies and clinical trial institutes acquire patients\xe2\x80\x99 data through PatientsLikeMe and are using the data for research purposes[10] \xe2\x80\x8b L \xe2\x80\x8b ikewise Humanscape will also contribute to disease research through the documentation of shared data on the medication effectiveness and side effects to patients and the categorization of patient groups for various diseases [9] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is already reflecting the PGHD of patients\xe2\x80\x99 opinions and experiences in its drug review process for rare and incurable diseases This is because reflecting patients\xe2\x80\x99 direct experiences and opinions in the development stage of a new drug such as in clinical trials may result in the production of safer and more effective medicine Specifically the FDA is developing Externally Led Patient Focused Drug Development (EL PFDD) meetings into a channel for the collection of data based on the experiences of actual patients to provide them with helpful information on medication and treatments [11] \x01 \x01 \x01 5 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c3 Humanscape a Patient Networking Service\x01 3 1 Attempts and Limitations on Building a Health Information Community \x01 To date the interchange of health information has largely taken place through Q&A services provided by web portals or online communities for specific diseases In particular online health communities and patient associations were generally organized around a specific disease and featured intensive discussions focused on a single disease which restricted their expansion into other areas Furthermore existing communities are not equipped with mechanisms to sustain internal activities such as new posts or information sharing which became problematic as users were alienated to \xe2\x80\x9clurker\xe2\x80\x9d status or compelled to leave the community altogether In this regard a decline in community engagement results in a corresponding decline of expectation or satisfaction toward the community which then poses a threat to the community\xe2\x80\x99s sustainability [12] Meanwhile PatientsLikeMe constitutes a case in which the exchange of health information is occurring at an extremely active rate Established in 2004 PatientsLikeMe is an online community for sharing information on symptoms among patients mainly those with incurable diseases Patients with incurable diseases have voluntarily shared information on their symptoms with other users complaining of similar symptoms and currently the number of patients registered on the platform is around 600 000 [13] However PatientsLikeMe remains somewhat limited in its capacity as a health information community Over 14 years since 2004 around 600 000 patients have joined PatientsLikeMe but the number of active patients on the site accounts for only around 17 000 as of 2018 and it is predicted that the accumulated volume of data will not increase dramatically in the future Moreover as the main services of PatientsLikeMe are focused on the sale of health \xe2\x80\x9cdata\xe2\x80\x9d to pharmaceutical insurance and medical device companies the site is not active regarding exchanges of patients\xe2\x80\x99 subjective experiences information or emotions shared as \xe2\x80\x9ccontent \xe2\x80\x9d This signifies that patient activities in PatientsLikeMe are limited to only the temporary input of data with limited practical and direct utility for patients Therefore patients are not compelled to share information unless they are heavily involved in PatientsLikeMe and 6 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cconsequently this implies that it is difficult to collect a high volume of PGHD across a diverse spectrum \x01 3 2 Difficulty in Collecting PGHD \x01 Active utilization of PGHD can be a way to contribute to treatments for patients suffering from incurable diseases At present however PGHD is not systematically arranged or accumulated to be used as a valuable data source Patients have no choice but to investigate and understand their conditions independently without any informative and emotional support for their health conditions unless they belong to any specific group or organization [14] If PGHD is not systematized and only individually owned without accumulation on the scale of big data it is highly likely to lose any potential value for research necessary for the development of new drugs or treatments In addition patients are less likely to be able to efficiently find necessary information on diseases or drugs which would narrow the range of choices available for the effective treatment of diseases and potentially suffer from diminished control over their body due to their dependence on information gathered passively Naturally healthcare professionals may also lose the motivation to use PGHD in making diagnoses and face the risk of judging patients\xe2\x80\x99 health from an incomplete and simplistic perspective \x01 3 3 Potential of a Patient Networking Service \x01 Against this backdrop Humanscape is working to establish its namesake platform Humanscape a decentralized patient network based on blockchains Humanscape can provide practical help for patients to overcome their diseases through intellectual and emotional interaction with each other based on community activities This process is expected to generate and collect a high volume of patient data namely PGHD on various disease groups Furthermore Humanscape facilitates active research into incurable diseases and the development of new drugs by linking patients to external industry sectors such as pharmaceutical firms and research institutes and helps patients to avoid complications and enjoy healthy lives through the continuous self management of their lifestyle and symptoms With these services Humanscape is taking steps to liberate patients from incurable diseases as its contribution to a world where everyone is healthy \x01 7 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cBlockchain based Patient Network Humanscape \x01 1 Humanscape\x01 1 1 Token Utilities\x01 \x01 \x01 Token utilities of Humanscape induces stakeholders to behave in a way that helps patients who are the principal community users to overcome their diseases The blockchain of Humanscape consists of HUM Tokens (HUM) the basic unit for transactions HUM Points (HP) points used within in the community and HUM Donations (HD) points used for donations In addition Activity Index Donation Index and User Score affect the token utilities The token model of Humanscape is based on the STEEM model which is evaluated as one of the most innovative among blockchain based communities and has been optimized to suit the needs of patient communities 8 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c\x01 1 1 1 HUM Token \x01 HUM is the basic transactional token in Humanscape\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain It can be purchased and sold in the exchange and transferred among users The HUM holding is used for the operation of Humanscape except the HUM used for the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) \x01 Inflation\x01 After the ICO HUM issues tokens at an inflation rate of 10 percent The inflation rate decreases by 1 percent each year for four years following the issuance Subsequently it decreases at a steady rate of 0 5 percent every year and the inflation rate eventually reaches 0 5 percent after 16 years Inflation is an important factor in stimulating token utilities but could lead to an excessive depreciation of tokens as supply outstrips demand Humanscape prepares ways to burn token holdings in case of a plunge in token value due to excessive inflation This burning process is carried out when the reward value is not deemed to be commensurate to the services \x01 1 1 2 HUM Point \x01 HP refers to points used within the Humanscape community HP is not traded in the exchange but can be purchased using HUM or earned through activities in the community Although speculators may attempt to trade HUM for short term profits Humanscape intends to minimize the potential for speculation by limiting the routes for earning HP used in the community and its conversion to HUM \x01 Earning HP\x01\x01 HP can be earned in five ways First patients earn HP when their contents are rewarded with votes from other users Second HP and HD holders are paid interest in HD according to the inflation of their HP and HD holdings Third patients earn HP when institutions utilize their health data to recruit subjects for clinical studies and to be used in post marketing surveillance for new drugs Fourth HP is earned when patients take part in the qualification process of institutions And finally HP is earned when HUM is converted to HP \x01 9 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cInflation Distribution Method \x01 As for rewards for content creation and payment for interest users are awarded tokens from the Reward Pool which is formed as a result of inflation Community activities eligible for rewards include \xe2\x80\x9ccontents creation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvoting \xe2\x80\x9d Of the total inflation 85 percent goes to the content creator and users who vote on it while 15 percent is paid to users as interest in proportion to their HP and HD holdings Applicable reward percentage for Content x is calculated based on the formula below P reward percentage for content V number of votes given to the content p weighted value index (adjusted by learning the community activity rate) Of the total amount of additional tokens issued on the relevant day (M) Content x is rewarded tokens in proportion to P P reward percentage for content M additional tokens issued on the relevant day R reward for the content The creator of Content x receives 65 percent of the calculated rewards and the voters receive 35 percent S author rewards C voter rewards Interest on User x\xe2\x80\x99s HP and HD holdings is calculated as follows M additional tokens issued on the relevant day I interest payments H HP and HD holdings To prevent indiscriminate conversion HP is converted to HUM tokens in 12 equal installments over a period of 12 weeks 10 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c\x01 Limits on HP Conversion \x01 HP can be converted into HUM However considering the value of HP which exists to operate and promote the community Humanscape intends to place a limit on its conversion in order to forestall a disturbance of the Humanscape ecosystem caused by economic power Specifically HP can be easily converted up to a certain volume but the conversion cost increases exponentially if a user wants to hold HP above the cap An exception is made for institutions that seek to utilize health information data using HP \x01 1 1 3 HUM Donation \x01 HD refers to donation points earned through contributions to the community Activities within the community benefit patient associations supported by patients themselves which encourages their motivation to participate and patient associations can gain actual benefits through financial rewards In the long term patient associations\xe2\x80\x99 activities to represent the rights and interests of patients and take a lead role in the treatment of diseases may yield outstanding results that cannot be achieved by the strength of an individual patient alone Users\xe2\x80\x99 earned HD cannot be converted to HUM or HP as only patient associations that can organize donation events are allowed to convert HD to HUM HD is earned when receiving rewards for uploaded content and through 1 1 conversion using HP Users receive a base rate of 10 percent of the total rewards in HD for creating content If they wish to receive additional HD they can adjust the ratio of HP and HD in the reward To encourage donations Humanscape provides additional rewards in addition to the basic HD reward corresponding to 10 percent of the adjusted HD in cases where the ratio of HD is adjusted For example a user who decides to receive 60 percent of the total reward in HP and 40 percent in HD will receive an extra 4 percent in HD In other words users are able to receive more HD by setting the HD ratio higher compared to conversion at a 1 1 ratio HD earned through this process can be freely donated within the community HD can be raised by patient associations and the HD collected can be withdrawn in two ways depending on the type of donations First for the unlimited fundraising method (regular contribution) with no set period and target amount the HD raised is converted to HUM tokens in 12 equal installments over a period of 12 weeks For the raising method with a deadline on the other hand the HD raised is converted to HUM tokens over a period of 4 weeks from the deadline or after the target amount is met The contributions collected are prohibited from being donated again 11 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c\x01 1 1 4 Activity Index \x01 The Activity Index indicates a user\xe2\x80\x99s activeness on the Humanscape community The score increases when the user logs in creates content casts votes etc and has a half life of 30 days to reflect the most recent Activity Index Users are able to cast more votes with a higher Activity Index At current Activity Index A0 Activity Index of the last active day T half life (30 days) t elapsed days \x01 1 1 5 Donation Index \x01 The Donation Index measures the volume of donations made by a user and is designed to encourage user donations The Donation Index increases when a user makes donations using HD Donations are recognized as contributions to community activities and therefore a user with a high Donation Index is allocated more votes as is the case with the Activity Index Unlike the Activity Index however the Donation Index accumulates without a half life \x01 1 1 6 User Score \x01 User Score is a composite index calculated based on the HP and HD holding amounts as well as the Activity Index and Donation Index User Score determines the number of votes and bandwidth allocated to users Based on the assumption that the overall distribution of the total HP and HD holding and the total sum of the Activity Index and Donation Index follows a normal distribution a standard score is calculated using the formula below This standard score is used to prevent new or minority users from exercising or abusing excessive influence G a user\xe2\x80\x99s HP and HD holding + Activity Index + Donation Index StDev of G m average of G M User Score (minimum value of M = 10)\x01 \x01 12 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c1 1 7 Bandwidth \x01 The various user activities within the community create transactions that generate data Since there is a limit to data usage capacity due to the characteristics of the blockchain network Humanscape uses dynamic bandwidth allocation method like Steem to resolve the data capacity issue The dynamic bandwidth allocation method sets a target capacity and lowers each user\xe2\x80\x99s maximum bandwidth per share when demand soars and raises it when demand drops Humanscape limits the bandwidth that each user can use in proportion to their User Score while the whole bandwidth depends on the total data capacity of the blockchain network B total bandwidth capacity Bx bandwidth of User x M User Score n total number of users\x01 \x01 1 1 8 Voting Right \x01 Users can \xe2\x80\x9cupvote\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdownvote\xe2\x80\x9d uploaded content up to the number of votes allocated to them Since they can only cast a limited number of votes each day users are made to choose carefully They will also use their votes in a way that encourages quality content to be generated within the community partly in order to keep the value of their HUM from falling This is expected to facilitate the self regulation of content quality To promote user activities more votes are given to users with high HP and HD holdings and high Activity and Donation Indexes Every 24 hours each user\xe2\x80\x99s votes are replenished up to 20 percent of the maximum number of votes and each vote can be used only once as an \xe2\x80\x9cupvote\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cdownvote\xe2\x80\x9d for a single item of content V maximum votes M User Score 13 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cUsers who create quality content will generate many \xe2\x80\x9cvotes\xe2\x80\x9d and receive rewards in proportion to the votes Users who \xe2\x80\x9cvote\xe2\x80\x9d on such content also earn rewards in proportion to the number of votes the content has received \x01 \x01 1 2 Service Composition \x01 1 2 1 Personal Health Records \x01 Chronic or incurable diseases require patients to constantly document and manage their own health conditions Humanscape allows users to create content such as disease related records and to input and manage data e g symptoms administered medication and IoT on a single user profile For example diabetics who need blood sugar management can measure and record their blood sugar level on their user profile on a daily basis along with factors that influence blood sugar such as dietary habits and other physical changes Such personal health data not only helps each patient to self manage their health but also serves as useful sources for various services Firstly disease related records and symptoms can be shared within the community through various content High quality content is more likely to be shared and receive a high number of votes from users awarding the author with rewards proportional to the number of votes Secondly users who record their symptoms in detail are more likely to be exposed to the profiles or posts of other patients with similar 14 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0csymptoms With greater usage of the services users are provided with customized information in order to enhance their user experience In addition numerous healthcare related institutions conduct a variety of research and marketing programs in which patients may participate to earn HP For example users could take part in pharmaceutical companies\xe2\x80\x99 clinical tests post marketing surveillance on new drugs or medical devices and insurance companies\xe2\x80\x99 marketing programs for recommending an insurance policy tailored to patients\xe2\x80\x99 health These institutions\xe2\x80\x99 activities based on patients\xe2\x80\x99 personal health records can offer actual benefits to those with incurable diseases and alleviate the financial burden facing their families due to insurance costs etc As such Humanscape aims to use accumulated information on patients\xe2\x80\x99 health in a way that is beneficial to the health of patients as well as humankind at large \x01 \x01 1 2 2 Community Communities by Topic Users share content such as daily treatment records knowhow and latest information on various topics like diseases symptoms and side effects in communities with specific themes where patients can post their personal health records directly on a bulletin board If posts or comments receive an upvote HP is given as a reward A part of the reward is given as HD which can be used to donate to donation events organized by patient associations \x01 Communities for Patient Associations A\x01community\x01is\x01created\x01for\x01a\x01patient\x01association\x01that\x01is\x01registered\x01after\x01a\x01qualification\x01 process

daily treatment records knowhow and latest information as a combination of texts images and the uploader\xe2\x80\x99s health data (diseases symptoms and administered medicine) The number and volume of posts that can be uploaded within a given period are limited by bandwidth Uploaded content can be voted on by other users and content that receives an upvote within 30 days since the upload date is given a reward proportional to the number of upvotes and no reward can be awarded after 30 days The number of votes that a user can cast differs according to the User Score In order to 15 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cprovide reliable and quality content to patients content is displayed in order based on the upvote/downvote count \x01 1 2 3 Patient Association \x01 Humanscape allows patient associations to register and conduct various activities for its operation With the exception of some large scale patient associations it is difficult for patient associations to make sufficient investments in online infrastructure such as websites as they generally operate with membership fees and donations In addition patients were limited to share their information with certain patient associations only which resulted in a lack of online channels to share such information since the information was shared mostly at offline meetings Humanscape aims to meet patients\xe2\x80\x99 needs for online activities by providing online community platforms organized by disease Furthermore Humanscape allows HD obtained through community activities to be donated to donation events organized by patient associations so as to encourage donations \x01 1 2 4 Institutions \x01 Institutions registered on Humanscape after a qualification process can create an official username Institutions can upload various news and information and post official replies For example a pharmaceutical company can post its latest news on the bulletin board for its products or reply to an inquiry about possible side effects Also institutions can hold events using HP such as the recruitment of subjects for clinical trials and post marketing surveillance for targeted patients HP paid by institutions for such events are given to patients after discounting some of the advertising costs incurred during the recruitment process Lastly institutions may support patient associations or participate in donation events using HP \x01 1 2 5 Qualification Process for Organization \x01 Organizations such as patient associations and institutions may request registration as an organization in a Humanscape community and be approved according to a qualification process Verified organizations may conduct additional activities according to their qualification as described previously 16 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cIn Humanscape patient associations and institutions play a vital role in improving the quality of the community and developing the ecosystem and thus the participation of organizations is vital During its early stage Humanscape will organize its ecosystem to manage the inflow and verification of these organizations\xe2\x80\x99 qualification Later a qualification system will be introduced so that the process is conducted automatically The qualification process is as follows First applicants who wish to verify qualifications can request verification of their qualifications by submitting documentary evidence At this stage a certain amount of HP is used but some of it is returned once the qualification gets approved at the final stage However if disapproved the HP gets lost When the request for verification is made the verifier undertakes verification The person who first undertakes the verification becomes the verifier of that particular request The verifier must use a part of his or her HP as a guarantee for verification If the verifier\xe2\x80\x99s result aligns with the final result for approval the verifier receives the additional HP as well as HP provided as a guarantee But if the results do not align the verifier loses the HP provided as a guarantee With the completion of verification by the verifier the final assessment for the approval of the qualification begins and the process is completed after this stage Deliberators must also use HP as a guarantee and if their deliberation aligns with the final result of deliberation the HP used as a guarantee is returned along with additional HP \x01 1 2 6 Donations \x01 Humanscape aims to help patients to improve their health in various ways through community activities One of these ways involves the introduction of a donation system Patient associations whose purpose is to support patients are non profit organizations that operate with membership fees and donations There are many ways for individual users to support their own patient association but financial contributions will serve as a foundation for patient associations to further support their patients Humanscape awards HD to users who actively perform activities such as providing health related information allowing the user to donate financial support to desired patient associations Donation Process Users can donate some of the rewards given for content When a donation event is designated the HD earned for content is provided to the donation event When a donation event has not been designated the user can select an event to donate to through a donation channel and give some of the HD holding to the selected event The user obtains donation points in proportion to 17 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cthe donated HD which is accumulated and displayed on the user\xe2\x80\x99s profile Patient associations that created the relevant donation event can convert HD to HUM according to the type of the event which may then be used for the original purpose of the donation \x01 Organization of a Donation Event Donation events can be generated by the administrator account of a patient association Creating a donation event requires information such as organization information the donation type project introduction fundraising period fundraising goal and donation usage plan In order to create a donation event a patient association must be registered with more than 30 members and the Activity Index of the group members must be above a certain level When the administrator account creates a donation event the donation event is finally registered on the donation channel through a vote within the patient association The vote is determined when the Activity Index of the voters exceeds 50 percent of the Activity Index of total members of the patient association 18 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c2 Usecases \x01 2 1 Private Sector \x01 Targeted Advertising Targeted advertising is currently one of the most general and effective methods of online advertising Some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading IT companies such as Google and Facebook have grown to their current scale based on earnings from targeted advertising Humanscape aims to provide a targeted advertising solution that designates a target group for advertising based on patient recorded health information to display or induce clicks on ads This method of advertisement will be favored by various clients such as pharmaceutical companies insurance companies and health supplement foods sellers As the target is a patient group formed around healthcare and medical topics advertisements tailored for such topics are expected to be more effective than in other channels Targeted advertisements are charged fees that contribute toward the operation of the Humanscape Community HP paid by clients for targeted advertising is added to the Humanscape pool and can be used to reward patients with HP when they record their health information contributing to the sustainability of the ecosystem Later the margin of inflation may be partially set aside for operation funds instead of charging advertising fees \x01 Recruitments for Clinical Trials Clinical studies are based on people s participation in new diagnostic preventive and therapeutic methods The global clinical research market is valued at 40 billion dollars as of 2016 [15] and it is also estimated that 13% of total clinical research cost is used for patient recruitment [16] In this context the Humanscape community can bring about the following cost reduction effects First using health information accumulated in Humanscape can reduce the cost of recruiting clinical research subjects Recruiters can quickly screen patients who are suitable for clinical studies based on the patient s recorded health information Patients are more likely to respond positively because they are asked for clinical studies that are closely related to their current health status According to the survey by pharmaceutical companies and clinical agencies 80% of respondents reported that online community or patient network is overwhelmingly effective 19 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cin mass recruitment compared to other methods such as media advertisement or posters in hospitals [17] These patient group networks are similar in character to online health communities Patientslikeme for example has signed with inVentiv Health [18] for effective patient recruitment and has affiliated with government agencies like clinicaltrials gov[19] in order to accelerate clinical research According to the report issued by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development 37% of the online recruiters for clinical research failed to recruit a sufficient number of patients 11% did not register a single patient revealing a problem of low participation in clinical studies [20] Therefore Humanscape community could be a good alternative as to encouraging patient participation in clinical research In addition when people are recruited from Humanscape the rate of dropout will be lowered and the cost will be reduced Even if patients agreed to participate in clinical studies they are likely to drop out in the middle of the process if the research venue is far away from the patient\xe2\x80\x99s house or workplace or if he/she cannot fit into the schedule With the fact that about 30% of patients give up the research halfway appropriate compensation and information on individual s health status proved to be effective for complete participation in clinical trials[20] Humanscape can reduce the cost of dropout by offering appropriate compensation and negotiating participation schedule in real time \x01 Post Market Surveillance(PMS)\x01 Post market surveillance (PMS) is the safety assessment of newly launched medicines or medical devices [21] Because it is not possible to predict all side effects that may occur during use of a medicine with pre approval research conducted on a limited number of patients the FDA undertakes PMS and risk assessment programs[22] More specifically PMS is conducted to review safety issues in closer detail and side effects that were not pre identified by collecting data on side effects and unintended effects from an unidentified group of patients Types of data used in PMS include data voluntarily submitted and recorded by patients and the patient registry In Humanscape there are patients who suffer from many different diseases These patients record treatment effects and the side effects of their medications Therefore data necessary for PMS gets accumulated in Humanscape which can then be put to use actively for PMS Furthermore by initiating surveys on patient groups within Humanscape more standardized information necessary for monitoring can be selectively collected In the US the budget for PMS is on average 2 16 million dollars per case (about 2 2 billion won) with the total cost amounting to 1 02 billion dollars (about 11 trillion won) [23] Domestic pharmaceutical companies have also been making a significant investment in PMS Currently pharmaceutical companies contact individual hospitals and other medical 20 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cinstitutions for PMS but Humanscape can establish itself as the platform where high quality information can be provided One problem with PMS is that it minimizes the observation period and the number of test participants in order to receive approval for the release of new medicines as quickly as possible [24] In other words while the assessment of treatment effects of the medicine can take place effectively during PMS it is difficult to completely guarantee the safety of the medicine In this regard Humanscape can help overcome the practical limitations of PMS with data from patients accumulated over a long period of time \x01 E commerce\x01 E commerce is a service for trading products that assist the treatment of diseases such as healthcare devices medical devices health supplement foods and over the counter (OTC) drugs Relevant products are automatically selected and recommended based on personal symptom records submitted by patients and useful product information is provided to help patients make informed purchases In addition patients can share their reviews of purchased products with the community and search for products that they are interested in In other words patients are able to easily and conveniently purchase products that are most relevant to their health condition and disease thereby effectively improving their own health Furthermore as E commerce is a service linked with the blockchain based Humanscape Community brokerage fees can be reduced helping patients toward reasonable consumption and guaranteeing greater transparency compared with other commerce services \x01 Insurance Solicitation and Sales\x01 The Internet has emerged as the most important marketing channel for the sale of insurance products Insurance companies can lower their operating costs with the internet [25] which is the most cost effective channel and consumers can benefit from lower premiums According to a research study by Bain&Company in 2015 8% of life insurance and 10% of property and casualty insurance worldwide is being sold online and this is expected to increase to 15% and 23% within 3 5 years respectively [26] Keeping pace with such trends Humanscape can offer more advanced types of online insurance products to patients More specifically patients can not only compare and analyze diverse insurance products at a single glance but also receive recommendations for the most suitable insurance based on their personal information Furthermore the platform helps patients to make decisions by surveying the insurance products purchased by people with similar diseases and soliciting their feedback In addition patients can benefit from lower premiums through IoT data that can be acquired by linking the digital wellness platform and the Humanscape community The digital wellness 21 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cplatform that aims to promote health in all aspects of life with digital technology is used by many people as it can be accessed easily regardless of time or space concerns Humanscape connects smart phones and wearable devices to the platform and provides services so that users can set individual health targets and achieve them In particular for patients with chronic diseases the community can serve as an opportunity to promote healthy lifestyles via daily activities by encouraging healthy habits suitable for the treatment of specific diseases separately from hospital or medication treatment If patients regain their health their medical expenses decrease As insurance companies lower premiums accordingly patients and insurance companies both gain economic benefits \x01 \x01 \x01 2 2 Public Sector \x01 Improving the Health of Patients in Developing Countries The blockchain based Humanscape community may help narrow the healthcare gap between developed and developing countries and improve the health of people in developing countries Compared to those of advanced nations benefiting from sophisticated healthcare services many countries in Africa South America and Asia still suffer from epidemics starvation and water pollution In Indonesia for example children under the age of five die from various illnesses every four minutes[27] In Africa the spread of infectious diseases such as Ebola virus and HIV/AIDS is not adequately controlled According to the World Health Organization (WHO) people from developing countries account for one third (30 7 million) of total worldwide deaths caused by chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer and among them 48 percent are 70 years old or younger [28] International agencies and organizations are investing vast amounts of money in programs to support drugs medical supplies and promote the health of the people of developing countries [29] Despite the assistance and continued advances in the medical treatment of diseases over the past century developing countries still suffer from a high mortality rate due to poor health facilities and a lack of pharmaceuticals Since medical problems in developing countries derive from information asymmetry low access monopoly of health data by the authorities[30] and and lack of medical infrastructure[31] however such investment is but a temporary measure to delay the deterioration of people s health rather than a fundamental solution 22 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cIn this context the Humanscape community helps address the imbalance in health information problem of expert shortage issues and prevent people from being deteriorated by wrong treatment Like the case in Zambia where the youth HIV/AIDS transmission rate is high the AIDS self diagnosis rate has increased from 12% to 40% after acquiring relevant information[32] Therefore the Humanscape Community helps patients in developing countries to share information on their diseases This allows information on infectious diseases to be obtained quickly to reduce damage and secure access to medical care Public Health Crisis\x01 Continuous monitoring of health information updated in Humanscape makes it possible to detect health issues within the population group that may prevent health risks and minimize damage Based on the flow of data on the symptoms of specific diseases we can capture the signs of infectious diseases In addition the spread of the disease can be prevented by analyzing the infection route based on the personal symptom record of the suspected infectee \x01 Comparative Effectiveness Research\x01 Healthcare data in Humanscape can be used for the comparative effectiveness research to overcome limitations of existing clinical studies and reduce medical expenditures A regulatory nature of current clinical studies shortens the follow up period and fails in reflecting actual clinical field A way to solve these problems is to conduct a comparative effectiveness research that identifies the most effective treatments by comparing the various treatments and effects of the same disease The use of health information in Humanscape allows us to compare and analyze the effects of treatment among patients with the same disease undergoing different procedures thereby enabling them to compare different therapies and find the most effective method In this way health information that is shared and accumulated by Humanscape can be effectively used for data based comparative effectiveness studies and helps consumers clinicians buyers and policymakers to make decisions to improve healthcare at the individual or group level \x01 \x01 23 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c2 3 Research Sector Rare and Incurable Diseases Voluntary health information from patients may contribute in the study of rare and incurable diseases that are difficult to obtain data samples For example Patientslikeme published a paper in Nature Biotechnology in 2011 Patientslikeme refuted a paper [33] that claimed Lithium could slow the progression of ALS published at the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2008 Patientslikeme tracked the experience of 149 patients for a year to prove ineffectiveness of lithium [34] What is interesting is the number of patients who voluntarily offered their health data in Patientslikeme was higher than the number of patients participating in PNAS studies using traditional clinical testing methods [35] In the PNAS study lithium was administered only to 16 patients out of 44 whereas in Patientslikeme 348 of 4 318 ALS patients were reportedly taking Lithium Among those 348 patients a total of 149 patients who met a certain condition was analyzed for data Relevant data accumulated in Humanscape will also be available to take part in the research of rare and incurable diseases \x01 \x01 Development of New Medicines and Clinical Research\x01 \x01 It usually requires more than 10 years and over one trillion won of investment to find a potential medicinal substance and to pass clinical research trials for developing a new medicine [36] Because of the astronomical costs and time involved this process has mainly been confined to global pharmaceutical companies with sufficient capital and while the development of new medicines for rare or incurable diseases was delayed In order to resolve this issue diverse methods to change the paradigm of the development of new medicines are being designed and one such method is utilizing artificial intelligence based on clinical data provided by patients Using AI could significantly reduce the cost and time required to find a new medicinal substance via analysis of big data on health and medical services offered to patients [37] In this regard incidence of side effects or the medical history of patients accumulated in Humanscape could be actively utilized In addition building on the data provided by patients candidate medicinal substances for new tailored medicines can be developed and increase the success rate of clinical trials by efficiently connecting with patients \x01 24 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c3 Technical Features \x01 3 1 Smart Media Token(SMT) \x01 Smart Media Token (SMT) is a Steem based blockchain token protocol that enables the creation and release of token There are well known token protocols such as Etherum(ERC 20) NEO and Counterparty However because of the transaction costs processing speed and the hierarchical relationship of private keys created for financial institutions not for social media it is hard to provide a desirable user experience in a community service led by the content[38] Therefore Humanscape adopts SMT as a token protocol and tries to solve the existing problems by utilizing the proprietary characteristics of the widely recognized steem blockchain \x01 3 2 Performance \x01 The concept presented above is proved through Steemit Steemit is a social network platform based on a database of Steem blockchain It is similar to a blog site such as reddit com except for the financial rewards and text storage in blockchain Steem blockchain is design to estimate the contribution of contents creators and distribute rewards through the collective intelligence in the platform Concept of this Steem blockchain is called Proof of Brain (PoB) PoB makes it possible to create steadily growing community by distributing tokens appropriately and let users contribute to Steem with high value contents Consensus algorithm of Steem is Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Witnesses are selected by Steem token holders and they creates the block Only selected witnesses can quickly generate blocks by taking part in block generation The Steem network is based on Graphene which is known to withstand more than 1 000 transactions per second Graphene which is also used in Bitshares and EOS has been successfully run in the Steemit service resulting in more transactions through Steem than the sum of the number of transactions processed in Bitcoin and Ethereum [39] 25 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cIn this technological concept Steemit is almost a perfect example and proven to be feasible \x01 3 3 Smart Contract \x01 Smart Contract is a technology that allows stakeholders to conclude and implement contracts without intermediaries using a blockchain based on the technical characteristics of a distributed ledger In Humanscape rewards are given when various user created content (videos texts etc ) is evaluated as meaningful data and receives an upvote Smart Contract is used to ensure the reliability of data trading during the implementation of such payment contracts In addition Smart Contract is used for various types of in service trading verification of qualification and implementation of other service logic Smart Contract is based on SMT and the data collection and operations that occur outside the blockchain are executed through Oracle \x01 3 4 Hierarchical Structure of Service \x01 26 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c3 4 1 Service Layer \x01 Service Layer is an area where Humanscape\xe2\x80\x99s core logic is executed and core data is saved Service Layer is comprised of data storage (blockchain InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and hybrid) and other service logics Patient data entering from the API layer is recorded on the blockchain after implementing Smart Contract in Humanscape\xe2\x80\x99s core Data handled in Humanscape can mainly be categorized into personal information personal health data and content shared with the community Personal information and personal health data are comprised of sensitive information that must be kept confidential or valuable data that constitute patients\xe2\x80\x99 assets as required by institutions and are therefore saved encrypted in dispersed storage areas to prevent public exposure In order to specify the ownership of saved data a hash value is saved on a STEEM blockchain and mapped to prevent forgery or tampering in outside areas including Humanscape Content data can include large volume data such as images and videos and is stored in external storage such as AWS S3 to ensure the effective management of resources Later IPFS will be used to implement decentralization in more areas The aforementioned data defines various activities in the Humanscape ecosystem (posting commenting voting rewarding verifying the qualification of patient associations and institutions and donating tokens) as Smart Contract based on which users give out tokens as rewards or payments \x01 \x01 3 4 2 API Layer \x01 The API layer is comprised of API for the storage and search of patient data and the development of services The data recorded by patients is categorized through the API layer and gains greater value and patients can select any desired data through conditional search In the long term there are plans to analyze and convert qualitative and unmeasurable data into meaningful data in addition to qualitative and measurable data among personal symptom records submitted by patients 27 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0cFurthermore the Humanscape API is designed to be available for use by third parties to allow their services to be linked with Humanscape or to allow the development of new services linked with Humanscape \x01 \x01 \x01 3 4 3 Application Layer \x01 The application layer provides web and mobile applications to ensure easy access for patients The application layer provides optimal UX/UI through which patients can use their personal symptom records more conveniently and a community environment where users can share information through communication with other users and naturally benefit from emotional support Also the application layer provides various services such as donation and commerce services to allow the meaningful usage of HP issued in the community ecosystem 28 Copyright 2018 Humanscape all rights reserved | support@humanscape io \x0c4 Token Events 4 1 Summary HUM Token HUM is a meta token of SMT Initially token conversion event was scheduled for existing token holders after issuing ERC20 tokens on Ethereum and Steem based tokens through SMT in the near future Total issue volume 125 000 000 000 HUM Standard
