\xe2\x80\x9cSGChain\xe2\x80\x9d) is an organic game ecosystem built on decentralized smart contracts for indie and other developers to get invested reviewed by gamers and other investors for gamers to invite interact and gift each other for game influencers to interact with developers and gamers more closely for investors to invest based on real marketing acceptance and for advertisers to provide native and natural ads to the right audience We believe blockchain will empower us to disrupt the current gaming industry and solve some pain points in today\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem Our mission is to harness the blockchain technology and ride this wave to rebuild this organic healthy mutually beneficial co existential ecosystem There will be two main products of the SGChain Our main public chain that\xe2\x80\x99s built on the latest and fastest blockchain algorithm The disruptive SGChain Ecosystem For developers SGC can help them raise fund fix the prevailing issues in the current gaming industry such as fraudulent ads clicks and fraudulent payment as well as inconvenient inconsistent expensive payment systems SGC will also provide a complete economy system that ensures better income for developers SGChain will provide the ICO smart contract to global game developers to facilitate the trading of the ingame currency with the SGC currency and make the currencies of different games interchangeable via the common SGC coin For gamers this will be a fun fair private safe and profitable or powerful game world For advertisers this will put you in front of your curated target audience in a most native and direct way Investors can also benefit from the ecosystem in that the early stage user participation of a game project will provide insights on future game projections and \x0chence help them make more accurate and risk less investment as well as helping them getting returns in a much shorter term than traditional investment The cross platform SGC will be launched in the global market to support multiple languages The ingame premium currencies of all games on the SGC ecosystem can be purchased with SGC And thus be interchangeable with the currencies of other games seamlessly and smoothly In the meantime SGC support will also serve as an open world sandbox game It can also support different genres of games such as casino games casual games MMORPG etc Any investment from American Chinese or Singapore individuals will not be accepted 2 Background 2 1 Global Gaming Market Size In 2016 there were more than 200 million global users on Steam platform and their revenue already hit 3 5 billion US dollars annually Now we have around almost seven billion in global population which means there are still hundreds of millions people out there due to different payment system or still under internet infrastructure development We wanted to connect all the players and developers around the world through SGChain The recent report shows that the total revenue of global gaming software and hardware will exceed 150 billion US dollars in 2017 and the entire game trend is shifting toward the mobile market Not only that AR VR and MR games are also fast growth markets 2 2 Current Game Industry Ecosystems and Problems \x0cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult and lengthy battle for developers to fight uphill to just bring their games in front of their target gamers We can see many problems in this competitive gaming market Monopoly is dominating the gaming industry Take a look at a snapshot of one day\xe2\x80\x99s revenue on Appstore \x0csource https //medium com/@sm_app_intel/a bunch of average app revenue data and why you s hould ignore it 2bea283d37fc It\xe2\x80\x99s getting more and more difficult to raise fund Fraud in advertisement makes the cost of user acquisition higher and higher Developers revenue is seriouly affected by the fake payment Payment difficulties cause the game limitation for users also affect the game flow and developer revenue There are so many creative indie games out there However they cannot survive in such a competitive environment Many companies are forced to shut down the business because of these challenges Especially small and midsize and indie game developers 2 2 Opportunities Blockchain The SGChain team thinks that blockchain technology is a great fit for the current market trends and it can solve some of the biggest problems in the industry SGChain will create a safe decentralized profile for each user to protect their privacy and connect all the users around the world with a global payment and \x0creward system We will work with top blockchain development team Qtum and top payment solution team \xe2\x80\x8bLightning Network to minimize potential network congestion problems AI The platform will also use AI to connect players and games more efficiently and reduce developers\xe2\x80\x99 advertising cost thus it can maximize the benefits for both users and developers Globalization One of the biggest trend in gaming it\xe2\x80\x99s evident in hit games such as PlayerUnknown\ s Battlegrounds Strike of Kings and card games like Texas Hold\xe2\x80\x99em Poker We found players from around the world are increasingly interacting and communicating through games Cross Platform \xe2\x80\x8bUnity Unreal engine are versatile powerful software engines optimal to develop a cross platform game Social Needs Players have increasing need for social interactions online and offline Open Source Everyone can build the same structure on the SGChain platform 3 SGChain Advantages 3 1 About SGChain SGChain is based on a distributed smart contract approach to building a platform for gamers and game developers The data on the blockchain requires network consensus and cannot be tampered

wide competition May 1 2020 Content Update Cryptobetting Feature 6 Technical Solution 6 1 System Framework SGChain aims to provide users with a visual smart contract based multi platform gaming platform \x0cWe implemented a light client SGC wallet and gaming platform at the application level where the gaming platform includes various games based on SGC tokens Following up we will gradually open platform proprietary SDK provided to the majority of developers allowing game developers to quickly develop SGC based DAPP and blockchain games based on SGChain\ s platform services and SDK support and quickly publish on our platform and distribution SGChain provides a series of middleware for each game including middleware such as support for user wallet call to smart contract such as keyethereum / ethereumjs tx / ethereum abi The backend implements some centralized services to provide for front end calls In this way the combination of centralization and decentralization provides users with a more efficient and smoother experience on the premise of ensuring data fairness and safety Security The core of the game data and logic are on the Ethereum blockchain management by a smart contract to ensure the openness of the game will not be tampered with At the same time when users utilize the wallet function of SGChain to play the game the private key of all user Ethereum accounts will be stored in the user\ s local terminal and will never be transmitted over the network nor will it be stored in the centralized server ensuring the user\xe2\x80\x99s account privacy and security 6 2 Smart contract architecture Compared to ETH smart contracts SGChain takes the economic stability inflation and deflation within the games into consideration A new version of the smart contract can be implemented for an existing game if majority of players voted for the changes through the consensus mechanism SGChain will support two scripting languages Lua and Wren Lua is a Turing complete programming language with compilers and bytecode virtual machines designed and optimized for blockchain SGChain uses Lua as its preferred language for smart contract programming on the SGChain blockchain which supports \x0cstatic compilation into bytecodes and on demand execution in blockchain networks Wren (http //wren io) is a small fast category based programming language Wren\ s developers describe it as akin to putting a small tak file into a lua sized package plus a bit of Erlang\ s features into a familiar modern grammar The Wren language and virtual machine were chosen because of its short easy to use documentation and accessible code base It also has very good performance and can be easily embedded iton C ++ applications Web Components (WASM) WASM is an emerging web standard for building high performance web applications that can be well defined and sandboxed with a small amount of fit The benefits of WASM are widely supported by the industry so smart contracts such as C or C ++ can be developed and developed in familiar languages Separation of authentication and application To maximize parallelism while minimizing the computational task of regenerating the application state from the program log the SGC OS divides the validation logic into three parts Confirm the consistency of the message Confirm that all preconditions are valid Modify the application status The internal consistency of the validation message is read only and does not require access to the blockchain state which means that it can be executed with maximum parallelism Validating preconditions (such as demand balancing) is also read only so you can also benefit from parallelism Only write access is needed to make changes to the application state and each application needs to be processed in order \x0cAuthentication is a read only process that validates whether or not a message can be applied and the application is actually executing it Real time calculations need to be performed but once the transaction is included in the blockchain no more authentication is required Virtual machine independent architecture This is the purpose of the SGC operating system software to support a wide range of virtual machines while continuing to add new virtual machines as needed over time 6 3 Consensus mechanism Because of the distributed nature blockchain needs a consensus mechanism to function properly The widely used consensus algorithms include Proof of Work (PoW) Proof of Stake (PoS) Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) Delegated Proof of Interest (DPoS Delegated Proof of Stake) SGChain will adopt DPOS DPOS can allocate equity after production without extra computing power It can also dynamically determine the execution result of the smart contract by the agent or all the nodes according to the transaction status of the network SGC as a public chain forms a community consensus that cannot be done without the economic means token support Token holding not only gets the contract release network bifurcation and other blockchain based services but also participate in voting as a proxy node to provide services token reward SGChain named this token SGC and each SGC holder calls it a stakeholder allocating the corresponding voting weight based on the SGC\ s holdings The proxy node is voted by the rights holder The top 20 proxies with the highest number of tickets take turns verifying the transactions in turn all in the order determined by all proxy nodes and guaranteed not to be tampered with Acting can work for the benefits of normal work on the contrary abnormal work or not will be \x0cpunished 6 4 Functional structure Backbone SGChain Backbone SGCs based on the latest blockchain research will address some of Ethereum\ s existing technical issues for faster transactions (Gosig Scalable Byzantine Consensus on Adversarial Wide Area Network for Blockchains) Digital wallet and its use Each user on the SGC platform will have an e wallet to store their SGC coins Users can use currency to invest in games they like upgrade their avatar interact with friends such as Avatar gifts Can also be used to support their favorite new game development buy in the game upgrade equipment and so on SGC Developer Alliance SGC based developers can announce game builds on the SGC platform launch ICOs get early game development funding and enable users to participate in game development decisions early with user supported developers developing and distributing themselves The SDChain platform is dedicated to providing a publishing environment that allows every developer to survive grow and succeed Platform SDK Third party games released on the platform can access the platform SDK get the user\ s player information friends list and can call the SDK to achieve the user information flow content release instant notification and view the user\ s game achievements praise and so on Other content providers Since the SGC platform will be developed based on Unity the SGC platform will actively introduce and share revenue with third party 3D models such as characters costumes animations scenes and more \x0c7 Team SGChain

\x0cparticipants informed of every detail of the development including its progress and expected milestones whether postponed or not) So it does not necessarily give buyers timely and full access to the development progress Insufficient disclosure is inevitable and reasonable 3) Regulations Cryptocurrencies and tokens are being or may be regulated by the authorities in different countries From time to time SGChain development and operations team may receive inquiries notices warnings or orders from one or more authorities and may even be ordered to suspend or terminate this public sale SGChain Development or SGChain Token SGChain\ s development marketing promotion or this public sale plan may be seriously affected or be terminated as a result \xe2\x80\x8bThe regulatory policy may change from time to time the existing regulatory clearance or tolerance for SGChain or this public sale plan in any country may be temporary In various countries SGChain Token may be defined as a virtual commodity digital asset or even securities or currency at any time so SGChain Token may be barred from trading or holding in some countries as required by local regulatory requirements In various countries SGChain Token may be defined as a virtual goods digital asset or even securities or currency at any time so SGChain Token may be barred from trading or holding in some countries as required by local regulatory requirements 4) Cryptography Cryptography is ever evolving it cannot guarantee absolute security at all time Advances in cryptography (such as password cracking) or technological advances (such as the advancement of quantum computers) \xe2\x80\x8bcan put cryptography based systems including SGChain at risk This may cause SGChain Token to be stolen destroyed or devalued To the reasonable extent SGChain development and operations team will be prepared to take preventive or remedial measures to upgrade SGChain\ s underlying protocols to cope with any progress in cryptography \x0cThe future of cryptography and security innovation is unpredictable SGChain development and operations team will try its best to face the ever changing field of cryptography and security 5) Development failure or give up SGChain is still in the development stage it is not a finished product \xe2\x80\x8bDue to the technical complexity of SGChain systems SGChain development and operations team may face unpredictable difficulties Therefore the development of SGChain may fail (for example due to lack of funding) which may cause SGChain team fail to deliver the tokens to any buyer in this public sale 6) Theft There may be attempts to steal funds received from the public sale \xe2\x80\x8bSuch theft or theft attempts may affect the SGChain development and operations team\ s ability to fund SGChain development Although the SGChain development and operations team will adopt state of the art technology to secure crowdfunding funds some cyber theft is still hard to stop 7) Source code flaws No one can guarantee SGChain\ s source code completely flawless \xe2\x80\x8bCode may have certain flaws mistakes errors or bugs which may prevent users from using certain features expose user information or cause other problems Such bug will undermine the availability stability or security of SGChain and adversely affect the value of SGChain Token 8) Security weakness SGChain blockchain rests on open source software and is an permissionless distributed ledger Regardless of the SGChain Development and Operations team\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to keep the SGChain system secure anyone may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of SGChain that the security measures adopted by the SGChain \x0cDevelopment and Operations team will be unable to prevent or remedy This may consequently result in the loss of SGChain Token or other digital tokens held by the purchaser 9) \xe2\x80\x8bDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack The Ethereum is designed to be public and unpermissioned Therefore Ethereum may suffer distributed denial of service cyber attacks from time to time Such attacks will adversely affect stall or paralyze the SGChain system As a result the affected transactions may be delayed in recording or being added to the blocks of the Ethereum blockchain or they may not be performed at all temporarily 10) Insufficient Processing Power The rapid growth of the SGChain will be accompanied by a surge of transactions and demand for processing power If the demand for processing power exceeds what the nodes of the Ethereum blockchain network can provide the SGChain network may destabilize or stall which may result in fraudulent or erroneous transactions such as \xe2\x80\x9cdouble spending\xe2\x80\x9d In the worst case scenario the SGChain Token held by any purchasers may be lost rolled back with the Ethereum blockchain or even hard forked The aftermath of these events will undermine the usability stability and security of the SGChain and the value of the SGChain Token 11) Unauthorized Claim of Purchased SGChain Tokens Anyone who gains access to the registered email or account of a SGChain Token purchaser by deciphering or cracking the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s password will be able to obtain all of the purchaser\ s SGChain Tokens Consequently the purchased SGChain Tokens may be incorrectly sent to anyone who has access to the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s registered email or account and is irrevocable Each SGChain Token purchaser shall take the appropriate precautions to maintain the security of their registered email or account such as (i) use highly secure passwords (ii) refrain from opening or responding to scam emails and (iii) keep confidential and personal information strictly confidential \x0c12) SGChain Token Wallet Private Key The loss or destruction of the private key necessary to obtain the SGChain Token is irreversible SGChain Token can only be accessed through a local or online SGChain Token wallet with a unique set of public key and private key Each buyer should store his or her SGChain Token wallet private key with great care The SGChain Development and Operations team or anyone else will not be able to help recover the lost private key in the event that the key is lost compromised destroyed or stolen 13) \xe2\x80\x8bPopularity The value of SGChain Token largely depends on the popularity of the SGChain platform SGChain does not expect to be hugely popular or widely used shortly after launch \xe2\x80\x8bIn the worst case scenario SGChain may even be marginalized attracting only a small group of users for a long time The demand for SGChain Token may be largly speculative The lack of users may cause SGChain Token\xe2\x80\x99s market price fluctuate greatly and have impact on the long term development of SGChain In the event of such price fluctuations the SGChain Development and Operations team will not (nor be liable to) stabilize or influence the SGChain Token market price 14) Price fluctuations Cryptocurrency tokens price \xe2\x80\x8btypically fluctuate sharply when traded in the open market Price shocks occur frequently in short periods The price may be valued in Bitcoin Ether U S Dollar or other currencies Such price fluctuations may be caused by market forces (including speculative trading) regulatory policy changes technological innovations the availability of exchanges and other objective factors that also reflect changes in the supply demand balance The SGChain Development and Operations team is not responsible for SGChain Token tradings in any secondary market Therefore the SGChain development and \x0coperations team is not obliged to stabilize the price fluctuations of SGChain Token SGChain Token traders shall bear the risk involved in the trading \x0c
