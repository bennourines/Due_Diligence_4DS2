WHOLE NETWORK VISION 22 REVISED RECORDS 23 4 \x0c1 Background Why do e commerce websites push things you like or need Why do you receive a lot of loan information when you are short of money You read the car purchase information on the Internet why would the customer service of 4S shop contact you actively When your bank deposits are large various investment and financing platforms will find you These are all because when you use mobile phones computers and other terminal devices you leave traces of behavior on the Internet and are recorded The internet platform obtains a large number of users through pre subsidy and collects a large number of user data in the cloud Later it makes profits from user data through advertising value added services platform Commission and so on Therefore the valuation of an Internet company is calculated according to the cost of acquiring customers and the number of users Every day we generate a large amount of behavior data on the Internet through various terminal devices and upload a large amount of behavior data to the cloud in real time but the value generated by this data is not owned by individual users In Internet giants such as Google and Facebook while providing free services to users they are also collecting information generated by users cleaning user data and transforming data value through cloud computing which is the traditional mode of information Internet With the advent of the 5G era the number of network connection devices increases greatly and huge user data will be generated on the edge of the network With the emergence of blockchain technology and end computing data collection and processing will inevitably return to the terminal from the cloud which can achieve the processing of massive data near the device terminal and through the blockchain network The transformation and transmission of data value has promoted the transformation of information internet to value internet Value Internet brings about changes in creation of relationships and the value system of the information Internet People\ s understanding of the objective world can be divided into two categories one is the understanding of the attributes and essence of the various things and the law of movement the other is the understanding of the significance of the various things in the objective world for human survival and development (i e value) Marx\ s value theory breaks through the idea of explaining value from the perspective of cost or demand while explaining value from the perspective of the relationship between people The ultimate problem of labor value is the relationship between people The change from primitive society to Communist society is manifested in the improvement of economic quantity and the change of system but in essence the change of relationship between people In the era of the information internet big data has become an important means of production Big data covers two key points big data and cloud computing that is powerful computing power and data that can be accessed at any time in the cloud Coal is the main means of production in the first technological revolution oil and electricity are the main means of production in the second technological revolution and data will be the important means of production of this technological revolution Big data is the means of production cloud computing is the productivity and the Internet is the relationship of production but in the traditional relationship of the information Internet users cannot obtain the actual value out of their own behavior data 5 \x0cThe birth of blockchain technology provides a fairer value trading mode for Internet behavioral data information from which the value Internet was born Blockchain distributed network combined with intelligent contracts can solve many shortcomings of the information network The popularization and application of the blockchain technology will solve the problems of credit value transmission and value storage as well as the collection and storage of personal Internet behavior data Not only that blockchain contains enormous economic significance it can even be said that the market and the times called for the birth of blockchain The emergence of blockchains will establish a new Internet production relationship and value system The new value Internet will distribute revenue to all users through the blockchain circulation economic model Users can get rewards through personal use behavior in the new value network Users can be in a spontaneous and active state in the process of producing data the same party receiving data will give corresponding returns according to the data provided The transaction information of both sides will run in a transparent and unchangeable environment which will lead to a more positive cycle \xe2\x80\x93 this is the main function of the new value Internet in the blockchain era Value Internet Makes Everyone\ s Behavior More Valuable In fact the core of supporting the trillion dollar market value of the current Internet giant is the high frequency user behavior display and the data value brought by the significant number of users The significance of blockchain lies in that it can change the existing user data value system redistribute the ownership of data and allow users who really own data get rewards from sharing it while ensuring their privacy In the early days of the Internet Internet giants such as Google Facebook Amazon and Microsoft established the era of the information Internet which mainly accelerated the efficiency of information circulation and solved the problem of information asymmetry With the development of blockchains technologies such as Bitcoin and ETF have created digital communication of value but users\ behavior data ownership the issue of rights and interests\xe2\x80\x99 confirmation has yet not been solved Today Facebook is leading the creation of a 28 partner management and distribution organization the Libra Association to create a simple borderless currency and financial infrastructure for billions of people by issuing the encrypted digital currency Libra It holds that everyone has the inherent right to control their legitimate labor outcomes \xe2\x80\x93 open immediate and low cost global currency flows will create tremendous economic opportunities and commercial value for the world The release of Facebook\ s digital currency Libra will have a far reaching impact on the global economic landscape At the same time it also indicates that licensing will become a global vision and trend of change Blockchains will no longer be relatively confined to the technical field and will better benefit each of our Internet participants Therefore the Whole Network is committed to building a consensus co creation and win win behavioral value network which matches the real Internet through blockchain technology end computing 5G technology and so on to create the link between human behavior in the real world and the value flow in the virtual world It records the Internet behavior generated by users on the blockchain guaranteeing the authenticity and security of information The more individual Internet behavior users contribute the greater number of digital assets they acquire per unit time In this way users can be motivated to continuously contribute their Internet behavior to obtain more behavior rewards The future will be an era of increasingly more perfect personal value systems Through the Whole Network individuals will truly become creators and owners of value 6 \x0c2 Whole Network \xe2\x80\x93 A consensus co creation and win win behavioral value Network The arrival of a new era also means the transformation of the old Internet era In the value Internet ecosystem the data monopoly data hegemony and passive collection of user data will gradually be replaced by the active sharing of valuable data the ownership of data by users and the rapid data sharing and exchange With the initiative of users to own personal data and the migration of cloud computing to end computing data collection and processing can be achieved through mobile terminals and user data value conversion can be realized by using blockchain technology in mobile terminals and a decentralized behavioral value network can be established 2 1 User Rights and Interests Return to Users 2 1 1 User Behavior from Priceless to Valuable Value expression carrying and transmission are indispensable in transactions According to Adam Smith exchange helps to improve human productivity Value is one of the key factors involved in transactions How to better reflect value ensure value and exchange value is an eternal proposition With the continuous development of technology the efficiency of production and exchange has improved accordingly Internet can better solve the problem of information dissemination but it is difficult to ensure that the value of goods will not be damaged in the process of information transmission Blockchain networks can better solve this problematic point User behavior data is first processed through device terminals and the value Internet is realized by utilizing the unique technical characteristics of blockchain such as book publicity non tampering data confirmation smart contracts node recording and the licensing economic model The Whole Network is committed to creating an autonomous efficient and transparent new behavioral value internet The initial product form is the Node Store installed on the Whole Network mobile hardware terminal It covers application recommendation application downloads download incentives content sharing community airdrops user behavior data acquisition etc The Whole Network realizes the value of user\ s behavior through blockchain technology and end to end computing so that users\ rights and interests can be returned to their hands Users can get ecological token rewards by using the Whole Network mobile hardware terminal products and at the same time users can complete different tasks in the Node Store such as downloading APP/DAPP watching advertisements playing games sharing and distributing inviting new users and so on They will receive token rewards provided by APP/DAPP developers in the ecosystem to achieve users\xe2\x80\x99 behavior value 7 \x0c2 1 2 Users Have Data Autonomy The emergence of blockchain technology makes the control of personal data transfer from Internet companies to users themselves User\ s personal data can be associated with personal digital identity cards Users can choose that personal digital identity cards are anonymous or public They can also access the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s application platform from any terminal device anytime anywhere Blockchain technology companies make it possible for people to control their personal data by opening and sharing information from decentralized nodes The Whole Network will establish a blockchain account system to protect users\ privacy and guarantee user data ownership All users who activate the Whole Network mobile hardware terminal will get a unique Node ID Using the Node ID they can log on to all apps in the platform directly and can also activate the NODE token incentives Node ID is also the only account to manage the value rights and interests of users because the blockchain cannot be tampered with and decentralized users can effectively restrict the access rights of others to personal data through the Node ID and provide security assurance for personal data and personal information In the future users can choose whether to contribute their data to the Whole Network using the Node ID so that they can truly acquire the ownership of personal data 2 2 New Upgrade of Internet Advertising 2 2 1 Current Situation of Internet Advertising Market In recent years with the development of the Internet economy the Internet advertising mode has replaced the traditional television platform and become the main advertising channel Global advertising expenditure reached $568 5 billion in 2017 With the emergence of new consumption patterns and the continuous enrichment of traffic transformation methods global advertising expenditure reached 588 9 billion US dollars in 2018 Globally the United States continues to lead the Internet advertising market In 2018 the five countries with the largest Internet advertising expenditure in the world are the United States China the United Kingdom Japan and Germany Figure 2 The top five countries in global Figure 1 Global advertising market size Internet advertising spending in 2018 2011 2018 (Data source eMarketer & Prospective (Data source open source) Industry Research Institute) 8 \x0cIn the global Internet advertising market Google and Facebook have been controlling the lifeline of the global Internet advertising According to eMarketer data in 2018 Google and Facebook continued to be the leading global Internet advertising companies followed by BAT in China In China although the three BATs account for 69% of the Internet advertising revenue the following headlines are also eroding the market There is no doubt that the competition of Internet and mobile Internet advertising market in China will become more and more fierce in the future Due to the continuous expansion of consumption and the middle class China\ s Internet advertising expenditure continued to grow in 2018 with a market share of 65% Figure 3 Distribution of Global Internet Figure 4 2008 Distribution of Media Advertising Revenue Firms from 2017 to Advertising Expenditure in China 2019 (Data source eMarketer) (Data source eMarketer) Whether from the global Internet advertising market or from the domestic Internet advertising market the Internet advertising market is a huge market with fierce competition and still growing rapidly Because of this the global Internet advertising market also has problems that cannot be ignored the monopoly of Internet giants and chaos 2 2 2 New Upgrade of Advertising At present the Internet giants occupy the main market They have a large number of user and behavior data They not only play the role of advertising platform but also play the role of platform for developers and users Developers do not have a transparent way to measure the effectiveness of advertising which will result in waste of investment Advertising giants (middlemen) use their biased data and oligopoly to increase their revenue and take most of their profits In the era of media fragmentation users are scattered in a variety of chaotic application scenarios and traffic competition is increasingly fierce The Whole Network returns the value of behavior to users and redistributes Internet advertising by using blockchain technology which benefits both developers and users The birth of the Whole Network aggregating a large number of fragmented advertising portals for APPs through token incentives achieves the form of large scale advertising traffic creation in the Whole 9 \x0cNetwork It not only enables APPs to generate traffic but also greatly improve user experience and opens up a brand new advertising for developers 2 2 3 Internet application promotion is more effective In the traditional bidding model developers rely heavily on AE personnel of the advertising platform the conversion cost is always uncontrollable and users are tired of too intrusive or unrelated advertisements and tend to choose to install advertisement interceptors spontaneously In addition users are also prone to blind spots in advertising that is they intentionally or subconsciously ignore any visual information similar to advertisements or banners These two phenomena make the advertisement unable to reach the target users and yield poor advertisement results In the Whole Network developers use the incentive mechanism for advertising The Whole Network will share part of the platform promotion costs with users in the form of tokens Because of the value attributes of ecological tokens more users will be encouraged to actively participate in relevant application downloads advertising browsing content sharing etc Senders can use the Whole Network to achieve more accurate and effective promotion and traffic acquisition 2 2 4 More Real Internet Advertising User Data Data centralization also brings some problems regarding advertising fraud The current online advertising ecosystem has defects and the operation of the middle layer is opaque which creates fraud in the advertising network advertisers and malicious third parties possible According to the report of the advertising agency The&Partnership and Adloox Audit and Verification developers suffered losses of up to $16 6 billion in 2017 due to advertising fraud (robots backdoors using advertising service networks etc ) The problem of advertising fraud is becoming a crucial and difficult issue in the improvement of the advertising industry\xe2\x80\x99s efficiency The Whole Network is based on the underlying blockchain system which will make it difficult to tamper with false IP addresses in mass production Developers can verify the real clicks of advertisements through the digital identities of viewers and clickers which is conducive to reducing the losses caused by advertising fraud All user data and user behavior in the Whole Network will be real effective and unalterable and all developers will get more real advertising feedback in the ecosystem Blockchain with its credibility security and non tampering characteristics allows more data to be liberated and promotes the massive growth of data Blockchains\xe2\x80\x99 traceability makes every step needed to record of data from acquisition transaction circulation and calculation analysis can be left on blockchain which makes the quality of data obtain unprecedented strong trust endorsement and also ensures the correctness of data analysis results and the effect of data mining Blockchains can further standardize the use of data and refine the scope of authorization After desensitization the data transaction circulation will help break through the information island establish the data horizontal circulation mechanism and form 10 \x0c socialized big data Value transfer networks based on blockchains gradually promote the formation of data trading scenarios based on globalization Blockchains provide the integrity of booking and is weak at data statistical analysis Large data has massive data storage technology and flexible and efficient analysis technology which greatly improves the value and use space of blockchain data In the future the Whole Network will have a large number of ecological users By continuously collecting user behavior data and analyzing user behavior and interest data users can use mobile terminals and watch content shop play games read articles watch videos browse advertisements or share and transmit information with them In the future the Whole Network will continue to cooperate with advertisers developers project parties industry platforms and data companies During the period of the ecological development the data contributed by users will continue to be rewarded with the ecological token 3 Whole Network Infrastructure The Whole Network will be based on the value generated by user behavior with the help of hardware terminals and user behavior incentives to form a behavioral value network for everyone to use and benefit from Figure 5 Whole Network Infrastructure Diagram 3 1 Blockchain Layer \xef\x83\x98 Token incentive With the disappearance of Internet dividends and the rise of company operating costs as well as the monopoly of data and human resources by industry giants project developers are facing increasingly higher operating and marketing costs The emergence 11 \x0cand application of blockchains is gradually becoming cohesive In addition the value of behavior and data will gradually return to the individual users It also brings new opportunities for project promotion and business model innovation for all developers Whether it is a large scale subsidy to burn money in the initial stage of the Internet or a model of social + incentive in the later stage it is the rudiment of the initial stage of the behavioral value Internet By incorporating the user behavioral value system into the development of the project developers can further achieve the self circulation of the project and ultimately a win win situation between the commercial value and the rights and interests of users Figure 6 Developer incentive cycle The Whole Network will become a new bridge between users and developers It adopts the mode of token economy to ensure that the relationship between users and developers remains equal that is behavior is value By providing daily behavior data users can make continuous contributions to the developers\xe2\x80\x99 advancement Similarly users should also enjoy the value of behavioral data Therefore unlike the profit model of traditional platforms the Whole Network further promotes the enthusiasm of users by measuring and sharing some of the platform promotion costs and user behavior With the help of the token incentive model users do not need to spend extra energy to download and advertise related applications on a daily basis Reading content sharing and so on are rewarding for the value created by corresponding behavioral data At the same time it will also reduce the exclusion of users to developers help developers obtain content presentation and behavior data improve the cost effectiveness of advertising and ultimately form a virtuous circle of the application ecosystem 12 \x0c\xef\x83\x98 User Behavior\xe2\x80\x99s Big Data With the popularity of smartphones and the enrichment of APP formats the number of applications installed on mobile devices has increased dramatically In the process of using mobile phones and these apps every day users generate a lot of data online and offline However the Internet should be a sharing equal and transparent society Because of the unbalanced development in the early stage the data resources are over centralized in Internet giants Users\ data is repeatedly sold back and forth but they have no voice Blockchains are bound to change that The Whole Network will belong to everyone through future data links whether it is behavior data or all kinds of travel data and social data generated by each user and this entirely self controlled right will provide a very valuable trust resource for the whole world Because this data reflects users\ interests and needs with the users\xe2\x80\x99 authorization it can be thoroughly explored and reasonably utilized and users can get the blockchain token reward With the large data of user behavior user\ s behavior can be predicted in advance which helps to refine operation and life cycle management With more intelligent hardware joining the Whole Network node it will have more user behavior data which will further provide more for manufacturers of various hardware industries with user data analysis What the Whole Network should do is not only to enable user behavior to be shared on the network with the users\xe2\x80\x99 permission but also to clearly define its ownership and to enable users to get behavior value reward through the contribution of behavior data This is the Whole Network through the blockchain technology and user behavior data with the important mission of integration 3 2 End terminal Layer \xef\x83\x98 Acute Angle Hardware Series The Whole Network will be further expanded and upgraded by linking more Acute Angle smart hardware as nodes so that all users can access it through the Acute Angle series hardware and use Internet of Things devices such as trusted sensors to read key data and record them on the blockchain Users can use the Acute Angle series hardware to create ecological value and obtain behavior value token rewards The Whole Network enables developers and users to form a direct peer to peer relationship through the token economy so that they can more closely be linked and users become a stakeholder of value sharing and win win development and make the Acute Angle hardware series become the terminal entrance for ordinary users to achieve value behavior 13 \x0cFigure 7 Node Series \xe2\x80\x93 Blockchain Mobile Phone Series Products The first hardware product of the Acute Angle hardware series is the Node series mobile phone The Node mobile phone will be the first mobile phone series launched in the Whole Network as the first mobile hardware carrier of the Whole Network relying on the bottom technological layer of the blockchain to integrate multi functions and a new generation of independent application store Node Store Node ID Node PS Blockchain Wallet etc are the new generation of user identity certificates With the help of blockchain smart contracts they can link up with various applications perfectly to achieve the transformation empowerment and transaction of user behavior value They are the users\xe2\x80\x99 hardware gateway into the blockchain world 3 3 Application Layer \xef\x83\x98 Node Store The Node Store is a versatile mobile app store that combines the blockchain industry APP/DAPP to create a green safe and vibrant blockchain ecosystem application cluster that solves the problem of not finding blockchain application download channels It aims to solve the problem that users cannot download high quality applications in one stop shop \xe2\x80\x93 it uses technology integration so that all users can quickly find safe green and high quality applications in the Node Store with download and one click installation and use 14 \x0cFigure 8 \xe2\x80\x93 Node Store Application Interface \xef\x83\x98 Node Wallet Node Wallet is a decentralized wallet APP that supports all currencies It realizes multi chain one stop digital asset management Users can enjoy safe efficient and convenient blockchain asset services In addition when users activate other APP trading functions they can directly carry out Node Wallet\ s Payment Wake up to achieve extremely fast and convenient digital asset transactions Users activate the Node mobile phones for the first time They will pay by waking up the Node Wallet to activate the reward acquisition function of the Node Store At the same time in the Node mobile phone wake up payment system through blockchain recording and reward every user\ s application download behavior will bring real time incentive for users and will be able to communicate in real time Guaranteed incentive is transferred to the user\ s blockchain wallet for transaction and use which not only brings users convenient experience of using traditional Internet products but also guarantees users a safer decentralized blockchain asset storage and transaction through the Node Wallet Node Wallet+ U key The U key built in encryption chip of the mobile phone is safe and reliable enabling users to stay away from the hacking virus and solve the problem of insufficient mobile payment security thereby creating a healthy and safe payment environment for users 15 \x0c4 Whole Network Consensus In the Whole Network each hardware is a node each node will have more than 51% of the rights and interests generated by the behavior data contributed to the Whole Network The consensus is based on the new working mechanism of Value Internet which proves that it will really solve the problem of transformation empowerment and transaction of user behavior value in the new blockchain network By recording the user\ s behavior on the chain the link between human behavior in the real world and value transformation in the virtual world can be achieved 4 1 NODE Rules and regulations The Whole Network will initially issue a NODE in the Ethereum chain and will build the lower layer of the public chain of the future ecosystem NODE will be a community wide incentive token and support the coordinated development of a variety of incentive mechanisms NODE is like the fuel of the ecosystem It promotes the operation of the ecological engine through the \xe2\x80\x9cburning of fuel\xe2\x80\x9d the operation of the ecosystem is kept stable NODE will be generated by user behavior and contributions to the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s construction mainly through the use of the Node mobile phones to obtain NODE token rewards Firstly users get the Node phone\xe2\x80\x99s unique Node ID by burning a certain amount of NODE in the Node Store which formally activates the behavior reward system and gives the Node mobile phones access to the NODE function This is one of the main behavior incentives of Whole Network use is value secondly users communicate with each other Developers\ incentives and airdrops will also be awarded for downloading applications viewing ads and sharing content in the Node Store This is the second incentive for the Whole Network\ s behavioral value operation is value With the participation of more developers NODE will be continuously exchanged in the Whole Network Advertising marketing promotion and other expenses will be shared with the Whole Network users by means of token incentives At the same time more developers and users will join and NODE will gradually reflect the value of circulation Each time the NODE combustion mechanism is carried out the total amount of 10 000 000 000 NODEs will be consumed as fuel to form a closed loop flow for the production use and consumption of NODE NODE is a non renewable resource of the Whole Network not unlike coal petroleum and other fossil fuels become a scarce means through continuous combustion and consumption In addition every NODE holder can enjoy the Whole Network development incentives At the same time with the reduction of a fixed amount of NODE and total 16 \x0cdeflation the value of NODE will also continuously increase continuously For this reason the Whole Network will be kept stable and ensure that the computational mechanism is carried out in an orderly manner The total circulation of NODE is 10 000 000 000 pieces of which the proportion of the mining pool is 65% According to the rigorous market research and calculation mechanism NODE is a proven economic model with market scale and significant application value Each token corresponds to the equivalent value of the services provided at the time of issue NODE Distribution Mechanism Role % Mining Pool 65% Private Investment 15% Foundation 5% Details Using Node mobile phones and subsequent mobile terminal hardware of users in the market up to 6 5 billion NODEs will be awarded It is used to introduce early investors to contribute to team building and operation It will be unlocked by period from the NODE token has been officially launched in the Whole Network For the Whole Network technology development ecological construction incentives community operations marketing and ecological improvement The use of this part of the funds requires a resolution by the Foundation and needs to be publicly announced in advance Ecosystem development fund 5% For incubation of high quality projects in ecology Team 5% Used to motivate the founding team unlocked by period after the NODE token is officially launched in the Whole Network Early Genesis Blocks 5% It is used to introduce early start up institutions or individuals to help promote the project 4 2 Reward Mechanism Figure 9 \xe2\x80\x93 The schematic diagram of NODE ecological incentive mechanism 17 \x0c\xef\x83\x98 Node Store token rewards Users get behavior rewards usage rewards airdrops and other forms and low threshold through downloading the APP inviting new users watching advertisements generated in the Node Store which forms the ecological closed loop of flow incentives Node Store rewards users with the token for the promotion of the APP and the cost of advertising investment By using the developer\ s application to bring active and effective user traffic to the developer the Whole Network burns continuously through the combustion mechanism 4 2 1 Node On the Whole Network each node will receive behavioral incentives and rewards based on \xe2\x80\x9cbehavioral power\xe2\x80\x9d The user activates the Node series mobile phone which becomes the node running in the Whole Network and brings certain behavior value incentives to the user through the user\ s usage behavior 4 2 2 Super Node The node can also perform NODE combustion consumption further enhance the \xe2\x80\x9cbehavioral power\xe2\x80\x9d and upgrade to \xe2\x80\x9csuper node\xe2\x80\x9d and enjoy more network wide development incentives including super node computing system incentives advertising system operation incentives and ecological fission incentives When the number of users in the Whole Network is increasing NODE will continue to burn and consume with the increase of the node\ s \xe2\x80\x9cbehavioral power\xe2\x80\x9d so it will gradually reduce the total circulation of the NODE market thus achieving a stable deflation appreciation Each node the Whole Network behavioral contributor will also receive more value benefits 18 \x0c5 Technological Infrastructure Figure 10 Whole Network Technology Architecture Based on Internet of Things 5 1 Whole Network Chain Whole Network Chain aims to build a standardized bottom layer account that can carry all the Internet behavior data to transfer from the traditional mode of value economy from the Internet of Things (IoT) industry 4 0 and de trust WN Chain is a revolutionary new transaction settlement and data transfer layer designed for the Internet of Things (IoT) Whole Network Chain can overcome the inefficiency of existing blockchain design achieve higher transaction throughput and does not charge transaction fees On the Whole Network Chain each terminal represents a node with the continuous development of the Whole Network there will be more and more Acute Angle series terminal hardware access the whole system will become more secure and faster the confirmation time will be shortened and the transaction will be completed quicker Whole Network Chain \ s vision is to become the first public chain of the Internet of Things to carry the value of user\ s behavior As the bottom layer public chain technology of Whole Network\ s blockchain the Whole Network Chain will link up in real time all the information of user\ s behavior value in the world with Node ID so as to have a safer decentralization mechanism a higher frequency TPS and faster transaction speed to help users open the behavior data link and behavior incentive mechanism and achieve information exchange value interconnection trust exchange between all developers and users around the world Whole Network Chain will be the technical support of the Whole Network blockchain layer in the future It will be a decentralized public blockchain of the Internet of Things platform which can help traditional smart hardware enterprises to get on the chain fast 19 \x0cwith a simple operation fast safe issuance of tokens smart contracts and blockchain system Whole Network Chain is committed to building a blockchain network system with global information exchange value interconnection and trust exchange Whole Network Chain provides secure and accessible digital accounts for all participants in the Whole Network performs smart contracts and completes payments Whole Network Chain is the cornerstone of decentralized services The Whole Network will be maintained by tens of thousands of terminal nodes in the chain All nodes can automatically store and process user information on the premise of decentralization and reach consensus on the consistency of processing results 5 2 Terminal Calculation With the rapid increase of mobile hardware terminal devices in the Whole Network and when the data stock generated by devices reaches the level of Zettabyte the rapid increase in the load of network broadband transmission from network edge devices to cloud data centers results in a long network delay Simple cloud computing is no longer enough to match the real time calculation of such large amounts of data Through the Whole Network\ s end to end computing the basic data needs not be transferred to the centralized cloud server and can solve the basic data analysis in the terminal of the smart hardware \xe2\x80\x93 it is more suitable for real time data analysis and efficient and secure smart processing The construction of the Whole Network Computing Service is a great innovation from centralization to distributed node network Smart hardware terminal computing can be real time large data processing with the following characteristics \xef\x83\x98 Distributed and Low Delay Computing \xef\x83\x98 Screening the data of the terminal equipment does not need every original data to be transmitted to the cloud making full use of the spare resources of the equipment filtering and analyzing at the edge nodes saving energy and time \xef\x83\x98 Reduce the pressure of data explosion and network traffic and process some simple data through edge nodes in cloud transmission which can reduce device response time and data traffic from device to cloud \xef\x83\x98 More intelligent for the future of the Internet of Things AR or VR scenarios as well as large data and artificial intelligence industries there is a strong demand for nearfield computing End to end computing guarantees that a large amount of computing needs can be done in the area close to the terminal to complete the calculation and to complete the demanding low latency service response End to end computing can provide smart interconnection services nearby to meet the key needs of the industry in the process of digital transformation From smartphones to wearable devices from medical care to automobiles and industrial manufacturing end to 20 \x0cend computing is playing an industry legend after another its foothold is to give terminals a smarter existence 5 3 5G 5G technology breaks up the scene from the above In the case of being very scattered it is not determined by centralization but by the nodes of each other are determined and distributed on the blockchain and the smart contract is completed The Whole Network + 5G will be able to realize the carriage change of information transmission (decentralization smart contract automatic confirmation point to point transmission encryption algorithm + high speed low latency low power consumption full coverage) The progression of geometric data increases The blockchain distributes the rights through 5G ) 5G technology can bring wider coverage to the Internet of Things a more stable licensed frequency band and a more unified standard The development of networking and blockchain provides a strong support The specific characteristics that can be combined are as follows \xef\x83\x98 Point to point network Whole Network adopts a P2P (Peer to Peer) network architecture In 5G technology device to device communication is also used The combination of the two can provide a good solution for equipment cooperation in the Internet of Things \xef\x83\x98 Low delay At the same time the high data transmission rate brought by 5G technology together with the new generation of network architecture can make the Whole Network terminal devices achieve high response speed and expand the application scope of Internet of Things technology \xef\x83\x98 Safety The Whole Network blockchain technology and 5G technology make it possible to communicate between devices The Internet of Things can form a network system that does not need a central server This can reduce the impact of DDOS and other attacks and make the whole system more robust and secure \xef\x83\x98 Low delay Vehicle networking driverless industrial control and other technologies require very high delay reduction while 5G network delay can be reduced by an order of magnitude compared with 4G which can provide solid technical support for the above areas \xef\x83\x98 Distributed Network 5G technology allows devices to communicate with other devices to form a D2D (Device to Device) network The Whole Network blockchain technology also provides a solution for distributed networks The application of 5G technology and blockchain technology in the field of vehicle networking will make it possible for equipment collaboration in these distributed networks 21 \x0c\xef\x83\x98 Transparency of information In the Whole Network if the devices are in the same main chain all or part of the information can be shared on the main chain according to the privileges so as to reduce the lag such as bullwhip effect in the field of supply chain \xef\x83\x98 Traceability of information Blockchain technology has the characteristic of inability to be tampered with Under the increasingly complex network structure of the Whole Network all instructions actions and other information between network nodes will retain archived vouchers which is conducive to resolving disputes and resuming events when needed 6 Whole Network Vision The Whole Network as the first blockchain + mobile hardware value network in the world is also the first decentralized industry wide application network It uses a high degree of community autonomy model to enable global developers and users to truly realize the value flow of global Internet application ecology and the return of user behavior value Advertising system based on smart contracts and a token economy model can help developers get rid of middlemen and implement more effective advertising delivery analysis and screening based on APP data and community rating can more effectively combat malicious software reduce users\ risk and help high quality applications obtain users more efficiently The world\ s token economy because of its appreciation expectation and incentive effect can help the development of the Whole Network ecosystem break through the bottleneck The Whole Network\ s token incentive mechanism not only brings a large number of users to the resident APP/DAPP but also brings new value sharing mechanism and community gathering place for users The Whole Network will build a consensus co creation and win win behavioral value network With NODE as a token incentive through the support of end computing 5G blockchains and other technologies the rapid deployment of global distributed node equipment will be achieved and the global consensus of behavioral value will be promoted jointly by the Whole Network The Whole Network will promote the comprehensive landing of Behavioral Value Network The Whole Network will be the cornerstone to improve the distributed node network that conforms to the characteristics of Behavioral Value Network and share with all participants the huge business value created in the future Whether in the past or in the future ten or more years the network will bring more and more rich experiences to mankind The network will be more valuable more efficient and more convenient to cooperate with human development and progress The Whole Network is made up of an idea of fairness and trust for which we want to achieve and 22 \x0cdefend Let user data and behavior based on the new value return user allocation mechanism give users and developers a new behavior value network Revised Records August 13 2019 Whole Network Whole Web White Paper v 1 0 23 \x0c
