growing IT market consumer data and information is the competitive power of the corporation However the problems in the rights and interests of the consumer who provide the information still needs to be resolved In the age where consumer information is used to produce value the consumer must have the right to provide and refuse providing data and this is reflected on the global policy basis and trend seen in Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights (CPBR) or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union (EU) If the rights to provide consumer information and data is with the consumer the advertisement profits and economic gains that result from the usage of consumer information should also be fairly distributed to the consumers Ad OS recognizes that consumer by existence can receive incentives as a productive individual and aims to support consumer economy via \xe2\x80\x98micro reward transactions\xe2\x80\x99 which has been overlooked in the past Ad OS Ecosystem seeks to help all entities in the advertisement market in addition to consumers For advertisement clients accurate and effective targeting will be provided with transparent advertisement fee calculation For advertisement agencies fair evaluation and business expansion for creativity and effort will be provided 2 Problem The most important player in the advertisement market today is the \xe2\x80\x98consumer\xe2\x80\x99 who provides their own information and data However out of the hundreds of trillions in KRW that compose the world advertisement market the consumer receives almost nothing in return In the past large transaction fees or delivery fees etc have cost more than the actual value of the rewards which made micro rewards restricted Advertisers want more consumer information for more accurate and effective targeting but consumers have been reluctant to provide personal information and risk of massive data leak accidents have grown insecurities Various advertisement media and technologies were developed through technological advancement but advertisement scams and means have developed as well increasing losses for advertisement clients 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 5 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 As a result trust between consumer advertisement media advertisement agencies and advertisement clients have not been properly formed and the losses and respective interests have been distributed disproportionately 3 Solution Moving data on a network along with economical value is cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic and advantage on the blockchain system With this method it provides a possible solution to the \xe2\x80\x98micro reward transaction\xe2\x80\x99 problem that made it difficult or impossible for it to exist in the advertisement market If appropriate incentives for the value of personal information were given along with secure sharing of personal information will form trust With a trusting relationship the consumer will be willing to provide their information and participate in business activities Through Ad OS consumers will be able to receive an interface where they can see how much economic value their information and activity has and how it is used and compensated Through this interface the consumers can become their own managing entities for the usage and compensation of their information and activities Advertisement clients can use the business platform to make advertisements based on authorized consumer information and pay advertisement fees for the advertisements they have run Also they will be able to review consumer participation and incentive payment details Blockchain only keeps essential calculation records or legal agreements that are needed for advertisement relationships which enables it to address problems in speed cost private information protection that come up in early implementation stages of development 4 Ecosystem Ad OS Ecosystem consists of the Main App Earning Apps Business Platform and cryptocurrency AmonD (AMON) The Main App will be developed to provide and environment to store use and exchange AmonD received as advertisement compensation received by the users and become a personal processor to manage user information The Earning App stands for the various applications that participating users use for advertisement campaigns This is not only limited to the advertisement market but can include playing games using contents completing special missions to receive rewards in a variety of creative apps The API and SDK needed to create the apps in a community or partnerships will be provided Business platform will provide necessary advertisement fee calculating functions that advertisement agencies require to create/register advertisement 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 6 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 campaigns and review reports on performance or incentive payments on the registered advertisements Ultimately it will develop into a platform that connects data on user devices with anonymous statistical information without needing private consumer information to protect consumer data and increase target advertising efficiency at the same time AmonD (AMON) is the cryptocurrency that ties together advertisement compensation and storage of participation value and also serves as the evidence of advertisement campaign activity and consumer participation 5 Token Economy Ad OS was born from the business model development that can dynamically connect increasing sales in real economy with token value The 4 core functions composing the token economy is as follows 1) The first compensation method that consumer earns \xe2\x80\x98Point\xe2\x80\x99 2) Cryptocurrency that can be exchanged with Points \xe2\x80\x98AmonD (AMON)\xe2\x80\x99 3) Cash sales that flow in through advertisement sales creating \xe2\x80\x98Fiat\xe2\x80\x99 with liquidity 4) \xe2\x80\x98Altcoins\xe2\x80\x99 that become the accessory to cryptocurrency sales and liquidity Each function operates closely with each other and contributes to the development of token economy AmonD Usages 1) \xe2\x80\x98Means of transaction\xe2\x80\x99 as a cryptocurrency 2) \xe2\x80\x98Means of event\xe2\x80\x99 that provides benefits with users 3) \xe2\x80\x98Means of payment\xe2\x80\x99 within the app 4) \xe2\x80\x98Means of exchange\xe2\x80\x99 with purchases from Altcoins The most important role and activity of Ad OS Foundation is to expand the utility value of AmonD at each step and save the fiat currency and Altcoins gained through advertisement sales for liquidity to sustain the project 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 7 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 1 0 Background 1 1 Evolution of Advertisement/Commerce Market and Its Challenges Advertisement and commerce are the representative market in the IT industry Until now it was generally known that consumers received information through advertisement and use commerce to purchase goods or services but because of technological developments the border between advertisement and commerce is crumbling and are being molded into one In 2018 the size of the world advertisement market was 670 trillion KRW and the size of electronic transaction market was at 2 86 Quadrillion KRW The connection and union of these two markets indicate an economic big bang that goes beyond imagination Many businesses are focusing on investments in research and M&As to realize this goal Especially after the rise of Amazon as the number 1 electronic transaction company in the US have grown into a social problem resulting in sales drops in offline stores and a series of store closings However the advertisement sales from businesses with large advertisement media platforms such as Google of Facebook have been growing and reaching new peaks every year On the other hand the rapid growth in the advertisement and commerce market have problems that cannot be ignored and Ad OS was born to solve these problems First as market size grows and technology develops businesses were able to enjoy more profits through advertisements but consumer benefits are at a standstill If personal consumer information is enough to create economic value in this age these profits must be fairly divided Second businesses require more consumer data that is accurate for effective advertisement and commerce However these demands also grow the risk of data leaks burdened on the company Hence advertisement technologies that safely protect consumer privacy is in demand 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 8 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 Third despite advanced digital marketing technologies advertisement clients suffer 23 trillion KRW in losses in advertisement scams (false accounts usage of bot programs) alone Therefore they require a method that can calculate advertisements accurately to target customers and a means to prove consumer participation 1 2 Private Information Protection and Data Rights In the 4th industrial revolution data is changing from supporting products and services to holding its own economic value Also data affects the growth of the company while serving at the catalyst for development in various industries creating new value in data economy in all industries As the socio economic value of data increases the idea of national/personal \xe2\x80\x98Data Sovereignty\xe2\x80\x99 is rising all over the world As the rights in data became more aware the US EU and other nations have adopted policies to strengthen data rights to protect domestic consumer and business data and increase data usage These events have resulted in strengthening national data rights increasing data nationalization policies For example violating the GDPR in the EU is penalized with 4% of all domestic and international sales or 20 million Euros (approx 26 1 billion KRW) whichever sum is higher Other general violations result in 2% of all domestic and international sales or 10 million Euros (approx 13 billion KRW) whichever sum is higher As GDPR was enacted to reinforce personal data protection obligations and levy heavy fines upon violation many businesses who were unprepared for these consequences had to close their sites or terminate services to EU citizens or change policies to provide services after obtaining consent of personal information usage This is not limited to the EU but is shown in the general direction of the world as nations strive to obtain data rights As the times change to support personal information protection and data the individual gained the right to decide data utilization and management as a provider of data Hence the methods where the individual actively participates in the collection/supply/utilization process to exercise rights as the central agent in data provided to 3rd parties As data rights have been reinforced new data utilizations and profit return methods need to be discussed and socially agreeable methods need to be debated Also voluntary participation from individuals in data collection/supply/utilization process need to be induced to solve social problems and create mutual profit The usage of personal information should be followed with fair profit distribution to allow individuals to exercise personal rights induce economic participation in the economic ecosystem 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 9 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 2 0 Problem 2 1 Paradox of Targeting and Privacy Businesses collect data on user type location relationship with other users usage time etc on their customers as they use business services to increase advertisement marketing effectiveness However businesses made a structure that made consumers impossible to use the service if they refuse to provide personal information and users are burdened with the insecurity that follows allowing businesses to use their personal information in any manner of ways As data creates more and more added value the \xe2\x80\x98revenue model that utilizes big data built from consumer information\xe2\x80\x99 was widely provided As a result the IT industry created vast amounts of profit from advertisement However in this process the collected data was illegally distributed or leaked in large amounts in frequent violations of user privacy In essence the precise targeting based on user data grew the possibility of privacy violation 2 2 Paradox in Industrial Development and Consumer Utility Most forms of SNS and online platform companies have collected and utilized consumer information to create added value in their profit model successfully and consequently developed into a certified business model Businesses were able to use personal data to create more profit but the consumer received almost no rewards and often become the victims of personal information leaks This problem challenges the justification of this business model Now the consumer is the agent in content creation in the IT industry ecosystem and a revolutionary restructuring that fairly divides the created added value based on user activity to reward those who contribute most to the growth of platforms is needed 2 3 Paradox in Technological Development and Advertisement Scams From the growth of online advertisement market and developments in advertisement technology advertisement methods that can deliver advertisement contents to specific target categories have been developed Businesses that use these advertisement methods use business performance to measure and compare advertisement effectiveness before choosing the better advertisement agency which speeds up the technological development 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 10 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 On the other hand as the active areas and added value of advertisement increases fake user accounts have been made to create ineffective advertisement fees for advertisers or AD scams that fake advertisement performance in traffic or exposure have increased as well Fake bot users made from software or numerous terminals have been utilized to obtain multiple rewards in other scamming methods Increasing transparency and effectiveness of advertisements through effective advertisement verification became a necessity The precious capital that is invested in advertisement requires verification processes to ensure that the advertisement paid for is accurately delivered to intended targets 3 0 Solution 3 1 Data Rights to the Consumer In the age where customer service is created with data it is important to let consumers know how their information is collected and utilized to eliminate uncertain information usage or misuse Also the value of personal information needs to be appraised to provide proper incentives If a trusting relationship can be built from the safe sharing of private information the user will be willing to share personal information and participate in business activities The Data New Deal policy incorporates consumers as a party in the data age and allows users to manage the supply/utilization of data more closely Users can confirm which data is being collected and provide or refuse information based on their discretion This premise is the US Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights (CBPR) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) In the light of these changes and policies the \xe2\x80\x98strategy to collect as much as data as possible\xe2\x80\x99 becomes impossible and even if these strategies are forced the security maintenance legal penalties and compensation upon data leaks increases dramatically Based on the Data New Deal target marketing methods that launch personalized advertisements to consumers after collecting and analyzing consumer information also changed as well Existing target marketing used consumers\xe2\x80\x99 overall consent for advertisement media or agencies to collect various data from them However as consumer obtains more data rights all data is owned by the provider of data (consumer) Therefore in the Data New Deal age it will be important for target marketing strategies to form a trust relationship with the consumer in addition to clients by sharing utilization process in a transparent manner This will be the core competitive power in the Data New Deal age To perform target marketing based on data the fact that the data has economic value must be shared with users beforehand and obtain consent on record and a medium that saves all of the usage will be needed 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 11 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 * Data New Deal Policy Data New Deal refers to the data \xe2\x80\x98reset\xe2\x80\x99 policy that completely restructures everything from scratch much like the New Deal economic policy in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s in the US The idea was put forward by Alex \xe2\x80\x98Sandy\xe2\x80\x99 Pentland a professor at MIT The idea is focused on giving individuals the means to control their private information to prevent businesses or other individuals from misusing the information 3 2 Micro Rewards and Consumer Economy Revolution Operating system plays the role of managing the overall computer system It controls hardware and manage computer resources aiding the executing of computer user programs and playing the intermediary role between the user and hardware Similarly Ad OS plays a role in helping consumers get economic compensation for providing data while aiding with overall management By providing the interface for users to use data economically and manage how their data will be utilized and compensated Ad OS will help users become the real agent in managing their data resources Advertisement clients can use Ad OS business platforms to create/register advertisement campaigns and utilize anonymous statistical information from target users to run its advertisements the users they want The advertisement will run for real time users and incentive rewards for participating users will be the compensation and proof of participation helping solve the problem of AD frauds Hence the advertisement fee that is not given to user as incentives will be returned to advertisement clients or not requested at all To materialize this type of advertisement system frequent data movement between users and advertisement clients and fee calculations is necessary These differences will differ dramatically from the operating methods in the existing advertisement industry Ad OS will use blockchain to provide user data to advertisement clients securely to build a trust relationship while utilizing cryptocurrency to give micro rewards for provided data With these principles Ad OS will serve as the intermediary between users and advertisement clients and give consumers the opportunity to participate in business activities for economic wealth since their potential consumption can be used to create profit 3 3 Proof of Trust Between Relationships Blockchain Cryptocurrencies that are created through blockchain technology has the large advantage of moving economic worth along with the movement of data on a network This advantage on the blockchain can materialize a different value through Ad OS By receiving incentives through Ad OS the proof that the advertisement has reached the consumer can be obtained Hence the micro reward transactions on Ad OS holds the value of advertisement performance and reward records at the same time and these results are available to both users and advertisement clients in a transparent ecosystem preventing artificial interference or falsified performance The implementation of blockchain technology has the potential to solve technological/cost problems with speed and fees Moreover the recorded information on the 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 12 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 blockchain cannot be deleted which made this technology the choice for Ad OS to record anonymous data untampered in order to build relationship between users and advertisement clients Specifically incentive rewards and calculation records must be proven true on the blockchain and the data will be managed and recorded on the chain However the time and cost required in blockchain transaction process must be minimized by supporting a design that records the minimum required amount on chain and managing user data agreements or advertisement client data usage records off chain 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 13 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 4 0 Ecosystem As the advertisement operating system that gives data rights back to the consumer Ad OS will provide an advertisement operating platform that allows specific target marketing for businesses using statistical information between saved personal information on user devices and intermediary servers without the need to collect private information or directly handling information Users can receive incentives in the form of Points on the Earning Apps These points can be swapped for AmonD (AMON) on the Main App where the user can directly manage the data saved on the user device On the other hand advertisement clients can use the Ad OS business platform to review anonymous statistical information required for target selection create/register advertisement campaigns advertisement results and fee calculation 4 1 Main App The Main App of Ad OS is the official wallet that manages user incentives and cryptocurrency assets as well as the personal data processor that manages the saved data on the device Main App will be able to exchange Points that the consumer can earn after viewing ads for AmonD (AMON) It will also have cryptocurrency wallet functions that can check Point and Token balance accumulation and exchange history as well as sending and receiving Tokens Moreover it will provide the environment for users to download contents and Earning Apps to earn Points with expansion capabilities to grow into a user community In summary the Main App will provide a step by step interface to allow users to directly manage data stored on the device as well as the data on Ad OS Ecosystem This white paper does not restrict the development of the Ad OS ecosystem as it has the potential to be a personal data processor with wide range of capabilities 4 2 Earning Apps The theoretical basis of the Earning Apps is that the mining incentive methods that use computing power is harmful to the environment and is gives an economic disadvantage as the parties with more capital at their disposal can have the computing power necessary to mine cryptocurrency As a response Ad OS gives incentives based on equal time and effort while allowing many of the internet masses that have never experienced blockchain and cryptocurrency to easily enter the Ad OS ecosystem 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 14 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 Earning Apps is the method that enables users to receive Points as incentives and all types of software that advertisement clients use to run their advertisement campaigns This includes applications run on devices websites on web browsers offline communications equipment beacons and other various forms of embedded software on devices to exchange data and signals Ad OS will provide API and SDK in order for development partners to create Earning Apps easily and participate in the ecosystem This will secure the openness and growth of the platform and allow the creation of various creative methods users can participate in to receive advertisement rewards 4 3 Business Platform In order for Ad OS to develop into a sustainable advertisement operating platform an environment that allows advertisement clients to create/register advertisement campaigns freely is necessary However this function will be incorporated in the late stages of Ad OS development and will not be specified in this white paper On the other hand the initial business platform will require functions for advertisement fee calculation such as advertisement performance report and incentive payment history for the advertisement clients The trust created from this base will have a significant effect in the development of the ecosystem When the initial user base and advertisement client numbers have grown to a certain amount and the data quality and quantity reach a meaningful size in the advertisement market an environment that supports advertisement target settings and respective advertisement fee policies will be required to grow advertisement client inflow dramatically In this process Ad OS will provide advertisement clients with anonymous statistic information and user device data to maximize personal information privacy and advertisement effectiveness for advertisement clients The development of business platform is considered one of the later stages in the Ad OS project In the initial stages the business platform will include manual/ semi automatic technologies and will require management from the Ad OS team 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 15 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 5 0 Token Economy 5 1 Composition The 4 main factors that compose the Ad OS token economy are \xe2\x80\x98Points AmonD (AMON) for which the points are exchanged for fiat currency coming from advertisement and platform sales for liquidity and Altcoins Each of these factors have unique characteristics and functions that rely on each other and contribute to the growth of Ad OS ecosystem and token economy 5 1 1 Point Point is the initial compensation method to reward users for their participation in advertisement campaigns or completing missions In order for users and advertisement clients to directly recognize the amount of compensation a basic currency unit of the service area 1 Point = 1 Won (KRW South Korea) It is not a guarantee of payment or any other form of collateral Points can be used to on the Main App to be exchanged for tokens based on the market price The reason for not providing compensation directly in AmonD and using points to exchange with AmonD is as follows 1) Due to the price fluctuations of AmonD the user requires a standard to recognize the fixed value of their activity 2) The rewards earned by the user are typically small and accumulated frequently and using these small transactions on the blockchain will result in excessive fees and time 3) Consideration for flexible service security and expansion in the long run 5 1 2 AmonD(AMON) AmonD is the utility token issued by Ad OS represented as AMON in exchange market AmonD can be exchanged for Points accumulated by the user or purchased through the cryptocurrency exchange The usage of AmonD is as follows 1) A participation method to earn rewards and compensation 2) Payment method for various apps provided by Ad OS 3) Exchange method for purchasing other Altcoins 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 16 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 Following the aspiration of one token for all the total issuance amount for AmonD will be limited to the current world population at 7 6 Billion Under no circumstances will any more additional tokens be issued For token holder rights and response to inflation the tokens provided to users will only be supplied with marketing event and will not be given for free with the exception of marketing purposes 5 1 3 Fiat Fiat is the cash sales that Ad OS will receive from advertisement clients which is liquidity Ad OS will keep fiat currency above a certain amount to allow necessary liquidity supply capabilities for when users wish to exchange tokens for fiat currency without having to rely solely on the cryptocurrency exchange However the balance amount and other specifics will not be specified in this white paper and will be announced after policy decisions Fiat can be used to protect AmonD value and token holder rights from sudden market value changes or unforeseen circumstances The holding a certain amount of cash assets can be a hedge against this pressing situation 5 1 4 Altcoins Altcoins is the crypto currency sales that can be received through advertisement clients that are Altcoin developers in the form of advertisement fees or through token swaps which serve as a substitute for liquidity Users can obtain purchase/investment opportunities for these Altcoins through the Main App The payment method will be AmonD The exchange structure between AmonD and other Altcoins will have the following implications 1) Widens the application area of the Altcoins which is a shared problem in the blockchain ecosystem (each Altcoin can be used as a payment method to advertise its own project) 2) Ad OS will discover intriguing Altcoin developers to participate in the Ad OS ecosystem 3) Increase usage value and demand of AmonD 4) Reduce the AmonD supply in the market by exchanging for other Altcoins and the foundation can increase AmonD reserves 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 17 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 5 2 Token Demand Demand for AmonD is the most important factor for token economy The principles that create token demand in the Ad OS ecosystem from users advertisement clients partners and foundation is as follows 5 2 1 User Benefits proportional to the amount of AmonD will be given to the user When purchasing or exchange with Altcoins held by Ad OS AmonD is the payment method AmonD can be used as a form of currency for specific services 5 2 2 Advertisement Client Can charge AmonD for payments regarding platform usage fee or advertisement fee Clients can purchase a large amount of AmonD above a certain amount to replace platform usage fee or advertisement fee with participate in Ad OS Ecosystem 5 2 3 Partner Ad OS business partner can have the opportunity to participate in the ecosystem by purchasing and staking a certain amount of AmonD for the development of the ecosystem and token holder community Earning App partners must effort to avoid sharing sale revenues or increase shares in revenue with Ad OS 5 2 4 Ad OS Foundation Ad OS can purchase AmonD to secure deposit of AmonD to supply its uses If liquidity is needed in the market Ad OS can purchase its own AmonD after policy agreements if necessary If the revenues occurring from services need to be divided with a partner the AmonD can be purchased by the foundation to pay dividends The main activity and mission of the Ad OS Foundation is to continuously develop maintain and expand the token demand However each method will be achieved step by step and parts of these methods might not be achieved or have no effect 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 18 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 5 3 User Incentive The user is the main supporter of the token economy in the Ad OS Ecosystem Hence it is important to continuously introduce new users steadily to the ecosystem use services and participate in advertisement campaigns Participation incentives will be created in the following manner 5 3 1 Experience Of all the online users around the world the proportion of the online users that have used or owned cryptocurrency is only 1% (about 3 2 million) (Source statista Number of Blockchain wallet users worldwide from 1st quarter 2015 to 4th quarter 2018) It does not mean that the other 99% do not care about cryptocurrency Many want to participate but difficult usage method financial burden fragmented services etc have prevented them from the experience Ad OS team aims to provide UX/UI and user friendly free opportunities to increase wide participation in cryptocurrency 5 3 2 Viewing Simple advertisement viewing is the lowest micro incentive in the form of rewards but it can be used by anonymous users who do not need authorized personal information or by users who are using the service for the first time to participate in the ecosystem Out of the various advertisement inventories existing in the market the low priced advertisements for unspecified masses is prevalent and this will help the platform in the early stages and the advertisement business 5 3 3 Participating in Advertisement through Personal Authentication Businesses want more specific and material consumer participation Advertisement campaigns commonly require an individual\xe2\x80\x99s gender age residential area and user verifications in personal authentication This offers a higher level of compensation compared to simple advertisement aimed to unspecified masses which increases the incentive for user efforts If users complete missions to satisfy advertisement campaign participation requirements with personal authentication for a higher compensation they will be able to add to ecosystem activity and productivity 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 19 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 5 3 4 Target Advertisement through Certified Personal Authentication If users trust Ad OS they will be more willing to actively participate in the Ad OS ecosystem for more plentiful compensation and rewards At this point HPL (Human Presence Level) will be introduced to allow users to specifically identify themselves for higher compensation and business targeting For users to increase HPL the user must provide more detailed information At this stage it is not advisable for users to simply answer questions or provide additional personal information This is because it is difficult to prove the information given and there is a risk of falsifying information As a countermeasure authorization methods that check existing data on the device along with analysis cooperative data and authorization sensors will be used to check for information legitimacy and utilization for advertisements or campaigns HPL can be considered as a form of mining power that users have At each stage targeting and compensation levels can be increased gradually ANONYMOUS ONLINE USER VERIFIED ONLINE USER IDENTIFIED USER FINANCIALLY IDENTIFIED USER 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 20 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 5 4 Member Participation Advertisement clients advertisement agencies app developers Altcoin developers and other business partners serve an important role in solving problems and obstacles in the existing advertisement market with support from the Ad OS foundation The benefits they provide to the Ad OS user and community are also equally important It is important to have continuous inflow and participation from business partners Ad OS will continuously create and propose new value and benefits to provide to partners and design he business system for the business partners to benefit from each other within the Ad OS ecosystem Instead of replacing the middle man Ad OS aims to support a platform where anyone can be a middle man and where middle man can also use the platform 5 4 1 Advertisement Client and Advertisement Agency Until now providing small micro advertisement compensation to consumers was difficult due to large transaction fees and access to personal financial account information To provide gifts as advertisement compensation personal information such as consumer address was necessary and excessive shipping fees also played as barriers These barriers put a restriction on advertisement agency creativity as well as restricting the search for methods to provide better advertisement compensation to increase advertisement effectiveness Through Ad OS the numerous micro reward transaction can be accomplished with low cost giving way to various and creative advertisement campaigns Also users who trust in the platform can provide more detailed information which leads to more precise target advertisement This ultimately leads to increases in advertisement performance which will result in continuous Ad OS ecosystem participation from advertisement clients 5 4 2 Business Partner (App Developer) Numerous app developers who do not have an inherent profit model offer their services for free while collecting advertisement fees that users watch as the main source of income As users use the app the accumulating points become meaningless as the user terminates service use and this limitation results in low user loyalty frequent breakaway and shortened service lifespan which contributed to losses for the app developer Ad OS seeks to add value to the valuable time and effort invested by app services that are discarded by using AmonD to exchange these points Through this method the users can use the service longer with loyalty while app developers can maintain a long term relationship with users to help grow their business 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved 21 \x0cWhitepaper v1 0 In addition API/SDK will be provided to simplify development for normal apps to sync with cryptocurrency This will allow apps to be developed without professional knowledge in blockchain development This will allow various creative services to participate in the Ad OS ecosystem However until these synergy effects are widely known the Ad OS Foundation will directly provide the Earning Apps in the initial stages 5 4 3 Business Partner (Altcoin Developer) Numerous Altcoin developers initiate various events such as air drops to spread awareness of their coin and secure coin holders This was also limited to targeting very few out of the 1% cryptocurrency users Due to repeated advertisement reduction/halting announcement from various advertisement media such as Google Facebook etc made developers lack the media to advertise their projects Because it is difficult to secure usage for Altcoins it is difficult to secure initial coin holders and users Also there is a lack of environment where coin circulation and pricing system can exist before growing in the cryptocurrency exchange market Ad OS supports a platform that is not determined by centralized advertising intermediary but from user decision and opinions to help Altcoin publicity and supply Altcoin developers can pay for their advertisement fee in their own coin Furthermore Altcoin Warehouse business model will be developed to fill the empty space in the Altcoin circulation market and support coin holder growth before opening in the cryptocurrency market for developer and user profit 2019 \xc2\xa9 ADOS FOUNDATION LTD All Rights Reserved
