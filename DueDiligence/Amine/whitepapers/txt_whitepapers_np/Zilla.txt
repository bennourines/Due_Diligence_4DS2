Here https //youtu be/QBNPC8ZNmUs Abstract The ZILLA founders share the common vision to create an ICO purchasing platform ZILLA will act as a gateway for Crypto enthusiasts to easily and safely participate in various vetted ICOs while also allowing companies to do an ICO more effectively ICO crowdsales are becoming more commonplace With more than 1500 ongoing ICOs and counting it is becoming overwhelming for buyers to keep track compare and verify various ICOs Moreover the ever growing complexity of the ICO environment for new would be crypto enthusiasts is both astounding and paralyzing No simple consumer Copyright 2017 @ [ZLA PTE LTD] PR@ZLA IO 2 \x0cfriendly and intuitive platform exists that enables participants to conveniently grasp and compare competing ICOs In addition there is no central authority or institution (by design) that is a reference point for new crypto enthusiasts The discovery of new ICOs remains a challenge Before the decision is made to participate in an ICO potential participants must painstakingly learn about how proposed projects will work investigate the backgrounds and qualifications of the team behind the projects and understand exactly what they are purchasing The risk of scams and fake crowdsales undermine the credibility of the sector and the process of completing KYC requirements for multiple projects is time consuming These issues reduce the amount of attention each ICO gets and as the number of ICOs increases maximizing exposure for quality ICOs becomes more important ZILLA makes this entire process simpler by providing a unified marketplace for ICO crowdsales In the same way platforms like Etrade and Ant Financial made the stock market more accessible to the general public or Alibaba and Amazon make it easy to buy products online ZILLA brings ICO token crowdsales to regular users in the form of one simple app Users are presented with a comprehensive list of properly vetted ICO projects together with all the information needed to make an informed decision about which projects to participate in Once a decision has been made users can participate in their chosen project with a single click ZILLA will also be the first multi lingual app ICO platform that will allow individuals from Japan Korea China as well as English speaking countries to participate and view ICO information in their own language We identified

glance which projects are the most popular amongst other users All users must register to use this feature so votes can not easily be manipulated This feature is quite similar to Reddit\xe2\x80\x99s

available Copyright 2017 @ [ZLA PTE LTD] PR@ZLA IO 7 \x0cToken issuer experience As more ICO projects become available the more difficult it will become for quality projects to attract people who are interested in participating in crowd sales Marketing user outreach and the production of informative yet attractive materials describing the project takes time and resources when developers should be focused on advancing their projects ZILLA makes it easy for token issuers to list and explain their projects to potential crowdsale participants Owners of a project can upload a description of their project biographies and qualifications for all team members business plans existing VC funders advisors and other funding details users may need to make an informed decision about which projects to participate in All of this information is localized and translated to allow ICOs to more effectively reach and attract a global audience More importantly ZILLA handles all KYC collection and verification and provides this information automatically to token issuers who require it for jurisdictional compliance Standard usage fees Token issuers who launch an ICO crowdsale on ZILLA will be charged 2% of funds raised as a fee for using the platform Users who purchase ICO tokens will be charged a 1% fee for using the platform All ICO purchase fees are waived for ZLA token holders while fees pertaining to the ICO crowdsale on the ZILLA platform may be reduced for ZLA token holders (see ZLA Token General Discount Plan) Copyright 2017 @ [ZLA PTE LTD] PR@ZLA IO 8 \x0cCompetitive

information of a plethora of crypto markets Copyright 2017 @ [ZLA PTE LTD] PR@ZLA IO 9 \x0cThe ZLA Token Crowdsale What is a Token Crowdsale A Token Crowdsale has emerged into a widely known and highly respected way to raise funds in order to advance a new commercial venture In this event a new cryptocurrency venture exchanges a portion of its cryptocurrency tokens to early users and supports in exchange for funding The Token Crowdsale will take place on our website and you can find further and updated information on our official website at ZLA IO Why do a Token Crowdsale ZILLA has already prototyped the ZILLA platform and has gathered an expert team consisting of an experienced CEO developers bankers and advisors from the legal compliance and VC world However fully implementing the ZILLA payment platform and building an iOS and Android ZILLA app will require substantial funding and a bigger team ZILLA chose to conduct a Token Crowdsale to further understand the token issuer experience and gather the crypto community around a novel platform for future Token Sales ZILLA participants can then also use their purchased tokens for the future use of the platform and save on the token sale fees ZLA Token Platform Discount Plan During the ZILLA Token Crowdsale ZLA tokens will be issued and swapped Once the ZILLA platform is launched ZLA tokens can be used by ICO participants and ICO issuers alike to reduce the fees required to use the ZILLA platform All users of the platform can simply hold ZLA tokens in their portfolio to receive the discounted fees For ICO token issuers each ZLA token held earns a 100 USD discount on fees up to 50% of the total fees charged (i e 1% of the total amount raised in the ICO) For example an ICO project that raises 10 million USD and holds 500 ZLA tokens would reduce their 200 000 USD fee by 50 000 USD If they hold 2 000 or more ZLA tokens their fee would be reduced to 100 000 USD ICO token issuers who wish to make use of the discount offered by ZLA tokens must commit the amount of ZLA tokens they wish to use before starting their crowdsale and those tokens are locked in for the duration of the sale If the crowdsale is collecting funds in a currency other than USD (e g bitcoin or ethereum) the discount awarded per Copyright 2017 @ [ZLA PTE LTD] PR@ZLA IO 10 \x0cZLA token is calculated based on the USD exchange rate on the day the crowdsale starts For ICO participants each ZLA token held earns a 100 USD discount on fees up to 100% of the fees charged by ZILLA For example a user spending 20 000 USD on tokens would normally pay 200 USD in fees but if they hold 2 ZLA tokens they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay any fee A user spending only 2 000 USD on tokens could hold 0 2 tokens to eliminate their 20 USD fee or 0 1 tokens to reduce their fee to 10 USD For ICO participants when purchasing ICO tokens users simply need to hold ZLA tokens in their portfolio to receive the fee discount The tokens are not locked and can be traded any time At any time ZILLA can choose to increase but not decrease the value of the discount awarded to ZLA token holders Airdrops to users ICO teams that list their project on ZILLA will do regular airdrops to our users in order to draw attention to their project The ICO can segment which users to send the airdrop to (such as VERIFIED users premium ZILLA BLACK users etc) and when users receive the airdrop they get a pop up stating who the airdrop is from they then jump to the ICO project page to receive the airdrop in their wallet \xe2\x80\xbb Minimum airdrop is 10 000 USD split by the targeted users \xe2\x80\xbb \xe2\x80\xbb All airdrops are done using ZLA token ZILLA BLACK ZILLA BLACK is the premium version of ZILLA and has 3 main features 1 We provide an indicator next to the title of projects that are projected to have the best performance based on data that we collect through user upvote/downvote and in app behavior combined with machine learning 2 ZILLA BLACK users will be able to get into pre ICOs at just 1 ETH (Typically preICOs have a minimum buy in of up to 100 000 USD) 3 You will receive more token airdrops than regular ZILLA members \xe2\x80\xbb ZILLA BLACK will be 1 ETH / month however all participants in our pre sale will receive it for free forever Copyright 2017 @ [ZLA PTE LTD] PR@ZLA IO 11 \x0cSub Token For those of you who hold our ZLA token we ve got a surprise for you We are creating another token called the GD token There will only be 5 000 000 GD tokens ever If you hold all of the ZLA tokens that you get during our crowdsale for 3 months we will send you 2 GD tokens Once you receive this token in your wallet the ZILLA app will activate a *VERIFIED badge next to your name You are free to trade both GD tokens on an exchange however you must hold at least 1 GD token in order to keep your VERIFIED status GD tokens acquired on an exchange will not give you VERIFIED status The only way to get VERIFIED status is to hold ZLA tokens untouched for 3 months Your VERIFIED badge will level up every 3 months Think of the VERIFIED badge like the Twitter or Instagram verified status \xe2\x80\xbb VERIFIED status will allow you to receive the most amount of token airdrops on ZILLA since people who hold that status are the most coveted type of ICO participant Allocation and Price A total of 60MM ZLA tokens will be issued and 33MM (55%) ZLA will be made available to the public during the ZILLA token crowdsale at the exchange rate of 1 500 ZLA/ETH 24MM ZLA (40%) will be allocated to the ZILLA company and team 3MM

the conclusion of the token crowdsale ZILLA will sell the remaining tokens on the ZILLA smartphone app without having to visit an exchange for 10 USD each but the sale\xe2\x80\x99s price may be

cryptocurrency its underlying blockchain technology and Token Crowdsales are necessary building blocks to our digitized economy It democratizes access to capital and provides greater liquidity to the masses It enables progress and economic development However one crucial part of the cryptocurrency economy are ICOs They are currently not accessible to the majority of the population It is cumbersome to participate in them and poorly managed entities as well as outright scams are undermining the entire sector There is no central authority (by design) that provides any safety or legitimacy ZILLA aims to make the Token Crowdsale economy more accessible and crowd vetted The ZILLA platform will only list pre vetted projects and will enable less technological savvy users to participate in the token economy Buying tokens should be as easy as shopping online and our one push token purchase system will democratize the access to a new class of assets You can now be part of the next generation platform for ICOs and support ZILLA in providing more safety and accessibility to the Token economy We are inviting you to embark on our exciting journey to rocket the token economy to the next generation Copyright 2017 @ [ZLA PTE LTD] PR@ZLA IO 19 \x0c
