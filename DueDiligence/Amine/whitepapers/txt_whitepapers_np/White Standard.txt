Technology 20 Security 21 \x0cOur Vision We believe in a world driven by trust The White Company is building the first environment with all the advantages of blockchain technology independent of the volatility of cryptocurrency Our company is focused on being an advocate for generating greater trust for the crypto community at large Our mission is to be a \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Knight\xe2\x80\x9d to actively educate while also promoting and offering greater transparency exchange transfer and liquidity within this space The White Company aims to create a stabilized and democratized crypto economy for consumers and merchants alike Our Story Elizabeth White and a core team of specialists in luxury goods and financial technology started The White Company in 2017 The initial mission was to provide the opportunity for clients holding cryptocurrency wealth to purchase real items The focus was delivering luxury goods and curated experienced with privacy Combining our experience knowledge and connections the team at The White Company brought together the world of fine art jewelry luxury automobiles and more As the business grew it became evident to the team that there was a tremendous need for asset management and payment facilitation in cryptocurrency There was a void left by the industry and The White Company was determined to fill it Cryptocurrency allows rapid efficient and inexpensive payments compared to traditional methods The glaring problem is its lack of adoption due to the high degree of volatility A cryptocurrency that is truly stable based on a commonly used currency like the US dollar was necessary This would serve as the \x0cfoundation of a new cryptocurrency environment that could finally realize promises set forth by the invention of blockchain As a result The White Company in Q2 2018 has launched White Standard cryptocurrency that is backed directly by US dollar deposits It is audited daily to ensure a new standard of transparency and trust Below is a feature of our website that shows our daily balance The White Standard is built on the state of the art Stellar network providing unparalleled speed efficiency and security In parallel The White Company has developed the White Wallet system It combines all the decentralization advantages of cryptocurrency with technology that allows nearly instant and free payments to anyone anywhere The White Wallet system will also integrate White Capital\xe2\x80\x99s Asset Management business It will allow crypto clients to invest directly through tokenized funds into top professional investment manager funds Our extensive network of luxury brands merchants and main street retailers are eager to participate in the cryptocurrency revolution The White Company is developing the White Pay merchant processing system This will enable anyone with a White Wallet to make simple payments online or in person to White Pay enabled merchants White Pay delivers the speed and convenience of debit and credit transactions with much less expense \x0cThe White Currency Platform The White Company provides a full cryptocurrency economy offering needed services that have been unavailable We currently operate a profitable Asset Management business We enable our clients to effectively enter and exit the cryptocurrency economy and convert crypto holdings into luxury items Features \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Quick no wait client verification Full customer service A Luxury Concierge Marketplace where clients can purchase unique items and experiences directly with their cryptocurrency holdings Ability to handle large ($1 million+) purchases and sales of cryptocurrency Facilitation of trades through OTC and Dark Pools enabling large trades at fixed prices without affecting the market We have developed and launched the White Standard a stablecoin that is fully backed by the US dollar It is verified daily and independently audited White Standard offers all the benefits of cryptocurrency\ s speed efficiency and security without the inherent volatility of all other cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Zero fees to purchase White Standard with Fiat Zero fees and simple exchange of White Standard to and from BTC ETH and XLM Guaranteed redemption of WSD to Fiat for anyone at any time We have built the complete payment system White Wallet It combines the advantages of decentralized blockchain with integrated payment processing White Wallet allows users to pay anyone anywhere with zero fees \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Zero fees to send and receive White Standard on the White Wallet system between users Ability to move WSD balances to decentralized unrestricted wallets at any time We will complete the integrated payment platform by adding the White Pay merchant processing system into White Wallet This will allow us to onboard merchants ranging from luxury to traditional retail Users of White Wallet will be able to pay for their luxury and daily purchases quickly without converting to fiat White Pay is the alternative to traditional and cumbersome financial transactions \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Zero fees and zero chargebacks driving quick merchant adoption across all sectors We will develop and integrate White Company Capital an asset management platform which allows clients to invest in the world\xe2\x80\x99s top performing money managers The funds range from venture capital to equities options futures bonds and of course cryptocurrencies The platform allows any manager after a thorough vetting of their strategy and track record to tokenize their fund into a liquid easily tradeable and manageable Investment Token \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Investment Tokens representing the world\xe2\x80\x99s top managers across a wide variety of strategy and asset types No management or incentive fees allowing investors to benefit fully from the performance of the funds Turnkey solution for fund managers allowing them to easily tokenize their strategies in a simple and fully compliant manner Fund managers will have previously untapped access to large sources of capital Tax advantages for US investors enabling indefinite deferral of taxes White Standard The Problem \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 There is no trustworthy stablecoin in the market that is third party audited and fully transparent The cryptocurrency markets need a simple \xe2\x80\x9ccash\xe2\x80\x9d alternative for investors to transact in and out of other crypto holdings The core promise of fast payments with cryptocurrency is not realized due to performance issues in the early blockchains and the inherent volatility of all major cryptocurrencies The Competition The main competitor claiming to offer a coin that is 1 1 backed by the US dollar Tether does not provide current audited information Tether has been suspected of not maintaining funds on deposit to back Tether Tokens and is under investigation by authorities according to two Bloomberg \x0cstories [See (May 24 2018) https //www bloomberg com/news/articles/2018 05 24/bitfinex saidto find bank in puerto rico after wells fargo exit] Another competitor TrueUSD has limited use because it merely allows token< >$USD (not currently available to public) or trading through exchanges True$USD is built on the Ethereum network which is limited to 7 transactions per second It has been shown to slow down and clog up significantly during high usage including ERC 20 token launches or popular DAPPS like CryptoKitties Due to the slow transaction speed True$USD can never serve as the basis for a payment system or any use besides being an alternative to Tether on exchanges Moreover ERC 20 has had a number of identified bugs such as the recent \xe2\x80\x9cBatch Overlflow\xe2\x80\x9d bug which caused a number of tokens to stop trading completely To compound the problem it is effectively impossible to rework the code to eliminate such bugs Lastly since launching in mid March it has issued 44 million tokens yet has not posted a single report or audit of its $USD deposits Solution White Standard \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Transparency White Standard will publish certified daily reports of the $USD balance on deposit and our third party administrator will verify and audit a monthly report Simplicity White Standard stablecoin is built on the Stellar Token standard (running on the Stellar network) The code is open source and can be readily audited and verified by the public to confirm it\xe2\x80\x99s secure fast and robust Stability Each White Standard stablecoin is equal to $1 USD and can be purchased or redeemed at any time Creation or deletion of White Standard will reflect the $USD balance on deposit Security White Standard is built on the Stellar Network Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain providing proof and accountability for all WSD users Flexibility The WSD stablecoin is instantly portable to any Stellar compatible decentralized wallet and tradeable on any exchange that supports Stellar tokens This includes the free native Stellar DEX (Decentralized Exchange) giving users true control over their money Efficiency The Stellar network is highly efficient with minimal fees Transactions settle in as little as 3 seconds (as compared to minutes or hours with ERC 20 Tokens) ensuring that users of WSD benefit from nearly instant settlement and smaller fees that are fractions of a penny \x0cStable Coin Features White Standard Tether TrueUSD Circle USD Basecoin and other \xe2\x80\x98artificial\xe2\x80\x99 stablecoins 100% backed by $USD deposits Parity doesn\ t require artificial manipulation Daily publishing of $USD deposit balances Third party audited Guaranteed redemptions MultiSig issuing process secured by third party Customer Value Driver Simple exchange of $USD< >WSD Ethereum (ETH)< >WS Bitcoin (BTC)< >WSD Stellar (XLM)< >WSD allowing crypto holders to have a stable $USD backed \xe2\x80\x9ccash\xe2\x80\x9d option that offers all the benefits of decentralized cryptocurrency Revenue Model To incentivize purchasing of White Standard there are no fees to purchase WSD with fiat \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Redeem White Standard to Fiat 0 10% of the Fiat Amount $USD balances held in deposit will earn interest at competitive market rates from our partner banks White Wallet Problem Typical Cryptocurrency Wallets and Exchanges have multiple issues \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Limits on transaction amounts Impossible or severely limited purchase of deposit or withdrawal with fiat Slow transaction speeds for cryptocurrency deposits/withdrawals often taking hours Hi fees for buy sell withdrawal and deposit along with poor exchange rates \x0cCompetition The White Wallet\xe2\x80\x99s competition include a variety of typical wallets and exchanges such as \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Coinbase Binance Bittrex Solution White Wallet \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2

Phase 2 White Wallet Mobile App with NFC integration to enable White Pay tap payments (see White Pay section) Revenue Model To incentivize the use of White Standard there are no fees to send or receive payments on the White Wallet network to another user (C2C) or to make a payment to a business that accepts White Pay (C2B) \xe2\x80\xa2 Exchange WSD< >ETH WSD< >BTC WSD< >XLM with no fee but includes a spread White Pay Problem \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Traditional Merchant Processing has high fees for merchants and long settlement periods Most merchants are not accepting crypto Merchants accepting crypto on their own are vulnerable to volatility risk \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Traditional Merchant Processors Networks (Visa MC Amex) have no options for cryptocurrency Lack of \xe2\x80\x9cTap\xe2\x80\x9d (NFC) payment solutions for real world retail applications Current cryptocurrency merchant processing has severe limits for both customers and merchants and very limited customer service Competition Currently Bitpay is the only cryptocurrency merchant services competitor with a $500 per month initial limit for new merchants To raise this limit requires significant effort and documentation by the merchant Approval appears to be arbitrary similar to withdrawal limits on exchanges The limitation of Bitpay is intentional It would be difficult for them to liquidate large volumes of cryptocurrency on the open market when they already have fixed an exchange rate for the merchant thus effectively taking on 100% of the currency volatility risk VISA MC Amex and other consumer facing pay card products do not accept crypto and are unlikely to do so This move would require them to set up fiat to crypto conversion and hold large amounts of cryptocurrency or enter the crypto trading market Typical merchant processing networks (First Data Square etc ) have high fees and settlements that take over a day They do not accept crypto payments and subject merchants to significant chargeback risks due to limited security and fraud Online merchant networks such as PayPal do not accept cryptocurrency and while they claim \xe2\x80\x9cinstant\xe2\x80\x9d transfers they are very limited in payment volume or withdrawal volume often holding payments for as long as 20 days Solution White Pay \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 No charge back risks to merchants Instant settlement and funds availability in WSD 0% fee to merchants Revenue Model The White Pay solution is integrated directly into White Wallet in Phase I and with a mobile device of the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s choosing (iPhone iPad Android) in Phase II for NFC payments As a result it is completely free to drive adoption and use of the White Standard The end goal would be to create a very large deposit balance of White Standard generating interest or generate revenue from those merchants who do wish to redeem WSD into $USD at 0 10% \x0cWhite Company Capital Problem Investors in cryptocurrency are relying primarily on the growth of their tokens through speculation Because of the high number of cryptocurrency options investors can be overwhelmed and traditional opportunities are little known to the average crypto investor Investors with large and small crypto holdings should be looking to diversify by accessing a broader variety of opportunities These include traditional equities futures options bonds convertible debt and other strategies which have much lower correlation to the cryptocurrency market There are substantial roadblocks For example crypto investors must cash out their holdings and then independently find traditional investment opportunities for their capital This involves high minimums to invest high fees and very low liquidity due to long lockup periods For many crypto investors their money is stuck in cryptocurrency On the other side the managers running successful non cryptocurrency strategies may be unfamiliar with blockchain or do not possess the technology and experience necessary to properly tokenize their strategy Many of these managers operate under Reg D 506b exemptions which do not allow general solicitation They have restricted options for marketing and trouble accessing outside capital in an efficient way Managers often rely on third party marketing firms who eat into revenue with large retainers and commissions Managers operating under Reg D 506c have a limited capital pool because while they are allowed general solicitation they can only accept accredited investors Even under a Reg S offering which allows unlimited number of non accredited foreign investors it becomes impractical to manage and administer a sizeable number of shareholders Solution White Company Capital Within the White Currency Platform White Company Capital will allow cryptocurrency asset holders to invest easily and efficiently in a number of tokenized funds These funds known as Investment Tokens will represent multiple asset classes managed by top asset managers They will be in the White Wallet under an \xe2\x80\x9cInvest\xe2\x80\x9d section to complement the WSD \xe2\x80\x9cCash\xe2\x80\x9d balance section The Investment Tokens will represent strategies ranging from actively managed cryptocurrency trading to traditional equities futures and options This will give investors multiple advantages Benefits \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Gives investors access to professional money managers with proven track records Diversification away from cryptocurrency to uncorrelated strategies that can profit even if the crypto market is falling \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Allows investors to fully benefit from the performance of the strategies without paying any management or incentive fees Opens up the strategies to investors who can\xe2\x80\x99t or don\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet the typical Limited Partner investment minimums for investing directly with those managers Access for Non US investors who typically have difficulty investing in US based assets due to capital controls and other restrictions or inefficiencies Ability to freely trade Investment Tokens on outside exchanges ensuring complete liquidity even when the managers\ strategies require long lockup periods Participation in the issuance of new Investment Tokens directly on the platform allowing early access and discounted pricing for initial investors Ability to redeem the Investment Tokens into cash (via White Standard) or other cryptocurrencies at any time All tokens will be built on the Stellar token standard benefiting from the network\xe2\x80\x99s speed efficiency and low cost This ensures that investors will have full control of the custody of their funds at all times unlike brokerage firms which are susceptible to failure and fraud The White Company has already secured interest from 12 top managers who see clear value and opportunity in accessing capital through a token offering The platform will offer a turnkey solution for managers integrating legal and compliance considerations directly within the Investment Token offering This allows managers to take advantage of the benefits of tokenizing their strategies while providing investors efficiency and liquidity unprecedented in the asset management industry The platform will implement the required compliance structure for each asset manager leveraging White Wallet\xe2\x80\x99s existing KYC/AML program This allows managers and their regulatory counsel to be fully comfortable that their tokens conform to the type of offering used for the issuance The White Company also brings together a top blockchain technology team who will create a customized token contract for each manager based their specific requirements Finally The White Company Capital team will also provide managers advice as to the tokenomics of each offering This helps ensure that their goals and token allocation/distribution plan properly align the managers\ incentives with investors\ returns As an added benefit to managers The White Company will actively promote through its extensive cryptocurrency community network each token issuance to maximize the amount of capital raised Customer Value Driver Access to top performing professionally managed investments A turnkey solution providing unparalleled access to new capital for professional money managers Revenue Model On The White Company Capital platform there are no fees to invest to buy or sell Investment Tokens \x0cWhite Company Capital will derive revenue from onboarding the Token Managers and providing a turnkey Investment Token solution Luxury Store Problem Current holders of cryptocurrency wish to benefit from their wealth by indulging in luxury goods and services and diversifying their holdings by investing in art automobiles and jewelry Converting cryptocurrency to fiat comes with involves high fees and lack of privacy There is a tremendous need to access the luxury market directly with cryptocurrency On the other hand traditional luxury purveyors such as Sotheby\xe2\x80\x99s Christie\xe2\x80\x99s and others do not have the capability or desire to accept cryptocurrency due to its high volatility Solution \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 The White Company\xe2\x80\x99s Luxury Goods Marketplace provides crypto holders the ability to spend their crypto holdings on tangible luxury without converting to fiat This is done by purchasing directly from The White Company\xe2\x80\x99s holdings or through its concierge service which can source specific client requests Exclusive access to limited edition rare and one of a kind items and experiences through the management team\xe2\x80\x99s relationships Prices based on a multi exchange average + spread The White Company\xe2\x80\x99s Luxury Sales business will also integrate with the White Pay Merchant Processing by allowing other luxury merchants to accept cryptocurrency The White Company is developing partnerships with Christie\xe2\x80\x99s and Sotheby\xe2\x80\x99s to provide back end crypto services for buyers and sellers This will expand the luxury goods universe to an even wider group of clients Customer Value Driver Providing holders of cryptocurrency with access to real world goods and services without converting to fiat Revenue Model Luxury good sales include a built in commission when the items are purchased directly from The White Company Luxury Marketplace which depend on the items (typically 10%) The White Company intends to develop strategic and profitable revenue models for its cryptocurrency backend services with luxury \x0cmerchants such as Christie\xe2\x80\x99s and Sotheby\xe2\x80\x99s which would expect to generate revenue of approximately 510% of the final sold price of their items Team Elizabeth White Founder & CEO Ms White

transaction fees and liquidity Stellar was initially based on the Ripple protocol Later significant changes were made to the consensus protocol (Stellar Consensus Protocol SCP) Stellar uses its consensus algorithms rather than mining resulting in much greater potential scalability SCP\xe2\x80\x99s key properties include \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralized control Low latency Flexible trust Asymptotic security We believe that reduced development friction is a key to the successful adoption of any new technology especially in the blockchain space Stellar leverages the current development best practices by utilizing a well constructed streamlined API for consumption of services through their Horizon API server This offers access to the full range of the stacks along with excellent open source SDKs One weakness of Ethereum is that all Smart Contract code is distributed in an immutable fashion to the entire network with all code getting executed on every node While this is nice as a philosophical argument it is impractical for large scale financial networks It is nearly impossible to release a smart contract based coin that is error free itself without a reasonable path to upgrading the code Stellar minimizes the code run on the chain and instead relies on outside services issuing signed transaction (including multisignature) They set dynamic permissions on the transfer of assets such as a time bound property used for escrow type scenarios The constraints set by these transactions protect the network and form the basis for smart contract like functionality They also allow the business logic of the network to live in standard enterprise grade SaaS solutions This separation of concerns allows for regular upgrading of secondary code without sacrificing the security of the blockchain Powering Stellar is the Third Evolution of blockchain technology which keeps the $400 billion $USD crypto asset ecosystem secure We are taking every precaution to ensure that it safely and predictably manages White Standard This \xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain 3 0\xe2\x80\x9d is far superior to the previous two iterations To appreciate the advantages of Stellar it is helpful to review the technological history of the technology Blockchain 1 0 is Bitcoin and its various forks It was a breakthrough in creating authority by consensus and thus enabling the transfer of value without a \x0ccentralized authority However Blockchain 1 0 was a very basic application and did not easily allow any other features or layers making it impractical for asset backed tokens The next step in the evolution Blockchain 2 0 began with the introduction of Ethereum Its breakthrough was the ability to execute smart contracts via the ERC 20 token standard This enabled the first assetbacked tokens to be envisioned The smart contract platform could be used to create features like time locked contracts for insiders It also offered capabilities that would allow ERC 20 tokens to comply with securities laws and other best practices necessary for assetbacked token issuance However the Ethereum technology was still limited by speed congestion and high fees At only 15 transactions per second it did not offer a reliable platform for assetbacked securities Based on real world needs of payment processing and securities trading could reach as many as 1 000 transaction per second The advent of Blockchain 3 0 via the Stellar protocol resolved all of the previous issues and added new functionality The Key Features of Stellar Are \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Reliable Network The $6 billion Stellar network is backed by industry leaders in the technology space including IBM Its robustness allows it to support up to 1 000 transactions per second Unparalleled speed Transactions on Stellar settle nearly instantly in as little as 3 seconds Inherent Flexibility Stellar has a built in decentralized exchange StellarPort which ensures tokens built on Stellar have maximum liquidity and are instantly tradeable without relying on being \xe2\x80\x9caccepted\xe2\x80\x9d by centralized exchanges Minimal Transaction Fees The stellar network is built around transaction fees that are minimal Currently $1 powers 300 000 transactions which make it ideal for assetbacked tokens to minimize trading and transfer expenses Security In order to understand the architecture of White Standard on Stellar let\xe2\x80\x99s first review some fundamentals of how Stellar accounts and transactions function \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Each account is assigned a public and a secret key Knowledge of the public key is sufficient to send funds to that account Provided the account trusts the asset (see below) a secret key is required for most other operations The secret key is only known to the account creator and needn\xe2\x80\x99t be persistent on the network Each account is assigned one or more signatories Initially the only signatory is the account creator however the creator (initially) has the ability to add more signatories to the account \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Stellar treats all tokens including WSD as assets In order for an account to receive funds denominated in a particular asset its signatories must explicitly assign a trust channel between the account and that asset The only exception is Stellar Lumen (XLM) Stellar\xe2\x80\x99s native currency which each account inherently trusts by default Each signatory is assigned a signature weight represented by a positive whole number Each possible operation falls into one of three security categories low medium or high Sending payments out of the account is considered a medium security operation Adding co signatories or changing the weight of a signature on the other hand is considered a high security operation Each account can associate a required cumulative signature weight to each operation category For instance if the account has 3 signatories each with the weight of 1 and the threshold of medium security operations is 2 and high security operations 3 then executing medium security operations would require 2 signatures and high security operations would require all 3 signatures Given the above upon account creation the account\xe2\x80\x99s creator (\xe2\x80\x9cmaster signature\xe2\x80\x9d) is assigned a default weight of 1 and all operation levels require a weight of 1 If the creator executes an operation that changes their own signature weight to 0 that operation is de facto irreversible In that situation the sum of the weights of all signatures (just a single one in this case) does not match the required weight to execute any operation and that includes changing the weight of their own signature or adding another signatory Thus the account is forever locked and payments cannot be sent out of it nor can the account ever be set up to trust another asset WSD\xe2\x80\x99s admin architecture will consist of two accounts owned by The White Company 1 Issuer This account will issue the original definition of White Standard into the Distributor Account (see below) Medium and high security operations in this account will require two signatures the owner\xe2\x80\x99s (The White Company) and a trusted partner\xe2\x80\x99s The trusted partner\xe2\x80\x99s secret key and their login into the system will never be received or seen by The White Company The Issuer account will only ever issue assets fully backed by $USD as verified by The White Company and the trusted partner Additionally Stellar allows issuer accounts to receive their own currency but it does not show that currency in the issuer\xe2\x80\x99s account balances Consequently WSD assets are redeemed and thus sent back to the issuer account will be effectively destroyed 2 Distributor This account will represent actual WSD assets backed by $USD in the bank When a member purchases WSD the purchase will originate from this account Similarly when a member sells WSD they will transfer their WSD to this account When the redemption is approved The White Company will move the WSD redeemed by the member from the Distributor account to the Issuer effectively \xe2\x80\x9cburning\xe2\x80\x9d them by taking them out of circulation Here is a summary of the permissions and abilities of the respective accounts once the infrastructure is set up Account Can send Can receive Signatures Can report WSD backed \x0cWSD WSD Issuer Yes (Mint) Yes Distributor Yes Yes required to send WSD TWC Trusted Partner TWC WSD balance No by $USD Yes Yes N/A There are four user roles defined in the system \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Minter The user who owns Issuer Account (TWC) Theirs will be one of the two signatures needed to send assets into Distributor account Mint Co Signer The trusted partner whose signature will also be required to send assets into Distributor account This will be a third party Administrator to ensure security trust and accountability Manager The owner of the Distributor account (TWC) empowered with sending $USDbacked WSD assets to member users and sending redeemed WSDs to the Issuer account to remove them from circulation Member Owner of an account that trusts holding WSD assets backed by $USD The overwhelming majority of users will have Member roles These accounts will be empowered to receive WSD assets as well as send WSD assets to other accounts that are configured to trust WSD Logins into the system will be protected by highest current Microsoft standards using OAuth2 and will optionally be protected by two factor authentication The secret keys for the Distributor and Issuer accounts and other sensitive information such as database connection strings will be stored in Azure Key Vault Azure provides highly secure cryptographic storage of sensitive information Co signer\xe2\x80\x99s secret key will be stored with the Co Signer in a place of his or her choosing This may be locally (thumb drive) in a trusted secure cloud escrow The web application will be hosted on Microsoft Azure
