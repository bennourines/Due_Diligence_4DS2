B u r k e \x0cInformation Technology and Human Civilization The development of human civilization is increasingly driven by information technology In Zero to One Peter Thiel suggests that the progress of human civilization and technology can take one of two forms horizontal or extensive progress and vertical or intensive progress The key words for vertical or \xe2\x80\x9c0 to 1\xe2\x80\x9d progress are technology and energy and the key words for horizontal or \xe2\x80\x9c1 to n\xe2\x80\x9d progress are distribution globalization and information technology It is possible to have both either or neither of these modes of progress at the same time 1815 to 1914 was a period of both rapid technological development and rapid globalization Telegraphy telephony and transatlantic cable have accelerated the \xef\xac\x82ow of information around the world Between the First World War and Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s trip to reopen relations with China in 1971 there was rapid technological development but not much globalization nor obvious change in the speed of information \xef\xac\x82ow Since 1971 we have seen limited technological development mostly con\xef\xac\x81ned to IT Today mobile internet provides people with easy access to information Since 1970 there has been no new progress in many scienti\xef\xac\x81c and technological areas \xe2\x80\x93 in the biomedical \xef\xac\x81eld for example the number of new drugs which receive investments of at least $1 billion has halved every nine years since 1950 Moreover in the \xef\xac\x81eld of energy technology i e the use of energy our overall technological level has not progressed much since the age of the steam engine and our overall use of energy remains at the level of boiling water to drive heat engines Our technology level stands in even sharper contrast to science \xef\xac\x81ction Science \xef\xac\x81ction writers often foresee the development path of civilization for example the science \xef\xac\x81ction works of Arthur C Clarke the founder of satellite communication technology are mostly based on science and many predictions in the novels have become reality Clarke s technical plans for satellite communications are strikingly consistent with actual developments and thus the geostationary satellite orbit was named the \xe2\x80\x9cClarke Orbit\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81rst work Space Overture was published in 1951 and described the \xef\xac\x81rst human moon landing It envisioned that the \xef\xac\x81rst orbital \xef\xac\x82ight would take place in 1970 and the \xef\xac\x81rst moon landing in 1978 In reality American astronaut Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in 1969 marking the \xef\xac\x81rst human moon landing and the \xef\xac\x81fth manned mission of the Apollo program The miracle was that reality transcended the wildest fantasy in the world However in 1968 Clark published 2001 A Space Odyssey describing an astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s journey to Iapetus aboard the spacecraft Discovery In reality we have not been to Iapetus in 2018 and even a return to the moon seems unlikely Since 1970 the development of our technology has stagnated As Peter Thiel said \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted \xef\xac\x82ying cars instead we got 140 characters \xe2\x80\x9d la m bda i m 01 \x0cFrom the contrast between the future predicted and expected by our predecessors and the real future i e the current reality we \xef\xac\x81nd that in all aspects reality falls behind our predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 expectations We have neither reached Mars nor realized mind uploading nor do we live in a virtual world and the results of our forays into arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence have also been disappointing much of the time Therefore we cannot help wondering Why is the development of human civilization inferior to the expectations of our predecessors To analyze this question we may further divide it into the following \xef\xac\x81ve 1 How can we de\xef\xac\x81ne the development speed of human civilization How can we de\xef\xac\x81ne the development acceleration of human civilization 2 How much slower is the development speed of our current civilization than the optimal one 3 What are the main factors that determine the development speed of human civilization 4 If the e\xef\xac\x83ciency of overall human collaboration is improved can civilization develop faster 5 Are blockchain and digital currency the most e\xef\xac\x80ective means of enhancing human collaboration We can solve and simulate the \xef\xac\x81rst two questions by using relevant evolution models the theory of adaptive topography and the NK model As it is impossible to deal with them exhaustively in the limited space available this white paper will focus on our exploration of the last three questions especially the last one De\xef\xac\x81nitions of civilization types In 1964 Soviet astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed a method of measuring a civilization s level called the Kardashev scale which was divided into three categories based on the amount of energy a civilization can use A Type I civilization can harness all the energy which reaches a planet For instance humans will reach Type I civilization when they can use all the solar energy that reaches the earth A Type II civilization can harness the total energy radiated by its own star mainly through facilities like the Dyson sphere A Type III civilization can control the energy of the entire galaxy for the Milky Way probably starting from harnessing the energy of a black hole at its center In 1973 the American astronomer Carl Sagan assessed that human civilization type at the time was 0 7 however the type was calculated to be 0 72 in 2016 The above is the assessment formula used by Carl Sagan l a m bda i m 02 \x0cEntropy and dissipation in the physical system Die Energie der Welt ist konstant die Entropie der Welt strebt einem Maximum zu Rudolf Clausius one of the founders of thermodynamics once said \xe2\x80\x9cDie Energie der Welt ist konstant die Entropie der Welt strebt einem Maximum zu \xe2\x80\x9d The sentence can be translated into English as follows Energy is conserved and entropy in the universe always increases and tends towards a maximum value According to the thermodynamic de\xef\xac\x81nition energy that we can control and use to do work is called free energy while uncontrollable energy turns into heat to be dissipated Entropy is a measure of how much energy we cannot control But Clausius noted that the second law of thermodynamics applies only to systems beyond life because life seems to be able to build order out of disorder Schr\xc3\xb6dinger therefore said that life depends on \xe2\x80\x9cnegative entropy\xe2\x80\x9d Forty two years after Ludwig Boltzmann\xe2\x80\x99s suicide Claude Shannon published an epoch making paper A Mathematical Theory of Communication which proposed the concept of information entropy to measure the uncertainty of information Today Shannon\xe2\x80\x99s legacy has had a profound impact on the information world we live in for example the theme of \xe2\x80\x9centropy\xe2\x80\x9d connects several issues in statistics physics life science information science and even economics Similarly blockchain technology is gradually becoming recognized by mainstream academia \xe2\x80\x93 for example professors like Qiu Chengtong Yao Qizhi and Zhang Shoucheng have talked about blockchain and the fairly marginal role it has played thus far on many occasions Blockchain is able to connect macro economics mathematics classical cryptography modern cryptography distributed theory computer networking databases storage and other \xef\xac\x81elds Therefore an increasing number of mainstream academics are beginning to study relevant technologies with many skills of hitherto limited practicality in the academic \xef\xac\x81eld of computer science \xef\xac\x81nally being put into use Therefore in Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s economic white paper we attempt to link together the collaboration consensus and economic incentives of the human community in the economic system through the concept of entropy combined with quantitative analysis and veri\xef\xac\x81cation Entropy and dissipation of human civilization\xef\xbc\x8dinformation theory The world is moving toward an era of an increasingly widening wealth gap The contradiction between economic globalization and political anti globalization which is increasing in intensity and the \xef\xac\x81nancial bubbles attached to the real economy have brought about a real economic crisis After the global failure of Keynesianism the GDP growth of China \xe2\x80\x93 the last high growth country \xe2\x80\x93 has gradually slowed down economists have failed to \xef\xac\x81nd a new economic growth model and the ever present threat of periodic global \xef\xac\x81nancial crises hangs in the air like the sword of Damocles Moreover the election di\xef\xac\x83culties of emerging democracies the split of the EU consensus the small countries and common people at the bottom of the world\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchies being enslaved by debt and the U S Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly ine\xef\xac\x80ective and risky regulation and control as well as its increasingly stringent liquidity management and supervision among other things have made the \xef\xac\x81nancial order more and more fragile and the risks are constantly accumulating In Asimov\xe2\x80\x99s Foundation series the \xe2\x80\x9cpsychohistory\xe2\x80\x9d developed by Hari Seldon successfully guided the Galactic Empire through the collapse crisis By taking into account individual human beings statistically psychohistory calculates and makes predictions about the development of human civilization as a whole in a manner similar to thermodynamics Today although we do not possess such a useful tool we can qualitatively describe the degree of disorder in human civilization and thereby improve it in some ways Since 2008 the sudden emergence of Bitcoin has showed many visionary people the potential of technology to change \xef\xac\x81nance Our research concludes that not only the \xef\xac\x81nancial industry but also many other \xef\xac\x81elds can improve their e\xef\xac\x83ciency based on the blockchain model At present the information technology industry is mankind\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced invention Here we try to de\xef\xac\x81ne the existing problems in the information \xef\xac\x81eld and discuss how to improve its e\xef\xac\x83ciency via blockchain l a m bda i m 03 \x0cThe Information Technology Industry Problems in the information technology industry \xe2\x80\x9cIt from Bit\xe2\x80\x9d everything is information In today\xe2\x80\x99s world informatization and digitalization are irreversible trends More and more businesses are moving from o\xef\xac\x84ine to online and the cloud including social networking e commerce games advertising taxi hailing bicycle sharing food delivery and live streaming Billions of people are living in a networked and intelligent society All digital businesses are built on information technology The underlying infrastructure of computers networks and storage as well as the upper level software of \xef\xac\x81le storage databases and middleware form the basis for the business operation of hundreds of millions of companies around the world These areas are collectively referred to as the information technology industry a huge market worth trillions of dollars Many market segments have seen the establishment of a large number of major companies such as Microsoft (now with a market value of $680 billion) in the operating system market which was valued at just $30 billion when the company was founded and Oracle (now with a market value of $203 1 billion) in the database management software market then valued at $20 billion However since 2000 companies in the enterprise software \xef\xac\x81eld have often run into bottlenecks and ceilings after reaching a certain scale Generally emerging American companies with a market value of around $2 billion will be merged or acquired and this is even more the case in China The root cause is that the distribution cost of the software industry is too expensive accounting for 100% or even more of an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s sales revenue which results in a clear trend toward centralization and intermediation in the industry From 1995 to 2016 the number of exits of American VC backed enterprise software (2B) projects (4600) outpaced that of consumer software (2C) projects (2600) The IPO market value of enterprise software was $825B much higher than the market value of consumer software ($582B) l a m bda i m 04 \x0cWe looked closely at the data and found that enterprise software (2B) reported more exits than consumer software mainly because of its widespread M&A exit Since 1995 rather than continue to grow independently about 70 companies valued at more than $2 billion have ended up being acquired by or merged into their competitors such as Microsoft and SAP which have been developing for 30 or even 50 years The reason is that they all hit an obvious ceiling on growth during their natural development in the United States Traditional competitors have huge advantages over them Firstly traditional enterprise software companies have strong cash \xef\xac\x82ow Secondly traditional enterprise software companies have a large number of existing customers thus reducing the marginal cost of software distribution Especially in 2018 a number of companies with growth potential were acquired For instance GitHub a representative of the open source community was acquired by Microsoft for $7 5 billion We believe that this will slow down the software industry and that the information industry which is dominated by a lot of older companies is no longer representative of technological progress Take Oracle as an example \xe2\x80\x93 its stand alone database products have been sold for 40 years l a m bda i m 05 \x0cThe business model of the information technology industry has become the main factor restricting innovation Renowned technologist James Mishra placed the scaling limits of businesses on two axes \xe2\x80\x93 product and distribution \xe2\x80\x93 and listed four categories of businesses accordingly The scalability of a business varies along the two axes Some businesses scale e\xef\xac\x80ortlessly on both sides while others require enormous human e\xef\xac\x80ort both to produce the product and then to distribute it The Four Categories of Businesses Category #1 Fixed Product Fixed Distribution Examples of such businesses are restaurants law \xef\xac\x81rms medical practices etc These companies can grow large for example Mayo Clinic the largest clinic in the United States but the problem lies in the fact that their growth is almost perfectly connected to hiring more employees to acquire and serve more customers Category #2 Scalable Product Fixed Distribution Traditional hi tech companies like Boeing Lockheed Martin Oracle and Salesforce are great examples Category #3 Fixed Product Scalable Distribution Most media even traditional newspapers fall into this category Category #4 Scalable Product Scalable Distribution Examples are Uber Wikipedia and China\xe2\x80\x99s TMT companies like DiDi and Toutiao What do the four types of businesses fundamentally de\xef\xac\x81ne The answer is the cost of growth l a m bda i m 06 \x0cBig ticket enterprise software is another example of a Category #1 business which can e\xef\xac\x80ortlessly scale on the product side but has more di\xef\xac\x83culty scaling with regard to distribution The process of software development is scalable but the process of selling products is essentially a linear model which expands with the growth of sales force just like the expansion model of restaurant chains with a central kitchen What are the percentages of R&D and sales in the cost of a technology company By analyzing S 1 documents from U S listed IPO enterprise service companies we found that these companies\xe2\x80\x99 annual sales and marketing expenses account for 80% of the total cost In addition there is also a so called Magic Number in the SaaS \xef\xac\x81eld in the United States \xe2\x80\x93 in other words the mainstream in the US SaaS \xef\xac\x81eld believes that the ratio of sales revenue and sales cost of a SaaS enterprise in one year should be equal to 1 We selected several well known SaaS enterprises\xe2\x80\x99 \xef\xac\x81nancial reports in the IPO year to observe their \xef\xac\x81nancial data As 2014 was a popular time for enterprise software companies to go public we chose to observe the data for this year ZENDESK Year End December 31 2009 2010 2011 Unaudited 2012 2013 In thousands except per share data Revenue 15598 38228 72045

operating expenses 17994 49123 69347 Operating expenses The sales and marketing expenses of Zendesk a global leading customer service SaaS company accounted for nearly 80% of its total cost in 2014 NEW RELIC Year End December 31 2009 2010 2011 Unaudited 2012 2013 In thousands except per share data Revenue 11663 29664 63174 Cost of revenue 1904 5078 10780 Gross prof it 9759 24586 52394 Research

expenses of New Relic a global leading software company accounted for nearly 80% of its total cost in 2014 Software is essentially a business \xef\xac\x81eld that is growing exponentially and the sales revenue of a software company is positively correlated with the scale of its sales force As a result an enterprise software company reaching a certain scale is more like a restaurant or a clinic than any other companies in the TMT \xef\xac\x81eld la m bda i m 07 \x0cDissipation of the information technology industry Blockchain brings network e\xef\xac\x80ect to the information technology industry and reduces dissipation Since 2012 the 11 fastest growing enterprise service companies in the world are all community based open source software companies So far there are more than 11 Open Adoption Software (OAS) companies valued at more than $1 billion and their average rate of growth is far beyond that of the last wave OAS companies take about three to four years on average to be valued at $1 billion At present most public blockchain projects only have one public blockchain such as Ethereum EOS and more recently Polkadot In addition infrastructure is provided on the periphery of the blockchain for example the provision of decentralized domain name resolution network disks and \xef\xac\x81les At this point the blockchain itself is the goal But that is not the case with our project or more precisely our project is more than that The concepts in our project go beyond current blockchain projects Our project is not only about technological innovation in the blockchain \xef\xac\x81eld but also a combination of technological innovation business model innovation and an economic system If economic models are not introduced into the Bitcoin system the consistency of distributed systems will never surpass the models of Raft Paxos and PBFT Therefore if we look at the implementation of distributed databases only from a technological perspective the problem of consistency will always be controversial We are not striving to be a database software company but instead to blaze a new path The starting point for our thinking is not the technological infrastructure of the blockchain but rather how to build a unicorn company with a valuation of more than $1 billion in China\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure software \xef\xac\x81eld A new community based model called Open Adoption Software (OAS) has been proposed which just as Bitcoin introduced economic systems into the distributed \xef\xac\x81eld has introduced a new term \xe2\x80\x93 the \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork e\xef\xac\x80ect\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 to the global software \xef\xac\x81eld la m bda i m 08 \x0cThrough this new model we hope to blaze a new trail in China\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure software \xef\xac\x81eld The community based model has changed the software development model The di\xef\xac\x80erences between traditional enterprise software and community open source software are as follows Traditional enterprise software products are developed by employees of a company while OAS code is devel oped on a community basis by community developers end users and ecosystem partners Traditional enterprise software code is closed while OAS code is open source Testing traditional enterprise software takes a long time while the OAS model provides free testing by all \xef\xac\x81rst line developers The revenues of traditional software companies mainly come from license or subscription fees while OAS companies charge service and training fees l a m bda i m 09 \x0cThe Data Industry Will Change Dramatically Over the Next Decade The amount of data generated by humans each year will be astronomical According to the report Data Age 2025 released by IDC global internet data has been growing at an annual rate of 50% since 2009 with the total global datasphere reaching 21 6 zettabytes by 2017 IDC forecasts that the global datasphere will have grown to 40 zettabytes by 2020 and to 163 zettabytes by 2025 What does this \xef\xac\x81gure mean As the world\xe2\x80\x99s population is expected to remain 7 billion in 2025 this will be equivalent to each person storing about 23 000 terabytes of data which would mean that each person would need to own 20 000 1TB hard disk drives (HDDs) since a normal personal computer HDD can currently store around 1 terabyte The evolution of data from business background to life critical Once siloed remote inaccessible and mostly underutilized data has become essential to our society and our individual lives In fact IDC estimates that by 2025 nearly 20% of the data in the global datasphere will be critical to our daily lives and nearly 10% of that will be hypercritical la m bda i m 10 \x0cEmbedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) As standalone analog devices give way to connected digital devices the latter will generate vast amounts of data that will in turn allow us the chance to re\xef\xac\x81ne and improve our systems and processes in previously unimagined ways Big Data and metadata (data about data) will eventually touch nearly every aspect of our lives \xe2\x80\x94 with profound consequences By 2025 an average connected person anywhere in the world will interact with connected devices nearly 4 800 times per day \xe2\x80\x94 basically one interaction every 18 seconds By 2025 embedded data will constitute nearly 20% of all data created \xe2\x80\x94 threequarters the size of productivity data and closing fast Productivity data comes from a set of traditional computing platforms such as PCs servers phones and tablets Embedded data on the other hand comes from a broad variety of device types including \xe2\x80\xa2 Security cameras \xe2\x80\xa2 Smart meters

time data Increasingly data will need to be instantly available whenever and wherever anyone needs it Industries around the world are undergoing \xe2\x80\x9cdigital transformation\xe2\x80\x9d motivated by these requirements By 2025 more than a quarter of data created in the global datasphere will be real time in nature and real time IoT data will make up more than 95% of this Cognitive/Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence (AI) systems that change the landscape The \xef\xac\x82ood of data enables a new set of technologies such as machine learning natural language processing and arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence \xe2\x80\x94 collectively known as cognitive systems \xe2\x80\x94 to turn data analysis from an uncommon and retrospective practice into a proactive driver of strategic decision and action Cognitive systems can greatly step up the frequency \xef\xac\x82exibility and immediacy of data analysis across a range of industries circumstances and applications IDC estimates that the amount of the global datasphere subject to data analysis will grow by a factor of 50 to 5 2ZB in 2025 the amount of analyzed data that is \xe2\x80\x9ctouched\xe2\x80\x9d by cognitive systems will grow by a factor of 100 to 1 4ZB in 2025 la m bda i m 11 \x0cSecurity as a critical foundation All this data from new sources open up new vulnerabilities to private and sensitive information There is a signi\xef\xac\x81cant gap between the amount of data being produced today that requires security and the amount of data that is actually being secured and this gap will widen \xe2\x80\x94 a reality of our data driven world By 2025 almost 90% of all data created in the global datasphere will require some level of security but less than half will be secur One Small Step for Lambda one Giant Leap for the Future Lambda is committed to solving the blockchain storage problem The blockchain system is essentially a distributed system based on peer to peer networks and a computer network system In the computer world the infrastructure at the bottom of any system includes computing network and storage resources Currently public blockchains are dedicated to providing computing power Some protocols aim to change TCP/IP to provide better network connectivity while Lambda is committed to providing storage infrastructure for blockchains As a fast safe and scalable blockchain infrastructure project that provides decentralized data storage capabilities with unlimited scalability Lambda has solved the data integrity problem that FileCoin and earlier projects failed to solve ensuring the integrity and retrievability of stored data through Proofs of Retrievability (POR) and Provable Data Possession (PDP) In addition by implementing Lambda FS and Lambda DB Lambda provides all decentralized applications with formatting and programmatic access to distributed stored data Design principles of Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s economic system The two core ideas of economics are that goods and resources are scarce and that society must use them e\xef\xac\x80ectively In fact it is precisely because of the scarcity of resources and people\xe2\x80\x99s desire for e\xef\xac\x83ciency that the blockchain economy has attracted people\xe2\x80\x99s attention In the Lambda system storage space is relatively abundant but storage that ensures security privacy availability and data integrity is a scarce resource Transaction between providers and demanders of such storage resources is what constitutes Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s economic system For Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s economic organization the three fundamental macro economic questions that need to be de\xef\xac\x81ned are What and how much of it is Lambda producing How does production take place For whom is Lambda producing What and how much of it is Lambda producing The Lambda organization produces decentralized storage space that guarantees security privacy availability and data integrity with the more expensive part also ensuring data retrievability At the current time the resources that can be traded within the Lambda system are storage space network bandwidth short domain name addressing and veri\xef\xac\x81cation capability How does production take place Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s storage miners provide storage space its retrieve miners provide fast access to data and its veri\xef\xac\x81cation miners ensure the veri\xef\xac\x81cation of POR and PDP For whom is Lambda producing Lambda is producing for all Dapps as well as business scenarios that require secure and private data \xef\xac\x82owing in a certain direction Therefore we can de\xef\xac\x81ne the production possibility frontier (PPF) of Lambda as follows l a m bda i m 12 \x0cProvable Data Possession Proofs of Retrievability We see therefore that the Lambda system consists primarily of veri\xef\xac\x81cation resources and storage resources The total quantity of veri\xef\xac\x81cation resources is limited and constant there are 1024 validators in the system and the total quantity of short domain name resources is also limited and constant Renewable resources mainly refer to storage resources and network resources which can grow over time 1 Validator Validators are responsible for validating the ledgers of MainChains and SubChains as well as the POR and PDP There are 1024 validators in total and they can obtain part of the block generation rewards The number of validators deployed is around a thousand primarily to strike a reasonable balance between system security and performance Validator nodes are divided into \xef\xac\x81xed and random ones Among the 512 \xef\xac\x81xed validator nodes 200 are operated by the Lambda Foundation 100 are distributed to programmers in the developer community who have submitted valuable code to Lambda and another 100 are distributed to Lambda enthusiasts who participated in the public \xef\xac\x81nancing The rest are obtained by holders of Lambda Coins through competition To qualify as one of the 512 random validators a validator needs to pledge a small portion of LAMBs to be a member of the veri\xef\xac\x81cation group The validator can get 400 million LAMBs in the \xef\xac\x81rst year after which the amount decreases over time For users of the Lambda system the validator s ability to verify the ledgers is the inherent logic of the system For the users\xe2\x80\x99 ability to verify the data they store Lambda provides a \xef\xac\x81xed low frequency validator to meet the basic requirements but veri\xef\xac\x81cation with higher frequency and more nodes needs to be purchased in the market The purchase adopts the Bancor mechanism and the fee is placed in a fee pool which can be regarded as a de\xef\xac\x82ation mechanism 50% of the bonuses in the pool are awarded to KEY holders and another 50% will be destroyed by burning A KEY can be understood as an equity like token in Lambda system and its speci\xef\xac\x81c meaning will be further explained below Validator resources trade in the system\xe2\x80\x99s built in exchange and the corresponding transaction pair is VAD/LAMB (In the economic sense validators similar to EOS RAM are scarce resources with \xef\xac\x81xed total quantity in the system ) 2 Short domain names LAMB storage resources can be accessed with short domain names which are unique resources in the Lambda system and need to be obtained through auction Anyone can bid for any account name and each bid for a particular account name must be 10% higher than the previous one The price will double after seven consecutive bids and the highest bidder needs to maintain the current highest bid for 24 hours before a deal can be concluded There is a de\xef\xac\x82ation mechanism in the short domain name auction system Speci\xef\xac\x81cally there is a fee pool of which 50% of the bonuses will be awarded to KEY holders and another 50% will be destroyed by burning l a m bda i m 13 \x0c3 Storage resources As Lambda is a decentralized storage project storage resources are the core resources in the Lambda system The supply of storage resources is relatively scalable so the storage resources are economically similar to the CPU and NET of EOS within the system Given that Lambda decoupled the design of PDP and block generation rewards when designing the system without using Proof of Space and Proof of Capacity it does not need to combat complex Sybil attacks but still needs to consider the repeated addition of a physical node As a result in the Lambda system storage resource providers need to pledge certain LAMBs for a token called KEY At the same time a Bancor based transaction pair Storage/LAMB will emerge in the storage resource exchange To buy a Storage/LAMB transaction pair means that the buyer needs 1GB of storage space per month When holding KEYs storage resource providers can obtain the block generation reward of staking hold in the system the income of leasing storage resources and the fee reward of validators and short domain name pools 4 Network resources Retrieval miners sell network resources their data come from storage miners they do not need to pledge LAMBs and will only obtain the tra\xef\xac\x83c fees paid by users in the retrieval market without additional rewards Monetary and \xef\xac\x81nancial systems LAMB is the native digital currency of Lambda and its main role is to act as a medium of exchange in the Lambda system At the same time LAMB is an accounting unit for stored values and also a store of value for holders outside the Lambda business system Gross domestic product (GDP) For any central bank the amount of issued money is always proportional to the growth of its GDP so we need to de\xef\xac\x81ne the GDP in the Lambda system which is equal to the sum of the products of di\xef\xac\x80erent storage capacities in the Lambda market and their own prices The increase in the amount of LAMBs issued should be proportional to the increase in Lambda GDP In our opinion the price and quantity of Ethereum are proportional to the number of ICO projects on Ethereum When projects need to issue tokens smart contracts need to be run Therefore the GDP of Ethereum is equal to the number of steps executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s GDP refers to the space to store data the network resources needed to store and read data the short domain name system to address a network and the Validator to validate data The structure of Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81nancial system The liquidity of Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s economic system is shown above l a m bda i m 14 \x0cBancor Mechanism and Hot Storage Resource Exchanges The Lambda system and blockchain systems that currently arbitrarily provide resources can be summarized with a simple statement \xe2\x80\x93 tokens purchase resources Under the current technological conditions tokens can purchase resources through automatic matching of orders or by providing an exchange under the blockchain on a second layer network Since there are cold warm and hot data as well as di\xef\xac\x80erent levels of data retrievability and veri\xef\xac\x81cation there are by necessity multiple endogenous trading platforms in the Lambda system Any trading platform requires trading depth to meet customer experience demands so Lambda introduced the Bancor mechanism to provide automated market makers in the background Lambda automatically scores resources for the quality of service and SLA and certi\xef\xac\x81es the top ranked resources for quality of service When the certi\xef\xac\x81cation resources are limited for the hot warm and cold data the supply of storage resources with 99 999% availability has an upper limit and must be less than the total demand We therefore provide the Bancor market that can automatically match the trading depth and the orders of demanders High SLA certi\xef\xac\x81cation mechanism Certi\xef\xac\x81cation takes place by calculating functions based on the PDP veri\xef\xac\x81cation of validators The certi\xef\xac\x81cation is a built in function of the system without any human intervention Storage miners can improve their certi\xef\xac\x81cation scores by burning LAMBs Access system of the certi\xef\xac\x81cation exchange KEY purchase According to the access system adopted by the certi\xef\xac\x81cation exchange the prices of the access KEYs increase sequentially until a threshold is reached which is the storage upper limit expected by the certi\xef\xac\x81cation exchange The access system of the exchange makes Lambda a limited storage system rather than an in\xef\xac\x81nite one for popular resources and certi\xef\xac\x81cation resources As regards certi\xef\xac\x81ed storage resources Lambda has the following advantages provable security provable data possession provable retrievability provable deletion and clear data \xef\xac\x82ow Lambda provides more data veri\xef\xac\x81cation services for users buying certi\xef\xac\x81cation resource services Data resource exchange A common trading platform the data resource exchange does not use the Bancor mechanism and all resources stored on Lambda can be traded at the exchange Lambda Token Total quantity 10 billion Lambda Coins Pledge Validators and nominators need to pledge approximately 8 12% of the total LAMBs Circulation In the \xef\xac\x81rst year 40% of tokens still wait for block generation rewards 20% are locked in the Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s account 10% of team tokens and 20% of private equities are still in the frozen period and not unlocked yet and the maximum number of tokens circulating in the market is about 10% Rental Users renting Lambda cloud databases need to purchase LAMBs at the exchange Transactions Data buyers in the marketplace need to purchase LAMBs at the exchange Rule All Lambda Coins will have been mined in 20 years with 10% allocated to the founding team 30% for fundraising 20% to the Foundation and 40% as block generation rewards After 20 years the total quantity of tokens will keep growing at a slow rate of about 0 5% per year Lambda Economic Process Unlike most blockchain applications Lambda is a data storage infrastructure for blockchains with its own chains for charging transactions encryption and access control LAMBs the native tokens of the Lambda project create memory and storage resources that consume nodes On the Lambda platform tradable resources mainly refer to the ability to access formatted data The fast access capability is a combination of the storage capacity of the hard disk and the memory size Since data are stored in an encrypted way they need to be deciphered when accessed by applications thus consuming CPU resources When measuring the contributions of storage providers we take a thousand decryptions and returns of data blocks as the unit of measurement l a m bda i m 15 \x0cIn the Lambda ecosystem the parties involved include Dapp developers and project parties chain node participants storage node participants and other participants such as investors The roles of chain nodes namely nominators validators and \xef\xac\x81shermen have been elaborated in the \xef\xac\x81rst chapter Unlike other MainChains Lambda has its own business logic we address and keep accounts of users\xe2\x80\x99 requests and returns and manage the consensus and clearing in the storage resource pool The logic of Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s data storage pool consists of four roles storage resource providers storage resource buyers community developers and data buyers which together constitute Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s interdependent ecosystem In addition in terms of the business model these four roles may be either individual users or enterprises Storage facility provider with Lambda clients installed From the renting of idle PC resources by individual users to the complete extraction of computing power and storage by large data centers we can drive countless computing and storage resources of all sizes Currently parties that have determined to be Lambda suppliers include individual users many IDC cloud computing centers tens of thousands of NAS devices of NAS platform operators like Phicomn and hundreds of thousands of PCs belonging to Internet caf\xc3\xa9s and Internet caf\xc3\xa9 platforms These suppliers are motivated to join Lambda by being able to acquire the LAMB digital currency rewards for completing tasks For suppliers existing low end hardware and PC resources cannot obtain digital currencies (e g Bitcoin) that require Hash Algorithm via Proof of Work (POW) Moreover the computing power of conventional CPUs and GPUs is increasingly falling behind that of ASICs and even storage tokens like Sia are using POW The Proof of Stake (PoS) used by Lambda and the method by which digital currencies can be obtained as long as data is stored will be the optimum choice for PCs and IDCs Meanwhile Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s probe program can monitor the running of related facilities of providers resource consumption and even the experience of end users in real time thus ensuring that the rental of devices will not have any impact on the original businesses l a m bda i m 16 \x0cDemands for data storage and transactions Today\xe2\x80\x99s distributed application developers will increasingly realize the value of the Lambda project On the Lambda platform they can not only easily develop distributed applications by taking Lambda as a BaaS service enjoying a variety of cost e\xef\xac\x80ective performance analysis and security assurance services at prices much lower than those of conventional cloud hosts and cloud storage but also sell the value of data whereby the return on data sales may be much higher than the cost of generating data The Lambda project is exploring a secure and e\xef\xac\x83cient decentralized data sharing model which \xef\xac\x81rstly will allow Lambda to extract multi layer metadata information from the shared datasets and establish domain indexes through consensus nodes to \xef\xac\x81nd connectable datasets e\xef\xac\x83ciently Secondly starting from the format of transaction records and the consensus mechanism Lambda will establish blockchain based data transactions to improve transaction transparency and avoid collusion and other forms of fraud Finally Lambda will prepare computing contracts based on the computation demands of data demanders ensuring the computing and output privacy of data owners with the assistance of secure multi party computation and di\xef\xac\x80erential privacy technology The main technologies involved include Distributed Hash Table and Locality Sensitive Hashing Software and microservices The Lambda team will introduce more features into the Lambda platform in the future At the same time the idea of developing its own Lambda applications together with other software developers is critical and the quantity and quality of such applications are one of the key factors of Lambda\xe2\x80\x99s future success The data storage and analysis services that we will provide may go toe to toe with the existing mainstream cloud platforms It will be easy for other open source R&D teams to open up their own open source software capabilities to the blockchain \xef\xac\x81eld by becoming WorkChains of the Lambda system Through the Lambda Foundation we will promote the development of the world\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain
