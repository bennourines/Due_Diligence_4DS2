for online merchants to move offline was always in the offing especially for unique products as opposed to mundane products such as books or pet food Ironically the digital sales channel has become one of the biggest barriers to the digital ecommerce economy becoming comparable to the offline segment Consumers like to touch and try gadgets fit new garments or shoes and explore new devices\xe2\x80\x99 functionalities 1 2 E commerce is booming the number of small merchants is exploding E commerce has grown at an unprecedented rate and is projected to grow at an even higher rate over the upcoming years According to \xe2\x80\x9cStatista\xe2\x80\x9d retail ecommerce sales worldwide in 2014 were USD 1 3 trillion and are set to increase to USD 4 trillion by 2020 The growth is illustrated by the number of shops created by online merchants on the Shopify platform They had 84 000 shops in 2013 144 000 in 2014 243 000 in 2015 and ended 2016 with almost 378 000 merchants on the platform a growth of 4 500% over 3 years In addition according to Statista the number of people buying goods or services online will increase from 1 46 billion in 2015 to over 2 billion by 2020 Challenges to solve in the global retail industry As the leaders of the $2 trillion global ecommerce market move to brick and mortar stores so do smaller merchants facing along the way numerous pain points such as 1 Costly inefficient and time consuming route to shelf space in a department store 2 Lack of the digital tools merchants expect such as big data customer analytics and engagement metrics 3 Only white label shelf space that blurs brand image and reduces engagement is being offered 4 Negotiation with numerous parties is required for a global launch (e g Westfield in London Lafayette in Paris Tokyo in Tokyo etc ) \x0c\x0c2 About FSCP 2 1 What is FSCP Token The FSCP coin offers customers sellers and advertisers advantages and exclusive application possibilities By paying with the FSCP token all e commerce payments are made in real time to all parties involved without any additional steps being taken Innovative advertising opportunities with which you can directly

incredible new opportunities to our society Everyone can now be an equal part of a newly forming ecosystem of either financial or socially influential movements Five star coin pro has formed a team of highly ambitious blockchain professionals to achieve an important goal\xe2\x80\x94 to become the leader of online crypto processing industry Ecommerce industry continues to rise sharply According to all major experts the revenues of e commerce will double in the coming 3 to 4 years This fact reflects where Five star coin pro is going with its business development While the market share of traditional payment processing companies will also increase over this period crypto processing is expected reach an absolutely unprecedented new level Currently the adoption of blockchain based payments on the major online retailers is LESS THAN 1% in comparison to all traditional payment methods This is exactly why the timing and opportunities for Five star coin pro to start expanding could not be any better Most of the blockchain experts agree that the implementation of various decentralized solutions has only just started and is currently in its infancy Five star coin pro crypto processing will instantly allow everyone to use cryptocurrencies for all types of payments The growth of our industry is projected to develop exponentially This is where the money is today and this is where more money will be tomorrow \x0c2 About FSCP 2 3 Our Moto In the digital age not all revolutions have already happened Breakthrough of blockchain technology essentially changes the understanding of money as a traditional payment method A variety of blockchain based cryptocurrencies has started to disrupt many areas from traditional banking all the way to online payments processing This is where Five star coin pro come in The vision that has inspired us to create Five star coin pro comes from incredible dynamics of the Cryptocurrency market Ever increasing acceptance makes them an equivalent part of global financial ecosystem What it means to us is that e commerce units of any type and scale will start to adopt the blockchain based payment technologies It will require innovative yet secure and wide reaching payments processing service providers Market is growing exponentially All e shops as well as big retailers where you currently shop are on thethreshold of integrating blockchain based payment methods It is perfect timing for Five star coin pro to emerge and lead the evolution of cryptopayments We focus on real living processes of B2B businesses which will be reinvented according to the global markets needs This is the direction Five star coin pro has chosen and that is the way e commerce is headed We will make sure that spending all types of cryptoholdings is instant and secure for both individuals and businesses \x0c2 About FSCP 2 4 FSCP Blockchain We are building a blockchain which hooks into other Blockchain to allow for trading across token/asset classes largely backed by Ether From the perspective of any individual chain we are building a scalable blockchain whose contract state is bonded by the activities of the FSCP chain itself Activity on other chains can interlink with this chain via interchange committed proofs similar (but constructed differently) to BTC Relay on the FSCP chain which can be submitted on Ethereum The FSCP chain validates the activity of the behavior of all participants (including activity on other chains) In other words the role of the FSCP token is providing computation and enforcement The token itself acts as a bond for its activity on this blockchain improper activity results in the token/bond being burned on the FSCP chain By creating a custom chain with deep enforcement we are able to construct a system where consensus rules optimize for high performing activity The design optimizes for rapid execution and clearing with slower settlement Future iterations may include shading of the FSCP chain but the initial iteration will presume high through put capacity for block propagation Owning FSCP tokens buys the right to validate this blockchain within its consensus rules Transaction fees on the network including (but not limited to) payment interchange trading and clearing house use are given to non faulty validators who enforce bonded contract states The token will have value derived from the fees derived from this network with the obligation/cost of providing validation to its users This token must have value to prevent low cost attacks and is necessary to enforce this network It may be on our roadmap to allow for delegating validation to third parties where by a limited amount can be slashed at a time before redelegation is required (the exact mechanism is not yet specified for security modeling) As this will be designed as a high performing system a linked via proof blockchain construction is necessary We expect that this system will be able to handle extremely high volumes of transactions and hence will only do final delivery over Ethereum Clearing and settlement occurs over the FSCP blockchain \x0c2 About FSCP 2 5 Investors The target group of investors consists of individuals and institutional investors who either have some understanding about the cryptocurrency world or those who mainly want to diversify a small part of their classical financial assets into the new economy It is expected that the large majority of people outside the community are still skeptical about cryptocurrencies and that it will take time to gain support among them Nevertheless inflated equity valuations negative yields and a lack of alternative opportunities to invest in the current investment environment will force investors to take part in cryptocurrencies and businesses created upon blockchain technology The exponential rise of blockchain technology used in real businesses is already delivering visible value added effects to the economy Undoubtedly such a revolution although gradual will not be overlooked by the retail investors 2 6 Decentralization Five star coin pro will develop a decentralized modular ecommerce network upheld by a peer to peer platform Centralized ecommerce infrastructure is vulnerable to malicious attacks and single points of failure By selling goods and processing transactions on the decentralized Five star coin pro token network built on the Ethereum blockchain everything is secured by 256 bit cryptography that will protect from fraud and prevent malicious attacks against the network 2 7 Interaction with the Ethereum Blockchain Five star coin pro\ s Ethereum blockchain backbone provides the necessary framework to implement scalable fast and cryptographically secure e commerce transactions The system will utilize smart contracts as the underlying technology for the creation of retail events harnessing the functional power of FSCP Tokens as a proof of purchase Five star coin pro\xe2\x80\x99s e commerce platform can operate with fiat currencies however the e commerce utility is optimized when using FSCP Tokens \x0c2 About FSCP 2 7 Interaction with the Ethereum Blockchain E commerce event act as a proof of purchase for any event containing enforceable pre set conditions programmed into the ticket\xe2\x80\x99s underlying smart contract code using Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s

risks Participants shall conduct transactions based solely on their own judgment and responsibility after knowing the mechanism and risks of cryptocurrency Price fluctuation risk Cryptocurrency will fluctuate with daily variations and the market is small compared with that of legal tender Therefore the range of price fluctuations (volatility) is wide and this may produce great financial losses or money value may become zero Liquidity risk Due to the small market compared with that of legal tender the counterparty to the sale and purchase may not be found and transactions may become difficult Or a situation may arise in which market participants may be forced to trade in unfavorable conditions Divergence risk due to hard fork A hard fork means that a single cryptocurrency splits in two and there is a risk that they are not inter compatible There have been cases in the past where the divergence between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic as well as between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have occurred and this kind of occurrence may result in a significant decline in value or invalid transactions Cyberattack risk There is a potential danger that your currency can be stolen by third parties accidentally through hacking or other means By strengthening the certification of the currency exchange and wallet where cryptocurrency is controlled it is important for us to strictly control a private key Risk of lack of completion of settlement Cryptocurrency transactions are not completed immediately and are placed in a pending state until confirmation is sufficient For example any unauthenticated transaction is authorized every 10 minutes for Bitcoin and once a minute for NEM and added to the blockchain Also some transactions may be cancelled during the authentication process of the blockchain \x0c5 About Risks Risk of laws and tax systems For laws and tax systems related to cryptocurrency reviews of taxation or disadvantage for possession/transactions may occur due to the change Risk of losing password If you lose your secret key or password for managing cryptocurrencies you might not be able to use your cryptocurrency anymore 6 What is Blockchain Blockchain is a technology for implementing a distributed ledger and is regarded as Blockchain \xe2\x89\xa0 Cryptocurrency \xe2\x89\xa0 Bitcoin Blockchain has a structure where companies etc allow collaboration for part of their data and share the information on a network Companies can share their data with one another which makes data coordination easier By obtaining mutual consent at the time of ledger update the validity and consistency of the contents are ensured and resistance to alternation and falsification is enhanced Blockchain is a technology that allows you to implement greater transparency and reliability in a public network such as the Internet by sharing data with one another instead of limiting data administration to one administrator and one company Blockchain is a technology fundamental to Bitcoin but blockchain is just a technology and many cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum Ripple and NEM use blockchain technology Incidentally there are also other cryptocurrencies such as IOTA that are based on technologies other than blockchain \x0c
