is ILCoin \xe2\x80\x9cWE NEED THINGS THAT DRAW ON THE REVOLUTION OF BITCOIN BUT BITCOIN ALONE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH \xe2\x80\x9d BILL GATES ILCoin is a modern alternative to Bitcoin using a SHA 256 encryption ILCoin is a cryptocurrency that is not dependent on the present banking system and has its own independent value There will be 2 5 billion ILCOIN available We are looking to expand ILCOIN usage worldwide In the near future we will be capable of handling smart contracts also we increase our maximum block size to 25 Mb in order to avoid future problems like hard forking because of SegWit Introduction \xe2\x80\x9cKNOW THE BASE WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD YOUR FUTURE \xe2\x80\x9d ILCOIN is a high quality cryptocurrency developed by ILCoin Dev Team It is mined using SHA 256 Proof of Work (POW) technology The ambition of ILCOIN is to evolve and become the foundation of a new global digital currency based economic system Members of this system may earn accumulate spend and trade ILCoins for the benefit of themselves and the entire community The Background Digital coins were all but non existent until 2009 when Bitcoin first appeared from seemingly nowhere It was and still is the most successful cryptocurrency It also brought blockchain technology into focus causing a true revolution in the digital world a game changer Cryptocurrencies (and in a broader sense blockchains) are digital systems designed to move information among members directly through a completely decentralized network of computers (including cell phones) Cryptocurrencies use virtually impenetrable \xe2\x80\x9cpuzzles\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure information remains concealed or locked into a block Verifying the cryptographic information is called mining and miners usually receive a unit of the given cryptocurrency (or a portion of it) for their work Verifying information contained in a block and adding such blocks to a chain of blocks (the blockchain) are the main elements of how the system works It is the key to ensuring information is distributed in a decentralized way without having to originate from or pass through a central data repository or distribution centre This also means that cryptocurrency transfers take place instantly on a peer to peer basis directly from one user to another without control banks central banks card companies payment processors etc \x0cThe Outlook \xe2\x80\x9cIN THE NEXT 30 YEARS 90% OF ALL COMPANIES WILL DO THEIR BUSINESS ONLINE\xe2\x80\x9d JACK MA FOUNDER OF ALIBABA COM In our lifetime most things have gone or are going digital Televisions telephones typewriters and even information have all gone digital Clearly traditional data exchange and payment systems cannot keep up with this fundamental shift in technology The Internet needs a new form of money and in order to move fast and virtually at no cost money needs the Internet The crypto movement although still in its infancy has demonstrated the superiority of decentralized communication and the voluntary respect of contracts between parties In other words information shared and stored is based on a consensus among all parties The fact that everyone can fi nd and see any type of information publicly if they know where to look ensures that information remains untampered and readily available While there is of course a high degree of uncertainty regarding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology everybody agrees that it is here to stay The potential in this groundbreaking technology together with the acceptance and recognition of cryptocurrencies even by a growing number of banks and governments makes new projects extremely appealing for start ups and investors alike The Company ILCoin has been launched and is mined by IlCoin Dev Team a young and dynamic start up company committed to build and develop a global digital currency based economic system and community With long time programming knowledge for each of our representatives we are intended to achieve improvements in this cutting edge technology which is the cryptocurrency world Every day we make effort to bring more numerous and improved assets for our users We are always looking for ways to update with better security and connectivity to our wallets so that we can keep current with the latest technology providing a better experience for our users Our support centre is always available to assist you with any issue that might arise during the use of our products We also have tutorials to help you feel more comfortable and confident when interacting with our products \x0cThe Goal for ILCoin Thanks to the centralized nature of ILCoin mining developmental work on the blockchain the wallet and the explorer is a continuous effort kept under tight control ILCoin can be safely stored in wallets built for the cloud Android OSX and PC and it can be transferred directly to anyone instantly at virtually no cost without banks without chargebacks ILCoin users can monitor their transactions throgh our own block explorer ILCoin is listed and freely traded on several cryptocurrency exchanges We are one step away from being able to create \xe2\x80\x9csmart contracts\xe2\x80\x9d the first blockchain to accomplish this using SHA 256 technology The vision is to make ILCOIN available to everyone in the world so that they can enjoy privacy and profit from economic opportunities The foundations of this new economic community have been laid Technical Info \xe2\x80\x9cTHIS IS WHY YOU CAN TRUST ILCOIN\xe2\x80\x9d Proof of Work To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer to peer basis we will need to use a Proof of Work system similar to Adam Back\xe2\x80\x99s Hashcash rather than newspaper or Usenet posts The Proof of Work involves scanning for a value that when hashed such as with SHA 256 the hash begins with a number of zero bits The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash For our timestamp network we implement the Proof of Work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block\xe2\x80\x99s hash the required zero bits Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the Proof of Work the block cannot be changed without redoing the work As later blocks are chained after it the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it Block Block Prev Hash Tx Tx Nonce Tx Prev Hash Tx Tx Nonce Tx \x0cThe Proof of Work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making If the majority were based on one IP address one vote it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs Proof of Work is essentially one CPU one vote The majority decision is represented by the longest chain which has the greatest Proof of Work effort invested in it If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains To modify a past block an attacker would have to redo the Proof of Work of the block and all blocks after it then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes The probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time the Proof of Work diffculty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour If they\xe2\x80\x99re generated too fast the diffculty increases Combining and Splitting Value Although it can be possible to handle coins individually it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer To allow value to be split and combined transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts and at most two outputs one for the payment and one for returning the change if any back to the sender Transaction In In In In \x0cIt should be noted that fan out (where a transaction depends on several transactions and those transactions depend on many more) is not a problem here There is no need to extract a complete stand alone copy of a transaction\xe2\x80\x99s history Network The steps to run the network are as follows 1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes 2) Each node collects new transactions into a block 3) Each node works on finding a difficult Proof of Work for its block 4) When a node fi nds a Proof of Work it broadcasts the block to all nodes 5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not spent already 6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously some nodes may receive one or the other first In that case they work on the fi rst one they received but save the other branch in case it becomes longer The tie will be broken when the next Proof of Work is found and one branch becomes longer the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes As long as they reach many nodes they will get into a block before long Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages If a node does not receive a block it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one \x0cCOMPLETED DEVELOPMENTS \xe2\x80\x9cTHANKS TO THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT ILCOIN IS ONE OF THE BEST MANAGEABLE

original SegWit problem took place in the Bitcoin network and in all subsequent coins that used the Bitcoin technology Due to this a 1MB limit existed which caused delay in the system if many transactions were made within a short amount of time The Bitcoin system was not very flexible to cope with this issue and thus it became a problem ILCoin instead increased the block size to 25MB meaning that we have greatly increased the capacity and electronic limits of the amount of transactions our miners are able to close SegWit or BIP148 will be available for Bitcoin if at least 95% of the miners accept the new source However until then Bitcoin cannot do this because the miners have to accept the bigger block size and be setup for them Since we control the network of ILCoin we simply adjust it to our needs From 170 000 transactions per block we can handle 15 million transactions per day or more depending on the blocks we mine At the moment Bitcoin can handle 375 thousand

order to prevent one of the biggest concerns in the crypto world \xe2\x80\x9cthe 51% attack to the network\xe2\x80\x9d as the name announce we have a set of rules and policies carve in the source code which allow or block different type of activities this also help us prevent any blockchain corruption like the double spending issue and prepare our chain for having smart contracts safer and solid The implementation of 3 different levels of security create a safe environment to the user took the solid SHA 256 and we put a hack proof vest so no one can double spend roll back or corrupt the network Also with these 3 levels we spread the stress of the network by giving different tasks to complete to every full node therefore our chain can be more stable strong and faster C2P is the actual next step of security in the cryptocurrency world in order to turn down the page for all the non ethical hackers who always try to take advantage on some back doors for some faulty codes or lack of hashing power for example and in the same moment hurt a specific cryptocurrency and the trust of still cutting edge technology In C2P every block non only contains the hash of the last block but also contains a set of certificates which the nodes can read in order to double or even triple check the origin of the block and inputs therefore if that container it\xe2\x80\x99s a valid or a corrupt one in the second case that block and its inputs will be rejected for all the network This new protocol prevents the 51% attack with it unique certificate stamp in every block since only non malicious nodes can deliver that certificate in addition to this it has implemented a unique blocking mechanism who allows to prevent the stealing of the coins and spending in case of a lost wallet from a user C2P is a unique asset of ILCoin and with these add on this cryptocurrency became the most secure coin ever existed \x0cFuture Plans and Developments \xe2\x80\x9cILCOIN WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE INNOVATIVE SERVICES TO ITS USERS \xe2\x80\x9d Expand Exchange Market ILCoin Development Team is working hard to be inside of new crypto exchanges At this moment we are on Bit Z IDAX Fubt Bitker DobiTrade Stex CoinExchange io TradeSatoshi FreiExchange Graviex Crex24 but in the near future we are looking forward to expand greatly within the marketplaces Smart Contracts (Q4 of 2019) \xe2\x80\xa2 Blockchains can run code While the first blockchains were designed to perform a small set of simple operations mainly transactions of a currency like token techniques have been developed to allow blockchains to perform more complex operations defined in full fledged programming languages \xe2\x80\xa2 First the program itself is recorded on the blockchain which allows it a blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic permanence and censorship resistance \xe2\x80\xa2 Second the program itself can control blockchain assets i e it can store and transfer amounts of cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\xa2 Third the program is executed by the blockchain meaning it will always execute as written and no one can interfere with its operation \xe2\x80\xa2 ILCoin Blockchain is capable of making smart contracts \xe2\x80\xa2 Contracts between parties \xe2\x80\xa2 Define rules and penalties for each type of contract \xe2\x80\xa2 Up to 5 types of contracts to defi ne each with its own rules and penalties \xe2\x80\xa2 Example type of contract exchange properties \xe2\x80\xa2 Example type of contract exchange shares Conclusion We believe that ILCoin is a high quality cryptocurrency which will be available to everyone who would like to enjoy privacy and profi t from economic opportunities References [1] Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System https //bitcoin
