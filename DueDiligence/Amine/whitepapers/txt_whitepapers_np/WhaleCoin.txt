b WhaleCoin Rhett Creighton Amber Hancock Austin TX USA rhett@heyrhett com amberrayh@gmail com Chain Starter Inc August 27 2017 WORKING DRAFT Abstract We describe a simple mined cryptographic blockchain which is designed to power a unique decentralized social network The social network supports several types of roles and notably the \xe2\x80\x9cWhale\xe2\x80\x9d role which is given to any user who holds at least 1 000 tokens The total number of Whales on this network will always be limited and Whales will have the power to influence how blockchain rewards are distributed An incentive structure will be designed so that \xe2\x80\x9cFollowers\xe2\x80\x9d will attempt to gain approval from Whales who will then influence the blockchain to send them rewards 1 Designing an Exclusive Club on a Blockchain The founding principle of WhaleCoin is a simple idea if you have 1 000 WhaleCoins or more you are a \xe2\x80\x9cWhale\xe2\x80\x9d Whales have the power to send upvotes to other users Unlike other social networks where upvotes or \xe2\x80\x9ckarma\xe2\x80\x9d have no inherent value in WhaleCoin the blockchain will pay users a portion of the mined block reward based on how many upvotes a user received from the Whales Like other cryptocurrency WhaleCoin is mined limited in supply and impossible to counterfeit[1] 2 Decentralization and Participation in WhaleCoin There are only two ways to obtain most cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\xa2 Mine them using special hardware electricity and technical knowledge of the process \xe2\x80\xa2 Buy them using cash if local or more likely using other cryptocurrency on some kind of internet exchange Unfortunately the vast majority of people on the planet still do not have easy access to the two processes described above as they can be expensive and technologically difficult to get started In order to spread awareness and use of cryptocurrencies it is important to provide people with cheap and easy ways to become invested in a crypto community \x0cFor example Blocki and Zhou described a process where humans could mine a cryptocurrency by solving CAPTCHAs in \xe2\x80\x9cDesigning Proof of Human work Puzzles for Cryptocurrency and Beyond\xe2\x80\x9d[2] However a key piece of technology known as a cryptographic obfuscator[3] requires further development for this process to work Giving away currency has proven to be a successful way to attract new users in the past Noted early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver received his first Bitcoin from an online \xe2\x80\x9cfaucet\xe2\x80\x9d set up by Gavin Andresssen[4] Stellar claims over 6 million Facebook auths due to their giveaway[5] But these giveaways do not ensure long term interaction of the new users with the coin In contrast to simply giving away coins or to the difficulty of creating CAPTCHAs for humans to solve WhaleCoin taps into the natural behavior that people already exhibit of continually following other people on a social feed 3 Steem / Steemit com Case Study Since launching in 2016 \xe2\x80\xa2 Steem is currently the 22nd most valuable cryptocurrency on https //coinmarketcap com with a market cap of $347 163 415 \xe2\x80\xa2 Alexa com ranks steemit com as the 1 370 most popular U S website and 2 428 most popular website globally Steemit is a social network site similar to Reddit where users can post links or longer form articles Everyone is able to upvote posts or comments and the blockchain pays a portion of the block rewards to users based on upvotes received In order to prevent people from spamming by creating many accounts to send upvotes with upvotes are weighted with the amount of Steem currency which a user holds This has the effect of users being paid much more if they receive an upvote from a \xe2\x80\x9cSteem Whale\xe2\x80\x9d A full list of Steem Whales can be found at https //steemwhales com/ The algorithm has gone through several changes to determine vote weight after many users complained that the Whales had too much influence The authors of this paper believe that while Steemit is a novel and groundbreaking project a flaw in the user experience is that it solicits everyone to post whatever they want but mostly rewards people only if Whales happen to send an upvote This leaves many users frustrated when they put effort into high quality posts which may not fit the tastes of Whales or perhaps happens to get overlooked by Whales on that particular day In Steemit the top 20 Whales may be so powerful that it actually hinders the value of the community It feels impossible to catch up to the Whales that already have millions of coins By contrast in WhaleCoin each Whale with over 1 000 coins has equal power The mined blockchain can support a maximum of 864 new Whales every 30 days at a 5 coin reward rate every 15 seconds \x0c4 WhaleCoin User Experience Design On the WhaleCoin platform Whales are the star of the show intentionally Whales can share news stories that they\xe2\x80\x99ve read or videos that they\xe2\x80\x99ve watched or a Whale might ask followers for advice or research To send an upvote to a Follower it only costs a Whale a blockchain transaction fee but is otherwise free This is similar to tipping but at no cost to the Whale Followers on the other hand are humans (or possibly bots) that are rewarded for doing a task that Billions of people already do every day follow a social network feed and interact through comments Because WhaleCoin is decentralized an unlimited number of portals could be built on top of it which could include chat SMS email or other integrations It may be possible for example to build a decentralized personal assistant application on top of WhaleCoin 5 Technology Overview WhaleCoin is a fork of Ethereum and shares many things in common with Ethereum However in Whalecoin consensus rules state that miners must pay a fraction of their mining reward to a smart contract The smart contract will split the rewards several ways including \xe2\x80\xa2 A Developer\xe2\x80\x99s Fund for development and maintenance of the WhaleCoin code and surrounding applications such as a social network Dapp that connects to Whalecoin \xe2\x80\xa2 Rewards paid out to followers of whales based on upvotes from whales The reward algorithm should have anti spam limit to ensure that a small minority of whales don\xe2\x80\x99t control a large fraction of the reward Also upvote rewards should decay over time to incentivize followers to participate in the social network and block chain It is possible that the rewards will also be split to include a moderator role to help ensure that the network runs optimally and to prevent anti spam attacks The contract rules will likely be updated after launch to promote decentralization and participation in the network 6 Mining Schedule Whale coin will use the same mining schedule as Ethereum which is currently 5 coins every block Blocks are mined through proof of work approximately once every 15 seconds For the first 200 000 blocks (approximately 35 days) rewards will not be paid out to Whale followers The reason for this is to allow the initial set of coins to be mined in a fair and decentralized manner \x0cAfter block 200 000 anyone that holds at least 1 000 Whale Coins has the option to be a \xe2\x80\x9cWhale\xe2\x80\x9d Being a whale allows a user to send upvotes to other users in the reward distribution smart contract Ethereum has an experimental plan to switch consensus algorithms in the future to Proof of Stake It is currently unknown whether WhaleCoin would upgrade along with Ethereum or if it would keep using the same consensus algorithm Most likely WhaleCoin would wait and see how software changes affect other blockchains first before making any major changes 7 Risks There are many risks involved with launching and deploying any new decentralized mined currency Some of the risks that would be involved in this process include \xe2\x80\xa2 Designing properly tuned economic smart contract rules It is possible that someone will find a way to game or cheat a contract that handles the logic for a reward unlocking mechanism \xe2\x80\xa2 There could be bugs or vulnerabilities in an unlocking smart contract that gives an attacker access to the funds \xe2\x80\xa2 Some social networks have more or less success than others It can be difficult to predict this success or failure ahead of time This list is not exhaustive Whalecoin is an experimental idea and the authors of this paper are not able to predict all of the problems which might occur once it is put into practice References 1 Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin A Peer to peer Electronic Cash System https //bitcoin org/bitcoin pdf Oct 2008 2 Jeremiah Blocki Hong
