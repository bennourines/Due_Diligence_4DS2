that is currently experiencing explosive growth The global market volume reached \xe2\x82\xac109 billion in 2017 with no sign of slowing down However this expansive growth has presented three major problems 1 Difficulties in diversifying and managing investments 2 Issues with transparency and reputation 3 No entry for cryptocurrency and lack of crossborder transactions We propose three solutions to them 1 Cross platform loan aggregator with ratings and blockchain 2 Welltrado P2P fund for global and cross border investors 3 Portfolio management of loans across platforms in a single dashboard We believe that this toolbox of solutions is a win for all The Crypto Community will gain unprecedented access to a decentralized and stable asset class A great mix to any portfolio The large risk averse institutional investors will get a method to trade the high volumes they seek The retail investors will benefit of a large amount of assets formerly inaccessible to them \x0cWelltrado believes that the P2P market needs technologically advanced tools for making investments and managing loans as well as a global P2P fund that allows cross border and crypto investments Welltrado is already an experienced player in the P2P platform market with an early version P2P platform aggregator already up and running \x0cWHAT IS P2P INVESTMENTS 8 Intro to P2P Investments Peer to peer lending investments or simply P2P investments is part of the growing industry of alternative lending/investment forms Through digital technology P2P investment platforms seek to simplify the borrower experience by cutting out the traditional middleman\xe2\x80\x94the banking industry\xe2\x80\x94and instead offering end toend loan solutions to borrowers and lenders P2P INVESTING EXPLAINED IN 5 EASY STEPS 1 Borrowers post loan applications online on P2P platforms 2 Lenders search online for loans to fund P2P FOR INVESTORS + Diversify and spread risk + Potential for consistent returns + Choose who to lend to 3 Lenders accept the loan application often on multiple loans to diversify and spread risk of default P2P FOR BORROWERS 4 Borrowers get their loans funded + Quick funding 5 Lenders receive debt service + Transparent fees + Simple application process \x0cWHAT IS P2P INVESTMENTS 9 Lending without the Middle\t\t man In the model of traditional lending institutions there is no immediate connection between borrower and lender as banks are the primary institutional lending party Individuals deposit assets in the bank gaining interest from this investment Borrowers apply to the banking institutions for loans offering collateral in one way or another The bank can then utilize among other things the deposited assets to offer loans to borrowers that meet their risk criteria P2P platforms provides a direct pathway between retail/institutional lenders and business and consumer borrowers with less or no need for collateral erasing the need for the third party involvement of banks This provides efficiency speed and greater accessibility and mobility to capital OPERATING COSTS AS % OUTSTANDING LOANS 2015 (FORECAST) 6 95 Other IT Origination Marketing Credit scoring billing and fraud 2 70 FDIC regulation Branch Network LENDING CLUB BANKS Sources Mckinsey Liberum \x0cWHAT IS P2P INVESTMENTS 10 Better P2P investments through technology Greater efficiency speed as well as greater accessibility and mobility to capital is achieved through digital lending platforms where algorithms and extensive data collection allows for real time risk score assessments of borrowers as well as fast underwriting of loans This significantly reduces the time spent to a matter of hours or days as opposed to the week (and often month ) long process of the traditional lending institutions P2P platforms caters to many different needs of borrowing including but not limited to consumers small and medium enterprises student loans and mortgages Essentially P2P is a viable model for every conceivable form of lending Through the merging of financial instruments with digital technology P2P platforms provides greater efficiency in the loan process by streamlining the process of loan application acceptance and funding It allows greater flexibility and control for lenders both retail and institutional and it gives vastly greater access to capital for borrowers Forbes believes that investors are choosing P2P lending investments due to higher returns (500% higher returns than the average deposit rate in the US) and a low correlation with the stock market Forbes com \x0cMARKET OVERVIEW P2P INVESTMENTS 11 Market overview P2P investments A MARKET IN MASSIVE GROWTH The global P2P market reached a market cap of \xe2\x82\xac102 59 billion in 2016 and is still experiencing massive growth which is expected to continue through 2025 As the graph below shows the market is expected to accelerate massively around 2019 making the market a very attractive investment All major

platforms globally excluding China which until recently housed more than 4000 platforms on its own LOAN SEGMENTS As seen in the table to the right the largest segment of current P2P investments is personal loans which consist of car loans pawnbroking and short term loans This is followed by business loans which account for both company loans and agricultural loans These are followed by mortgage loans and invoice trading Until the third quarter of 2016 the development of loans in the P2P market in Europe shows an average growth rate of 50% in the consumer segment and nearly 300% in P2P for business These growth rates suggest that in the future the business loan segment will play a larger role in the overall market volume for P2P lending Statistcs source statista com P2P INVESTMENTS SEGMENTED CONSUMER LOANS 36 00 % BUSINESS LOANS 26 10% INVOICE TRADING 19 40 % MORTGAGE LOANS 18 50 % THERE ARE 300+ INVESTMENT PLATFORMS CURRENTLY OPERATING IN EUROPE Of these 100 platforms are already partners with Welltrado and many more are waiting in line \x0cMARKET OVERVIEW P2P INVESTMENTS 13 Future growths This all around growth only accounts for the traditional internet lending industry worldwide If we consider other investor niches the size of investment opportunities is tremendous COMMODITIES From 2007 to 2016 the number of contracts traded in the agricultural energy and industrial metals categories rose from \xe2\x82\xac1 16 billion to \xe2\x82\xac5 77 billion with a total nominal value of more than \xe2\x82\xac100 trillion REAL ESTATE The size of the global real estate market has reached \xe2\x82\xac217 trillion and residential property makes up about 75% of the total value DEBT MARKET The global debt market value grew by \xe2\x82\xac7 6 trillion to more than \xe2\x82\xac215 trillion in 2016 with a total trading value of \xe2\x82\xac52 trillion annually Transaction costs of trading debt are currently estimated at \xe2\x82\xac150 billion EQUITY MARKET The world market cap of listed domestic companies as of 2016 was \xe2\x82\xac64 82 trillion while the global annual stock turnover as of 2016 was \xe2\x82\xac85 71 trillion The market for P2P investments is growing immensely reaching a volume of $125 87 billion in 2016 This number is expected to be nearly 10 times higher by 2025 With Welltrado in the market the sky would be the limit \x0cMARKET OVERVIEW CRYPTOCURRENCY 14 Market overview Cryptocurrency Because Welltrado intends to build a strong bridge between the crypto markets and P2P lending platforms and markets it is important to look at the current state of the cryptocurrency market both inside and outside of P2P lending CURRENT STATE OF CRYPTO MARKETS First of all the crypto market is growing quickly right now and represents a huge untapped resource for P2P markets The total market cap of cryptocurrencies reached \xe2\x82\xac165 billion in August 2017 and is expected to grow continuously throughout 2025 as the graph below

tokens However describing the difference between the two can be difficult and blurry CRYPTOCURRENCY AND P2P PLATFORMS The notable thing about the crypto markets is however that very few P2P lending platforms support the use of cryptocurrency despite the large market volume Therefore this section will also be quite brief Only a few platforms and other projects have recently begun to cater to this market such as ETHLend io Blackmoon Crypto ICONOMI among others CRYPTO ASSET GROWTH The market for crypto assets has grown by over 2900% since 2015 This market growth rate has remained consistently high even above regular fiat capital markets The market of listed crypto assets has reached 170 billion EUR while the true market size is considerably higher as not all assets are listed on exchanges \x0cMARKET OVERVIEW WELLTRADO 16 Welltrado in the market Welltrado is already established in the P2P market with a successful comparing and investing platform We have already been working in the business for more than 12 months Welltrado currently focuses on the European market where there are ~300 platforms in all four segments (real estate financing invoice financing SME loans and personal loans) but we have much bigger ambitions than that Currently we are in contact with 60% of the players in the markets (~200 platforms) and most of them treat us as partners They see our activity as very meaningful for their own business and the market in general We already have 100 integrated platforms and more waiting in line We continue to connect with the rest of the market platforms PLATFORM SUPPORT P2P platforms already support us with insights into their markets sharing statistical data and data about their investors\xe2\x80\x99 profiles\xe2\x80\x94 things that are vital to the success of Welltrado\xe2\x80\x99s solutions \x0cMARKET OVERVIEW WELLTRADO 17 Competitors Welltrado has a unique and strong position amongst possible competitors We engage with market competitors both as aggregators a P2P crypto fund and as a management tool No other competitor engages these areas simultaneously in the way that Welltrado does Most competitors as aggregators of loan investments are limited to single jurisdictions especially within the UK or the USA Welltrado on the other hand would operate in all European countries at first and later expand to other continents One of our main goals is to facilitate cross border investments FEATURE / PLATFORM WORKS WITH CRYPTO CURRENCY INDUSTRY ENABLES INVESTMETS VIA PLATFORM PROVIDES EDUCATIONAL MATE\xc2\xad RIAL / INDUSTRY NEWS PROVIDES

4500 P2P platforms in the world which means there are over 4500 different account interfaces to understand navigate and control But this also means that P2P lending investments are difficult to diversify and manage \x0cPROBLEM #1 19 DIVERSIFICATION MANAGEMENT Difficulties with diversifying and managing assets Because P2P investment platforms are not backed by guarantees from states or large financial institutions it is very desirable for P2P investors to diversify their investments\xe2\x80\x94spread them out on several loans\xe2\x80\x94so that one bad apple will not spoil the entire basket Diversification is very important for any healthy investment on a large scale By spreading investments across several loans the chances of bankruptcy or default of one investment are mitigated by the others Difficulties with managing properly diversified investments Once the gigantic task of researching opportunities and correctly diversifying assets to secure the bulk of capital is complete another problem immediately appears for the investor Just how do you properly manage and monitor these 50 investments made With the investments made across a host of different platforms the investor needs to log in to every account separately each time they need to check on the investment That is 50 times that a website address must be entered and a username and password needs to be entered as well Every single time However this can become an almost impossible task to achieve for even the most hard working investors To ensure a healthy asset they must perform individual and in depth research into every single investment and to do this equally well for 50 different investments is too huge a task PROBLEM CONCLUSION The current approach to the P2P market does not encourage or help diversification of assets even though it is of vital importance for any larger P2P investments \x0cSOLUTION #1 LOAN AGGREGATOR 20 SOLUTION TO PROBLEM #1 Loan aggregator To help investors easily diversify their investments Welltrado has developed a loan aggregator for P2P platforms which gathers information on loans from all affiliated platforms and aggregates them through numerous data points This provides a reliable rating and accurate risk assessment for every loan and platform By utilizing big data collection all available loans are gathered and aggregated at Welltrado allowing investors to browse and invest in rated loans across hundreds of individual platforms through a single easy to use dashboard \x0cSOLUTION #1 LOAN AGGREGATOR 21 At the core of Welltrado\xe2\x80\x99s vision is the aggregator tool with the idea of gathering P2P platforms and building an online marketplace for them This tool has already existed in a basic form for more than a year and has enjoyed success as a simple and easy display of loans and platforms AN E WALLET FOR YOUR INVESTING HOW DOES THE AGGREGATOR WORK From this data we start by building the marketplace and presenting the many loans in a simple easy fashion Welltrado will then develop its own e wallet which will be integrated across all compatible platforms so that investors only need to transfer money to one single account Investors can then easily browse and view loans as well as select the desired loans and the desired investment amount completing the loan investment with merely a few clicks Essentially it means that we connect with numerous data points at all interested platforms From there we gather vital information about the structure of the individual platform collect information about their equity buyback policies and everything else that potential investors might want to know This makes investment and diversification of assets an extremely simple and streamlined process HARD MAINTAINANCE Performing well as an investor in the P2P market today is extremely time consuming The task of investing and diversifying assets as well as managing their successful progress takes an unreasonable amount of time and effort \x0cWELLTRADO SOLVING PROBLEMS The Welltrado aggregator and will help solve a host of issues in the P2P investment market DIVERSIFICATION The aggregator will help investors easily diversify their assets by spreading their investments over many smaller loans ensuring the investor\xe2\x80\x99s bulk capital if one of the platforms goes bankrupt or if a loan defaults SUSTAINABILITY By using blockchain technology in data collection and rating platforms Welltrado will provide sustainability to the P2P lending market by exposing and keeping track the \xe2\x80\x9cbad seeds\xe2\x80\x9d of the industry TRANSPARENCY The big data collection and rating system will provide much needed transparency for the market Investors can view the basis of the loans they are choosing EFFECTIVENESS The aggregation of loans into a single browsable dashboard at Welltrado will greatly increase efficiency for investors looking for new opportunities \x0cSOLUTION #1 POWERFUL DASHBOARD OF LOANS 23 SOLUTION ON PROBLEM #1 Powerful loan dashboard To further facilitate and greatly enhance the investor experience Welltrado will also develop a dashboard where investors can manage and monitor their entire portfolio of investments made through the Welltrado platform across all P2P platforms \x0cSOLUTION #1 POWERFUL DASHBOARD OF LOANS 24 Management and liquidity MANAGEMENT TOOL The concept of the Welltrado management portfolio of loans is very simple This tool essentially works just like an e mail inbox where any account be it Gmail Hotmail or any other can be added and monitored in a single dashboard if you provide the login details to the application Similarly investors can input their login details to Welltrado The system would then crawl the accounts on all provided platforms gathering all available information and presenting it in a single simple professional and easily managed dashboard This eliminates the need for investors to log into dozens of different individual P2P platforms to manage and monitor their investments And it also eliminates the need for filling out and updating annoying excel spreadsheets and diagrams CREATING LIQUIDITY THE POSSIBILITY OF SECONDARY MARKETS This management tool would also work like an e wallet for loans This means the possibility of a straightforward secondary market of loans on Welltrado Normally investments would be tied to the loans for the agreed duration But with this tool investors could trade loans and create liquidity when needed making the P2P investment market even more dynamic than it is today FACT On average a retail investor will invest in 5 7 different platforms and monitors the returns/defaults in endless excel sheets \x0cWELLTRADO SOLVING PROBLEMS The Welltrado Loan Portfolio Management tool will help solve the following problems in the P2P market MANAGEMENT The portfolio dashboard will make managing and monitoring investments much easier by gathering information from all committed loans LIQUIDITY By having the management tool act as a loan wallet Welltrado will effectively be able to create a secondary market for investments Investors would gain much greater liquidity as a result DIVERSIFICATION Using the tool will also make it much easier to maintain oversight and control of diversified capital as all investments are displayed in a single dashboard \x0cPROBLEM #2 26 PROBLEM #2 Cryptocurrency and cross border mobility Because the P2P investment market is either unregulated or differently regulated in almost every country cross border investments are virtually non existent it is simply easier to invest at home even though there may be much more profitable investments to be made abroad Similarly the markets of cryptocurrencies have not yet found a viable way into the P2P investment market even though the two are obviously compatible with their decentralized structures and interest in free flow and better access to capital \x0cPROBLEM #2 27 Crypto needs a way in CRYPTOCURRENCY Cryptocurrencies need a serious entry to the P2P market As stated in the market overview the market for cryptocurrency is ripe and ready for use on the P2P investment markets Currently only a tiny handful of current P2P platforms operate with cryptocurrencies such as bitbond com and ethlend io Large crypto assets are waiting and interested in investing and these could provide greater mobility more liquidity and grant access to a much larger amount of capital But the crypto market has yet to find a stable entrance to the P2P market even though the rising use of blockchain technology and the philosophy of decentralized freedom of cryptocurrencies is a perfect match for the P2P market In addition P2P lending markets and platforms need to utilize the cryptographic technologies that have come to light recently These include technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts as they present great opportunities for the market in terms of increased efficiency security and of course profits Crypto investors need investment options tailored specifically to many different crypto investor profiles and their currencies both for short term and long term investments as well as software and infrastructure that facilitates a free and easy flow between fiat and cryptocurrencies in the P2P investment industry NO FLOW According to the 2016 MovingMain stream report from University of Cambridge on alternative finance about 50% of firms in the EU indicated that there was no flow of funding from outside of their country and 72% of platforms cited that there was no outflow of funds to other countries \x0cPROBLEM #2 28 ROI ACROSS THE WORLD (UP TO %) UNITED KINGDOM 12 % Cross border mobility GERMANY 8% CHINA 10 % SINGAPORE 20 % RUSSIA 18 % CROSS BORDER MOBILITY Low mobility of funding in the EU The continuously low levels of cross border investments are mainly attributed to poor regulatory harmony between countries as regulation is fragmented across Europe Regulations in countries are either too vague or too complex for investors to enter into cross border investments The most promising parts of Europe regarding cross border investments are in the Nordic countries as well as Central and Eastern Europe But even so the entire EU needs tools and structures that encourage cross border investments Mobility is not only desirable within the EU As the graph to the left illustrates there are widely varying ROIs across the world Investors should have full opportunity to invest in their desired ROI across the globe Profits should not be limited by borders BRAZIL 22 % SPAIN 12 % ITALY 10 % IRELAND 10 % CANADA 11 % PORTUGAL 6% USA 5% FRANCE 10 % AUSTRIA 6% ISRAEL 7% BULGARIA 9% LITHUANIA 25 % LATVIA 14 % ESTONIA 30 % DENMARK 15 % \x0cSOLUTION #2 SETTING GLOBAL CRYPTO FREE 29 SOLUTION TO PROBLEM #2 Setting global crypto free Global crypto investors do not have any real opportunities to enter the european P2P market properly Most platforms require you to have an European bank account or even an account in the local country So crypto investors stay out of the market even though it could be the perfect way to diversify their crypto portfolio A fund structure together with the aggregator will give crypto the toolset it needs \x0cSOLUTION #2 SETTING GLOBAL CRYPTO FREE 30 Funding visions for the future INVITING THE CRYPTOCURRENCIES One of the greatest abilities of the fund will be that crypto investors can invest cryptocurrencies in long term P2P investments Using smart contracts and a token system both fiat and crypto investors could invest in the fund This means building a very important bridge between cryptocurrencies and the fiat market as well as creating a flow between fiat and cryptocurrencies in the Welltrado ecosystem The Welltrado P2P lending fund will invest directly or indirectly into alternative lending products globally and thereby become frontrunners in the development of the entire alternative lending investment industry This is also important as Welltrado intends to champion sound and healthy regulations but especially to incentivize a harmonization of regulations internationally and globally The fund could also be used to help the aggregator tool grow as investments in alternative lending forms would encourage platforms to develop APIs that connect the platforms with Welltrado\xe2\x80\x99s aggregation and portfolio management tools By having the fund invest in new projects on the alternative lending market Welltrado itself could grow directly as a result TAILORED INVESTOR PROFILES To best serve the needs of investors Welltrado plans to develop up to five different investment funds so that many different types of investor profiles can be accommodated short middle and long term investments would be available for both fiat and crypto investors \x0cSOLUTION 3 WELLTRADO CRYPTO P2P FUND 31 Investment across borders REGULATORY PROBLEMS Because regulations currently are either too complicated or non existent investors have no good incentive to make investments across borders It is an enormous task to keep track of the different regulations in different countries Keeping investments at home is currently much easier as regulations are familiar and investments are easier to monitor\xe2\x80\x94but it is not necessarily the best financial investment To solve the problem of lacking cross border investments and at the same time allow cryptocurrencies to enter the P2P market Welltrado will establish a P2P crypto fund The fund will at first strive to make pan European investments and later spread to the rest of the world HOW DOES THE WELLTRADO CRYPTO FUND WORK Investors would enter into a management agreement with Welltrado The fund will then invest in cross border loans and portfolios on behalf of the investors By investing in the Welltrado P2P fund investors will find an easy way to make P2P investments across borders using the Welltrado structure as a fund vehicle \x0cWELLTRADO SOLVING PROBLEMS The Welltrado P2P fund tool will help solve the following problems in the P2P market CROSS BORDER INVESTMENTS The Welltrado P2P fund would help investors make cross border investments in an easy fashion without the need to be familiar with dozens of individual national regulations CHAMPIONING REGULATIONS AND VISIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE MARKET By actively investing in alternative finance forms Welltrado will help shape build and grow the P2P market as well as advocating for better and more unified regulations on the market ACCESS FOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES By making different investment funds that appeal to crypto investors the cryptocurrencies will be invited to invest in P2P investments thereby acquiring a huge amount of potential capital for the market \x0cPROBLEM 3# 33 PROBLEM 3# Transparency trust and reputation As the market continues to grow issues with transparency trust and reputation arise Investors need better tools based on massive data collection to scrutinize the investment opportunities and to create more transparency on the market Likewise the market needs to hold itself accountable as bankrupt platforms can reappear with new faces while the market has no effective way of tracking them \x0cPROBLEM 3# 34 Not enough data TRANSPARENCY TRUST AND REPUTATION Diminishing transparency on the market Because of the massive growth of the P2P market both in market volume and in the number of platforms the transparency of the investments and loans has been greatly weakened There is too much to choose from too little information provided and too little done to earn the trust of investors Need for community regulation and trust building In the same vein as the issue with transparency regarding loans we find a major problem in maintaining reliable trust and reputation in platforms and loans The P2P investment market needs better instruments that rely on high level technology and data collection such as blockchain technology and algorithms which would provide risk assessments of platforms and loan investments Equally the market needs tools to track and trace the \xe2\x80\x9cbad seeds\xe2\x80\x9d of the P2P market the ones that go bankrupt and start over again under a new name even though their model is still unhealthy Recent reports from Deloitte Bloomberg ECRI and many others agree that the biggest problem of a future P2P market is how to maintain transparency of assets controlling and monitoring platform default rates etc There is not enough transparency on P2P investments for investors to make informed and sound decisions The P2P market is vulnerable to those with less than good intentions The P2P market needs new and better tools to create a sustainable P2P ecosystem for the future where trust and reputation are well founded in hard data and with the market itself holding the platforms responsible \x0cSOLUTION #3 RATING SYSTEM 35 SOLUTION TO PROBLEM #3 Rating System Tied to each loan investment and platform we calculate a specific rating which is based on the data points and APIs of the platforms This combined rating and credit score is calculated through proprietary algorithms and provides a solid and transparent basis for investors to make their decisions PLATFORM RATING is the first step in building market transparency as it is the easiest and fastest to implement Such a rating will help demonstrate the trustworthiness of platforms and the quality of the data that has been provided + Platforms are rated and evaluated on a range of parameters + Years of operation products portfolio size RISK BENCHMARKING + Pricing and appetite for risk Risk benchmarking is the second but more costly and difficult step in building transparency However here lie the biggest gains for investors in addition to the platform rating every loan is rescored with a proprietary credit risk model and assigned an individual EL grade + Continuity of business + Experience of team and shareholders + Transparency and disclosure of information + Historical accuracy of PD (Probability of Default) and LGD (Loss Given Default) + Credit risk process and external data objectivity/availability + Recovery strategy \x0cSOLUTION #3 RATING SYSTEM 36 Creating Transparency PLATFORM EVALUATION BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY With the rating system toolset investors will be able to check ratios of platforms before they invest To help create a market based on trust reputation and security all collected data is kept through blockchain technology This means that the aggregator will detect platforms that go bankrupt platforms that have a large number of late loans and defaults and platforms not managed by competent people Welltrado uses the ratings to find the platforms that are going bankrupt or close to it We will not make relationships with or recommend these platforms and investors will be able to see transparently why through our ratings This rating system would then not just be helpful to the investors Borrowers and platforms would have great interest in getting a good rating on the Welltrado platform as it would save them the need to build reputation on several different rating systems It will also allow Welltrado investors and the entire P2P investment market to keep track of platforms developed by people who have already had P2P platforms go bankrupt and are starting new ones Finally and most importantly blockchain allows the storage of transaction data with no risk of data manipulation ALL IN REAL TIME All ratings and data will be constantly updated in real time providing vast and instant statistical data about every single loan and platform on several different parameters \x0cTOKEN MODEL 37 Token model The Welltrado token sold during the token launch is known as the Welltrado token or WTL This is the only time that these tokens can be created and therefore the total supply of WTL s fixed TOKEN MODEL TRANSPARENCY Only WTL token holders are able to use the Welltrado platform Every time a person gets returns on successful investments a fee of 5% of the profits is taken and divided into two chunks 2 5% of the fee goes to token burn 2 5% goes back to Welltrado development Thanks to Welltrado\xe2\x80\x99s intelligent proprietary technology this 5% is transparent to the user carried out immediately at current exchange rate available The tokens we burn is sent to an unspendable address that can be verified transparently this action takes the tokens out of circulation forever As a result the community using the platform will positively affect price through deflation This we believe will more than likely compensate for the small 5% fee Ownership of WTL creates a reserve that can be used as the fuel for future services In fact Welltrado\xe2\x80\x99s built in exchange will automatically search for the optimal rate for the fee transaction on all exchanges with which Welltrado has integrated and the instant formation of a corresponding lot for the purchase or sale of cryptocurrency on the selected currency exchange will ensure that the customer gets the best conversion rate possible for the whole transaction \x0c+ WELLTRADO TOKEN STRUCTURE Investment 95 % Returns WTL TOKEN INVESTOR Welltrado Development Welltrado 2 5 % INTERNAL CRYPTO EXCHANGE Burned from Wallet 2 5 %
