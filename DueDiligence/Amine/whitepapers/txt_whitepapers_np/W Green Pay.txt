global movement to reduce GHG By 2030 the Korean government aims to reduce GHG emissions by 37% from its business as usual scenario In 2015 Korea launched its Emission Trading Scheme (KETS) which is the second largest in scale after the European Union Emission Trading Scheme at the point of writing Korea\xe2\x80\x99s Cap and Trade system mitigates GHG emissions through market mechanisms It applies to approximately 600 companies that account for over 68% of Korea\xe2\x80\x99s GHG output (Korea Carbon 2018) A cap that determines the maximum emission level that companies are permitted was set by the government When a company exceeds the cap the company has to purchase additional carbon emission rights from the market at market price or has to pay a penalty to the government The penalty for non compliance with the KETS is three times the average market price per unit of tCO2e The maximum penalty is capped at KRW 100 000 per tCO2e (approximately US $93/tCO2e equivalent) Source The

the prevailing market price Despite the increasing demand for carbon credits in the market the allocation of carbon credits by the Ministry of Environment is limited The price of carbon credit per ton is high at approximately KRW 22 000 (US $20) as of April 14 2018 This is higher than EU\xe2\x80\x99s CER that is priced at approximately Euro 13 84 (approximately KRW 17 700) as of April 16 2018

still in a very nascent stage of development in Singapore A high degree of uncertainty as to how tokens and token related activities are to be treated exists The applicable legal and regulatory framework may change subsequent to the date of issuance of this White Paper Such change may be very rapid and it is not possible to anticipate with any degree of certainty the nature of such regulatory evolution W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD does not in any way represent that the regulatory status of the WGP tokens will remain unaffected by any regulatory changes that arise at any point in time before during and after this offering NO REGULATORY SUPERVISION None of W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD or its af\xef\xac\x81liates is currently regulated or subject to the supervision of any regulatory body in Singapore In particular W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD and its af\xef\xac\x81liates are not registered with MAS in Singapore as any type of regulated \xef\xac\x81nancial institution or \xef\xac\x81nancial advisor and are not subject to the standards imposed upon such persons under the Securities and Futures Act Financial Advisors Act and other related regulatory instruments Such persons are required to comply with a variety of requirements and standards concerning disclosures reporting compliance and conduct of their operations for purposes or maximising investor protections Since W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD is not subject to such requirements or standards it will make decisions on those issues at its own discretion While W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD will have regard to best practices on these issues holders of WGP tokens may not necessarily enjoy the same extent and degree of investor protections as would be the case should they invest with regulated entities

PTE LTD will have regard to the interests of holders of WGP tokens it is also permitted to consider the interests of other key stakeholders and to prefer these interests over the interests of WGP token holders This may mean that W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD is permitted to make decisions that con\xef\xac\x82ict with the interests of WGP token holders Not owing any \xef\xac\x81duciary duties to holders of WGP tokens also means that holders of WGP tokens may have limited rights of recourse against W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD and its af\xef\xac\x81liates in the event of disputes TAX RISKS The tax characterization of WGP tokens is unclear Accordingly the tax treatment to which they will be subject is uncertain All persons who wish to receive WGP tokens should seek independent tax advice prior to deciding whether to receive any WGP tokens W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD does not make any representation as to whether any tax consequences may arise from purchasing or holding WGP tokens RISKS FROM THIRD PARTIES The tokenized nature of WGP tokens means that they are a blockchain based asset The security transferability storage and accessibility of blockchain assets depends on factors outside of W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD \xe2\x80\x99s control such as the security stability and suitability of the underlying blockchain (in this case the ERC20 blockchain) mining attacks and who has access to the smart contract where the WGP tokens are stored W GLOBAL INVESTMENT PTE LTD is unable to assure that it can prevent such external factors from having any direct or indirect adverse impact on any of the WGP tokens Persons intending to receive the WGP tokens should note that adverse events caused by such external factors may results in the loss of some or all of the WGP tokens Such loss
