AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Executive Summary AMO is a blockchain project to create and operate the AMO market a market where car data can be shared and exchanged AMO Market = CAR DATA Market With the rapid development of connected cars electric vehicles (EVs) autonomous cars and smart cars there is a need for a decentralized open marketplace for transactions in the automobile industry AMO Market will support the exchange of data between all stakeholders Participants in the AMO Market are all stakeholders within the automobile industry be it car users automobile manufacturers or automotive service providers They participate in AMO Market simultaneously as data producers and consumers in a cycle of value sharing and creation A technology enabled economic system AMO Market is built on the AMO Blockchain and supports the fair valuation of data and distribution of rewards Accounting for adjustments in supply and demand payouts and purchases 1 are made with AMO Coin Car data is no longer limited to narrow use by a select few but with express consent of data owners becomes a shared asset that benefits other participants in the AMO Market When service providers or manufacturers want to access car user data proper authorization is brokered with data owners and even then all information and sensitive data is protected using cryptography Ultimately AMO Market aims to create an environment where car data and information are no longer used and held by a few select companies but are used and shared through legitimate and secure processes and transactions As a result car data will become a public asset and return more valuable and optimized services enjoyed by those involved Figure 1 AMO architecture overview 1 Amo Coin refers to both the AMO Token and AMO Coin AMO Token will later be converted to AMO Coin Cryptocurrency refers to the AMO Token before its converted state *AMO Platform The AMO Platform uses the AMO Blockchain to provide AMO Market operations It supports communication among participants and manages operational policies and IT systems including software 4 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Chapter 1 Overview The need for a decentralized car data market in the rapidly developing automobile industry The cars of today are generating and processing unforeseen amounts of data The advancement of the automobile industry has brought with it developments like the connected car the electric vehicle and the autonomous car Cars are now becoming moving hubs of information not merely a means of transportation to take one from point A to point B This new concept of automobiles is changing how we think about time money management entertainment and life overall The five key elements driving the smart car revolution are Security Platform Autonomous Connectivity Electrification\xe2\x80\x94also abbreviated as SPACE Each element contributes to the car data used to improve the quality of automobile services In the automobile industry car data plays a central role in supporting service development hence the success of business efforts tends to be determined by the availability of car data This is why there is an urgent need for a car data market that both smoothly facilitates the sharing of car data and also guarantees the security and credibility of the car data and the market itself AMO Market is a car data market centered on AMO Blockchain and AMO Platform AMO Blockchain and AMO Platform will be developed by security experts through the application of blockchain technology to Penta Security\xe2\x80\x99s existing technologies namely AutoCrypt\xc2\xae AuthentiCA\xc2\xae and Penta CryptoWalletTM AMO Market will contribute significantly to revitalizing the automobile industry by deriving additional value from car data and incentivizing participation and interaction in the AMO Market 1 1 Problems with Car Data Management The value of car data though invaluable and exorbitant is limited because of the difficulty in collection storage and sharing An automobile generates a diverse collection of data throughout its journey from start to finish\xe2\x80\x94beginning at the car manufacturer and ending at the scrapping facility The data reflects the lifecycle of the car and could be used to improve the state of car manufacturing car rental car sharing insurance and vacation industries However no commonly agreed upon standard or system currently exists for the systematic collection storage and use of this data On occasion car data may be utilized by independent service providers but oftentimes they overlook the potential of generating further value from the car data and fail to make full use of it 5 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Figure 2 Problems with car data and existing car ICOs 1 1 1 Unsystematic Collection of Data While data from external and in car sources about vehicle usage equipment and components has long been available the systematic collection and management of the data has been extremely limited Most car manufacturers and service providers rely on individualized systems for data storage and management Only with the recent introduction of connected cars have electric vehicles and autonomous cars enabled the use of V2X data generated through interaction with roads vehicles pedestrians and the overall traffic infrastructure Following advancements in the electric vehicle industry not only in car data but also charging and battery related insights are being recognized as valuable information The progress on smart cars has also increased demand for user data generated by various applications The problem is that the format of collected car data varies by vehicle manufacturer and service provider In most cases the data is technically incompatible with other systems and cannot be shared While legislative limitations might partially account for the lack of data sharing the main obstacle to sharing car data is the lack of a common technical framework Since there is no public protocol for gathering data it is impossible for participants to be properly informed about how their personal information is being used and whether agreed boundaries for data use are being respected Additionally even if individuals agree to share their data with service providers under contractual agreements they are not fairly compensated for their contribution Currently there is no institution or company that performs comprehensive collection of valuable car data generated in each part of the vehicle operation process covering the communication systems internal and external systems and the application layer 1 1 2 Inefficient and Uncompensated Data Provision Access to car data opens up new business opportunities for service providers to offer customized services to car users However because there isn t an equal relationship in data transactions between car users and service providers (such as car manufacturers developers of automobile services car insurance providers etc ) there is also no means of rewarding car users for their provision of data Personal data only serves as evidence of contract fulfillment rather than amounting to any generation of additional value In particular service providers that are unable to provide a high level of data protection can easily end up misusing customer data beyond the bounds of agreement and even leaking the data Therefore there is a need to establish a trustworthy platform that can quantify the value of car data and provide a fair compensation system for data contribution In this way both data providers and data consumers will stand to benefit from the exchange 6 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 1 1 3 Insufficient Data Security and Privacy Protection Car data can be categorized based on whether or not it includes personal information Car data that includes personal information must be collected and stored in a manner that provides adequate privacy protection in accordance with the rights of the data subjects In particular any distribution of such data must follow protection protocols and processes For instance collection and storage of sensitive data such as daily driving patterns without proper security measures can give rise to social issues regarding privacy It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to address the current method of relying on portable devices (SD cards etc ) for storing important data generated within the vehicle data transmitted via internal vehicle networks and additional vehicle related data Any information that includes private information must be shared and utilized only after completing de identification2 of the data for adequate privacy protection Car data that is not shared or used only has potential value without any actual value Due to the current lack of rules and security guidelines surrounding car data the sharing and use of car data can only be perceived as a risk rather than an opportunity for creating value 1 2 AMO Solutions and Goals AMO provides a secure and reliable market for car data The vision of AMO is to create a secure and reliable environment for sharing car data that builds upon our expertise in the automobile industry The first step in achieving this is to solve the current problems in the automobile data industry as explained in detail below Figure 3 Solutions to existing issues 2 De identification refers to the process of removing all personally identifiable information that could be used to identify a person from a dataset This is commonly performed via pseudonymization in which real names are fully or partially replaced with symbols tokens or temporary IDs Both methods rely on encryption technology 7 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 1 2 1 Standardized Data Collection and Car Data as a Transaction Unit To solve the problem of non standardized data collection systems a range of hardware and software data collectors have been developed to deploy with AMO These include a hardware data collector (AMO Data CollectorTM) a mobile application (AMO Mobile WalletTM) a car infotainment (IVI) app software embedded into a car s telematics systems and software data collector for V2X devices (AMO Auto WalletTM) These tools will perform data collection for all three levels of data involving automobiles V2X data In car data and User data Following a car s entire lifecycle from the first registration of the car to records of any accident history or services engaged to the final scrapping of the car it is possible to systematically collect car data for a wide variety of uses regardless of national boundaries or type of vehicle Furthermore specification for car data will be publicly available so that anyone will be able to participate and contribute to the car data market This will prevent any one company or organization from monopolizing car data as a business tool To this end a public blockchain like AMO Blockchain is necessary in allowing this type of open datasharing Data will consist not only of what is generated by drivers and other car users (Car Data) but also secondary generated data (Processed Car Data) from those who provide any kind of services within the auto industry The specifications for Car Data and Processed Car Data will also be defined and shared through the blockchain in order to encourage use 1 2 2 Compensation System for Data Provision AMO provides users with the AMO Market a blockchain based car data market which is an environment that facilitates exchange between data producers and consumers AMO Market solely provides the environment for trade and does not assume data ownership rights Car data becomes a commodity and data producers and consumers contribute to determining the value of car data Any market based value transaction involving provision of car data will be rightfully compensated with AMO Coins This compensation model provides incentive for market participants to supply car data In the future active market participation and data generation incentivized by the compensation model is expected to encourage even countries without active automobile manufacturing to establish and grow their automobile related businesses 1 2 3 Applying Data Security and Privacy Protection to the Blockchain Car data which users have agreed to share will be stored on the AMO Blockchain along with other relevant information about the transaction data ownership rights and data usage rights Similar to the way data is typically stored on the blockchain all this data will be stored in blocks The raw data which contains sensitive personal information will be encrypted de identified and fragmented in order to preserve maximum security This distributed method of storage will be implemented with AMO Blockchain s Peer Storage feature With Peer Storage the PCs and IoT devices that make up the nodes of the blockchain will provide data storage resources in exchange for proper compensation Storage space created through this organic system is therefore potentially limitless Data in distributed storage is decrypted on request of the data buyer only with the authorization of the rightful data owner This process of verifying credentials and permissions is facilitated by AMO Platform However AMO Platform is only involved in making the peer to peer connections and retains absolutely no access to the data 8 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 1 3 How AMO Differs Creating a Future Automotive Ecosystem Deep knowledge and technical understanding of automobiles and the IT industry along with hands on experience is essential for building the car data market Since automobiles are complex machines consisting of over 10 000 physical parts and hundreds of millions of lines of code grasping the massive amount of internal and external data is extremely difficult Moreover creating a safe and secure blockchain based ecosystem is certainly not simple In order to overcome both challenges the core team of developers must possess comprehensive knowledge and skills in automobile and transportation technology management of sensitive car related information and general system development with integrated security Building and sustaining an ecosystem based on blockchain technology is virtually impossible without proven results and capabilities AMO has the optimum skills and experience required to build the AMO Market \xc2\x9f Penta Security understands automobiles and transportation infrastructure as part of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) development efforts Penta Security has been running the AutoCrypt\xc2\xae project since 2007 working with both the Korean government and major automobile manufacturers Following the successful construction and operation of autonomous vehicle complexes in Sejong Yeoju and Hwaseong the project will be expanded to constructing similar smart roadways in Seoul Jeju and Daegu \xc2\x9f Successful experience in the IoT environment is needed to build and operate a stable infrastructure between cars and smart objects Penta Security\xe2\x80\x99s expertise in solutions optimized for IoT environments is demonstrated by its development of AuthentiCA\xc2\xae a cloud based certificate authority service for the smart car smart factory smart \xc2\x9f energy and smart home environment Using blockchain technology Penta CryptoWallet\xe2\x84\xa2 and AMO Data Collector\xe2\x84\xa2 have already been developed Not simply a plan in the works or an empty vision roadmaps with proven results and technology are already underway 9 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Chapter 2 AMO Market A virtuous cycle of car data transactions in which all participants benefit Figure 4 AMO Market & AMO Coin Economy The AMO Market provides an open platform where anyone is able to participate in sharing car data or processing it into more valuable output Built on blockchain technology and designed with end to end security principles in mind AMO Market is operationally stable while guaranteeing data security as well as protecting the rights and personal data of market participants As part of the car data economic ecosystem AMO Market participants simultaneously reap financial rewards while contributing to the advancement of the automotive industry 2 1 How AMO Market Works The market price of provided data determined according to the law of supply and demand 10 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO AMO Market utilizes blockchain technology to improve the current automobile ecosystem that consists of numerous stakeholders The core feature of AMO Market is voluntary provision and appropriate compensation for car data Car users manufacturers service providers and all other participants in the automobile industry will be able to provide car data and receive appropriate compensation for their contribution according to market value Figure 5 AMO Market AMO Market consists of AMO Blockchain and its supporting feature AMO Platform Market participants assume the roles of both data producers and consumers Car data generated via initial vehicle use along with secondary output (processed car data) will be traded in the market and the market value of data will be determined based on the law of supply and demand and information gathered through various support systems provided by the AMO Platform 2 2 AMO Market Participants Every participant contributes to market activity simultaneously as both data producer and consumer \xe2\x80\x94 a \xe2\x80\x9cpro sumer \xe2\x80\x9d TM With the AMO Data Collector device that can be easily attached to a vehicle s OBD II port together with the AMO Mobile WalletTM smartphone application and AMO Auto WalletTM software installed in the car car users are able to collect car data for sharing on AMO Market The car data that car users have agreed to share is then stored on the AMO Blockchain in exchange for AMO Coin according to the value of the data provided Using these AMO Coins car users are able to purchase various products and services offered by manufacturers and service providers participating in AMO Market Data producers can share data and receive compensation in AMO Coins according to the evaluated value of the data Data consumers can obtain the rights to extract and use the data by paying that evaluated value in AMO Coins 11 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Figure 6 Lifecycle of car data for car user/data producer Automobile manufacturers and service providers can purchase car data recorded in the AMO Blockchain in order to provide up to date service to car users Service providers manufacturers and maintenance companies can in turn also submit secondary processed data in the AMO blockchain and receive AMO Coins according to the value of that data Figure 7 Lifecycle of processed car data for manufacturers service providers and data producers As such car users automobile manufacturers and related service providers become the suppliers and consumers in the AMO Market Through this structure of providing and receiving data and compensation a cycle is created in which car data is enriched and the market is activated The ongoing cycle in turn contributes to the growth of the AMO Market 12 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 2 3 AMO Blockchain AMO Blockchain is a blockchain optimized for storing and trading car data The AMO Blockchain is a network that all participants of the AMO Market take part in As shown below whether a car user or a manufacturer or service provider all participants share car data on the AMO Blockchain Figure 8 AMO Blockchain connects to each market participant In order to transact AMO Market participants connect to the blockchain via the AMO Blockchain Client and AMO Wallet As Market participants data producers obtain AMO Coin in return for data they share and exchange On the other hand those participating in the blockchain as AMO Blockchain Nodes receive rewards in proportion to their contribution in sustaining the blockchain These rewards are for either block generation or contributing resources to AMO Blockchain s Peer Storage The car data generated by car users and the processed car data from service providers are uploaded online and stored on AMO Blockchain At this point all communications are encrypted and any transaction details data ownership and usage rights are stored and managed together as blocks similar to the way storage is done on a typical blockchain On the other hand raw data which includes personal information is encrypted and de identified before storage on Peer Storage This data stored on Peer Storage is fragmented and stored in a distributed manner across multiple blockchain nodes In this way even if physical access to Peer Storage were to be compromised data obtained would not have any value since it would be incomplete and thus not possible to decrypt Both car data and processed car data are in direct contact with the AMO Blockchain and under no circumstances pass through the AMO Platform AMO Platform is responsible for the management of policies and software along with key management and certificate issuance necessary for participant authentication without any involvement in car data management 13 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Figure 9 Data storage structure for AMO Blockchain The AMO Wallet3 which is connected to the AMO Blockchain contains AMO Blockchain Node functions This will allow other IoT devices with networks and computing power to join nodes in the future increasing the scalability of the AMO Blockchain Figure 10 AMO Wallet 3 AMO Wallet works as a client and node for AMO Blockchain simultaneously AMO Wallet can be either AMO Mobile TM TM Wallet or AMO Auto Wallet 14 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 2 4 AMO Platform AMO Platform is responsible for the operational and managerial functions of the car data market The AMO Platform is essentially the IT system made up of the AMO Market operational policies data policies security policies and software It\xe2\x80\x99s also responsible for community operation among the participants and system support for AMO Blockchain operation Major components include AMO CA AMO Coin Management System AMO Metric Management System AMO Node Management System etc Figure 11 Conceptual diagram of AMO Platform Despite the rise in demand for car data one of the primary reasons it has not yet been collected and shared is that standards for car data differ depending on the automobile manufacturer To solve this issue the car data standards of each of the manufacturers will be converted to match the international standard While this may rearrange the order of the data values it will not change the value of the data itself Additionally a rich API will be provided for car data users meaning that data purchasers will be able to conveniently access car data from the AMO Blockchain The value of the car data is determined by the supply and demand of the data on the market The AMO Platform uses machine learning and cooperative agreements in order to calculate optimal valuation preventing issues of quantity vs quality of the market platform data when it comes to compensation The AMO Platform does not intervene in the flow of both car data and processed data between the market participants and the AMO Blockchain The platform supports communication for smooth operation of the AMO Market including policy and software distribution distribution of keys and certificates for the authentication of participants 15 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Figure 12 AMO Platform & Data Flow As an example of operational support AMO Platform intermediates data ownership and usage rights Encrypted car data can only be decrypted by those who have purchased the data AMO Platform facilitates interaction between data producers and data consumers to manage who has ownership over the data 16 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Chapter 3 Technical Details 3 1 Collection of Car Data In Car Data / V2X Data / User Data is collected from the automotive systems networks and applications The developments in connected cars electric vehicles and in vehicle infotainment have already made the autonomous car a reality Car data traded in the AMO Market will include all data generated related to automobiles including information gathered from the environments that interacts with the next generation of automobiles Figure 13 The range of technologies in car data Car data includes all data from the three layers of automobiles Figure 14 Technical scope and categories of car data There are three types of data internal data or data from the car itself (In Car Data) communication data (V2X data) and data from the use of applications (User data) 17 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Figure 15 AMO\xec\x97\x90\xec\x84\x9c\xec\x9d\x98 CAR DATA \xeb\xb2\x94\xec\x9c\x84 V2X data refers to traffic data communicated between vehicles roads and other connected nodes via wired and wireless network infrastructure V2X data can be categorized as follows according to the parties involved in data exchange \xc2\x9f V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) Communication between vehicles e g contacting emergency vehicles \xc2\x9f V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) Communication between vehicles and road infrastructure e g traffic lights about to turn red \xc2\x9f V2D (Vehicle to Device) Communication between vehicles and mobile devices e g car network sharing \xc2\x9f V2P (Vehicle to Pedestrian) Communication between vehicles and pedestrians e g pedestrians crossing the road V2X data includes information gathered through vehicle communication between external devices and traffic infrastructure Real time traffic information distance to the vehicle in front and weather information are difficult to acquire through the internal operations of the car V2X data allows car users to be fully informed even when facing roads with poor visibility or worsening weather conditions V2X data refers to the data about the surroundings of the vehicle whereas in car data covers any internal car data including car speed status or car model Further examples include details about the VIN (Vehicle Identity Number) car owner car insurance operational data and car servicing User data refers to information gathered from communication between the car and the car user This information includes frequented locations preferred music refueling time and driving habits 3 1 1 Limitations in the Collection of Car Data Presently car data is only used in special circumstances and for very limited purposes such as when a service provider needs to perform repairs or troubleshoot the cause of a fault or an accident In such instances car users who are the actual owners of the car data are unable to reap any monetary reward for the data they generate and perhaps are even unaware that their data holds any monetary value The result is that car users do not make any effort to preserve or collect the data and by extension automobile manufacturers and insurance agencies or other service providers in the auto industry will be unable to obtain reliable car data Therefore they may try to generate car data on their own or conduct surveys that give incomplete data lacking objectivity In addition there is no incentive given to encourage the further extraction of value from car data or processed car data because they are not shared as assets belonging to service providers which have spent a great deal of time and resources in processing the data As AMO Market thrives data transactions between and among car users and service providers will enhance the quality of existing services as well as accelerate the development of new ones 18 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Figure 16 Data usage and quantity with AMO Market 3 1 2 Collection of car data Car data is collected using hardware and software Car data generated both internally and externally can be collected using the following two methods \xc2\x9f Collection of data using AMO Mobile Wallet TM TM AMO Data Collector is plugged into the car\xe2\x80\x99s OBD II port for data collection The collected data is first sent to the AMO Mobile WalletTM installed on the user\xe2\x80\x99s smartphone which then delivers the transmitted car data to the AMO Blockchain Any car data that includes personal or confidential information is first encrypted and then transmitted to the AMO Blockchain Figure 17 Data collection process with AMO Data CollectorTM and AMO Mobile WalletTM \xc2\x9f Collection of data using AMO Auto WalletTM Installed in the vehicle AMO Auto WalletTM collects internally and externally generated car data and stores it on the AMO Blockchain Any car data that includes personal or confidential information is first encrypted and then transmitted to the AMO Blockchain 19 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 3 1 3 Storage/Transmission of Car Data The In Car Data and V2X Data collected by AMO Data CollectorTM is transmitted to AMO Mobile WalletTM on the smartphone via Bluetooth For car data collected by AMO Auto WalletTM highly sensitive personal information within the data is first encrypted before being uploaded to AMO Blockchain Car data only contains partial event data as well as the metadata of any original data Therefore due to its small volume car data can be suitably uploaded in real time via LTE/3G mobile communication networks However if data collected becomes further diversified and includes data of larger sizes like videos or voice data they may be uploaded via Wi Fi or first housed in an additional storage location before uploading in bulk Product Type of Data Collected In Car Data AMO Data CollectorTM (H/W) \xc2\x9f Operational data (distance speed fuel efficiency etc ) \xc2\x9f Various troubleshooting

3 2 Structure of AMO Blockchain AMO Blockchain provides higher performance and stronger security than existing blockchains AMO Blockchain combines existing blockchain technology with AMO Peer Storage AMO Peer Storage supports peer to peer network based distributed storage for efficient storage use and sharing of car data AMO Peer Storage functions in connection with AMO Storage Anchor and is connected to the node of AMO Blockchain as depicted in the diagram below Figure 18 AMO Blockchain Node Conceptual Architecture Generally a blockchain is designed to scale and as the number of participating nodes increases the integrity of data becomes stronger and the data becomes nearly impossible to falsify or forge However it\xe2\x80\x99s not an adequate method for storing large amounts of data as the efficiency of the entire network deteriorates if there is too much data on each block This is why Peer Storage will be activated after launching the AMO Blockchain Testnet and Mainnet to manage larger volumes of car data efficiently AMO Virtual Machine takes care of the processes within the Node\xe2\x80\x99s memory by indexing AMO Coin transactions in the market market participants\xe2\x80\x99 coin balances and other information and relocating car data transactions and authorizations AMO Blocks is present in the Node\xe2\x80\x99s memory as well as the file system (hard disk etc ) in order to save and store data from the blocks generated in the blockchain Each block contains key information of AMO Coin transactions car data transactions and anchoring data for encrypted sensitive data The AMO Peer Storage will be released to the blockchain community as a decentralized distributed storage space for the safe and efficient storage of encrypted data that would otherwise be too large and difficult to store on the AMO Blockchain With this issues like synchronization or inefficiency when reviewing data can be minimized Typically attempts to resolve blockchain capacity challenges involve using distributed storage that actually works as a centralized file system However this does not match the decentralized nature of AMO where car data standards are shared and permissions for data use and purchase are brokered on a P2P basis 21 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 3 3 Data Privacy and Security Privacy by Design (privacy conscious architechure) is critical in the automotive environment As the car becomes a more integrated part of its users lifestyle car data inadvertently includes personal information that may be considered sensitive in nature In order to protect AMO Market participants from sensitive data exposure especially in light of growing cybercrime multiple safeguards need to be in place 3 3 1 Compliance with Security Guidelines Car data is collected transmitted stored and used in compliance with strict legal regulations International vehicle security and privacy guidelines have been considered throughout the development process AMO Market has been developed to comply with the following legislations and guidelines 1) The key principles of vehicle cyber security for connected and automated vehicles (UK 2017) 2) Security and Privacy in Your Car Study Act of 2017 (US 2017) 3) The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (US 2015) 4) Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (US 2016) 3 3 2 Encryption of Personal Information Particular care must be given to any internally or externally generated car data that contains highly sensitive personal information AMO Wallet identifies and encrypts such sensitive personal data during the collection of car data The encryption keys used by AMO Wallet are issued by AuthentiCA\xc2\xae The data consumer is able to decrypt the data only after acquiring permission from the data producer The process of requesting permission and performing key exchange for decryption is supported by AMO Market Platform The authorization process between the data producer and consumer is protected with end to end encryption which means AMO Platform cannot decrypt or access any of the communication 22 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO Figure 19 Acquiring right to use encrypted data through the AMO Platform 3 3 3 Encrypted Communications and Encrypted Data Storage Besides the encryption of personal information AMO Market also encrypts the communication channel itself by supporting secure communication over SSL/TLS Multi layered security is employed firstly to prevent data leakage during the transmission of data between the car and AMO Wallet where car data is not yet encrypted and secondly to prevent car data and less sensitive unencrypted personal information from being leaked during the transmission between AMO Wallet and any AMO Node Encryption key and certificate management service AuthentiCA\xc2\xae will be deployed to encrypt communication channels 3 4 CAR DATA Trading Ownership and rights for acquisition of car data allow for the guarantee of fair transactions In AMO Market car data producers supply the market with data and car data consumers obtain permission to use the data Car data consumers pay for their use of the data with AMO Coins which are then used as compensation for the production of car data Data traded in the market includes car data and processed car data 23 \x0cAMO Blockchain Penta Security AutoCrypt\xc2\xae Reverse ICO 3 4 1 Data Ownership and Access to Data Car data producers maintain ownership of the data but car data consumers are able to gain individual access rights to a specific set of car data upon purchase As such any resale of this data is prohibited Restrictions on time or scale of data use can be applied on a case to case basis The ownership of processed car data belongs to those that participated in the secondary processing of car data It is important to note however that the data ownership rights do not extend to the initial car data used as the source
