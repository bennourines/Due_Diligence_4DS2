integration of cryptographic technology into the banking system without eliminating the disruptions in the existing banking system cannot make any contribution other than the quick HAKKIMIZDA borrowing of the people in the borrower based money system and the formation of new financial bubbles For that reason it is important to first identify these disruptions and provide solutions to those disruptions SERVICES After eliminating these disruptions \xe2\x80\x9cThe Natural Selection of Money\xe2\x80\x9d will take place and the real growth will take the place of artificial economic growth which is based on debt The current SERVICES economic system will return to its natural process again The savings will be realized within the production process instead of deposit money loan swirlthat entered into a wicked circle in the closed banking system PRODUCTS The flat foreign exchange idea used today is made up of the idea that it is a check or a dollar against gold Over the time any foreign currency has never protected its value The reason for PRODUCTS that is whenever the Central Bank is to issue money the money in our pockets lose value so we call it as inflation \x0cMONEYFESTO After years of inflation over indebted markets and financial regimes that were not regulated irresponsibly caused terrible problems (2008 Mortgage Crisis) This crisis at the same time has begun to be the beginning of a major financial evolution Crypto exchange was born The crypto Exchange is the idea of HAKKIMIZDA creating a new foreign exchange where the gold principles that are not dependent on inflation are valid and the supply and demand determine the value It has emerged as a reaction to the disruptions in the current financial system The usage of cryptomoney which arises as a reaction to the existing system without SERVICES removing the disruptions which caused this reaction is against the nature of Blockchain Technology reason for that is whenever the Central Bank is to issue money the money in our SERVICES pockets lose value so we call it as inflation Today the value of paper money is only the value of paper and ink It is called price money (nominal money) Namely the value on paper money is an existing value as only the government or PRODUCTS laws say so and it does not backed by any gold The value of money is equivalent to the reputation of states (political and military power) in the global economic system PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO Fiat currencies have failed as a store of value The US dollar has lost approximately 97% of its purchasing power in relation to gold in the nearly 50 years since the United States went off the gold standard in 1971 (LBMA 2018) The euro has lost over 75% of its value on a gold basis since the single European currency HAKKIMIZDA debuted in 1999 (LBMA 2018) No fiat currency has maintained its value against gold in the long run Partial Reserve System It is the only system that artificially allows for the loan deposit money loop among the banks and allows SERVICES for the more than one banks to grant loans (ie creating the money for jam) through the deposit money deposited to only one bank and that aims the savings stay within the closed SERVICES banking system instead of sliding into the real sector and with which you will never be arrested in the world in any way although you sell the thing to several customers The banks deposit unearned money by granting loans For instance a factory is built with this credit At that according to PRODUCTS the fact that a person who does not have money makes a factory to himself to whom that factory does belong to Does it belong to that person Does it belong to the Bank Does it belong to the PRODUCTS Nation Or does it belong to the State Whereas it is the state\ s reputation that determines the value of paper money \x0cMONEYFESTO How can the value of money be determined in an economic system where the authority to issue money cannot be determined A state that cannot issue its own money loses its authority by becoming indebted Whoever issues the money then it is the State HAKKIMIZDA The banking system plays a leading role in all economic crisis in the world When we look at the economic crisis of 1929 and the mortgage crisis of 2008 the main reason for the crisis is the financial bubbles that are formed in the markets SERVICES As the financial bubbles that grew on the basis of bank loans continued to swell from one side securities and securitized SERVICES products continued to rise to the extent that they find the new buyers that is to the extent the banks could grant new loans As the number of new buyers decreases due to the increase in prices the lending rate of the banks is also decreasing When the banks lose their lending ability the artificial system that allows PRODUCTS the credit wheel to spin is clogged and the financial crises are artificially revealed by the banks again PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO Let\ s explore the banking scam none of us have ever been taught anything about money the reason is to prevent us from learning the truth that money is a trick and money is a trap When solving any crime there\ s a universal truth follow the money but with the banking scam follow it backwards where does money come from HAKKIMIZDA The world\ s money supply is always growing where does all the new money keep coming from Money comes from privately controlled global banks like the Federal Reserve System They create money every day which increases the world\ s money supply Because all banks are either owned or controlled by SERVICES private bankers The real question is how do private bankers create new money And the answer is they create it out of thin air Bankers create money out of nothing they make it up it is a SERVICES fiction Godlike power to create something of value and nothing a stroke of a keyboard and money isn\ t is created in fact only 3% of the world\ s money is even in the form of bills and coins which means 97% of all money in the world is just numbers typed on a computer screen This is part one of the banking scam money is PRODUCTS created out of nothing PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO The second part of the scam is this phony money is issued as debt what is that exactly well when you consider We work our whole lives to pay it off you could say debt is slavery but who\ s debt is this phony Money It\ s our debt all of it it\ s our debt when we use credit cards We get student loans borrow money HAKKIMIZDA for mortgages all bank borrowing and it\ s our debt again when the government borrows which is each and every day In today\ s world money is debt and debt is money and don\ t forget the interest charges money equals debt and debt equals slavery therefore money equals slavery Our monetary system is a SERVICES carefully concealed system of slavery why Because our government can create the same money for free with no interest charges just like they used to as the founding fathers designed it SERVICES inside the States Constitution for our protection against private bankers The third part of the banking scam is very evil when bankers create money from nothing an issue of his debt they only create the principal portion of the debt They do not create the money PRODUCTS for the future interest payments there is not enough money in existence for all of us to make our interest payments Infact our money creation system is even mathematically impossible PRODUCTS money issued by the bank\ s principal that does not equal the money demanded back to the bank\ s principal plus interest \x0cMONEYFESTO We are forced to play a game of musical chairs to see who can make their debt repayments this guarantees a world of bankruptcy competition and scarcity of Money For example we go to the bank to borrow money for a house HAKKIMIZDA let\ s say a hundred thousand dollars the moment we sign the loan document the bank creates the money out of thin air A hundred thousand dollar debit gets registered for us and a hundred thousand dollars secured to credit for them then one of two things happens either SERVICES We give the bank 30 years of labor making house payments totaling three hundred thousand for the original one hundred SERVICES thousand we borrowed or the bank takes our house The bankers get either our labor for life or our house and often they get both all from money created out of thin air and issued as debt for money made out of nothing This is why all the bankers end up with all the assets PRODUCTS PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO The fourth part of the banking scam is inflation People think inflation is prices and costs increase A better answer might be the value of our money always goes down inflation is created every time the central Bank\ s print money which is every day where does all this new money get its value The answer is it HAKKIMIZDA steals its value from the existing money supply where our savings are Our savings are disappearing because of the new money they\ re printing If money creation was imbalanced with goods and services there would be no inflation Prices would stay the same but the reality is banks always print money driving prices SERVICES ever higher which steals the value of our savings making them disappear Since the private bankers created the Private Federal Reserve in 1913 the United States dollar has lost 97 cents in SERVICES purchasing power An item in 1913 that costs $100 in 2011 costs 2230 a price increase of 2130 percent This is the banking scam There is no money created for the future interest payments and inflation steals our savings every day in order for the banking scam to be pulled over our eyes the bankers need help from the PRODUCTS likes of paid for politicians and appointed civil servants Militaryindustrial complex mainstream media multinational corporations and the bankers good buddies PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO There is no money created for the future interest payments and inflation steals our savings every day in order for the banking scam to be pulled over our eyes the bankers need help from the likes of paid for politicians and appointed civil servants Militaryindustrial complex mainstream media multinational corporations HAKKIMIZDA and the bankers good buddiesFor example what do our banker controlled television networks say about criminal bankers Oh bankers are our saviors Chairman is Man of the Year He saved the World Bankers really do deserve their bonuses They\ re so smart and what do our banker own g20 politicians say ee need to SERVICES do That we must save our banking system and now we need austerity measures like increasing existing taxes and bringing in new taxes cutting our social programs including education and SERVICES health care stealing from our pension plans while increasing the retirement age Keeping us working for more years at lower wages while placing our children and grandchildren and debt and servitude for their future lives We are being lied to that we must go deeper in debt for bailouts stimulus packages PRODUCTS quantitative easing saving the too big to fail banks credit easing currency interventions all names that mean the same thing more debt to us PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO Is it not strange that the solution that too much debt is always more debt to us and where is all this money going it\ s going to the banks into the bankers they are stealing our money right now 1/10 of 1% of the world\ s population owns two thirds of the world\ s wealth this means that 99 99% of the world\ s population HAKKIMIZDA own less than a third of the wealth a decreasing amount because these guys are stealing it We desperately need to wake up to the banking scam it is time for change to retake control of our money system we must stop supporting the banking scam The Government should create all the currency and credit needed to SERVICES satisfy the spending power of government in the buying power of consumers money will cease to be mastered and will then become servant of humanity and the issuing power of money SERVICES should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs it\ s a pyramid scheme and we the people are the bottom layers of the banking pyramid Without our support the banking scam collapses We have to do it ourselves wake up get active wake others remove our money PRODUCTS from the bank Imagine that you have a printing press at home that can print money and there is a law that requires the money that you print to be accepted by every person and every business PRODUCTS in the country You could buy multi million dollar mansions the most expensive luxury cars top of the line clothes Rolex watches yachts private jets and the best of fine artwork all without limit and beyond your wildest dreams \x0cMONEYFESTO You could become a famous philanthropist creating programs to help the poor the unemployed and the elderly let that sink in for a minute and explain to me how you would go trillions of dollars into debt you wouldn\ t why would the thought borrowing money ever cross your mind HAKKIMIZDA If a group of prominent bankers came to you and said in spite of your good deeds popular opinion is building people fear the unregulated printing of money we are the country\ s top economists and if you give us your printing press we will give our official endorsement provide the illusion of constraint and gladly SERVICES lend you any amount of money that you want at a very low interest rate which by the way you never have to repay Really would you trust them But that is exactly what we have now the SERVICES government can print United States notes and spend them which was last done in 1963 but it cannot legally print Federal Reserve notes and spend them The Federal Reserve is a private corporation a governmentPRODUCTS sponsored enterprise and Federal Reserve notes are private corporate bank notes The Fed effectively owns the printing press and can print or otherwise create any amount of money totally PRODUCTS independent of any congressional approval or oversight and in order for the government to borrow more money for its budgetary con game it borrows the money from the Federal Reserve \x0cMONEYFESTO The Fed purchases government Treasury bills Treasury notes and Treasury bonds in exchange for its newly created money and then sells the securities on the open market at a huge profit and all of us are stuck with a perpetual interest payments through ever increasing taxes plus the hidden tax of inflation HAKKIMIZDA Printing United States notes and spending them without that is however not a good alternative it would still cause inflation which not only hides the real tax rate but also discourages saving and has a destabilizing effect on the economy In the beginning SERVICES the Federal Reserve actually had a positive stated objective to prevent runs on banks that got themselves in financial trouble and to even out the business cycle from that noble beginning SERVICES about 100 years ago the Fed morphed into the entity of absolute power that we have today To understand the process we need to look at banking before the Federal Reserve from the beginning a bank was considered a safe PRODUCTS place to keep one\ s money but there was one big difference the gold standard the government did not print money it minted gold and silver coins as the Constitution still requires by the way PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO The paper money that existed at the time was printed by each individual bank as a receipt a bank note for the gold and silver deposited with the bank customers were charged a small fee for a safe place to keep their Money These notes were easier to carry easier to hide and often exchanged for goods and services instead of the HAKKIMIZDA actual gold or silver The bank notes were considered just as valuable as the actual gold or silver because of bank success depended on its spotless reputation If somehow there was an occasion where everyone wanted to take their money out of the bank at the same time how could that possibly cause a problem for SERVICES depositors Well imagine that you were a banker back then hundreds of customers have gold in your vault also a loan broker you offered to split the interest received on any goal that customers SERVICESto lend with the interest rate determined by the make available supply of money made available and the demand for loans all as well but then you notice all of that gold just sitting idly in the vault day after day and then you get a brilliant idea if you lend jewels gold and don\ t tell him You get to keep all of the interest income PRODUCTS for yourself if Joe comes in for his gold you can use Paul\ s gold to cover it If you don\ t get too greedy you could actually get away with it couldn\ t you But there was one big problem that made PRODUCTS that very difficult the banker would lend the gold the borrower would spend it and whoever received the gold would likely put it back in the bank the banker would issue a fresh bank note for the newly received deposit \x0cMONEYFESTO But would have no way of knowing that this was the same goal that he had just lent With the compounding effect of several of these inflationary cycles the Baker would conclude that his business was expanding and that he could take more risk Also with this newly created money the town would experience an HAKKIMIZDA economic boom However all artificial booms eventually end and the resulting downturn in the economy would make people nervous and want the security of real gold often triggering a run on the bank With banknotes issued while an excessive deposits the bank would fail and many people would lose all of their SERVICES Money Instead of passing laws against the misappropriation of SERVICES depositors funds and the making of fraudulent loans the individual state governments completely ignoring the compounding effect passed laws to regulate the process by enforcing a reserve requirement a percentage of the deposits that could not be lent But because of either incompetence or PRODUCTS corruption the reserve requirement averaged a very low 15% This is the origin of the fractional reserve system legalized fraud PRODUCTS which is the foundation of our present banking system As a result there were many boom and bust cycles accompanied by bank failures that were falsely blamed on the business cycle \x0cMONEYFESTO The Federal Reserve to the rescue to put an end to bank failures The Fed was given the power to create money and make loans to banks to make up for the shortfall if too many customers wanted to withdraw their money at the same time They called it providing liquidity since the Federal Reserve was considered part HAKKIMIZDA of the United States government runs on the banks were prevented by giving depositors a false sense of security in the banking system Both the Federal Reserve Act and by no coincidence in my opinion the sixteenth amendment were passed in the seen year 1913 The Federal Reserve Act SERVICES established a central bank to make loans not only to banks but especially to the federal government and the sixteenth amendment authorizing a federal income tax provided the SERVICES collateral for those government loans The Full Faith and Credit of the US taxpayer and forced by the absolute power of the IRS guarantee the loans However with the gold standard the amount of banknotes circulating in excess of the gold deposits could only go so far if the reserve requirement was 15% the amount of PRODUCTS banknotes could only increase to about six times the amount of gold deposited the bankers profits and the resulting inflation would end PRODUCTS \x0cMONEYFESTO This is an absolute mathematical limit unless the gold standard could be eliminated With the availability of money and interest rates under the complete control of the Federal Reserve immediately in 1914 the roller coaster ride got underway Government borrowing from the Fed starting in 1914 to finance HAKKIMIZDA World War one increased the money supply 70% causing inflation In early 1920 the discount interest rate was raised from one point two five percent to six percent to fight the inflation The money supply went down only eleven percent but unemployment increased to 20 percent SERVICES In 1924 the discount interest rate was lowered from six percent to 3 percent to fight the unemployment this along with an easy money policy caused the Roaring Twenties stock market boom SERVICES people would buy stocks the value of the stocks would increase they would present the stocks as collateral then the bankers would loan them more money to buy more stocks and repeat the process The money supply increased 60% and the unemployment rate went down to 5% In 1928 to fight the PRODUCTS inflationary boom the discount rate was increased from 3% to 5% followed by tight money policies in 1929 that led to the October 29 1929 stock market crash the money supply decreased 35% PRODUCTS and unemployment increased to 24% \x0cMONEYFESTO The resulting Great Depression made possible the New Deal entitlement expansion of government and permanently changed its charter from very limited to totally unlimited How about that for stabilizing the business cycle the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve were the top bankers of the time were they that HAKKIMIZDA incompetent they failed miserably or did they There was one huge gain for the Federal Reserve that I would like to point out at the bottom of the Great Depression in 1934 gold was made illegal for the public to own I fail to understand the rationale but a law was passed requiring people to take their SERVICES gold coins to the bank and exchange them for Federal Reserve notes People were confused and desperate enough to comply SERVICES The Federal Reserve a private corporation took possession of virtually all of the gold in circulation in the United States at that time this fact is briefly mentioned in history books but it is not reported that it was and still is the biggest gold heist in the history of the human race and it was the first big step in PRODUCTS completely eliminating the gold standard Where is the gold now Well we may never know when the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913 the law made the Fed exempt from federal PRODUCTS state and local taxes in spite of an enormous profit potential and also exempt from audit Are you getting the sense that there was some chicanery involved here \x0cMONEYFESTO In 1974 President Nixon ended the gold standard and the rest of the world soon followed without a gold backed currency the Fed and central banks in every other country in the world could create any amount of money without limit reducing the value of the currency for everyone in the process HAKKIMIZDA Also with a new deal entitlement policy and income tax and no real debt limit the federal government was able to grow to an unimaginable level destroying the middle class increasing poverty and homelessness Regulating almost every aspect of human SERVICES action eliminating the right to privacy flexing its military muscle creating enemies all over the world and obligating children to more than a fifty thousand dollar debt as soon as they are born SERVICES rendering the Pledge of Allegiance totally obscene In addition with an unlimited amount of money made available for loans and with saving steadily devalued by inflation one who wants to save money to buy a house car or industrial equipment PRODUCTS as used to be the norm is now at a total disadvantage compared to one who borrows the money and makes the payments The entire economy runs on debt people are given the illusion of PRODUCTS ownership of high ticket items only if the banker makes the loan and gets his cut and due to the long term effects of inflation saving for retirement is only possible by investing the money \x0cMONEYFESTO That gets us to the absurd economy that we have now the Federal Reserve effectively owns the printing press prints money and makes a huge tax free profit for every dollar that they print which includes the 17 trillion dollars in national debt Interest on all of the money lent since 1913 plus all of the other money HAKKIMIZDA created and lent into circulation here and all over the World Without an independent audit the exact total can only be estimated to be at least 30 trillion dollars That is 300 billion dollars per year on the average each year for past 100 years with that level of pilfering the loss of high volume manufacturing jobs SERVICES multiple boom and bust cycles high public and private debt high taxes high inflation and a balance of trade deficit for the past 40 years no economy could be expected to do well It\ s a miracle SERVICES that it has made it this far without total collapse the middle class has been completely destroyed up to 1972 the income distribution was a bell curve a natural distribution showing a strong middle class with a minority of poor and few rich but slowly since then the middle classes disappeared the income PRODUCTS distribution even in 2005 at the peak of the real estate boom before the 2008 crash is nothing like a bell curve it shows more households at or near the poverty level than any other income PRODUCTS level \x0cMONEYFESTO Homelessness once rare is now commonplace with government spending dominating the economy the connected minority get richer with government jobs government contracts or government bailouts while the middle class is being pushed closer and closer to the poverty level HAKKIMIZDA The Empire of the United States was conquered without a shot being fired and is still being vigorously plundered At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected I answer if it ever reach us it must spring up among us it cannot come from abroad SERVICES if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher as a nation of free men we must live through all time or die by suicide How do we die by suicide as a nation are we all SERVICES that apathetic unaware well it is difficult to be otherwise with the entitlement culture is so well established and with the media bombarding us with headline rhetoric and misdirection this is the richest country in the world this is a democracy your vote counts support our troops who fight the unending battles for your PRODUCTS freedom every other country is worse off if you just work harder you can still achieve the American dream cuts in social programs would spell disaster income equality tax the rich the problem is PRODUCTS corporate greed Automation illegal immigration the minimum wage the Chinese the Republicans the Democrats \x0cMONEYFESTO the Tea Party the media is biased and has control of the narrative but the Internet can counter the popular media to put an end to this insidious form of economic enslavement here and in virtually every other country in the world the artificial economy of the central bankers by the central bankers and for the central bankers HAKKIMIZDA must be replaced by a natural economy since the central bankers have acquired most of the gold this must be done without gold or gold backing and can actually be done without backing by any commodity and without totally disrupting the present banking system It is only possible to create economic value in a real sense SERVICES by completing the cycle of the capital within the production process Beyond that the expansion arises in the circulation area is compelled to burst like a balloon to the extent it is not realized SERVICES by being re included in the production process and remains within the wicked circle of loan deposit money The period in which we live is essentially a period of depreciation or of returning to the real value It will be impossible PRODUCTS for the banking system to create new bank money and since the banks cannot create money for the jam they will not be able to grant loans in an uncontrolled manner and the formation of new PRODUCTS financial bubbles will be prevented \x0cMONEYFESTO As the banks will not be able to make money for the jam they will shoulder the real sector instead of earning money at the expense of the real sector and the country\ s economy will gain value added and production based vitality Since fiduciary money is not created interest and inflationary pressures will not be the HAKKIMIZDA subject and the liquidity risk will be automatically eliminated Banks should be the institutions which do not grant loans against interest to the institutions through the money that created for the jam become partners to that institution against the fund that SERVICES they provided through their own resources and should distribute the profit that they obtained from this to the depositors by supporting the real sector Like so they will direct the investors SERVICES whom they regarded as the shareholders in this respect to favourable investments and will serve the real and reliable growth of the economy The bank will be involved in the money generation process by PRODUCTS acting as an entrepreneur In addition to providing funding banks should also choose a strategic sector in which they will operate as they will exhibit entrepreneurial behaviour and they PRODUCTS should only meet funding requirements from that sector Thus the banks will also specialize in the sectors they have chosen and they will reduce the time cost by managing the partnership \x0cMONEYFESTO In addition to the economic support they provide to the business they partnered they enable the presence and development of the business by providing consultancy through their expert personnel on the subjects of R&D advertisement public relations technology marketing and sales HAKKIMIZDA Buy gold and silver coins get out of debt rip up your credit cards these actions will bring down the banking scam only vote for politicians to support debt free money or run for office yourself and turn off mainstream media to search for the truth while you SERVICES still can and support every effort to end the Reserve System and all the privately owned central banks Let\ s bring these criminals to justice to get our money and our countries back SERVICES PRODUCTS PRODUCTS \x0cADVANTAGES OF BLOCKCHAIN AT BANKING SYSTEM Banking system is inefficient in its current state as it requires the use of multiple third party verifications and transferring services in order to complete a transaction Blockchain can alleviate the need for these organizations and provide the world with a viable solution to the inherent problems facing the banking community HAKKIMIZDA Blockchain is transforming the way in which we conduct business globally by offering us the ability to perform transactions securely in a peer to peer manner without the need of any middleman The current state of the global banking system is shabby at best SERVICES We\xe2\x80\x99ve already witnessed multiple government bailouts to date and it is exactly this type of pompous behavior that spawned the birth of cryptocurrencies nine years prior Satoshi the unknown SERVICES creator of Bitcoin was even kind enough to let us know that this was his motivation by leaving a reference to the bailout headlines from the London Times embedded in BTC\xe2\x80\x99s genesis block \xe2\x80\x93 The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks To understand the advantages that blockchain has over the PRODUCTS current banking system you need to understand the history of banking Banks evolved out of the need to securely store gold The first \xe2\x80\x9cbanker\xe2\x80\x9d was nothing more than a gold depository for PRODUCTS wealthy people Individuals would drop off their gold and the banker would then issue them a receipt that could be used to purchase items around town \x0cADVANTAGES OF BLOCKCHAIN AT BANKING SYSTEM Eventually the banker realized that the people never all came for their gold at the same time and so he decided to start lending out other people\xe2\x80\x99s gold at a slight mark up or interest rate The people eventually became suspicious of the banker\xe2\x80\x99s quickly expanding wealth and one night the banker was cornered by a HAKKIMIZDA furious crowd who accused him of spending their gold They forced the banker to take them to his vault and show them that he had everyone\xe2\x80\x99s gold He gladly obliged as he not only had all of their gold but he now had the interest he made in profit as well After realizing what the banker had done the wealthy SERVICES individuals demanded in on the action This is why banks now have to pay you a small interest on your holdings as well SERVICES Not much has changed since then in regards to the purpose of banks It\xe2\x80\x99s still a third party organization looking to make a profit off of holding your funds Today none of these steps are necessary thanks to blockchain technology Technology has advanced and it is time for our banking systems to do the PRODUCTS same The world cannot continue to bail out fraudulent bankers or run on a fiat based financial system Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a moment to see how blockchain technology could eliminate much of these PRODUCTS banking problems in the coming years \x0cADVANTAGES OF BLOCKCHAIN AT BANKING SYSTEM The words peer to peer has no use in the current central banking system that relies on a combination of verifications and monitoring platforms to ensure your funds are sent Every time you swipe your debit card there are around thirty separate thirdparty organizations that must coordinate to complete your HAKKIMIZDA transaction Your bank must first check your balance verify that it is you actually spending the funds notify the account where the funds are going to ensure it is correct interact with the merchant processing firms involved interact with VISA or MC and the list SERVICES goes on This is why you can spend your debit card funds quickly but any refunds can take a week or longer to be processed SERVICES eliminate this need for third party verification Cryptocurrencies The transparent nature of blockchain technology makes it perfectly suited for financial services An individual can check any wallet on the blockchain to ensure funds are present and once they are sent they go directly to the other individual involved in the transaction PRODUCTS Have you ever tried to send a large amount of money PRODUCTSIt is a nightmare that can take days to complete internationally depending on the amount you decide to send During this layover your funds are inaccessible to both you and the other party involved in the transaction It is common to wait over a week for a large transaction to complete \x0cADVANTAGES OF BLOCKCHAIN AT BANKING SYSTEM Blockchain technology eliminates the need to wait and regardless of the amount of crypto you are sending the transfer time is the same This is a huge advantage that crypto has over the current banking system Imagine that you are a large international company that must send millions of dollars in capital HAKKIMIZDA internationally Blockchain technology would allow you to accomplish this task with unmatched simplicity There would be no additional delays and the funds would be more secure than any other form of money transference currently SERVICES available You also avoid any losses from converting your funds between countries Records stored on a blockchain are immutable and easily traceable SERVICES Nobody can hack this data and it is easy to search for a single transaction Integrating a blockchain based system would allow banks to quickly handle common issues such as identity theft or
