smartphone users in the world and nearly all of them use text messages to communicate with each other All phones come pre installed with an SMS service but most people nowadays install an instant messaging app the moment they purchase a new phone These apps are now a smartphone staple and instant messaging apps are one of the factors directly responsible for helping the smartphone become popular in such a short time They directly increase the utility of smartphones exponentially by enabling instant communication for free all around the world Instant messaging apps are highly scalable Early implementations were built for use on computers more than 60 years ago and offered only individual peer to peer communication Messaging capabilities have since been expanded to multiple platforms and now offer a means of communication not only for individuals but also for groups organizations and workplaces The Rise of Messaging Communities Messaging platforms that can exchange real time information are a natural venue for people to congregate in online communities Such communities offer people a way to share opinions and information pertaining to specific topics of interest such as hobbies or professional groups This tendency to attract congregations has made it easier for messaging apps to retain users and has also caused certain apps to absorb large portions of the market There are many forms of messaging communities that we can visit online A variety of platforms ranging from independently operated websites and blogs to a wide range of social media and video platforms are all commonly used every day across the world These platforms are now maturing with some apps such as Facebook expanding their services to encompass many aspects of the community messaging ecosystem while other platforms such as Steemit explore innovative ways to increase the value proposition of specific community types These new interactive communities have exploded in popularity across the internet Such group conversations are extremely accessible and easy to create allowing all participants to communicate in real time In fact Facebook Messenger has more than 2 5 million new group conversations every single day and Telegram Messenger has millions of community group conversations with more than 30 000 people In addition the number of views generated by the 80 million users who participate in Telegram group conversations is 30 billion per month Interactive communities are propelling the popularity of messaging apps past even that of existing social media services according to data from a Bi Intelligence report (as shown in Figure 1) Interactive communities are offering new forms of social interaction that are proving to be the new standard for online

and SNS ] A Breakdown of Interactive Messaging Communities The stakeholders of most messaging communities can be broken down into four categories 1 Admins manage and moderate the community 2 Content producers directly add value to the community by creating topics for discussion Examples may include videos polls images memes or even just stories they type up and post 3 Content consumers are the people who do not post a new content but like to comment and share content they view online They are just as invaluable as the content producers as they are the ones that keep the community buzzing with discussion 4 Advertisers are content producers who specifically target all of the above people with the goal of advertising a product or service usually for profit While these communities can be targeted toward a wide range of topics communities that require immediate information sharing tend to be the most active Blockchain communities are common on instant messaging apps as well as groups geared toward popular discussion topics such as cryptocurrency databases job hunting and stock trading information The interactive community model is still in its early years However because these communities evolved in an environment that was designed for the purpose of P2P communication existing platforms are not ideal for fostering large healthy communities that create and consume content on a regular basis There are a number of problems that need to be addressed before interactive communities can truly come into their own and flourish Text Message Instant Messenger Community Messenger

Rights Reserved 4 \x0c1 2 Problem The following problems are inherent across the instant messaging industry Difficulty to Grow and Maintain Community While creating a group chat is easy growing it into a larger community is not a simple task Furthermore community members will not remain in the group chat if there is no reason to congregate This problem persists even in communities where the central purpose is sharing of information for the simple reason that the vast majority of community members have a tendency to be passive Due to the passive nature of most participants attracting new members and keeping community users happily engaged tends to become a job for the admin For a community with tens of thousands of participants the job consumes a tremendous amount of time and capital Difficulty in Delivering Important Information A common problem with most interactive communities is an overabundance of information Participants are constantly shown fresh new information which continuously floods out This can become problematic when useful content become lost in a sea of messages In messaging groups where information is delivered via push notification members are forced to either receive every message regardless of their interest in it or to turn off push notifications entirely The vast majority of users opt for the latter option to save their time and energy thus rendering one of the most important functions of the messaging app obsolete Modern messaging apps are inconvenient for their customers and it is a critical issue that must be resolved Restriction of the Business Model One of the important factors that distinguishes a simple group chat room from an interactive community is the revenue model An interactive community with tens of thousands of people gathered for specific purposes is an attractive space for marketing However the revenue model of currently existing messaging apps is very traditional Advertisers must be sought out externally or individually proposition channel admin themselves The process is cumbersome and there are no quantitative indicators of marketing effectiveness leading to unsatisfactory results for all stakeholders These inherent limitations directly affect the ability of a community to become fully interactive Often times such advertising can actually benefit the community members by displaying information that would serve interest to them Disclaimer Information provided is not for general distribution but is provided to give general knowledge to those interested in NESTREE This is not an offer invitation or

searched by Nestree users the more exposure it will have on the Channel menu and the more users it will connect with Nestree uses algorithms to recommend attractive channels to users through algorithms Channel recommendation algorithms operate based on a variable called \xe2\x80\x98Channel Power\xe2\x80\x99 with each channel having a quantitative amount of Channel Power Channel Power is measured by 1) the number of participants on the channel 2) participant activity level 3) the channel\xe2\x80\x99s compensation policy and 4) the channel\xe2\x80\x99s wallet reserves When browsing through the Discover menu users will see channels with higher Channel Power towards the top of the channel list This brings more exposure to the channels that work the hardest to add value to the Nestree platform as a whole User Activity Rewards The more channel participants talk the higher the score High score when channel Reward is On Users CHANNEL POWER The more participants in the channel the higher the score Channel Wallet The more assets reward for the higher the score [ Figure 8 Measuring CHANNEL POWER ] User Behavior Rewards Blockchain technology is typically implemented with the philosophy of providing incentives to ecosystem members Cryptocurrency which prevailed specifically due to blockchain technology is a distinct example of this with users being directly rewarded for their contributions to the network Nestree offers a variety of ways for participants to be provided with compensation for their contributions to the community In order to make this compensation function efficiently a multi purpose utility token EGG is used EGG is an ERC 20 utility token supplied as a reward in the following three ways to contribute to the growth and vitalization of the community Disclaimer Information provided is not for general distribution but is provided to give general knowledge to those interested in NESTREE This is not an offer invitation or a recommendation

growth by offering EGG as a reward to community members who successfully invite others to join the channel Every participant in this referral program receives a unique invitation link If outsiders follow an invitation link and join the community a smart contract will immediately trigger an EGG reward for the community member who referred them Their rewards will be deposited in their Nestree cryptocurrency wallet and can be freely sold on an exchange or traded between users The channel admin deposits EGG reward into the channel wallet and sets the compensation amount Compensation payment is distributed by a smart contract and is transparently visible All processes are handled automatically Channel Reward Reward Admin Reward Joined User User Invite Invite Invite [ Figure 9 Invitation Reward ] \xe2\x91\xa1 Contents Reward Content compensation is a reward paid by the admin to content producers Unlike simple group chatrooms a community consists of participants who produce content and other members who consume content Currently existing communities on traditional messaging apps have no reward for content producers so most members become too passive to produce or deliver quality content However by paying compensation for the production of content motivated participants provide quality content to the channel The information or content shared by the participants can be \xe2\x80\x98liked\xe2\x80\x99 by other community members and if the post meets a set number of likes the channel operator pays out EGG to the corresponding participants This creates a virtuous cycle of enthusiastic content uploaders big rewards excited participants and a quality channel where participants naturally want to stay engaged and invite friends Disclaimer Information provided is not for general distribution but is provided to give general knowledge to those interested in NESTREE This is not an offer invitation or a recommendation of an investment nor purchase of the product It is a

this document 2019 \xc2\xa9 NESTREE All Rights Reserved 11 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa2 Random Reward Nestree also has a unique system that allows a channel operator to offer rewards on the channel any time they choose This might take the form of a game prize or a reward for participating in a poll for example Community members who participate are rewarded an EGG on a first come first serve basis This compensates people for paying attention and staying active on the channel further fostering a vibrant interactive community It raises the expectation that the operator may issue a special reward without notice creating an audience more receptive to the messages content producers create Invitation Reward Contents Reward Random Reward Invite Growth Chat & Like Activate First come Delivery [ Figure 10 Reward acquisition method and expected value ] 3 1 2 Commuinty Operation As a channel grows and becomes active the volume of messages posted in the channel will increase dramatically Flooded message feeds reduce a channel\ s ability to transmit information effectively Therefore it is important to have a feature for a large number of people to exchange information and communicate without being exposed to information overkill Push Notification Filtering Nestree includes a feature that allows channel participants to selectively see only the messages they need In interactive communities with thousands or tens of thousands of participants it is common for users to disable push notifications This causes participants to frequently miss out on important information or content When browsing an interactive community the most important messages everybody needs to see are announcements from the channel operator and messages from their friends The next most important kind of messages is the content posted by regularly contributing members of the community With this in mind Nestree provides the following options for each channel that enable users to receive push notifications efficiently \xe2\x9c\x94 Notifications of admin messages \xe2\x9c\x94 Notifications of friends\xe2\x80\x99 messages \xe2\x9c\x94 Receive notifications from a specific users message \xe2\x9c\x94 Do not accept notification from specific users message Disclaimer Information provided is not for general distribution but is provided to give general knowledge to those interested in

Admins often find it difficult to make important announcements in channels with a large number of participants There is simply too much conversation going on to get everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention at the same time and announcements tend to get lost in overflowing chat windows This is especially true when conflicts arise online as important information is lost in a long line of messages To address this problem we\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented a special mode called \xe2\x80\x98Admin Exclusive Chat\xe2\x80\x99 in which operators can enable to cease chat messages from all members except admins for a specified period of time This allows admins to deliver information effectively and can also be used to calm down a heated community quickly and easily In addition to this to encourage community participants to ask questions and make suggestions they may message admins directly in private conversations While only group conversations are allowed in channels one on one Chat with channel operators is always possible This allows channel participants to interact with the moderator to resolve questions and be more active in the community [ Figure 11 Admin Chat ] Multi Notice Board Operators also need a way to post permanent or long term announcements for all community members to read Important information needs to be shared in nearly every community but it is also important to keep track of past announcements Existing messaging services are usually only able to register one message at a time as a permanent notice often forcing operators to string a series of announcements into one long block This makes it hard for community members to understand what contents have been added or changed Nestree allows an operator to register and manage multiple announcements within a channel Especially in a channel with a large number of people this can significantly enhance information transfer Participants can instantly see what was added when a new bulletin is registered In the future the multi notification system will expand to not only display announcements in the operator\ s \xe2\x80\x9cbulletin board\xe2\x80\x9d space but also in a space where static content can be displayed to the participants directly [ Figure 12 Multi Notice ] Disclaimer Information provided is not for general distribution but is provided to give general knowledge to those interested in

Model Targeted Marketing Nestree channels are community spaces dedicated to specific topics and goals where users can interact Advertisers can use the targeted marketing functions to search for and select appropriate channels for the execution of their ads It is easy to sort through channels according to a number of criteria such as community size purpose and other channel characteristics and deal with channel operators and EGG Tokens effectively Advertisers can expose their ads to large numbers of people in real time They can maximize the effectiveness of their ad placements by being able to communicate directly with channel operators Admins choose which ads to display on their channels ensuring that advertisements remain as relevant as possible to the goals of each community Advertisement Reward Nestree enables channel operators and participants to share the EGG rewards paid by advertisers in exchange for advertising space on the channel Participants in traditional messaging platforms generally do not want advertisements to be posted within the channel However if the reward is shared community members would be much more likely to accept (and even want) ads Participants will be happy to watch the ads they voluntarily choose to watch \xe2\x80\x94 this is a verified user behavior in similar apps Rewards are distributed to channel participants via a smart contract and as a result it is transparent which users have watched the ad This allows advertisers to clearly see users\xe2\x80\x99 ad views and clicks which helps them to plan their future ad campaigns based on audience data Channel Watch AD Register AD Reward Advertiser Admin AD Reward User [ Figure 13 AD Reward Structure ] Disclaimer Information provided is not for general distribution

\xc2\xa9 NESTREE All Rights Reserved 14 \x0cChannel Subscription A channel subscription is a feature that allows an operator to charge a fee for access to their channel The latest information or content shared in real time on a messaging app can sometimes have a high monetary value In the existing messenger market there are already a large number of group chat rooms that are operated for a fee However because other messaging services do not have their own payment methods in the app channel operators spend a considerable amount of time and money monetizing their group chat rooms and managing paid members On the other hand Nestree can simply set up channel admission fees using EGG Only users who have paid the fee can enter the channel as participants In addition operators can set a subscription fee rather than an admission fee so that a paid subscriber must pay the fee on a recurring basis in order to maintain their rights to visit the channel For example an operator may charge a subscription fee of 10 EGG per month for access to their exclusive content Channel subscriptions enhance the overall community of the messenger ecosystem as channel operators are motivated to monetize their channels by providing quality content on a regular basis Channel operators could use Nestree to earn revenue for 1 1 legal counsel or technical advice for example It is possible to leverage channel subscription functionality in a variety of creative ways 3 2 Other Features P2P Trade Nestree users can trade cryptocurrency with the app\xe2\x80\x99s cryptocurrency wallet To initiate the transfer the user proposes a transaction for an amount of currency of their choosing Upon the other party\ s approval the requested transaction is completed Transactions are carried out on the blockchain via the Nestree secure P2P trading system Smart contracts ensure every trade is safe cryptographic passwords that have been requested for the transaction are returned if the transaction fails due to any reason Users can trade with confidence without risking vulnerability upon transaction failure Transactions of large volumes are difficult to trade on exchanges but are suitable for P2P trading * This function is in the process of reviewing the law on anti money laundering and identity verification In accordance with international law \xe2\x91\xa0 Select Asset

fees than standard because the only fee required is the one set by the sellers This enables Nestree markets to be more competitive than traditional marketplaces which have a lot of overhead fees they need to cover Sellers can also communicate instantly with buyers via group chat or one on one chat within the channel Real time feedback in commerce can provide great satisfaction for both parties which can further drive sales 3 3 Value Proposition Nestree is a service that targets \xe2\x91\xa0 content consumers \xe2\x91\xa1 content producers \xe2\x91\xa2 channel operators and \xe2\x91\xa3

whitepaper are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions there are risks uncertainties assumptions and other factors which could cause NESTREE\xe2\x80\x99s actual results performances achievements and/or experiences to differ materially from the expectations expressed implied or perceived in forward looking statements RISK FACTORS Before deciding to purchase and participate in EGG we recommend that you read the following carefully and thoroughly analyze and understand the factors and risks involved Risks include but are not limited to the followings Digital tokens are being closely scrutinized by various regulatory bodies around the world including by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission There is a substantial risk that in numerous jurisdictions including the United States EGG may be deemed to be a security Therefore applicable securities laws may limit the ability to hold more than certain amounts of EGG restrict the ability to transfer EGG require disclosure or other conditions on you in connection with any sale of EGG and may restrict the businesses that facilitate exchanges or effect transfers of your EGG You may lose EGG if you lose your private key to your digital wallet If a private key is lost destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible the Purchaser will not be able to access the blockchain asset associated with the corresponding address and NESTREE will not be capable of restoring the private key Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development and its application is experimental in nature This carries significant operational technological regulatory reputational and financial risks Smart contracts may not be fit for the purpose intended by the NESTREE and may contain flaws vulnerabilities or other issues which may cause technical problems or the complete loss of EGG It is possible that upon a NESTREE launch NESTREE and EGG will not be used by a large number of individuals businesses and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of its functionalities Furthermore NESTREE may never become operational These or other unforeseen factors may significantly decrease or eliminate any value of EGG NESTREE anticipates that NESTREE will receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other sensitive data In the event of a security breach unauthorized access or an act of cyberterrorism there is a risk of disclosure of personal information Although NESTREE plans to implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to its database such measures will not guarantee that such events will not occur In such a case NESTREE may be adversely affected by the damages incurred by NESTREE and the loss of reputation of NESTREE and EGG Blockchain technologies have been the subject of intense scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world Depending on the existence and nature of regulatory action on the blockchain industry companies like NESTREE may be substantially affected directly or indirectly by such actions NESTREE makes efforts to comply with such government action to the extent required by law Nevertheless NESTREE may be adversely impacted by such regulatory actions The application of these regulatory regimes to EGG is unclear but if such regulations apply to EGG NESTREE will need to expend time and resources to comply with them or face adverse regulatory action \x0c
