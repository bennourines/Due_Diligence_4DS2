decentralized gaming PvP platform which allows players to earn real money on their achievements IQeon represents an infrastructure that will allow the integration of games applications and services based on intelligent competitions between users as well as applications and services for motivation The name \xe2\x80\x9cIQeon\xe2\x80\x9d is not chosen by chance and is a combination of two concepts Part of the name \xe2\x80\x9cIQ\xe2\x80\x9d implies a common abbreviation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cintelligence quotient \xe2\x80\x9d Part of the name Eon is a concept from ancient Greek philosophy meaning epoch eternity generation These two concepts re\xef\xac\x82ect the worldview of the project which in the modern era of innovation actually has human intelligence as a driver that guides the progress of humankind IQeon is the \xef\xac\x81rst platform where players can earn money thanks to their intelligence and achievements This will be realized by using the internal currency in the IQeon ecosystem which at any time can be converted to the crypto currency \xe2\x80\x93 IQeon tokens (IQN) issued based on Ethereum blockchain IQeon tokens (IQN) can be freely exchanged at existing cryptocurrency exchanges or to \xef\xac\x81at money Purposes of the project further development of IQeon platform creation of IQeon ecosystem formation of the audience of engaged platform applications and games users formation of partnerships with game developers and game content for the platform development of a line of IQ Clash proper games based on the platform 3 \x0c1 Growth of the game industry 1 1 Mobile games and applications global market Rapid growth in the number of mobile devices inevitably leads to increase in the number of mobile applications and games users According to the Newzoo 2017 Global Mobile Market Report as at the beginning of 2017 the number of smartphone users exceeds 2 3 billion or 31% of the worlds total population By 2020 this figure will reach 3 6 billon Mobile games market is the largest segment of the global gaming market and by the beginning of 2017 it amounted to 42% ($ 45 7 billion) and by 2020 the share of mobile applications and games will grow to 50 % and in monetary terms will amount to $ 62 3 billion 4 \x0c1 2 Features of mobile intelligent games market According to GameAnalytics study in the field of mobile games and applications classic games card games social casinos puzzles and word games show the highest retention While quizzes show the highest 1st day retention leaders of the 7th day retention are board games card games social casinos puzzles and word games Leaders in the engagement board games card games social casinos puzzles and word games The concept of the platform `s games also correspond to such genres as \xe2\x80\x9ccasual \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csports \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c arcade \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ceducational \xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c multiplayer \xe2\x80\x9d The number of downloads is not a determining indicator when monetizing applications The number of active users is much more important (we will consider the user retention parameters for 1 day 7 days 28 days session duration and user engagement) Day 1 Retention This metric reflects the percentage of users who entered the game the day after the first session The 1st day retention rate is considered excellent if it is 40% or more The median day 1 retention is about 25 % Within each genre the 1st day retention range varies greatly The best median retention of the 1st day in the market is shown by word games almost reaching 35% However top retention rates for day 1 are held by quizzes (Trivia) For the best games of this genre 1st day retention can reach up to 48% 5 \x0cDay 7 Retention This metric reflects the percentage of users who returned to the game a week after the first game session According to GameAnalytics statistics 14% are considered to be a good indicator of day 7 retention The median retention value of day 7 is 5% Projects of few genres fall into the retention range of 15 25 % on the 7th day They are board titles (Board) cards (Card) social casinos ( Casino) puzzles ( Puzzle) strategies (Strategy) quizzes and word games Retention of the 7th day at 10% is not achieved by even top games in the genre of racing (Racing) and music (Music) 6 \x0cDay 28 Retention This metric reflects the percentage of users who returned to the game a month after the first game session Only in 15% of games this figure is 5 6% At the same time a fall is observed in 2019 Analysts attribute this to the fact that players began to leave games earlier The median value of retention on the 28th day is between 1 1 5% Games of most genres cannot overcome the bar of 10% However top games in such categories as board card games casino puzzle and word projects are capable of this At the same time Game Analytics notes that for games with 6% or more retention on the 28th day usually business is going good 7 \x0cAverage Session Length Analysts understand this metric as the time from the launch of the application to the moment when it is sent to the background Important a short game session is not necessarily bad and a large one on the contrary is not necessarily good But under the same conditions (genre visual style mechanics used) the high duration of the game session indicates the fascination of the game Only 15% of projects on the market have an average session of 11 12 minutes And it falls from month to month Back in June 2018 this parameter was about 14 minutes The median value of the average game session is 5 5 5 minutes And it also falls Among all genres only two differ in session duration card games and casinos In the top games of these genres users spend an average of 25 35 minutes Multiplayer games also show good performance In general they have the highest median among all genres 10 minutes and for top games the average session duration reaches 22 23 minutes 8 \x0cEngagement (Stickiness) The metric reflects the number of users who play each day during the month Calculated by dividing DAU by MAU and multiplying by 100% The engagement of the top 15% of games in the market is about 19% GameAnalytics notes that if the game has a stickiness of 18% \xe2\x80\x94 this is very good The median stickiness value on the market is about 8% The best involvement in the market is shown by casino games The median average engagement rate in this genre is above 20 % The top games of this segment can reach almost 30 % engagement Card games also show a very good stickiness it ranges from 8% to 28% 9 \x0cARPPU ARPPU is the average revenue from a paying user In this study GameAnalytics only accounted for direct payments in games Advertising revenue was not taken into account The top 15% of games has ARPPU around $20 However this metric varies greatly among the leading projects depending on the season It falls by the Christmas season and then rebounds till the third quarter inclusively This is easily explained during holidays the paying audience increases New users can on average pay much less than the main paying audience of the game The biggest ARPPU is in action games strategies and role playing games (RPG) They have it at $ 27 31 While the best median value for multiplayer games is around $15 10 \x0c2 The problems of mobile games market 2 1 Solutions with the help of which you can get real money while playing games are not widely used on the market According to data for December 2017 97% of gamers do not have the ability to monetize their achievements in the gameplay The remaining 3% attempt monetization in the following ways specialized services and auctions (20%) thematic forums (12%) direct agreements between players (8%) illegal exchanges (3%) The remaining 57% of attempts to monetize cannot succeed because of account being blocked by developers or because of fraud which leads to the loss of all virtual achievements IQeon solves this problem by using its own internal currency When transferred to the personal account of the platform user the earned currency is exchanged for IQN tokens which can then be freely exchanged for available digital assets and means of payment on exchange services 2 2 The market practically does not have any solutions that allow organizing PvP competitions with fixing conditions and automatic payment of gain to the winner Game scenarios of IQeon platform applications allow players to enter into a dispute staking the internal currency on a certain achievement or event The system will automatically pay the reward to the winner 11 \x0c2 3 The authors of content for games do not have the ability to monetize their groundworks without serious investments in the development of technology solutions for example mobile applications An application constructor based on the IQeon platform SDK will be implemented With its help game content developers will be able to create new applications based on existing scenarios and game mechanics with minimal effort 2 4 Receiving payments in mobile games and applications through the App Store and Google Play is associated with large commissions (30%) The total commission for exchanging IQN tokens for other available digital assets and means of payment will not exceed 10% 2 5 The developers receive one time earning for in game purchases IQeon platform allows the developer to get income from each stake The platform uses the following system of charges and rewards players who want to make a stake or \xe2\x80\x9cfight\xe2\x80\x9d in one of the games place equal stakes ( for example 50 IQN ) The overall amount of stakes makes 100 IQN 88 % of which comprises the stakes pool that the winner will receive and 12% (12 IQN) is the platform\xe2\x80\x99s fee 50% of the platform\xe2\x80\x99s fee (6 IQN) is paid to the developer as a reward 2 6 Bonuses and game points received in one game cannot be used in other games IQeon platform solves this problem by the possibility of exchanging the local currency for IQN tokens The platform \xe2\x80\x99s user account can support the functions of synchronization and conversion of the internal currency on the balance of any game or application of the platform into IQN tokens 12 \x0c3 Advantages of IQeon platform 3 1 Purposes of the platform IQeon team develops a \xef\xac\x82exible and scalable platform for the rapid launch of new products that allow players to compete among themselves in a variety of intelligent and logical tasks receiving IQeon internal currency for the best result Another direction for the development of IQeon platform is motivational applications This direction is especially important in the \xef\xac\x81eld of education sports and the observance of a healthy lifestyle Often people do not have enough inner motivation to study certain material or force themselves to run in the morning or lose several kilograms 3 2 Technical advantages The blockchain technology guarantees reliability and anonymity of all payment transactions in IQeon system and IQeon (IQN) token itself corresponds to the ERC20 standard which makes it compatible with existing wallets and stock exchange crypto currencies and allows its easy integration into a variety of products and solutions Fully supported by Ethereum block chain mechanism of smart contracts on the basis of which IQeon token is issued will provide permanence and reliability of the conditions of each competition (bet) as well as a guarantee of winning 3 3 Advantages of the platform for developers of games/content A ready developed infrastructure for the introduction of payments based on the cryptocurrency into its own products The use of IQeon tokens is consistent with the App Store Review Guidelines and the Google Play Developer Policy Reduction of charges for developer fees withdrawal (from 30% Google Play and Apple Store to 10%) Additional game audience for your own products API that allows quick integration of your products into an existing ecosystem SDK for rapid deployment of new applications based on IQeon platform 13 \x0c3 4 Advantages of the platform for players Genericity The internal currency IQeon earned in one game can be used in another one Liquidity Using your own platform wallet IQeon tokens could be exchanged for avaliable currency Convertibility Using multiple cryptocurrency exchanges IQeon tokens can be exchanged for any other crypto currency (bitcoin litecoin ethereum etc ) Reliability Thanks to the blockchain technology all transactions of IQeon tokens in the ecosystem are of no return they are repeatedly recorded in the decentralized transaction register and thus are protected from forgery and any types of fraud The use of smart contracts ensures that the terms and conditions of each dispute are recorded and invariable and guarantees payment of the winnings Anonymity anonymous IQeon platform allows players to remain 3 5 Advantages of the platform for token buyers Games and applications for self development \xef\xac\x81eld shows rapid growth and IQeon platform is the \xef\xac\x81rst solution in this area that allows players to receive income in the form of liquid crypto currency Developed partnership system involvement of third party developers in IQeon ecosystem and expansion of its own product line will lead to a growth in the audience of users and increase in demand for IQeon token These facts should ensure the growth of the value of IQeon token which can be purchased at the lowest price during the Crowdsale period After this IQN can be bought only in the open market 14 \x0c4 Platform description IQeon platform focuses on the range of applications for self development logical games and PvP disputes Below are the developed scenarios for applications that will be implemented in the platform This list will be constantly supplemented in the process of platform development 4 1 Scenario for motivation and self development This scenario assumes that two players bet on the fact that one of them (player A) will perform a certain action (lose weight by X kilogram go to college hit a basketball in the basket 10 peat etc ) Each of them contributes the same amount which will be paid after deducting the platform fee and developer\ s reward (total 12%) to player A if he performs the action or to player B if player A would not perform the described action All transaction terms pass through IQeon API to the blockchain and cannot be changed After completing or not of what is described in the conditions of the action both players must con\xef\xac\x81rm the corresponding result in the application Payment of rewards is accomplished through the mechanism of smart contracts For cases if the players do not agree on the result of the dispute the mechanism of remote con\xef\xac\x82ict resolvers is implemented in the application Players can choose an arbitration option for their dispute and a remote con\xef\xac\x82ict resolver will make a sound decision about the results of the dispute according to the materials provided (picture video) An additional charge for invocation of a con\xef\xac\x82ict resolver will be deducted from the prize fund Both friends and unfamiliar with each other players can participate in the scenario The second option will be implemented through the listings of achievements The \xef\xac\x81rst listing will contain requests from players \xe2\x80\x9cI\ m ready to bet on XX IQN that I will do \xe2\x80\x9d and each player can respond to such a request The second listing will contain the queries \xe2\x80\x9cI bet on XX IQN that no one can do \xe2\x80\x9d and again each player respond to this challenge 15 \x0c4 2 Scenario for PvP disputes This scenario is similar to the previous one however in such a scenario the dispute can be concluded for any event (the result of a sports match election results the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest whether it will rain tomorrow whether the morning train will arrive on time etc ) and between a group of players In addition in this scenario there may be di erences in the mechanism for determining the results For many events the result can be automatically loaded from the trusted resource API and entered into the system by a smart contract In this case no con\xef\xac\x81rmation of the outcome of the dispute is required by all players If the result cannot automated the approach described in the \xef\xac\x81rst scenario is applied Arbitration is involved in disputable cases The mechanism for \xef\xac\x81xing the terms of the dispute and paying out winnings is also similar to the \xef\xac\x81rst scenario 4 3 Scenario for educational applications This scenario is applied to already existing and new services and applications of aimed at education (training courses learning foreign languages etc ) In such applications on line training is paid The course usually consists of theoretical information audio recordings video clips and interactive assignments tests for intermediate and \xef\xac\x81nal control For additional motivation of trainees the following mechanism is applied the user pays the cost of the course in IQeon tokens and starts training For high results in tests as well as for certain activities the trainee receives a reward in IQeon internal currency thereby returning a part of the paid course cost The application developer or the author of the course determines what part of the cost (maximum) the learner can return in the form of rewards is determined 16 \x0c4 4 Scenario for quest game with AR The given scenario involves player\xe2\x80\x99s passing of a sequence of levels for time Each level represents an intellectual puzzle for determining the location (park public building courtyard bridge) after arriving at which the player looks for a code placed with the help of AR or a hint that will help the player to give an answer to the current level After entering the answer in the application the player moves to the next level gets the next puzzle etc The quest is announced in advance and starts for all participants at the appointed time The participant who has passed all levels in a minimum of time wins The prize fund is divided among the players who have taken the \xef\xac\x81rst 3 places commensurate with the occupied position and the di erence in the time of passing 4 5 Advanced scenarios The IQeon team plans to expand the list of game scenarios using modern technologies such as AI (Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence) and VR/AR (Virtual / Augmented Reality) after the launch of the platform AI based on neural networks will use a constantly improving self learning algorithm for creation and generation of logical tasks VR/AR will add the games with contests implemented in virtual reality to the IQeon platform 17 \x0c5 IQ Clash API 5 1 Demo Another scenario the scenario of game rooms has already been developed by the IQeon team and implemented as an IQ Clash API and the \xef\xac\x81rst application IQ Clash Intelligent Battles can now be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play 5 2 Scenario for puzzles using game rooms This scenario is based on the implementation of the game rooms in the application The game room is a sequence of logical tasks performed by the players during a certain time of the room action To participate in the competition the player makes a contribution (bet) The amount of bets minus the platform charge and the developer\ s reward forms a prize fund which is then distributed among the players who took the \xef\xac\x81rst places (who showed the best result when passing the tasks) 5 2 1 Public Rooms Public rooms are available to all users and are displayed in a list on the application main screen Two or more public rooms with similar set of parameters (the number of participants and the bet) cannot be available at the same time Public rooms can be of two types Automatically created are 4 rooms created by the system are permanently in public access (for 2 6 12 and 24 persons) The rooms are created automatically instead of \xef\xac\x81lled or expired 18 \x0cPublished private rooms are private rooms at creation of which the user indicated that it should become public under certain conditions (time frame or content) These rooms also obey one time public access rule of only one room with a certain set of parameters Other rooms with the same parameters are bu ed at the time of compliance with the publication conditions and are published when there is no public room with the same parameters and there is no room with the same parameters created earlier in front of it Such rooms will also be for 2 6 12 and 24 participants but bets will be di erent 5 2 2 Private rooms Private rooms are created by user and are accessible only by a direct link The user can share the link in any convenient way (posting in social networks sending a direct message etc ) When creating a private room the user selects room capacity from the o ered (2 6 12 and 24) a bet (it cannot be more than the vendor\xe2\x80\x99s account balance) When creating a private room the user can specify a publication setting The room can only be private or it can become published under certain conditions speci\xef\xac\x81ed by the user when creating it Time frame The room remains private for a \xef\xac\x81xed period of time after which it is bu ed for publication Completeness The room remains private until a certain number of participants join it 5 2 3 Gameplay The gameplay begins when a user joins the game It consists of a sequence of logical tasks from di erent categories formed using AI) Mechanics inside each category are chosen randomly To complete all tasks a user has 10 minutes after which the game is forcibly completed and the user is given the result N/A which deprives him of the right to participate in general drawing In this case he does not receive the bet back If a user leaves the game process without completing all the tasks he is given the result N/A which deprives him of the right to participate in general drawing In this case he does not receive the bet back 5 2 4 IQeon obtaining IQeon internal currency can be earned in application in the following ways win the game in a game room for IQeon receive for a task completion To use IQeon in the application it is necessary to bind the wallet with IQeon to this application in user account A user can get the opportunity to win IQeon internal currency without a need for payment in the application This opportunity gives a ticket to the game of the day on IQeon which a user can receive for the following activities in the application enter the app during 7 consecutive days 19 \x0c6 Tournaments based on the IQeon platform The IQeon platform provides a functional and convenient mechanism for hosting e sports tournaments Classic tournament in e sports is a major event the organization of which requires considerable resources IQeon makes organization of an online tournament available for any user of the platform 6 1 Matching Services and Games Not only the games integrated into the IQeon platform but also any games of a competitive nature may become the games for the tournament The main condition is the possibility to track the results of matches through one of the supported APIs (Steam Origin Uplay Battle net etc ) 6 2 Application of Smart Contracts The important criteria when conducting online tournaments are transparency and guarantee of compliance with all conditions of the tournament To ensure these criteria smart contracts and independent resolvers will be involved in the IQeon platform 20 \x0c6 3 Procedure for the conduct of the tournament A player who wants to create a new tournament can do it through the IQeon web portal When creating a tournament the name the game the dates the amount of the participation fee the requirements for the participants the game mode the format of the tournament the number of participants and the way the prize fund is distributed are indicated Information about the tournament is published in a special section of the web portal and all interested players register to participate in the tournament When registering each participant speci\xef\xac\x81es his ID for tracking match results (for example Steam ID) as well as the address of the cryptocurrency wallet After registration of the required number of participants the IQeon API forms a smart contract with the necessary conditions for the tournament and publishes it in the Ethereum network The address of the smart contract for transferring contributions in IQN for participation in the tournament becomes available in the personal accounts of the participants 95% of the collected amount of IQN forms a prize fund 5% constitutes the commission of the platform from which payments for the transactions in the Ethereum network and remuneration to the resolvers are paid and the rest is the reward of the platform After all the conditions necessary for starting the tournament are ful\xef\xac\x81lled the stage of matches begins the results of each match are tracked through the platform API to which the tournament game is connected After each match the participants con\xef\xac\x81rm their results in their personal account A resolver is involved in case of controversial situations (for example the use of cheat codes) or in case of technical problems (the match is not completed due to the network disconnection) The resolver may decide to make a second match or disqualify one of the players for violating the rules of the tournament After con\xef\xac\x81rmation of the results by the players or the decision of the resolver the match results are recorded in the tournament\ s smart contract through the IQeon API 21 \x0c6 4 The order of formation and distribution of the prize fund 22 \x0cAfter receiving the results of all scheduled matches the smart contract distributes IQN in accordance with the scheme of the prize fund distribution chosen at the stage of the tournament creation The scheme above shows an example of the distribution of winnings When creating a tournament you can select several brackets and several winnings distribution schemes Not only the platform user but also the sponsoring company may create the tournament In this case the tournament participants do not pay the fees and the organizing company sponsors the prize fund 23 \x0c7 Platform architecture IQeon API Provides a set of methods and interfaces for the interaction of all platform elements IQeon blockchain control subsystem Implements services on interaction with Ethereum blockchain It records transactions with use of IQN to blockchain deployment and interaction with smart contracts IQeon web application It is a platform portal It contains information part (platform description blog documentation) and user and developer personal accounts Users can through their personal account link applications to their account make purchases transfers exchange IQN for available crypto currencies and \xef\xac\x81at money Developers can get API keys for their applications register a new application in the platform see statistics for accrual of remuneration and exchange IQN for available currencies through their personal account In addition the personal account service replicates IQeon wallet application to web services IQeon wallet Is the application (iOS Android) which allows the user to issue a debit card after veri\xef\xac\x81cation and exchange IQN for avaliable currency (and vice versa) 24 \x0cIQeon SDK Is a creation tool set for rapid expanding of new games and applications based on existing scenarios and game mechanics IQ Clash API Is a set of methods and interfaces for agile development and integration of games and applications based on the scenario of game rooms into the platform Existing games & services Existing games and applications thanks to API can be integrated into IQeon platform This will allow existing games to take full advantage of the platform and use IQeon token in the gameplay Ethereum wallet & Digital currency exchangers IQeon token complies with ERC20 standard This means that it is initially compatible with Ethereum wallet and can be freely transferred from one address to another In addition this standard provides token\xe2\x80\x99s genericity and technical compatibility for further addition for crypto exchange stocks trading and for exchange on online crypto currency stock services 8 Legal aspects Nowadays the legislation of most countries in the world to various extents toughen the requirements for online services that allow earning money online The team of IQeon project together with legal advisors studied the legislation of the top countries for the project Experienced legal advisors helped IQeon project to create its own concept of mobile games applications and services that do not meet the criteria of activities subject to regulation and licensing Therefore IQ Clash products and the products of the platform\xe2\x80\x99s partners that support transactions using IQeon (IQN) token will meet the requirements The expectations of IQeon platform users regarding the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of using our products and the ability to receive money will be worthwhile IQeon platform focuses on the range of applications for self development logical games and PvP disputes The use of IQeon (IQN) token which is not a means of payment in analogy with the \xef\xac\x81at money prevents the claims of authorities The use of crypto currency in internal transactions in such software products practically does not encounter resistance from the authorities This is possible thanks to the fact that the funds in \xef\xac\x81at money will not be stored on the user account balance in IQeon games and applications 25 \x0c9 Project team Vadim Dovguchits CEO (Chief Executive O Igor Podlesny cer) Business Analyst Blockchain Enthusiast MBA Supervisor of
