worldwide 1 8 billion Revenue in the Digital Advertising market amounts to US$279 billion in 2018 The market\ s largest segment is the segment Search Advertising with a market volume of US$127 billion in 2018 4 Revenue in the Social Media Advertising segment amounts to US $51 billion in 2018 Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2018 2022) of 10 5 % resulting in a market volume of US $76 billion in 2022 The average revenue per Internet user currently amounts to US$17 24 04 \x0cPROBLEMS Advertising Too expensive With each passing year companies spend more than ever before on digital marketing services The recent ban on cryptocurrency advertising on Facebook Twitter and Google creates an entirely new and uncontested \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Ocean\xe2\x80\x9d market space with no competition Webhits io\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to pioneer the technological development of this new industry by introducing a new generation of digital advertising solutions to ICOs startups blockchain companies and corporations Marketing Limited access The rapid economic growth of the Asia Paci\xef\xac\x81c and particularly China Singapore South Korea the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia and India attracts the attention of multinational companies They want to enter these emerging markets to sell their products and services Although Asian social media networks like WeChat and Tencent QQ have become some of the largest and most popular globally the rest of the world cannot advertise on them Influencers Transparency On one hand freelancers and small businesses cannot afford the much needed services of top social media in\xef\xac\x82uencers On the other hand many social media authority \xef\xac\x81gures are unable to maximize their pro\xef\xac\x81ts from existing followers Mining Electricity & Resources With the rapid growth of the blockchain technology the resources and tools available for mining increase by the day In November 2017 The Guardian revealed that Bitcoin network\xe2\x80\x99s estimated electricity consumption is greater than that of 19 European countries consuming more than \xef\xac\x81ve times the produce of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s largest wind farm Lorem ipsum Lorem ipsum 05 \x0cOUR SOLUTION Advertising Unlike any other existing and relatively overpriced social media platform Webhits io offers 10 times cheaper advertising services Much like Facebook Twitter Medium and Pinterest the Webhits io is also interest based This allows sole proprietors businesses and global brands to more effectively advertise their offers to a highly targeted countries of interest Connecting with and capitalizing on interest based audience will result in an increased ROI for advertisers Higher ROI The Webcoin team aims to integrate all viral social media networks into the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest interest based p2p social media and web exchange platform The Webhits io platform will allow businesses from all around the world to effectively advertise also on the Indian and Asia Paci\xef\xac\x81c markets Marketing Global Market Connected Freelancers More Services & Income Social Mining The advancement of the Internet technologies allows millions of people worldwide to work remotely from virtually anywhere The number of freelance marketplaces like Fiverr Freelancer and PeoplePerHour is growing and so is the number of freelancers It becomes harder and harder for a freelancer to stand out and earn money online Webhits io will encourage freelancers to offer a greater variety of social media and website related services More services will lead to improved pro\xef\xac\x81le visibility more clients thus more income Webcoin social mining requires almost no GPU and CPU unlike Bitcoin or Ether In order to engage in Webcoin social mining miners need to visit websites and social media links submitted by advertisers to the Webhits io platform Every veri\xef\xac\x81ed visit of an advertiser website and every advertiser related social media action (e g like share follow) will be monetarily rewarded with a \xef\xac\x81xed portion of Webcoin token Low GPU & CPU no hardware 06 \x0cPLATFORM OVERVIEW All commercial processes occurring within the Webhits io platform will be governed and regulated by the Webcoin team Advertisers will receive an initial amount of Webcoin which they will trade for a certain amount of social media exposure Upon receiving advertiser demands the platform issues an offer to the appropriate miner After the miner successfully delivers the service the platform rewards him with a portion of Webcoin token The platform will also retain a small portion of Webcoin from each transaction This will be our team\xe2\x80\x99s main source of revenue for maintenance and support Advertisers can obtain Webcoin after the ICO in the following ways 1 2 Buy directly from exchanges which will generate demand for the Webcoin token and drive prices upwards As some of the advertisers may not be willing to deal with exchanges and convert FIAT currency to cryptocurrency themselves the platform will save them the trouble by re selling Webcoin for USD$ at 5 10% above the average market rate on cryptocurrency exchanges WEBHITS MINERS INFLUENCERS SMART CONTRACT SOCIAL MINING APP ARBITER SMART CONTRACT REVIEWERS SERVICE ADVERTISER Wallet + Altcoins Wallet CRYPTO CURRENCY EXCHANGES Dollars Wallet 07 \x0cL RATIO & REVENUE The L ratio Webhits io core mechanism is responsible for generating income by maintaining adequate rewards for miners and attractive prices for advertisers In the same time traders will seize the enormous potential for substantial returns on their investments due to the nature of supply and demand forces that govern the open market The L ratio is the proportion of 1 Webcoin that a miner will receive for providing services to an advertiser The Webhits io platform will keep the remaining portion 1 L of the Webcoin paid for the service provided TYPICAL OPERATIONAL CYCLE 1 2 3 4 5 The advertiser buys 1 Webcoin from the ICO cryptocurrency exchange or the Webhits io platform The advertiser spends 1 Webcoin within the Webhits io platform and sends an order for a prede\xef\xac\x81ned amount of social media exposure (e g 200 Facebook shares likes) The Webhits io platform receives 1 Webcoin and sends an order to miners for a pre negotiated amount of social media exposure The miner delivers the service successfully The Webhits io platform con\xef\xac\x81rms the completion of the task and pays the L amount of 1 Webcoin to the miner The Webhits io platform retains the remaining of 1 L portion of 1 Webcoin By retaining a small proportion of Webcoin on every operational cycle the remaining public supply of the coin will slowly decrease over time leaving the team with disposable Webcoin assets at hand we would like to refer to as temporary operational \xe2\x80\x9cinventory\xe2\x80\x9d The goal here is to create scarcity on the cryptocurrency exchanges which will increase the demand for Webcoin and ultimately its market price The Webhits io platform will generate income by offering this Webcoin \xe2\x80\x9cinventory\xe2\x80\x9d to advertisers or by directly selling it on exchanges thus maintaining the long run public supply of Webcoin sustainable 08 \x0cOPERATIONAL MECHANISMS We believe in creating the most favorable conditions for advertisers and miners to connect The Webhits io platform is designed to be functional manageable and pro\xef\xac\x81table with no dependency on monthly fees whatsoever Additionally recurring monthly payment plans can later be designed for large corporate advertisers and professional miners TM Demand for paid subscriptions can be created by setting policies of limitation on the free user accounts (e g not allowing them to request or provide more than a certain amount of social media exposure per day) 09 \x0cUSER ROLES ADVERTISERS Advertisers are companies in need for web and social network advertising Reasonably high demand for services can be expected because of Webcoin\xe2\x80\x99s competitive ICO pricing and market positioning Our value proposition is to offer more exposure for less money The current price of an identical offer on the market (same degree of social media exposure) is more than 10 times higher Advertisers are expected to show extraordinarily high interest on all ICO price levels SOCIAL MINING Unlike Bitcoin Webcoin social mining requires almost no GPU and CPU Webhits io suggests much simpler ways to earn Webcoins within the platform MINERS Miners are individuals who offer social media exposure for a fee A miner\xe2\x80\x99s duty is to provide a certain amount of exposure in the form of likes shares and follows for a company The miner would be motivated to deliver the service because a rewarding portion of Webcoin revenue will amount to his service fee For example even the least popular miners can earn at least $500 every month for simply generating social media likes and shares Professional miners with multiple accounts and considerable social popularity can earn in the tens of thousands a month 10 \x0cREVIEWERS Reviewers are people who review advertiser web and social media content for a fee Webhits io selects and encourages reviewers to examine a number of websites or social media posts based on their interests language and geographical location Three reviewers will be randomly selected by the platform to analyze and authorize the posts The approval of two out of three reviewers will be needed for every post Only then will the posts be sent to the appropriate miners We strive to create a healthy marketing community with no tolerance for hate speech racism gender discrimination and drugs Reviewers will have an incentive to deliver results because a rewarding portion of Webcoin revenue will constitute their service fee For example even the most inactive players can earn at least $400 every month for simply reviewing advertiser links or posts Serious miners with a business agenda can also be reviewers Engaging in this activity may add a few thousand to their monthly income SOCIAL INFLUENCERS In\xef\xac\x82uencer marketing focuses more on in\xef\xac\x82uential people\xe2\x80\x99s social reputation It identi\xef\xac\x81es individuals who have in\xef\xac\x82uence over a potential buyer segment and focuses marketing activities on these in\xef\xac\x82uencers Influencer marketing derives value from 3 sources 1 2 3 Social reach In\xef\xac\x82uencers reach out to millions of consumers through their social channels and blogs Original content In\xef\xac\x82uencers produce original and compelling business oriented marketing content for the brand Consumer trust In\xef\xac\x82uencers maintain a strong relationship with their audience People take social media authority \xef\xac\x81gures seriously and they trust their judge ment Followers popularize in\xef\xac\x82uencers\xe2\x80\x99 messages on social media hence reach ing out to even more potential buyers The integration of Ethereum Smart Contracts within the Webhits io now allows large advertisers to customize their high end service requests based on speci\xef\xac\x81c criteria and bene\xef\xac\x81t more from working with social in\xef\xac\x82uencers For instance when a popular company (advertiser) requests a sponsored video review of their new product the platform sends the service request to a renowned social authority \xef\xac\x81gure The in\xef\xac\x82uencer reviews the terms and decides whether to accept the offer or not If the person accepts he also agrees to stick to the conditions of the advertiser Upon the completion of a secure payment the monetary value of the transaction is safely kept by the platform until both parties independently con\xef\xac\x81rm that the job has been completed 11 \x0cARBITER Arbitrage occurs when 2 parties operating within in the Webhits io platform disagree on the quality and integrity of the work performed For example an advertiser creates a service request which the platform sends to a social in\xef\xac\x82uencer who completes the work only partially then submits back to the advertiser for a review Should the advertiser reject the work done the platform will step in as the arbiter between the two parties and resolve the issue TRADERS Webcoin will be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges so that miners can easily cash out their earnings Advertisers will also be able to buy Webcoin from exchanges Webhits io itself will also actively trade on the exchanges in order to manage any arising short term Webcoin supply needs WALLET A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that generates stores and protects user private keys Users can easily monitor their balance send and receive digital currency Webhits io will provide users with a multi cryptocurrency wallet The platform plans to further deepen its relationship with miners reviewers and social in\xef\xac\x82uencers through lottery events and rewards in the form of ether bitcoin and altcoins CUSTOM SERVICES The platform will also offer white label solutions If a corporate advertiser requests that a custom technological feature be built into Webhits io for a one time project then the platform will implement the requested feature and accept Webcoin as compensation 12 \x0cSCALABILITY The currently offered public crowdsale supply of 25 000 000 Webcoin will be suf\xef\xac\x81cient for all platform operational needs that may arise over the next 3 to 5 years Bearing in mind the rapid development of the cryptocurrency segment our projected expectations for the near future may be subject to modi\xef\xac\x81cation In case of a surprisingly high demand and insuf\xef\xac\x81cient Webcoin at hand an adequate amount of Webcoin10X will be publicly introduced through a secondary ICO Webcoin10X will operate in a manner almost identical to Webcoin Webcoin vs Webcoin10X Webcoin10X available public quantity will be 10 times less than that of Webcoin at a 10 times higher price With 1 Webcoin10X an advertiser can buy a package of social media exposure from the platform and it will be 10 times more valuable than the same degree of exposure bought with 1 Webcoin Both Webcoin and Webcoin10X will remain fully utilizable within the Webhits io platform We reasonably believe the Webcoin / Webcoin10X business model has the potential to be further re\xef\xac\x81ned scaled and expanded 13 \x0cROADMAP Milestone 8 / Aug 2018 BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS EXPANSION Milestone 9 / Jan 2019 Milestone 7 / Sep 2018
