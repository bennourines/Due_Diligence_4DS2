8 9 Abstract Background Weather Market OBSERVER Weather Observation Ecosystem of OBSERVER Econnomic Model of OBSERVER Other Considerations References \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 1 ABSTRACT Weather observations are made in real time every day through a variety of methods including satellites weather radars and ground based observatories Data obtained from these observations are used either as initial conditions for weather forecasts or as real time weather monitoring Since weather observations require costly equipment and trained personnel they are generally performed in the public sector However unlike the developed countries where observation networks are built and operated some underdeveloped countries do not provide such services Even in countries where public observation networks are well established their networks have often significant limitations in providing high resolution weather information especially for megacities The OBSERVER intends to collect and distribute real time weather data for regions where public observation networks are not well established To realize this goal the OBSERVER provides a platform that encourages observations by individuals and businesses verifies the quality of the data and facilitates transparent data transactions At OBSERVER anyone can share real time weather data that they collect using their smartphones automobiles mini weather stations vessels or aircraft The collected data is managed through big data technology and the observation history is recorded on a blockchain for legitimate compensation This platform allows anyone in the world to provide weather data and purchase them on a real time basis This will be an alternative to the current limitations of the public observation networks and the inefficient data exchanges between countries GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM 1 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 2 BACKGROUND According to a survey U S residents use weather Weather observations are made in various ways forecasts about 3 8 times a day (Lazo et al 2009) These include surface weather stations balloon the U S alone use weather forecasts over 300 billion radar and satellites Ground based weather stations Considering the population of the U S people in a year Most weather information is used as a small piece of daily information but in certain industries such as logistics leisure energy agriculture and fisheries it is used as high value added information The Swiss Federal Office of Climatology and Meteorology estimated the value of the free of charge climate information provided to the public at up to $360 million annually (Frei 2010) In the U S the value of weather information was estimated to be approximately $31 5 billion per year (Lazo et al 2009) Now its value is on the rise due to rapid climate change and frequent extreme weather events The most important pieces of weather information are weather forecasts Weather forecasts are the integrated outcome of numerical weather prediction borne radiosondes and remote sensing that utilizes generally observe air temperature pressure wind speed wind direction and precipitation Among these variables air pressure serves as a basis for weather forecasts This is because mid latitude weather forecasts start by locating low and high pressure systems in a daily weather map While ground based observations may seem easy installation and operation of the stations are not straightforward For instance regular weather stations are not randomly placed They can be installed only in the regions that meet certain conditions (e g a site that keeps a certain distance from the road) The equipment is costly and the data is subject to quality control by meteorological experts Even if regular observation network is in operation model run on supercomputer The numerical weather stations are often not evenly distributed For data such as air temperature pressure humidity and operates about 700 weather stations but the number weather prediction model requires various input wind These data should cover the globe without being limited by national borders (Fig 1) GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM instance the Chinese Meteorological Administration of stations is significantly small in Tibet and North China (Fig 1 Box) 2 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE The regular observations performed by the public sector are usually optimized for weather forecasts ranging from hundreds to thousands of kilometers They are made only at a designated time and place On the other hand operational institutions around the world (e g European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts) are improving the spatial resolution of their numerical weather prediction models to 10 kilometers or even higher Such high resolution forecasts require high resolution observations as well as regular ones In cities high resolution observations are crucial not only for weather forecasts but also for fine dust monitoring In the current urban environment Distribution of regular weather stations in the world and those in China and Southeast Asia (boxed) where various types of structures are built two very different meteorological phenomena can occur at locations just a few kilometers away from each other For instance the distribution of urban heat islands is greatly affected by the arrangement of buildings (Fig 2) Air pollutants also show complex distribution patterns depending on the flow of air within the city Given rapid urbanization across the world the need for detailed city scale meteorological information is increasing Some cities have already responded to such needs and have been carrying out high resolution observations but in reality these cases are confined to only highly populated megacities in developed countries due to the sheer cost of operation The OBSERVER intends to establish a platform where meteorological data is secured through the efforts of individuals and private firms Anyone can share weather data that are collected by smartphones mini weather stations automobiles vessels or aircraft The collected data are verified and Urban heat islands in Boston U S [Taken from Climate Central 2014 report] Where private weather observations are needed Observations in remote regions beyond regular weather networks managed through big data technology They are also High resolution observations as well as public sectors The blockchain technology City scale weather and fine dust monitoring sold on a real time basis to a variety of businesses helps ensure transparent data transactions GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM for short term weather forecasts 3 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 3 WEATHER MARKET Do weather observations (or weather information Rollins and Shaykewich (2013) conducted a in general) have commercial value In fact high study on Canadians\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to pay for weather being commercially used in a broad spectrum of mean of $1 2 (Fig 3) The numbers may seem small resolution observations and forecasts are already sectors including agriculture food medicine travel leisure health beauty insurance retail automobile energy military science disaster prevention and public services According to IBM the total damages from the five most destructive weather events of forecasts The figure varied from $0 6 to $2 17 with a but the combined benefits are estimated to exceed $16 million per year as there are potential buyers of real time weather information Weather information is now widely available 2014 amount to $17 4 billion worldwide with insured online in a broad range of prices from virtually free the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology forecasts are mostly provided for free or at a low losses of $11 8 billion In the case of Switzerland reported that the estimated benefits of extrapolating weather and climate information in the agriculture sector are valued at $42 million adding that the sector could cut 100 million Swiss Francs in costs by using weather and climate data to accurately to thousands of US dollars While public weather cost the costs go up with high resolution forecasts and customized data Long term observations are also sold at a high price As big data technology continues to mature the estimate the energy demand (Frei 2010) Weather use of weather information is trending upwards at greatly affects travel and leisure related products weather information to earn greater profits in fact information is important for other sectors as well it health and beauty supplies and retail companies It is also an integral component of vehicle development (e g self driving car technology) urban planning and development (e g smart city) and disaster prevention a significant pace Companies are incorporating a growing number of multinational companies are buying small weather companies Monsanto a leading provider of agricultural products announced the acquisition of The Climate Corporation in 2013 The deal was reportedly valued at approximately one billion US dollars which came as a surprise to many although the relationship between agriculture and weather is evident Monsanto later acquired an agtech software company HydroBio and launched the Climate FieldView platform designed to help farmers access customized weather data to better manage their crops and optimize yields Farmers need to pay an annual subscription rate of approximately $1 000 to use the Climate FieldView platform In 2015 IBM bought The Weather Company at approximately two billion US dollars It is now Willingness to pay by commercial sectors (Rollins and Shaykewich 2013) GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM combining big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for global weather forecasts 4 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 4 OBSERVER The OBSERVER is founded on the vision that and share the data online In other words without it at a reasonable price \xe2\x80\x9d At OBSERVER weather can measure meteorological conditions and send \xe2\x80\x9canyone can produce weather data and purchase observations are made worldwide on a real time basis with data being made available to the public without government interference Big data technology allows for systematic data management while blockchain technology enables transparent data trading To this end the OBSERVER intends to collect data conduct quality control and provide standards for data transactions Weather observations have been largely considered as a public service Indeed weather observation networks are typically maintained by tax revenue and data exchanges are conducted through the intergovernmental organization (World Meteorological Organization) This makes it hard for individuals or private companies to access location specific weather data on a real time basis Unlike public weather services that require large initial investments in sophisticated instruments individuals and private firms can make their own observations at any place and time Personal observation is already an indispensable part of our daily lives For instance a person can measure air temperature or pressure using his/her smartphone any expensive instrument or expertise individuals out their data via worldwide cable and wireless networks This may help overcome the limitations of existing public observation systems and inefficient data exchange platform The three main components of the OBSERVER are weather data providers buyer and the OBSERVER foundation (Fig 4) Weather data providers send real time observations to the OBSERVER foundation where observations are quality controlled and processed into the database Data providers receive payment once they send out the data and every time their data is sold All transactions take place on a blockchain platform in a secure and transparent manner Since the OBSERVER collects data in various forms quality control is critical The OBSERVER does not rely on data providers or buyers to check data quality Instead data quality is controlled by the OBSERVER foundation which is also in charge of data management and transactions Although this is different from the decentralized blockchain platform it is a necessary move to ensure data quality which cannot be done without meteorological expertise OBSERVER ecosystem and examples of weather mining methods GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM 5 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 5 WEATHER OBSERVATION The OBSERVER aims to promote weather observations conducted by individuals and private companies Individual observers are not required to use certain types of instruments nor to guarantee data quality This fundamentally sets private observations in the OBSERVER apart from public observations that are conducted with standard meteorological instruments to measure basic weather variables (e g air temperature pressure humidity precipitation wind solar radiation etc ) with a certain level of quality In Observer App Smartphones Air pressure Cloud etc Most of smartphones have built in pressure OBSERVER individuals can measure meteorological sensors Any smartphone owners can share pressure automobiles or mini weather stations For instance part of a Observer member First Observer will variables from various tools such as smartphones observer A can measure air pressure by using his/her smartphone while observer B can measure humidity with his/her mini weather station Their data are sent to the OBSERVER foundation and are qualitycontrolled by meteorological experts OBSERVER s most common ways of observation are by using smartphones and mini weather stations However it also considers other individual and corporate options such as automobiles vessels and aircrafts GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM data based on their GPS with Observer and become compensate with OBSR coins for exchanging the data to Observer wallet smartphone application Then users can transfer OBSR coins to any other wallets that accepts OBSR coins A smartphone is also useful for taking pictures of clouds An observer can simply take low resolution pictures of the sky and send them to the OBSERVER foundation through the smartphone App The photographs can be used to estimate cloud cover and to visually monitor real time weather conditions 6 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE Mini Weather Stations Air pressure Temperature Humidity Particulate Matter Raining or not Ultraviolet (UV) etc Mini weather stations can also share their observations with the OBSERVER Many equipments are already available in both online and offline stores The small observational device which is connected to a local wireless network can measure outdoor air temperature and humidity pressure and transmit the data to the OBSERVER foundation in real time Automobiles Air pressure Temperature etc Automobiles manufactured in recent decades are topped with sensors that measure air temperature and pressure Automobile owners therefore can be a part of the OBSERVER by extracting weather information from the automobile with the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) scanner and syncing it with their smartphones All they need to do is to install the OBD scanner on their automobiles (only once) and Observer MWS V 1 and Installation examples Aircrafts Air pressure Temperature Humidity Wind etc All aircrafts are mounted with weather observation open the OBSERVER App Other instruments which equipments The upper air observations they also utilized observations during the take off and landing are designed for automobile observations could be Vessels Air pressure Temperature Humidity Precipitation Wind etc Equipped with a range of meteorological instruments large vessels are also capable of generating weather data Marine weather observations hold significant economic values as they are often difficult to conduct They are particularly valuable for navigation routes services produce are of great value In particular the aviation when most airplane accidents occur are enormous sources of added values If the meteorological data from individual aircrafts and major airlines are communicated to the OBSERVER foundation through the airport communications network it could create a new market Others VOCs NOx SO4 O3 radiation etc Individuals and companies can participate and weather prediction businesses Such high value on observing air quality (O3 NOx SO4) or communication networks of shipping companies to network of atmospheric conditions with help of added information can be sent in real time via the the OBSERVER foundation and verified for its quality This can be done through a strategic partnership with shipping companies GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM radiation Observer expect to build a permanent the private sector Similarly radiation map can be constructed as long as the accuracy of personal radiometers is ensured 7 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 6 ECOSYSTEM OF OBSERVER The OBSERVER is composed of three main components as shown below weather data providers buyers and the OBSERVER foundation Weather Data Providers Individuals and private companies can measure weather conditions from a variety of sources (e g smartphones automobiles mini weather stations vessels aircraft etc ) and share them on a real time basis These observations can be done consciously or subconsciously For instance an automobile connected to the OBD scanner can automatically measure air pressure every 30 minutes as soon as the engine starts and deliver the data to the OBSERVER foundation via smartphone Individuals can take a picture of the sky and send it to the OBSERVER foundation Aircrafts and vessels which are mostly operated by corporations already have communication networks in place Just by adding the OBSERVER to their networks high value added weather information can be sent to the OBSERVER foundation GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM Buyers Buyers of historical and real time weather data could be individuals companies or government Customers like weather service providers can process OBSERVER\xe2\x80\x99s data to offer real time information on urban weather Weather information obtained from automobiles can be directly applied to automobile navigation systems By combining OBSERVER\xe2\x80\x99s data with AI technology (e g IBM\xe2\x80\x99s Watson and Google\xe2\x80\x99s deep learning algorithm) weather service providers can make hyper local short range weather forecasts Daily observations can be also purchased by government agencies in agriculture energy disaster prevention and public services Among others the data archived in the OBSERVER can be useful for local governments looking to develop smart cities Airlines and ship routing companies can take great advantages of OBSERVER\xe2\x80\x99s real time weather data as well Airlines can use OBSERVER\xe2\x80\x99s data to check airport weather and monitor clear air turbulence As for ship routing companies they can monitor real time weather and marine conditions with OBSERVER\xe2\x80\x99s data 8 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE OBSERVER Foundation The OBSERVER foundation performs multiple roles First it controls the quality of real time weather observations and archives them into the database It also blockchains the weather information based on its accuracy In addition the OBSERVER foundation executes payment of routine compensation (OBSERVER coin) for successful observations and connects data providers and buyers The OBSERVER foundation operates a local server and a central server Once observations are collected they are temporarily stored in the local server while the central server conducts quality checks The role of the central server is to verify manage and distribute the data The quality of individual observations is tested in the following three steps The first step is to verify the collected data (except photographs) and compare it to local climatology Then the data is compared with other data produced at the same time from nearby locations The final step involves a machine learning algorithm which is used to establish the reliability of the data The machine learning algorithm incorporates a numerical weather prediction model output as well as observational data Once the data is verified it is managed with big data analysis technology GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM 9 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 7 ECONOMIC MODEL OF OBSERVER 7 1 OBSERVER COINS All payments and transactions in the OBSERVER are made in OBSR a transaction coin OBSERVER COIN (OBSR) Coin for transactions OBSR is a coin listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges and used in transactions of the data The data providers receive OBSR on two separate occasions the first is when their data is quality checked and the latter is each time the data is sold OBSERVER and Blockchain technology The OBSERVER uses blockchain technology to enable transparent data management effortless data trade and efficient compensation A buyer can immediately purchase the weather In order to access weather data buyers need to data by paying with OBSR anywhere in the world and pay in the OBSERVER foundation The value of from conventional purchasing methods such as purchase OBSR from the cryptocurrency exchanges OBSR will increase with a greater public interest in the OBSERVER project and higher demand for its data This in turn will result in better compensation for the data providers GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM The use of OBSR eliminates the issues that arise unstable foreign exchange rates and disturbances in wiring and mailing remittances The details of transactions are recorded in the blockchain and are managed transparently 10 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE 7 2 ECONOMIC MODEL Economic model of OBSERVER Individuals and private firms can carry out both simple observations (e g monitoring a single variable such as air pressure) and comprehensive observations (e g multiple variables including air temperature pressure humidity and precipitation) using mobile and stationary devices The data provided by private observers goes through a verification process and is then given an Impact Factor (IF) depending on the location the type of data and the quality GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM 11 \x0cOBSERVER TECHNICAL NOTE OBSR payment for real time observations Observation platform records the values of each observation (IFs) and operates as the basis of OBSR payment for successful observations There is a limit on the total daily assignment of IFs The total amount could differ depending on the region and the type of variables For instance while the maximum IF assignment for air pressure in an urban area would be 100 that in an island area would be only 50 Even for the same region precipitation data may get 10 times more than other variables This means that the amount of IF assigned to weather data providers may vary depending on the time and location of observations Let us assume that five data providers observed air pressure in a region where total daily IF assignment Weather Data Providers Quality Factor (QF) B 0 5 A 0 5 E 0 0 D for 24 hours using a mini weather station and received a Quality Factor (QF) of 1 0 after data quality checks On the other hand observers B C and D received QF of 0 5 for 12 hour observations using a smartphone while observer E sent the data to the OBSERVER foundation but was given a QF of 0 0 due to equipment malfunction In this case IF may be distributed as shown in Table 1 If 50 OBSRs are provided as compensation for the above observations 40% (20 OBSRs) is paid to observer A It is important to note that the smaller the number of local observers and the higher the quality of the data the larger the rewards will be Total IF / Total QF 1 0 C is 50 (Table 1) Observer A performed observations 50/(1 0+0 5+0 5+0 5+0 0) = 20 0 5 Table 1 Example of IF distribution IF distribution 20 \xc3\x97 1 0 = 20 20 \xc3\x97 0 5 = 10 20 \xc3\x97 0 5 = 10 20 \xc3\x97 0 5 = 10 20 \xc3\x97 0 0 = 0 OBSR distribution for data sales OBSR MIning control cryptocurrency exchange and use it in the OBSERVER total supply of OBSR to the weather observarion Customers may purchase OBSR from an external foundation Once the transaction is complete the data is transmitted to the customer The OBSR that The OBSERVER foundation allocates 65% of the compensation(see business note) customers pay is used for the data provider royalties and for the OBSERVER foundation management costs It is also directed to future compensations This creates a win win structure for weather data providers buyers and the OBSERVER foundation GLOCAL WEATHER DATA TRADING PLATFORM 12 \x0cOBSERVER
