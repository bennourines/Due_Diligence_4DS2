live in an age of ultra high mobility Advances in transportation and communication technology have led to unprecedented numbers of people travelling working and doing business across borders And yet in such a fast paced global environment traditional financial institutions have been remarkably slow to adapt This becomes particularly apparent when considering cross border money transfers Money Transfers There are more than 180 different fiat currencies in circulation each varying in value strength and liquidity Transferring these currencies across borders is expensive inefficient and often impractical This is due to the global financial infrastructure which is characterised by tight KYC/ AML regulations high opacity and a strong dependency on third party institutions Transactions become particularly problematic when sending money to developing market economies with weaker currencies where economic and political infrastructure is strained Trading in and out of exotic currencies is expensive due to low liquidity on the global market and the consequent need to route exchanges through strong currencies such as USD Apart from cross border money transfers constituting an essential function for e commerce and trade for millions of migrant workers sending money home in the form of remittances is of critical importance It is a multi billion dollar industry that sustains families and developing economies The World Bank estimates that officially recorded remittances to low and middle income countries reached $466 billion in 2017 However due to high transaction fees charged by banks and companies such as Western Union and Moneygram a staggering 7 1% ($33 billion) failed to reach recipients 1 The War on Cash The remittance industry is facing a number of imminent and structural challenges including a lack of reliable data on migration and payment flows increasing KYC/AML compliance costs and high transaction costs which are still well above the 3% target set by the UN with its Sustainable Development Goals However the single biggest threat facing cross border money transfers today is de risking https //www worldbank org/en/news/press release/2018/04/23/record high remittances to low and middle income countriesin 2017 1 www bitspark io 3 of 14 \x0cDe risking refers to financial institutions exiting relationships with clients who are regarded as posing a high risk i e those that predominantly deal in cash It affects different types of organisations including money transfer businesses NGOs NPOs and SMEs Banks are traditionally resistant to disruption and seem more interested in preserving power than the prospect of financial inclusion Their continuing disengagement is constraining the future of the remittance industry and money transfers at large Considering that businesses providing cross border transactions are in direct competition with banks de risking is essentially a way for banks to secure their dominance Facing these challenges businesses continue to look for alternative means to serve the casheconomy That\xe2\x80\x99s because for the world\xe2\x80\x99s 1 7 billion unbanked the cash network is the only option to send and receive money The war on cash is a threat to cross border money transfers and therefore of major concern for families in developing nations It is the perfect problem for a crypto based solution In Perspective Target Markets Founded in 2014 Bitspark has been working to build an alternative system to address these challenges and remove dependency on banks Our journey began when we conducted the world\xe2\x80\x99s first ever cash in cash out money transfer using bitcoin and we have since refined our services to support a global network Bitspark\xe2\x80\x99s solution first and foremost addresses the exclusion of cash based economies with a focus on the emerging markets of Asia and Africa In these regions more than anywhere else cash is still the primary means of storing and transacting value For instance Indonesia is among the major cash based economies In fact it is the second largest cash based economy in the world With a population of 250 million only 36% of Indonesians have a bank account Credit cards debit cards and internet banking are used by 1% 8% and 5% of the population respectively This means that the majority of transfers both domestic and international are predominantly cash based 2 2 https //assets kpmg com/content/dam/kpmg/id/pdf/2017/01/id retail payments in indonesia pdf www bitspark io 4 of 14 \x0cThese figures correspond to other emerging markets in Asia and Africa where Bitspark is working to serve people and businesses to live and thrive without banks Bitspark s network serves the Philippines Indonesia Nigeria Ghana Vietnam and Pakistan since 2015 until now The Bankless Alternative The parallel financial ecosystem which we have built dramatically decreases the cost of money transfers increases efficiency and speed and

Effect Cross border money transfers The advantages of our bankless alternative become apparent in a side by side comparison of conventional channels and Bitspark\xe2\x80\x99s money transfer process within the same remittance corridor Let\xe2\x80\x99s asses this in the context of Sub Saharan Africa Sub Saharan economies are largely cash based with around a third of its population unbanked 3 Apart from global remittances regional remittances are both common and problematic Generally there are two options available to transfer money across borders via banks or through cash based retail channels such as Western Union Bank option Transferring money across borders through banks is an incredibly complex and opaque process The multi hop model of correspondent banks and currency exchanges causes friction delay and exorbitant charges The process is shrouded in mystery and customers have no clear visibility into how their money is moving across borders when it will arrive and how much it will cost Retail channel When it comes to retail channels the main problem with dominant service providers such as Western Union and MoneyGram lies not so much in its inefficiency but in the power they wield as monopolistic middle men These companies charge extortionate fees usually hidden in exchange rates The Bitspark Alternative In stark contrast our bankless alternative offers a completely new way of transferring money across borders utilising cutting edge technologies inclusive of the existing cash based economy The Bitspark ecosystem is both faster than the banking channel and more cost effective than its retail counterparts 3 https //globalfindex worldbank org/ www bitspark io 9 of 14 \x0cWith Nigeria as the main source of remittance inflows for Ghana 4 the Ghana Nigeria corridor serves as a case in point For our comparison we use global average fees for bank transfers and focus on Western Union due to its hold on retail Example Sending money from Ghana to Nigeria 4 Sending by Bank Transfer Sending by a Retail Channel Sending by Bitspark Time 5 10 Days Cost 11% Time 1 2 Days Cost 6 5% Time Seconds Cost 0% https //countryeconomy com/demography/migration/remittance/ghana www

York Times The Australian Coindesk and many more www bitspark io 13 of 14 \x0cStablecoins Best understood as price stable cryptocurrencies stablecoins are highly suitable for crossborder money transfers They are robust in terms of their ability to accommodate reasonable fluctuations and float on an open market Stablecoins are either fiat collateralised and trusted or crypto collateralised and trustless Fiat collateralised \xe2\x80\xa2 With this form of stablecoin each token is collateralised by an equal amount of fiat currency usually held by a central custodian Holders of these tokens are guaranteed to redeem their token at any point for the value in fiat \xe2\x80\xa2 The downside of this type of stablecoin is it that poses a counter party risk it requires a trader\xe2\x80\x99s good faith in third parties with regard to the presence of sufficient collateral that backs the stablecoin in question Crypto collateralised \xe2\x80\xa2 Crypto collateralised coins are backed up by reserves of another cryptocurrency This makes it possible to create decentralised and more trustworthy stablecoins To counteract the volatility of the reserve crypto pool the stablecoins are often over collateralised to absorb major price fluctuations \xe2\x80\xa2 Trustless stablecoins form the core of Bitspark\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem Specifically we use BitAssets which are backed up by 200% of BitShares\xe2\x80\x99 native token using smart contracts www bitspark io 14 of 14 \x0c
