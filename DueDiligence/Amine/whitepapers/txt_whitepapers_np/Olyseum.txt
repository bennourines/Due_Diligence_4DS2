 Abstract
 Olyseum is an ecosystem designed by sport stars to create a closer and more
 meaningful relationship with their fans In Olyseum stars will monetize their social
 influence and reward their fan’s loyalty Olyseum will allow stars to monetize
 audiences and fans to monetize engagement everything through a blockchainbased reward system and an ERC 20 utility token 
 For fans Olyseum is proposing a collaborative platform that allows them to earn
 tokens for their activity around stars in several social networks These tokens can
 then be redeemed through an exclusive experience exchange created by Olyseum
 and the stars as a means to be closer to them 
 For stars Olyseum helps them create a global community through which they can be
 closer to their fans and reward their support Stars will also earn a direct percentage
 of the overall advertising income of the network allow them to monetize all of their
 fans and their activity On the other side they are entitled to receive additional
 value by making available exclusive experiences for their fans and sharing them in
 their current social networks in exchange for tokens and other benefits 
 Launched by former FC Barcelona players Carles Puyol Andrés Iniesta and Iván
 de la Peña and in partnership with computer engineer and neuroscientist Carlos
 Grenoir and super hacker Kevin Mitnick in 2016 Olyseum aims to bring fans and
 their sporting stars closer with blockchain based token as the backbone of a new 
 innovative interaction model between fans their stars and brands

 1 1 Overview
 Keywords description product technology 
 tokens staking
 This document describes a proposed upgrade
 of Olyseum’s initial product that leverages
 blockchain technology to help fulfill the founder’s
 long term vision of recognizing users for their
 loyalty and engagement and providing them
 with value that can be used towards access to
 exclusivity from their beloved stars solving the
 common problem for very popular people of
 providing value to a large number of users 
 At the same time Olyseum involves the stars
 and the content generators in the finantial
 ecosystem around social value from a global
 perspective at a platform level 
 The OLY token shall be earned by fans by actively
 interacting with content and other social activity 
 and shall be then utilized to access exclusive
 merchandise offered in a newly launched
 exchange of curated experiences products and
 services built in the star communities Given the
 exclusivity and uniqueness of the marketplace
 offers acquiring them will require users to use
 tokens to access them 
 Once launched the new Olyseum platform shall
 combine the latest technologies with an ERC20
 token with the purpose of creating a new way of
 engagement between stars and their followers 
 1 2 Motivation
 Keywords genesis stars for fans
 Olyseum was born from the initiative of a group
 of globally recognized sport stars who frustrated
 with the available technology to interact with
 their fan base decided to take on the challenge
 of launching a platform created by stars for fans 
 Throughout their careers Olyseum co founders
 Carles Puyol Andrés Iniesta and Iván de la Peña 
 as well as many other sport stars built a massive
 and loyal fan base And while the last decade
 brought new technologies like social networks 
 which allowed them to enhance their global
 reach these networks did not fulfill their desire
 to establish closer ties with each fan In a way 
 they were able to increase reach but lacked
 engagement More importantly there was a
 common feeling that social networks were unfair
 to the fan base (and to them) keeping most of the
 value generated by them in the hands of a few
 market participants brands clubs advertisers
 and the networks themselves 
 In 2016 Puyol Iniesta and de la Peña met Carlos
 Grenoir and Kevin Mitnick (the world renowned
 security expert) who were exploring ways to
 solve the drop of engagement in social networks
 using reward systems Artificial Intelligence and
 other technologies including Blockchain 
 That meeting turned out to be the genesis of the
 first Olyseum version soft launched in 2016 by
 some of the biggest names in the sports industry
 in partnership with entrepreneurs with a very
 strong background in security and IT In its first
 iteration the Olyseum platform consisted of a
 mobile app that helped connect fans with their
 sporting stars providing exclusive content and
 offering several engaging features much like a
 specialized social network for fans 
 From February 2017 to February 2018 Andrés

 Iniesta personally used this beta version of
 Olyseum He spent time getting to know
 the members in the Comunidad Iniesta and
 personally published 397 posts inside Olyseum 
 During that period he received 16 291 likes
 from community members 713 shares within
 the Olyseum platform and created conversations
 that generated over 2 300 comments The first
 feedback test of Olyseum and Comunidad Iniesta
 on Facebook received almost 1 million likes in
 over eleven publications with over half a million
 likes and more that 6 600 shares coming from a
 single Olyseum video During this period Iniesta
 also launched contests and gave away the soccer
 boots he used during his 400th match for F C 
 Barcelona All of this on a private first beta version 
 Olyseum has experimented with this platform 
 testing reaching out to the fan base and other
 sport stars and looking at upcoming new
 technologies As a result of this experimental
 phase the Olyseum team has identified clear
 pain points on what we consider a thriving but
 broken industry and is with this in mind that is
 now presenting the addition of blockchain as the
 next evolution of the product focused on making
 fans feel closer to their stars through a unique 
 aspirational social commerce experience 
 1 2 1 How it all Started
 Inspiration from Carles Puyol
 All my career I have strived to reach what I
 envision for my team and to be the best example
 for others something indispensable for a captain 
 The goal most professional players aim for is to win 
 First placing values before results second trying
 to perpetuate the behaviors of success and for
 this you have to cultivate a method and train hard
 for it One of the things you learn is that success 
 in a team sport requires you to study the game 
 the tactics and to motivate the players on your
 side This is the type of discipline I want to share
 with my fans especially the youngest ones who
 are starting their sporting life For a long time now
 I have wanted to create a platform where I can
 share my knowledge through lessons challenge my
 followers through contests plan activities and help
 the people that have supported me all these years 
 a place where we can concentrate on what we truly
 passionate about sport” 
 Inspiration from Andrés Iniesta
 “I would love to have a place where the users
 who really feel my football those closest to me 
 those I can call my friends can communicate with
 me and share my experiences as friends I have
 always wanted to reward my fans for their support
 all of these years with some cool stuff from my
 professional life also a part of my economic success 
 But on other social networks it’s impossible there’s
 no way to do it That’s why I created my community
 on Olyseum Comunidad Iniesta”

 such as ESPN (US) continues to drop year on year 
 ESPN has seen its subscriber base reduced by
 12% in the last six years while Sky (UK) faced a
 decline in average viewing of live Premier League
 matches of 14% over the past season Ratings
 for primetime coverage of Rio 2016 compared
 to London 2012 also declined for NBC (US) by
 17% with a steep decline of 25% among the allimportant adults aged 18 49 segment According
 to the Advertising Association and WARC UK ad
 spending on mobile was higher than TV spend for
 the first time Total ad market growth was recorded
 at £5 4 billion demonstrating a 3 5% year on year
 growth the 17th consecutive quarter of market
 expansion Spending on TV saw a slight decline 
 but 30 7% increase to £1 3 billion spent is an
 impressive gain for mobile 
 Online social media is the main source of news
 for different age segments especially for those
 within the 18 to 44 years old segment leaping
 fast from TV to social media and other sources 
 1 3 The Opportunity Trends of a
 Broken Industry
 In the last 2 years we learned a lot about the
 relationship between fans and their sport stars 
 We also spent a lot of time evaluating industry
 trends and testing hypothesis of what could be
 improved in the market The following 3 key
 trends were key to inspire our next product
 evolution 
 1 3 1 A Huge Broken Traditional Sport
 Media Industry
 Keywords state of the art on demand mobile 
 social networks
 The global sport market revenue in 2017 was
 around 90 9 billion U S dollars 15 billion more
 than in 2013 and almost double 2005 revenue 
 According to a sport survey published by PwC in
 September 2017 the expected average annual
 growth rate by segments over the next 3 5 years
 is led by Broadcasting (8%) Sponsorship (7 1%) 
 Participation fees (6 6%) Ticketing (6 1%) and
 Licensing and Merchandising (5 9%) Sports in
 the digital world touches different audiences and
 formats such as the remarkable digital games
 industry in which for example the game FIFA
 18 has reached outstanding new sales records of
 over 300 000 copies sold in one week bringing
 the total retail sales to over ten million USD 
 As many industries the sports industry is
 transitioning into the digital space and facing
 many challenges during this process One of the
 biggest challenges is the shift in consumer behavior
 especially among the younger generation This
 is determined by how media is mostly being
 consumed nowadays with consumers preferring
 mobile devices and on demand services over
 broadcasted TV

 While all this data shows a shift in the traditional
 behavior of sport fans towards online platforms 
 stars who have built online audiences of
 phenomenal sizes are still lacking the right tools
 to help them maximize their brand value and
 let the fans interact with them in a meaningful
 way Existing social media companies do not
 see the stars who are the true owners of these
 communities as their partners and those who
 do manage to extract value from their audiences
 (the so called “influencers”) do so despite the
 networks they work with rather than because
 of them 
 1 3 2 The Unsocial Social Network
 Keywords growth unsharing unspecialized
 Industry specific social networks tend to be very
 active and engaging Reddit for example has
 achieved a high level of meaningful conversations
 within the Information Technology space and has
 developed a huge community of contributors 
 Other more generic networks like Twitter or
 Facebook had to find ways to break down their
 huge communities around shared interests as a way
 to keep them engaged (like groups in Facebook) 
 Yet they are so generic that they are not appealing
 to stars that carry large audiences Conversations
 in these networks tend to be short lived and they
 usually get lost in the depth of never ending feeds
 that receive very little attention More importantly 
 these channels are only able to share some small
 talk or chat but they lack tools for efficiently
 building and nurturing a solid fan base 
 The fans in turn feel disengaged The passion
 they show for their stars in the sports field does
 not translate to the online world and is turned
 into apathy becoming just “readers” or passive
 participants of whatever their “feeds” show them 
 The resulting communication system is isolated in
 a misplaced loop It becomes difficult for the stars
 to truly understand what their fans want or what
 moves them leading to the voice of their followers
 and supporters to get lost due to unidirectional
 and dysfunctional communication channels 
 Impersonal and non specialized social networks
 see their level of community engagement fall 
 and young users feel increasingly unmotivated to
 actively participate in these communities hopping
 from one social network to another as they get
 disengaged 
 Another problem identified by our founders
 is the way stars (and clubs) correspond and
 share their success with the fans who support
 and encourage them throughout their careers 
 Facebook Twitter and other social platforms
 benefit tremendously from the engagement 
 content creation and participation of their users 
 yet this benefit is rarely shared in any meaningful
 way with their rightful owners At Olyseum in
 contrast we are proposing to reward fans and
 sport stars for their activity and engagement
 around the content we create or publish This is
 even more relevant because fans are not looking
 for monetary value In fact what they crave
 the most can’t be measured with a monetary
 reward How much is an experience with your
 star worth What level of effort would a fan put
 in in order to be able to get a signed shirt a
 video or to share a dinner with a star What
 fans crave for is feeling closer to their stars 
 We believe the existing system is not fair and
 does not properly reflect the true potential of
 the fan star relationship This is why we created
 Olyseum we want to apply the latest available
 technology to help fans and stars improve
 their relationship on and offline and do so in a
 way that it is mutually beneficial After almost
 two years of experimenting with our app and
 our founders’ communities we concluded
 that adding blockchain and smart contracts
 technologies can help fix this broken system

 a way of knowing them better A fan of Carles
 Puyol knows that football is at the center of his
 life but he may not know that he likes to cook or
 that he enjoys skiing with the family or reading
 a specific book Learning about his tastes and
 activities or just receiving recommendations of
 activities that he likes can be a unique way of
 feeling closer to the star 
 At the same time statistics show that having a
 massive follower base does not automatically
 translate in engagement In fact some influencer
 marketers assure that the larger the follower
 base the less engaged they tend to be As a
 result marketers are less inclined to spend
 marketing budget on big stars and instead go
 with the smaller influencers to achieve a better
 ROI While this might be good for the up andcoming influencers it is not so good for the
 sport stars who have seen it harder and harder
 to monetize the enormous number of followers
 they have 
 1 3 3 The Rise of Social Commerce and
 Influencer Marketing
 It is no secret that people (and fans ) use social
 media networks to among other things discover
 things to buy Social networks like Instagram 
 Pinterest and the like have become sources
 of inspiration that drive sales According to a
 GlobalWebIndex survey the percent of Internet
 users who use social media to research or find
 products to buy increased by 20% between
 2015 and 2017 and time spent on these social
 channels is now over 2 hours per day 
 Just in Instagram over 1 5 million posts were
 tagged with #ad and influencer marketing grew
 by an estimated 200% Fitness & wellness were
 trending and made it to the top 10 industries 
 Another research firm Technavio estimates that
 annual social commerce revenues will exceed
 $165 billion by 20211 
 Sport fans are particularly prone to this type of
 social influence The reason is that knowing their
 stars tastes in products services and activities is

 2 Solution Overview
 2 1 The Proposed Platform
 Vision 
 To be the main hub between celebrities and their fans 
 Mission 
 Bringing celebrities closer to their communities 
 allowing them to monetize audiences and activity 
 Value Proposition 
 A unique social buying experience with an embedded
 blockchain based rewards and loyalty program
 thought for sport fans 
 At its core the proposed Olyseum platform is a
 tool that allows fans and stars to connect through
 content visualization plus social commerce with
 three major components 
 A Content feed where fans can access content
 from their preferred stars interact with these
 contents and obtain points 
 B Loyalty/reward program which consists of a set
 of rule based off chain point allocations combined
 with a set of on chain smart contracts that allocate
 and distribute OLY tokens and 
 C Products and experiences marketplace which is
 the place where tokens can be used or staked in
 exchange of exclusive access to unique and limited
 products and experiences such as collectibles 
 VIP access tickets and other experiences involving
 stars (meet & greets exclusive digital content 
 masterclasses etc ) 
 The goal is to build a platform that makes it very
 easy and fun for fans to identify and interact
 with as much content as possible available online
 related to their sporting stars At the same time 
 their engagement will be rewarded by a blockchainbased reward system that uses an ERC20 token
 to allow participants to reap part of the economic
 value created by their social interactions within
 and outside the platform allowing for powerful
 marketing and engagement features to be
 programed and tracked transparently 
 2 1 1 Actors of the Platform and their Roles

 2 1 2 Flow of the Rewards Distribution
 Keywords income from ads Olyseum fee token conversions budgets tokens
 distribution
 The following chart represents the expected flow of the OLY tokens through the
 system once the platform is completed 
 General flow 
 A Rewards are allocated through a transparent “Point” system (using the public
 blockchain as a way to ensure this transparency) to fans These points can later on
 be converted to ERC 20 tokens within the system (the OLY tokens) The source of
 the OLY tokens will depend on how the fans earned their points (a pool of tokens
 that is funded by advertisers/promoters that want to reward certain behaviours
 within the platform and a “native” token pool from the platform itself funded by
 the fees the platform collects from the marketplace sales) 
 B Fans can use their OLY tokens in the Marketplace in exchange of products and
 experiences created curated and promoted by stars and brands These tokens are
 then distributed (as revenue share) between the promoters (advertisers) endorsers/
 owners (stars) and the platform 
 C Fans can also decide to stake tokens instead of spending them In that case the
 staked tokens are locked in a contract for a certain period of time and then released
 for the original owners to recover them In return fans are granted special discounts
 (in fiat or tokens) and/or access to exclusive deals within the marketplace 
 12
 Description of a proposed flow2 from the
 different actors perspectives 
 User (Fan) flow 
 1 User finds about Olyseum (through a tweet
 or other social media from a star that is part of
 Olyseum’s network or through other marketing
 means) 
 2 User creates an Olyseum account sets up
 app and selects initial stars to follow 
 3 The app automatically creates an OLY token
 wallet and a content feed based on user’s
 preferences 
 4 As a user interacts with content or performs
 certain actions within Olyseum the platform
 awards her with points These points may be
 part of the native reward system and/or from
 specific campaigns that the platform and/or
 advertisers may launch from time to time (see
 the other flows) 
 5 After a minimum threshold of points is
 achieved the user can convert those points to
 OLY tokens 
 6 OLY tokens can then be stored withdrawn or
 used in the Olyseum marketplace 
 7 As fans become more active and get more
 system points their status on the network
 increases and they unlock new offers and/
 or access additional rewards and discounts
 available only to the most active users 
 Star flow 
 1 Star signs up into the Olyseum platform and
 sets up his community which includes curating
 marketplace products for his fans 
 2 Items offered in the star marketplace may be
 priced with a combination of fiat and tokens 
 Stars receives a percentage of the overall
 advertising income related to their fans and
 of the marketplace proceeds related to their
 experiences Another percentage goes to the
 platform (which is used to pay the experiences 
 cover costs and gain a profit) 
 3 Star may use his outside social networks to
 promote / recommend specific experiences
 and/or to encourage their fans to sign up into
 the platform These promotional activities are
 rewarded by the Olyseum platform with OLY
 tokens 
 4 Star may decide to use some of those tokens to
 incentivize certain activity within their Olyseum
 community using the native blockchain based
 rewards mechanism 
 Brand (advertiser) flow 
 1 A brand defines a budget for a specific
 campaign and sets up the rewards mechanics in
 the Olyseum platform 
 2 Olyseum platform creates the campaign and
 hashes the rewards rules into the blockchain 
 3 The Olyseum platform allocates points to
 the users that perform the activities that the
 brand wants to reward always following the
 rules established by the brand in the rewards
 mechanics 
 4 At the end of the campaign the reward
 mechanics are made public and anyone can
 validate them contrasting it with the hashed
 document in the blockchain 
 5 This gives absolute transparency to the brand 
 as well as to the users who can verify that they
 actually got the rewards they were entitled to 
 6 Points that are allocated to the user can be
 exchanged for OLY tokens at any time as long as
 the user achieved a minimum user category and
 the amount of points reach a minimum threshold
 that makes it economically viable 
 2 This flow is indicative of the current state of our approach and
 is for illustrative purposes only Final flow may differ from this
 design due to regulatory or commercial constraints 
 13
 2 2 Why Blockchain Technology 
 Keywords smart contracts new advertising
 models transparency
 The OLY token will be the centerpiece of a reward
 system for fans as well as a flexible mechanism
 to manage unique and innovative marketing and
 engagement engines 
 At launch Olyseum will publish and maintain
 a set of smart contracts that will manage the
 loyalty and reward system within the platform 
 These smart contracts in combination with
 some additional off chain technology shall
 allow certain platform participants (fans stars 
 brands and the platform operators) to set up and
 see transparent rules for how to receive and use
 OLY tokens within the platform 
 One of the key benefits of using blockchain
 technology for the reward system is that it can
 bring a lot of transparency to it This should be
 very relevant when in the future brands and
 communities decide to reward fans for specific
 actions within the platform For example a
 brand might want to reward those fans that
 engage with a specific content within the
 platform Yet if this is publicly disclosed there is
 a risk of cheating (fans would start liking content
 not because they actually like it but because
 they know that a particular brand will reward
 them disproportionately to do so) This would
 be detrimental as advertisers would feel they
 are not getting real attention or engagement 
 but rather just paid clicks It is well known that
 the advertising industry is prone to this kind of
 manipulation especially in performance based
 models like Pay Per Click (PPC) or Pay perAction (PPA) schemes 
 Olyseum proposes to use the public blockchain
 to solve this problem while at the same time
 ensuring that the rules of reward allocations are
 transparent and immutable The way this works
 is the following 
 First the advertiser might enter the campaign
 parameters in a private form within the Olyseum
 platform (total budget amount of tokens paid for
 each action within the platform duration etc ) 
 Once completed the Olyseum system encrypts
 these parameters and hash it into the Ethereum
 blockchain creating an immutable prove of the
 existence of these parameters but without
 revealing the parameters themselves yet 
 The Advertiser (or the platform if the adveritser
 paid in FIAT) would then fund the smart contract
 running the campaign with the equivalent OLY
 tokens to their planned budget causing the
 campaign to start 
 Olyseum as operator of the platform would then
 allocate points to each market participant that is
 entitled to them based on the parameters set up
 in the first step 
 These points would eventually be exchanged for
 OLY by their rightful owners To do so the system
 would recognize that these tokens were earned
 from the advertising campaign 
 The smart contract distributes the rewards
 following the original campaign parameters 
 Finally the hash is revealed and the specific
 information of the parameters would be open for
 anyone that wants to audit the right distribution
 of the rewards 
 In this way everyone can verify that they have
 actually been rewarded according to the rules
 of the campaign Yet by revealing this after the
 campaign is over we make sure that no users
 are inclined to game the system and modify
 behavior just to earn tokens 
 This is just one application of blockchain
 technology and as the Olyseum ecosystem
 grows we may test / propose new use cases 
 14
 2 3 Main Token Uses
 Keywords ERC20 utilities brands stars fans
 Behind all the flows described so far the
 Olyseum platform will have a native token called
 OLY that will aim to recreate the dynamics of
 a “circular economy” In a circular economy 
 the resources within it are exchanged back and
 forth among participants with minimum “waste”
 outside the system As the economy adds more
 participants to it and as participants increase
 their interactions / exchanges there’s a natural
 increase of demand for the means of exchange 
 which in this case is the OLY token 
 Additionally we are also adding the possibility of
 staking tokens instead of using them We believe
 this is important as we expect long term users
 of the platform to value the OLY token over
 time especially as the network of stars expand
 Fans Get rewarded with tokens when they
 engage with the content within their feeds
 and the communities they belong to and
 performing different activities within the
 platform 
 Acquire tokens from other market
 participants given that OLYs are ERC20
 and compatible with many different wallets 
 Use as access rights and means of payment
 for purchases made in the marketplace 
 Additional potential uses include bidding
 for exclusive auctioned products or
 experiences with their sport stars 
 For those that do not want to fully spend
 their OLYs the system will provide a series
 of token discounts in exchange of locking
 a certain amount of tokens into a staking
 smart contract that will hold the tokens
 for a certain period and then release them
 back to the original owner 
 In addition as users accumulate points
 in the system they may gain access
 to exclusive rewards (similar to airlines
 frequent flyer programs tiers) 
 Stars
 (endorsers)
 Receive tokens as partial compensation for
 the sale of products/experiences offered or
 endorsed in the marketplace 
 Receive tokens for promoting the platform
 and bringing new users and stars on board 
 Reward community members (fans)
 for active participation within their
 communities 
 Stars may also use their tokens to endow
 charity causes they want to support 
 While not contemplated at launch once
 the platform opens up to lesser known
 influencers staking may be a way for them
 to gain visibility into the platform 
 Advertisers
 (Promoters)
 May acquire tokens paid in FIAT to
 activate a specific campaign Tokens shall
 be acquired from the platform and/or
 third party exchanges when/if available 
 Fund specific ad campaigns using the
 tokens to reward certain engagement
 behaviors This can be done directly by
 them or transparently through Olyseum 
 Platform Olyseum will endow the platform with a
 large number of tokens to help kickstart its
 use 
 In addition the platform may collect a
 small transaction fee each time there is a
 transaction in the marketplace 
 Fund a “native” reward system which
 will promote engagement across the
 platform or within specific communities
 that require promotion 
 3 Holding or Staking means locking the tokens for a certain period in which the tokens cannot be accessed by the user Once that
 set time has passed tokens are freed up and can be re used to get another discount or consumed 
 and there are more opportunities to access deals
 that are more appealing to their fans The staking
 smart contract will receive tokens take them out
 of circulation for a while and then return them
 back to the original owners In a way it is similar
 to a time deposit In exchange the staking action
 shall grant the owner with a specific benefit (a
 temporary discount increased market visibility 
 etc ) and it may serve as a way to ensure delivery
 and quality of service in the future (as stakes can
 potentially be reduced by the system when a
 market participant misbehaves) 
 The goal is to have in place a system that allows
 the OLY token to be used at least as a means of
 value exchange and storage across this circular
 economy 
 The following chart summarizes some of the
 ways each market participant may acquire 
 spend or stake tokens

 2 4 Some Growth Strategies
 At Olyseum we believe we have a great
 working beta version for the platform and a
 clear vision of what needs to be built to deliver
 a functioning blockchain based social network
 focused on bringing stars and fans closer to
 each other Our immediate goal is to increase
 the number of stars and fans in our platform 
 as we work behind the scenes to release the
 new version and incorporate all the benefits
 provided by blockchain technology and smart
 contracts described in the previous section of
 this document While we do not plan to release
 or disclose a specific roadmap or marketing plan 
 we do have a few growth strategies that we can
 share like fostering a healthy competition across
 star communities through contests and other
 gamification techniques The idea behind these
 contests will be to establish engaging and fun
 ways to distribute a portion of the OLY tokens
 that Olyseum holds to the different stars and
 their followers incentivizing some competition
 and gamification 
 The reward system is the blood of the Olyseum
 platform In essence we are combining on and
 off chain technology to create a two tiered
 reward and loyalty system that will allow users
 (fans) to participate in a model that has clear and
 verifiable rules for earning storing and spending
 the native tokens 
 We believe that a good loyalty/rewards program
 should have the following characteristics 
 1 Clear transparent rules for earning points /
 rewards 
 2 An easy way to redeem points / rewards 
 3 Transferability to other participants when user
 no longer wants to use their points 
 4 Long term value for the most loyal participants
 With this in mind we’ve set up a series of design
 principles that we believe will position Olyseum
 in a great place 
 We will leverage established communities of
 fans through partnerships with sport stars that
 want to offer rewards to their followers (and
 to monetize them) At Olyseum our plan is to
 leverage already established communities of fans
 and their sport stars in all their social networks 
 We believe that fans will appreciate when their
 sport stars invite them to participate in a program
 that rewards them for their loyalty with the
 possibility to earn tokens that are redeemable for
 exclusive content experiences and more 
 From the fan’s point of view as long as their
 star has a social presence or makes the news 
 Olyseum will offer her the possibility to add the
 star to their feed even if the star is not yet part of
 the Olyseum platform 
 Once the star joins the platform a new marketplace
 will be created where the fans of that star will
 be able to access the curated products and
 experiences tailored for that star’s fans 
 For the sport stars joining our platform shall be
 risk free and shall be a very small commitment
 (just agreeing to create some exclusive products
 and experiences for their followers) Over time 
 though having a direct channel with their fan
 base and a way to reward their interaction shall
 make Olyseum a very engaging channel for those
 stars that want to keep a closer tie with their fan
 base Each star will monetize fan acquisition and
 fan engagement making it a very motivational
 fact for stars to migrate ther fanbase

 We will develop exclusive rewards initially
 focused on the sports industry In order to
 generate genuine value for the fans and for
 the OLY token the products offered in our
 marketplace need to be exclusive and fanoriented Olyseum is uniquely positioned to
 achieve this given the direct access we have to
 some of the world’s leading sport stars and their
 network Further initially specializing in sport
 fans will give us an edge over other experiencefocused companies 
 We will leverage blockchain technology but we
 will not abuse it In our view many blockchain
 projects commit the error of focusing too
 much in the technology and less on the user
 experience For us having a product that is
 beautiful and delivers on the promise to the
 users is key to succeeding All the powerful
 aspects of blockchain will be worthless if we fail
 to deliver an amazing experience to our fans and
 stars 
 We will listen to our users and iterate Although
 we have a clear vision of what needs to be built
 at launch we are also aware that decentralized
 technologies such as this require constant
 reviewing and adapting to the market 
 In sum the rise of the Ethereum blockchain
 and its smart contracts capabilities has opened
 up numerous new ways to share not only
 information but also value in a meaningful way 
 We believe that adding blockchain technology
 to a traditional rewards program provide a
 fast cost efficient immutable transparent and
 decentralized way of achieving this And while
 there are still some technological challenges
 around scalability the combination of traditional
 development with smart contracts running on a
 public network may bring trustless and efficient
 reward systems allowing secure exchange of
 information and value between parties that may
 not necessarily know or trust each other 
 We have spent a long time identifying different
 alternatives that would allow us to best leverage
 the current state of the blockchain technology
 in order to tackle some of the opportunities
 and trends we described above We are now
 ready with this launch to execute our vision of
 bringing fans and their stars together in a unique 
 engaging way where everybody gets rewarded
 for adding value to the community The future
 of fandoms has arrived And it’s called Olyseum 
 We hope you join

 to confer digital access rights to services and
 products within the Olyseum platform and related
 applications which provide a channel for major
 sporting personalities to have direct interactions
 with their fans and offer them rewards and
 exclusive content The Olyseum platform and its
 proposed main token utilities will have already
 been developed and fully functional at the time of

 purpose whatsoever and will neither be designed
 nor created as an investment product or a security

 can be used on a third party’s platform to acquire
 goods or services) under the AML or be deemed
 to be a “payment token/cryptocurrency” as such
