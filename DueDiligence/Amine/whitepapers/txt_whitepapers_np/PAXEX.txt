b ABSTRACT What is the point of having a forum or blog if it can t make money Beginners who start a forum or a blog realise too soon that forums and blogs are extremely difficult to monetise 9 in every 10 forums fail because a successful forum or blog needs a lot of traffic else earnings will be very low This is where PAXEX comes in PAXEX is a cryptographic currency built solely for forums and blogs PAXEX combines concepts from social interactions cryptocurrency marketing and the power to create apps within the PAXEX ecosystem All combined gives the FORUM administrator The power to develop applications that empowers the forum create polls and voting events that are user friendly and in turn earn money while doing it FORUM administrator The power to receive reward for activities on the forum and create a fair system to measure their input in terms of money \x0cINTRODUCTION PAXEX is built upon three foundation 1 BLOCKCHAIN The first layer is the PAXEX blockchain 2 API The second layer is the service API This technology can create wallets and enable spending track and report circulation of PAXEX coin Enable users to transact and store PAXEX coins 3 APPLICATION The third layer is the application built on the API They have power to a Introduce users to the world of cryptocurrency and connecting with thousands of PAXEX users b Provide services of news payments events with economic incentives to its users c The forum can communicate to its users If a forum cannot communicate its value to its users why should the users place on value on its services This paper will explore the incentives and demonstrate how PAXEX\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s may result in better revenue for most forums / blogs \x0cINTEGRATION PAXEX has robust features for developers With our easy Basic API secure wallets can be built for your applications with instant transfers real time notifications through web hook and web sockets giving your applications the needed push The following operations are supported Check Address Valid Create New Address Get All Address By AccountName Get Balance Transaction Send Fill Transaction History Testing \x0cTECHNOLOGY PAXEX (PAXEX) PAXEX is the fundamental unit of account on the PAXEX blockchain PAXEX is a liquid currency and can be traded on exchanges used as a form of payment API PAXEX API allows developers to access and integrate the functionality of PAXEX with applications built for forums and blogs Public documentation is available PAXEX provides a cryptocurrency and blockchain platform for hosting voting event community based functions and wallet services PAXEXLIVE (COMMUNITY SOCIAL MEDIA FORUM) PAXEXLIVE is a pay type contents forum It rewards contents creators to the forum Its implementation will be a working example for forums wishing to integrate PAXEX api into their forums PAXEXLIVE ACCOUNT There are 3 types of accounts Free Member This is a free membership role with restrictions to post creation of thread etc Member This is a membership role activated by the lockdown of certain amount of PAXEX coin in the forum wallet Full Member This is a membership role activated by the lockdown of certain amount of PAXEX coin in the forum wallet LOCKDOWN MECHANISM To reduce the circulating supply of PAXEX coins and hence maintain a stable price a lockdown mechanism is activated once a user registers on PAXEXLIVE \x0cTECHNOLOGY (CONTD) Free member (Lockdown = 0 PAXEX) Member (Lockdown = 20 PAXEX) Full Member (Lockdown = 50 PAXEX) Practical approach 10 000 member will result in 10 000 X 20 = 200 000 PAXEX coins pulled out of circulation and locked This will result in a decrease in supply and will cause price to be stable PAXEX WALLET A PAXEX wallet is a software program where PAXEX coins are stored MASTERNODE Masternodes are computers that run a PAXEX wallet and make decisions such as locking transactions with InstantSend coordinate mixing of coins and voting on budget funding Masternodes are required to have 5000 PAXEX collateral a dedicated IP address and be able to run 24 hours a day without a more than a 1 hr connection loss Masternodes get paid 80% of the block reward on every block which is distributed to masternodes one at a time \x0cINCENTIVIZED COMMUNITY WHY DO WE NEED THIS PROJECT Many blockchain project fail due to commercialisation of coins and blockchain For a blockchain project to succeed its coins must be applied in daily lives there is an obvious gap between the blockchain ecosystem and the developers of general contents/software Forum administrators have not been empowered to make the most revenue due to this widening gap Only option available to them include google adsense CPC and traditional advert banner placed on the homepage This puts the forum administrator in a big disadvantage once the forum generate low traffic Eventually the forum administrator loses interest and leaves the project PAXEX is designed to eliminate this gap as we will deploy numerous developers to build a wide range of application suited for forums and blogs Features to vitalize forum 1 BOUNTIES GIVEAWAYS AND AIRDROP Forum administrators can use the built in wallets to create bounties giveaways and airdrop to its current users Users perform task not limited to advertising and get paid directly into their wallets The immediate impact will increase traffic and more exposure for the forum 2 VOTING FEATURES Voting has become a big revenue earner for the big exchanges in the crypto world This technology utilises the power of a vote to generate revenue Forum administrators will literally have this power at their fingertips EXAMPLE OF VOTING IN ACTION Graviex exchange \x0cINCENTIVIZED COMMUNITY (CONTD) EXAMPLE OF VOTING GRAVIEX EXCHANGE Forum administrators can setup PAXEX voting address and have user vote on special events 100% earning from the voting event goes to the forum administrator 3 POLLS Polls survey the thoughts and ideas of the forum members Site Administrators can create polls and all members can participate in the poll This activity is a simple one but draws no revenue to the forum administrator PAXEX turns an ordinary activity like POLLS creation into a revenue generating activity In order words forum users will be charged for their participation \x0cINCENTIVIZED COMMUNITY (CONTD) 4 THE POWER OF A LIKE In the world of social media everyone feels good when they get a like PAXEX will revolutionise the lIKE to involve a coin value transfer associated with each like This will power the community and will be a passive income generator for most members USER AND FORUM CHARACTERISTICS 1 The user can create and own wallet for deposit and through this wallet the user can receive coins on the PAXEX blockchain network 2 Every user can create a wallet for withdrawal which can be used for direct withdrawal 3 Within the forum the administrator can provide coins according to internal rules of the forum based on activities such as login posting and tasks 4 Every member can donate coins to other members or give coins as a return for the comment and also receive coins from other users based on their activities 5 To upgrade membership certain amount of coins of a certain user can be locked in Such lock in can be used to stabilise the price and network 6 The forum has been designed to introduce its own fees The administrator of the forum can define a certain fee rate for the transactions between users in advance and can collect certain portion of the coin profits \x0cAPI INTEGRATED FUNCTIONS Initial APIs are basically limited to the forum List of basic API 1 Lock in Definition Lock in is to fix the change of state of the users membership for a certain period or until a certain event takes place 2 Generating coins Coins can be continuously distributed through participation in post thread creation and LIKEs 3 Creating a wallet address for deposit and withdrawal Creation and management of the forum s wallet address to receive coins of individual users DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND ROADMAP 2018 Q3 Listing on CREX24 GRAVIEX and CRYPTO BRIDGE Listing on MNO Fully functioning API Android wallet PAXEXLIVE launch API service website launch 2018 Q4 API integration on major forums and blogs PAXEX exchange launch \x0cCONCLUSION PAXEX provides peer to peer payment service as well as APIs that can easily be combined with various services Forum administrators will fill the power and be able to create and build application on top of our API Revenue creation is the goal and this can be done while doing what every blogger and forum administrator love doing GIVING THE WORLD A VOICE THROUGH THEIR FORUM \x0c
