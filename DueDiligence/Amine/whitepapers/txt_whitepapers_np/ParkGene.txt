 1 Executive Summary
 Imagine a world where your car takes you to where you’re going and drives
 away to go and park itself Imagine a world where your car using its own digital
 wallet pays for parking completely on its own 
 The future is bright and we are only getting started at PARKGENE 
 PARKGENE is a decentralized ecosystem where parking owners and drivers meet
 to conclude short term or long term parking rental contracts PARKGENE based
 on the Ethereum Blockchain combined with smart contracts will eliminate the
 dependence on centralized systems between the transaction participants and
 will significantly reduce the cost of parking for drivers while offering an
 alternative source of income to parking owners PARKGENE provides innovative
 approaches openness convenience and ease of use to enable the parking
 industry and its stakeholders to raise the quality of urban life to a whole new
 level 
 The ecosystem will be of interest to individual professional or municipal parking
 owners who are engaged in offering parking spaces as well as to the drivers 
 PARKGENE will create the most comfortable and straightforward conditions for all
 platform users to achieve their goals Furthermore due to its decentralized
 nature PARKGENE will offer all the tools to customize and streamline all
 operations according to specific needs and requirements 
 We believe that over time PARKGENE will offer a valuable solution not only in
 Western Europe and North American markets but also in other markets around
 the world that face congestion and parking problems providing a viable
 alternative that can help improve the entire parking industry 
 PARKGENE PTE Ltd is incorporated in Singapore and is wholly subsidiary of
 PARKGURU LTD (UK) a company that owns and operates an advanced omnichannel parking booking service (https //parkguru com) Today PARKGURU’s
 applications provide booking services and detailed information on millions of
 parking spaces located in Europe and North America 
 The introduction of PARKGENE will create an operational fork PARKGURU will
 remain focused on providing on street and off street parking sourced by
 municipalities and professional parking operators (garages) while PARKGENE will
 be a new product focused on efficient decentralized peer to peer parking for
 individually owned driveways and home garages 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 5
 2 Vision
 PARKGENE is a convenient and secure way to find parking connecting drivers 
 individuals and businesses 
 Our Vision is to disrupt the traditional – mainly off line – Parking industry sized
 at $100 billion annually and to provide drivers with a better parking experience 
 while helping cities become smarter and environmentally friendly 
 We aim to make parking in cities twice as easy and ten times as cheap We will
 establish the GENE token as a payment method for the automotive industry 
 allowing drivers to pay for parking and integrating it with mobility services 
 vehicles and automotive infrastructure 
 3 Parking Industry Overview
 3 1 Industry Overview
 In the present scenario the world is facing critical issues of traffic cramming with
 a significant rise in the vehicle population and congestion in cities and this has 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 6
 become an ongoing challenge for municipal councils and the traffic authorities to
 track and manage vehicular traffic 
 According to research by Frost & Sullivan[1] the worldwide parking industry is
 about $100 billion and is expected to attract institutional and strategic
 investments to the tune of $200 $250 million over the next 3–5 years mostly to
 spur innovation and smarter parking One big reason for this infusion of capital is
 to remove the inefficiencies in the ways that we currently park per recent
 findings 
 A 2011 study by Cisco[3] revealed that just within the US alone the total cost of
 personal transportation amounts to $3 trillion per year Parking represented a
 staggering 12 5 percent of this total or $374 billion This includes not only the
 actual cost to park but also associated inefficiencies such as the urban traffic
 created by people looking for parking With numbers this large it’s not surprising
 that automotive OEMs increasingly view parking as an important service that
 needs to be integrated within the vehicle’s telematics system to streamline
 efficiencies 
 In the coming years P2P parking will generate new opportunities globally for
 myriad commercial parking lots garages and residents to rent out their parking
 spaces with the aid of online marketplaces running over mobile and web
 platforms 
 3 2 On street & Off street Parking Market
 Until recently parking and innovation have mixed like water and oil This is
 largely due to the slow changing nature of the two headed parking industry 
 which is comprised of both on street and off street parking 
 On street parking represents about one third of all parking related revenue[1] in
 the US and is typically controlled by cities and municipalities These
 organizations are not the fastest moving when it comes to initiating technical
 change and while there has been progress within the realm of mobile payments
 at meters truly scalable innovative parking availability projects that help drivers
 find spots when they need them are few and far between 
 Off street parking represents about two thirds of all parking related revenue in
 the US and is largely owned by private enterprise and therefore theoretically 
 should be faster moving when it comes to innovation But even this segment of
 parking has been slow to change mostly because its fragmented nature 
 Despite the theoretical supply of parking spots sourced by Municipalities and
 Private Parking Operators drivers globally spend an average of nearly 20
 minutes per trip in pursuit of a parking space according to a 2011 IBM survey[4] 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 7
 This is a colossal waste of time and the concept of pre booking parking prior to
 arriving at a destination is still nascent Most people continue to drive around
 searching for a spot either on street or off street typically unaware of what
 parking inventory is available to them 
 3 3 Peer to Peer (P2P) Parking Market
 Parking in private garages and driveways is a massive market by itself 
 According to a research published by CNT (Center for Neighborhood Technology
 (CNT))[5] there is a huge supply of parking spaces totaling 61% of the number of
 residential units in Chicago when only half of them are occupied during night 
 According a study contacted by PARKGENE based on housing and driving data
 published by the US Census Bureau Eurostat and indexmundi com we estimate
 that the 100 biggest and busiest cities in the US and Europe generate a market
 of 20 million usable parking spaces and a potential revenue of 60 Billion USD 
 It is obvious that P2P Market is massive and its efficient utilization could result in
 tremendous benefits for the cities drivers parking space owners and the
 economy overall 
 Over the past two years several innovative startups (JustPark ParkEasier 
 CitiFYD) mainly in the US and Europe have launched services and apps focusing
 on P2P Parking offerings The P2P concept is simple Individuals buy and sell
 goods and services from one another In doing so they circumvent traditional
 businesses including parking operators 
 Nevertheless all these apps are still facing scaling issues and most of them are
 counting a few thousand users as their operational geographies are limited and
 global marketing is a big issue Transparency payment security high credit
 card processing fees regulatory and tax issues are some of the major barriers
 for all these startups to scale to become national or international champions 
 3 4 The Problem
 Parking imposes a significant burden on drivers and the wider economy One in
 three drivers abandoned their search for a parking space[6] at least once in the
 past year in pursuit of a coveted spot 
 The factors that predispose a city to congestion are the same as those that cause
 parking pain large and growing populations vibrant economies relatively cheap
 motoring and dense urban environments with limited land space 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 8
 The parking problem is compounded due to the lack of information many drivers
 simply don’t know where space is available increasing driver frustration and
 wasting time Just like congestion parking pain is costly For the individual
 driver the search for parking results in wasted time and fuel and incorrectly
 parking or running out of time can result in a parking fine 
 In the city the search for parking clogs intersections and city streets increasing
 traffic congestion The search for parking also worsens air quality as vehicles
 emit greenhouse gases into the environment 
 Generally off street parking rates reflect local market conditions and central
 locations in major cities of commercial political or cultural significance Similarly 
 local political and policy considerations generally dictate on street parking rates
 with many cities favoring relatively high on street fees to encourage high
 turnover and to support local business activity 
 In short parking pain extends far beyond the driver’s seat The economic cost of
 parking pain is quantified and monetized in terms of searching for parking 
 which results in wasted time fuel and emissions overpaying for parking and
 parking fines Several non economic costs are also quantified such as avoiding
 trips due to problems finding parking as well as increased frustration and stress 
 Standard parking charges are a cost of driving like fuel and maintenance but
 parking pain imposes an unnecessary economic burden in much the same way as
 traffic congestion does According to a recent market research conducted by
 INRIX Inc[6] the parking pain costs (time lost in search for parking parking
 fines fuel consumption etc) for drivers in the U S $95 7 billion a year drivers in
 the U K £31 2 billion and drivers in Germany €45 2 billion 
 To reduce these costs technology providers automakers cities and businesses
 are relying more on providing drivers with real time parking availability to ease
 parking pain But as cities grow bigger and busier while real estate value is
 rocketing parking spots in the city are becoming more and more difficult to find 
 3 5 Opportunity
 This is where PARKGENE comes in 
 PARKGENE’s decentralized technology will supply new parking spots in already
 crowded cities which now remain unutilized by enabling not only the Peer toPeer sharing but also the seamless integration of all competing parking
 technology solutions offered by the industry thus creating a functional
 marketplace 
 P2P marketplaces is not a new idea We have seen several successful
 applications in the lodging industry with companies like Airbnb or in the 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 9
 automotive industry with Uber and Lyft A few startups have already evolved in
 offering P2P Parking but scaling has always been a problem 
 We believe that PARKGENE will create the foundation where the whole P2P and
 Professional Parking Marketplace can operate seamlessly by connecting drivers 
 spot owners and Technology providers who offer park booking services on a
 robust blockchain infrastructure which utilizes the GENE Tokens (GENE) as a
 common mean of payment 
 4 What is PARKGENE 
 It’s a P2P Park Booking Provider
 To put it simply PARKGENE is similar to the “Airbnb for parking” We will
 connect people that own parking spaces with drivers who want to park provide
 additional parking spaces to the market and undercut the cost of high parking
 fees while providing an income source to all parking spot owners who rent out
 their driveways and garages 
 PARKGENE built on the Ethereum blockchain will be the first system which
 allows drivers and owners of parking spaces to transact with each other directly 
 Our aim is to create a more transparent and liquid way to park PARKGENE
 addresses both the short and long term parking rental markets by lowering fees 
 using decentralized conflict resolutions and making this market truly P2P 
 eliminating various middlemen and ensuring that reviews and listings are
 honest as they are stored on an immutable blockchain 
 It’s an Automotive Services Ecosystem
 But PARKGENE is more than just a P2P app for parking It’s an ecosystem and
 internal payment system that aims to connect the entire automotive industry in
 a mesh marketplace network 
 PARKGENE aims to develop to global automotive platform based on blockchain
 technology 
 PARKGENE will provide all the necessary tools to existing market service
 providers allow them to connect transact and build a growing global community
 that matches local supply and demand of parking spaces using the GENE 
 Initially establishing GENE Tokens (GENE) as a mean of payment for the parking
 industry will potentially attract numerous other relevant industries (car 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 10
 insurance tolls automotive services etc ) that could use our distributed ledger
 technology and start accepting GENEs as payment for services 
 5 PARKGURU’s Role
 PARKGENE’s founding team already owns and operates a successful parking app 
 This product is operated under the brand name PARKGURU
 (https //parkguru com/) PARKGURU works with parking garage companies and
 municipalities to provide an on street and off street parking solution 
 From the start PARKGURU was built with the intention of simplifying the way
 drivers access parking by building a core infrastructure that facilitates on street
 and off street parking A natural extension of PARKGURU is to leverage existing
 technology to build PARKGENE a decentralized parking solution for the
 blockchain era 
 The introduction of PARKGENE will create an operational fork PARKGURU will
 remain focused on providing on street and off street parking sourced by
 municipalities and professional parking operators (garages) while PARKGENE will
 be a new product focused on efficient decentralized peer to peer parking 
 The success of PARKGURU has provided proof of concept for PARKGENE What
 has already been developed will serve as a minimum viable product for
 PARKGENE to begin operations The contribution of PARKGURU to PARKGENE will
 not only be IT and infrastructure but also an introduction of PARKGENE services
 to more than 50 000 existing clients of PARKGURU and share of a PARKGURU’s 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 11
 talent pool of more than thirty engineers developers support sales and finance
 teams 
 6 How does PARKGENE work 
 Drivers looking for a parking spot meet virtually with parking owners through the
 PARKGENE app The following diagram shows the different stages of a parking
 session completed on the PARKGENE platform and over the Ethereum Blockchain
 with smart contracts 
 Once a driver reserves a parking spot the reservation triggers the PARKGENE
 smart contract on the Ethereum Public Blockchain 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 12
 The PARKGENE App transfers the full parking fee amount in GENEs from the
 driver wallet to a depository (a temporary wallet) Should there not be enough
 GENEs balance in the driver’s wallet the driver can use his credit card or other
 means of payment (Bitcoins Ethers) to buy GENEs real time and pay for the
 transaction 
 The successful reservation and payment provide additional App functionality to
 drivers and parking owners which is needed for the completion of the actual
 parking session For example the driver will have the ability to open the garage
 door from his mobile phone while the parking owner is notified and monitors –
 in live video – the entrance and exit of the vehicle This functionality is optional –
 although very helpful – and is achieved through integration of PARKGENE
 platform with existing remote access tools that are available in the market or a
 specific device that PARKGENE will offer to the Parking Space owners at very low
 cost 
 At the end of a successful transaction the parties conclude a smart contract on
 Ethereum with the entry and its confirmation on the blockchain 
 The parking space owners receive from the depository to their wallet 70 80%
 of smart contract in GENE tokens when drivers check out of the parking space 
 The remaining 
 • 5% of the total amount is paid to the driver and parking space owner as
 they perform several actions that enhance the ecosystem (e g Ratings 
 Reviews) 
 • 10 20% of the total amount is paid to PARKGENE to cover operational 
 development cloud services and advertising costs 
 GENE is available in a limited edition of 1 000 000 000 GENE Tokens 
 We are considering that the possible increase of users and number of smart
 contracts may increase the demand for GENEs among drivers resulting in a
 token that other service providers (i e Tolls Car Wash Car Insurance Tow
 Service providers etc ) will likely receive as payment for their services 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 13
 7 PARKGENE Features
 Reduction of High Parking Fees
 Existing platforms which are intermediaries in the parking industry take a high
 percentage as a commission At the same time P2P Parking economy is not fully
 implemented because there remains a middleman in the form of а booking
 service or agent that takes the role of а guarantor and arbitrator in resolving
 disputes and nonstandard situations At the same time several tax regulations
 restrict payment using FIAT currency from one user to another thus limiting the
 potential growth of P2P Parking economy growth in several places of the world 
 Research indicates that the world’s leading parking marketplaces charge a
 service fee of up to 20%[7] to the parking owner 
 Currently based on research from INRIX[6] the average cost for off street
 parking across 10 cities in the US is $15 51 for 2 hours We expect with our P2P
 solution to be able to reduce this cost by at least 50% a huge saving for drivers 
 while at the same time to double – at least – the availability of parking spots in
 cities resulting in numerous benefits for drivers reducing traffic congestion gas
 emission and overall improving the quality of living in big cities 
 Trusted Reviews & Rating – Incentives and Bonuses
 PARKGENE offers a system of bonuses that drivers and parking owners receive
 for making certain actions in the system an identification process a detailed
 description of the parking space adding photos writing reviews etc Putting
 ratings on the economic rails will allow drivers to receive more profitable offers
 and save money 
 The parking owners receiving reviews and ratings will be able to reach the full
 level of their real load much quicker and thus earn more money since even
 lower rated ads get higher rental loads than those which do not have reviews at
 all For each feedback both driver and the parking owner will collect GENEs 
 which they can use in the future The size of the bonus is determined by both
 the rating given by the opposite side as a review and by the duration of use 
 Users will be able to receive up to 5% of the parking fees paid back in the form
 of bonuses instantly received after they perform an action in our ecosystem 
 Security Measures
 PARKGENE values the security of both the parking space owners (who provide
 access to their premises) as well as the drivers who park their cars There are
 several measures we have put in place to manage all these security issues 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 14
 There are different stages where security measures are applied 
 • Account ownership and access
 The most common security breach is when a scammer or other bad actor
 takes control of someone’s account by obtaining the password Normally 
 this would mean access to someone’s email or the ability to make
 purchases on their behalf But in the case of PARKGENE it could mean
 giving a stranger access to private details about your home parking space
 and the ability to rent it out to others 
 Multi Factor Authentication is implemented to prevent account takeovers 
 PARKGENE will require both hosts and guests when logging in from new
 devices to verify their identity with a second account either via SMS or
 email This policy is common among a clear majority of other social and
 communication apps that use multi factor authentication including
 Facebook Google etc 
 Predictive models trained using machine learning techniques look for
 uncharacteristic behavior to flag for instance if the account is seeing an
 abnormal number of login attempts or a login from a foreign country 
 PARKGENE system will ask for an additional confirmation that the person
 logged in is truly in good faith 
 In addition to multi factor authentication PARKGENE is also adding SMS
 alerts Push Notifications and Email alerts to let people stay up to date
 about changes made to their account in the event a stranger has gained
 access and starts tinkering with settings 
 • Physical Access to the Parking Spot
 Check In Process To provide additional security and increase the level of
 loyalty and trust between the driver and the parking owner When the
 driver checks in the parking owner (or the PARKGENE Service) gives the
 driver the “digital keys” (or the remote control) and uses the mobile
 application to either scan the QR code or even press the “Open Garage
 Door” button from the driver’s phone screen This feature is optionally
 implemented with PARKGENE Internet Door Opener (PIDO) or any other
 world class garage door opener manufacturers such as Chamberlain 
 Nortec and others 
 Check Out Process When the driver departs from the parking space the
 digital keys are deactivated and the check out is confirmed to the system 
 Monitoring and Auditing of Parking Session Depending on the situation 
 the Parking Owner and the Driver may have access to video recording of
 the Parking session which is securely stored for 1 year on PARKGENE’s
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 15
 platform and available to anyone who has the link and the authority to
 view it This feature is implemented with the use of any Video Camera
 connected with the parking space account and it is extremely helpful to
 both users to resolve any issue that may arise 
 • Financial transactions
 Financial transactions conducted over the PARKGENE platform are secured
 in multiple ways 
 PARKGENE offers high level of Wallet Security to both drivers and Parking
 Owners who transact with each other All GENE Tokens including additional
 cryptocurrency (Bitcoin Ether etc ) stored in wallets are pooled and
 securely stored in different wallet layers such as Hot and Cold Storage
 Multi Sig Wallets so the risk of hacking is minimized 
 PARKGENE parking session fees are managed by the PARKGENE parking
 smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and the funds are
 distributed to the stakeholders automatically after the end of each parking
 session All funds distribution is traceable through Etherscan 
 Transactions with FIAT currency which is automatically exchanged to
 GENE tokens for the completion of a parking session are handled through
 Credit Card processing providers who comply with the highest levels of
 Banking Security measures such as PCI DSS etc PARKGENE does not hold
 any type of Credit Card information but in special cases it may require
 basic KYC (Know Your Customer) verification which will be completed
 electronically and takes less than 1 minute to complete 
 8 Business Model
 8 1 Revenue Model
 PARKGENE offers an easy way to understand monetization model 
 The PARKGENE service is monetized through commissions charged for parking
 spots offered by individuals Depending on the region the commission ranges
 from 10 to 20% of the cost of the service 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 16
 Currently in the European and US markets where the PARKGURU service is
 already up and running successfully 15% of the commission is being charged 
 The same rate has been confirmed in the China Singapore and other regions 
 Rates are calculated automatically and are consolidated within each region This
 ensures that customers are receiving the best service possible for the best price 
 8 2 Strategic Goal
 We expect that parking spots from individuals will be much cheaper than
 professional parking garages Moreover this supply of spaces will augment the
 existing supply Below we describe the “ultimate” scenario and our vision of what
 we want to accomplish in the industry 
 “Make parking in cities 2 times easier and up to 10 times cheaper ”
 How Here is how we will do it 
 Double the number of parking spots in cities New P2P spots entering the parking
 market will help drivers find parking easier (2x easier parking) 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 17
 Offer P2P parking spots at half of the professional parking spot price 
 New P2P spots entering the parking market will create a new cheaper pricing
 layer against the professional parking operators (2x cheaper parking) 
 Further reduce the actual parking spending by 80% In the optimum situation
 where a driver rents a P2P spot for $5 0 when at the same time receives $4 0 by
 letting his private parking spot to others (5x cheaper parking) 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 18
 8 3 Strategy
 Our team is already serving more than 50 000 drivers in the professional Parking
 business With the introduction of PARKGENE P2P parking offering we aim to
 aggressively expand in Europe North America and Asia 
 Our strategic expansion plan is based on three major pillars 
 • Organic development 
 • Acquisitions 
 • Strategic Partnerships 
 Organic development
 With the Beta version coming out in February 2018 we aim at establishing an
 immediate foothold through an aggressive marketing campaign and we will be
 targeting specific cities 
 We have identified several cities where parking problems are severe and we feel
 we can bring value to the drivers 
 • Athens Greece is our obvious target as we already have 50 000+
 users on the PARKGURU app and our intention is to provide them
 instantly with a cheaper parking alternative 
 • The United Kingdom and more specifically London and Manchester will
 be the next Airbnb has paved the way for P2P services and we
 strongly believe that PARKGENE will be adopted by the British parking
 owners and drivers 
 • Russia ranks exceptionally high on our list We will focus our efforts in
 Moscow and St Petersburg With Russians playing an integral part in
 the cryptocurrency industry we believe that our product will be easily
 understood and adopted 
 • Other European cities will follow Paris and Marseille (France) Rome
 and Milan (Italy) Barcelona (Spain) Warsaw (Poland) Bucharest
 (Rumania) are cities facing high congestion levels and are part of our
 expansion plan 
 • North America The importance of the North American market is
 massive given the size and the levels of spending in parking services 
 Our business plan relies on initially offering our service in cities like
 Chicago Los Angeles and New York 
 • Furthermore we aim to establish our presence in other parts of the
 world and more specifically we will target Bangkok (Thailand) 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 19
 Istanbul (Turkey) Shanghai Beijing and Guangzhou (China) and
 Mexico City (Mexico) 
 • Last but not least Japan Crypto currency fever is strong in this area of
 the world and given congestion levels in Tokyo and Osaka we
 anticipate strong application adoption here 
 Acquisitions
 Given the inefficiency of the parking industry and the fact that many smaller
 companies are trying to enter and offer similar services we aim to consolidate
 the market through the acquisition of regional players 
 We intended to use operational proceeds to extend our geographic footprint 
 thus we could offer our services in many other countries 
 We expect that this consolidation will provide us with enough momentum to
 build a global brand and attract additional users while in the meantime
 supporting our organic development 
 Strategic Partnerships
 Beyond possible acquisitions we plan to build strategic partnerships and work
 with regional players in the parking and automotive industry that will use and
 integrate the GENE token in their platforms 
 In order to provide our users with best services we will try and create
 partnerships with companies in other areas of the automotive industry making it
 possible for GENE token holders to use the token for services beyond parking 
 9 Token Sale
 During the Token Sale PARKGENE PTE Ltd will issue a crypto token called GENE
 Token (GENE) on the Ethereum blockchain operated by a smart contract which
 will be made available to buyers globally excluding Restricted Persons 
 • GENE (GENE) – ERC20 token with a limited release

 • GENE (Token Sale Base Price) = $0 10
 • Total GENE 1 000 000 000
 • Token Sale Hard Cap 350 000 000 GENE
 • Accepted forms of payment BTC ETH BCH LTC DASH and USD
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 20
 9 1 Why Token Sale 
 There are many reasons we have decided to hold a Token Sale instead of
 alternatives ways to sell products and receive money 
 A Token Sale offering allows us to onboard participants from different regions
 that will potentially be users of the platform either as parking owners or drivers 
 Lastly the tokens’ smart contract enables the distribution of parking fees to
 parking owners and payment of weekly revenue share and incentives that would
 be hard to process without usage of blockchain technology

 14 Risk Factors
 The purchase of GENE tokens involves a high degree of risk including but not
 limited to the risks described below Before acquiring GENE tokens it is
 recommended that each participant carefully weighs all the information and risks
 detailed in this Whitepaper as well as the information and risks available from
 other sources 
 Dependence on Computer Infrastructure PARKGENE’s dependence on
 functioning software applications computer hardware and the Internet implies
 that PARKGENE can offer no assurances that a system failure would not
 adversely affect the use of GENE tokens Despite PARKGENE’s implementation of
 all reasonable network security measures its processing center servers are
 vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other
 disruptions of a similar nature Computer viruses break ins or other disruptions
 caused by third parties may result in interruption delay or suspension of
 services which would limit the use of the GENE tokens 
 Smart Contract Limitations Smart contract technology is still in its early
 stages of development and its application is of experimental nature This may
 carry significant operational technological regulatory reputational and financial
 risks Consequently although the audit conducted by independent third party
 increases the level of security reliability and accuracy this audit cannot serve
 as any form of warranty including any expressed or implied warranty that the
 PARKGENE smart contract is fit for purpose or that it contains no flaws 
 vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the complete
 loss of GENE tokens 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 38
 Regulatory Risks Blockchain technology including but not limited to the issue
 of tokens may be a new concept in some jurisdictions which may then apply
 existing laws or introduce new regulations regarding blockchain technologybased applications and such regulations may conflict with the current PARKGENE
 smart contract setup and GENE token concept This may result in the need to
 make substantial modifications to the PARKGENE smart contract including but
 not limited to its termination the loss of GENE tokens and the suspension or
 termination of all GENE token functions 
 Taxes GENE token holders are solely responsible for determining if the
 transactions contemplated herein are subject to any applicable taxes whether in
 their home country or in another jurisdiction It will be the sole responsibility of
 GENE token holders to comply with the tax laws of any jurisdictions applicable to
 them and pay all relevant taxes 
 Force Majeure PARKGENE’s performance may be interrupted suspended or
 delayed due to force majeure circumstances For the purposes of this white
 paper force majeure shall mean extraordinary events and circumstances which
 could not be prevented by PARKGENE and shall include acts of nature wars 
 armed conflicts mass civil disorders industrial actions epidemics lockouts 
 slowdowns prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or
 communication service acts of municipal state or federal governmental
 agencies other circumstances beyond PARKGENE s control which were not in
 existence at the time of white paper release 
 Disclosure of Information Personal information received from GENE token
 holders the information about the number of tokens owned the wallet
 addresses used and any other relevant information may be disclosed to law
 enforcement government officials and other third parties when PARKGENE is
 required to disclose such information by law subpoena or court order 
 PARKGENE shall at no time be held responsible for such information disclosure 
 Value of GENE Tokens Once purchased the value of GENE tokens may
 significantly fluctuate due to various reasons PARKGENE does not guarantee any
 specific value of the GENE tokens over any specific period PARKGENE shall not
 be held responsible for any change in the value of GENE tokens 
 No Guarantee of Income or Profit PARKGENE does not guarantee any
 income or profit from GENE tokens because GENE tokens are only intended to be
 used within PARKEGE system and do not have any value beyond it PARKGENE
 does not in any way whatsoever guarantee any income or profit from PARKGENE
 services It shall be your sole responsibility to weigh all the available information
 and risks prior to using PARKGENE services PARKGENE shall not be liable for
 any potential loss or damages 
 PARKGENE | White Paper | V 18 25/01/2017 Page 39
 Risk of Insufficient information GENE tokens PARKGENE’s platform and the
 project are at a very early developmental stage and its philosophy consensus
 mechanism algorithm code and other technical specifications and parameters
 could be updated and changed frequently and constantly While the Whitepaper
 contains the up to date key information related to GENE token at the date of the
 Whitepaper it is not complete nor is final and is subject to adjustments and
 updates that PARKGENE may make from time to time PARKGENE is not in a
 position nor obliged to report on every detail of the development of GENE
 tokens (including its progress and expected milestones whether rescheduled or
 not) and therefore will not necessarily provide timely or full access to all the
 information relating to the GENE tokens but will use reasonable efforts
