spending for the combined theatrical and home entertainment markets reached $88 4 billion worldwide up from $81 9 billion in 2016 There are over 170 000 cinema screens (+8%) around the world and 777 \xef\xac\x81lms (+8%) were released in North America in 2017 The MPAA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin commented \xe2\x80\x9cWith more stories and more storytelling mediums than ever our industry continues to adapt to an ever changing world \xe2\x80\x9d $90 $80 $70 $60 $50 $40 $30 $20 $10 $0 $35 91 $12 30 $36 43 $15 12 $38 42 $38 82 $40 58 $24 53 $24 53 $32 12 $15 68 $29 76 $25 85 $21 00 $18 55 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Global Theatrical and Home Entertainment Consumer Spending (US$ Billions) Theatrical Digital Home Entertainment Physical Home Entertainment Source IHS Markit Physical includes rental and retail Digital includes Electronic Sell Through(EST) video on demand(VOD) and subscription streaming(pait subscribers only) Subscription streaming does not include spending from sports While the overall market is growing the industry is also dominated by conglomerates with a vertical integration among three phases production distribution and exhibition This integration causes barriers in the industry such as biased screen allocation as the business is mainly focused on obtaining a wider audiences for stronger revenues The \xef\xac\x81lmmakers and audience are the main victims from this e\xef\xac\x80ect The \xef\xac\x81lmmakers are asked to produce \xef\xac\x81lms only with a high probability of commercial success The consumers\xe2\x80\x99 right to enjoy various and free choice of content is lost MovieBloc\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to solve those problems with its blockchain technology The creators will get transparent revenue share audience data and equal screening opportunity the viewers will access various \xef\xac\x81lms & content In the long term MovieBloc will create the biggest and most participant centric \xef\xac\x81lm ecosystem By co working with KMPlayer a multimedia player with over 300 million users MovieBloc will not only provide \xef\xac\x81lm producers with an equal opportunity to create and show their \xef\xac\x81lms but also bring various movies at a reasonable price to MovieBloc users MovieBloc is di\xef\xac\x80erent from previous \xef\xac\x81lm related ICO projects These projects have focused on removing middleman and providing direct distribution channel between the creators and the audiences However this model has gave the creators more roles and responsibility of promoting and exporting their works to the audiences MovieBloc seeks to create an ecosystem with all \xef\xac\x81lm distribution participants (translator designers curators reviewers etc ) instead of becoming a simple content platform with content providers and consumers 5 \x0c2 Current Film Industry Houston we have a problem Apollo 13 (1995) \x0c2 Current Film Industry 2 Current Film Industry 2 1 Industry Oligopoly & Vertical Integration The movie theater industry is composed of three vertical layers production distribution and exhibition In America the big six conglomerates and a few major studios show strong presence in production (investment) and distribution in other countries conglomerates can control exhibition as well such as South Korea Net\xef\xac\x82ix and Amazon Prime Video are focusing on vertical integration by owning its original content and using their distribution system to deliver that content to its subscribers Accordingly consumers have no access to content that these institutions choose not to invest in A few powerful corporations with strong capital are thus limiting the consumers\xe2\x80\x99 right to enjoy various content and the \xef\xac\x81lm producers\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity to release their work to the wider public 2 2 Limited Funding Opportunities Major studios invest in \xef\xac\x81lms and look into the scenarios directors and actors for one goal box o\xef\xac\x83ce hits The directors and \xef\xac\x81lmmakers must implement the commercial centric ideas into their \xef\xac\x81lms to reach a wide audience This limits \xef\xac\x81lm producers\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of expression and the \xef\xac\x81lm market to be supplied with mainly standardized \xef\xac\x81lms In order to fund their work without the investors interference \xef\xac\x81lm producers have to either make an independent \xef\xac\x81lm on low budget or receive help from crowdfunding Even if the production is \xef\xac\x81nished pro\xef\xac\x81tabilty is di\xef\xac\x83cult to achieve due to limited budget di\xef\xac\x83culty of securing screens exporting and marketing of the \xef\xac\x81lm 2 3 Revenue Problem It is extremely di\xef\xac\x83cult for independent \xef\xac\x81lms to be regularly shown at movie theatres outside of \xef\xac\x81lm festivals After the theatrical release VOD is another pro\xef\xac\x81table market However blockbusters are once again gain the vast majority of pro\xef\xac\x81ts As for short \xef\xac\x81lms and independent \xef\xac\x81lms revenue share agreements with VOD services are being handled in adverse conditions due to a weaker bargaining power YouTube another monetizing option requires the channel to have 4 000 hours of annual viewing time and over 1 000 subscribers in order to receive ad revenue Thus independent \xef\xac\x81lmmakers resort to uploading their content on YouTube for free as a way of sharing their portfolios As you can see there are no platforms providing a fair revenue share to the creators 7 \x0c2 Current Film Industry 2 4 Nontransparent Revenue Share and Date The recipient is unable to verify the accuracy of the data The sheet does not disclose how revenue was a\xef\xac\x80ected by discounts promotions marketing nor viewers\xe2\x80\x99 data (device age gender) Sales reports with no transparency or veri\xef\xac\x81cation method creates low credibility in the business creators without audience information disables any viewership insight from their content production 2 5 Limitation of Film Distribution It may seem like the advanced online streaming technology has provided audiences with a wider selection of \xef\xac\x81lms but the centralized distribution infrastructure has yet to change and is still a strong barrier for indie \xef\xac\x81lmmakers to go abroad Every year countless \xef\xac\x81lms are produced and recognized for their quality at international \xef\xac\x81lm festivals but the di\xef\xac\x83culty of \xef\xac\x81nding distributors in each country limits the \xef\xac\x81lm producers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to deliver their work to the audience 8 \x0c3 Solution Where we re going we don t need roads Back to the Future (1985) \x0c3 Solution 3 Solution 3 1 Decentralizing the Film Industry MovieBloc will decentralize the \xef\xac\x81lm industry to create an ecosystem with transparent rewards catered to the participants\xe2\x80\x99 role and contribution Participants will experience a new ecosystem by taking upon the role of a creator curator translator reviewer viewer etc Other blockchain based \xef\xac\x81lm projects primarily focus on maximizing the pro\xef\xac\x81t of the CP (content provider) and rewarding the audience MovieBloc di\xef\xac\x80erentiates itself from other projects as it comprises of production marketing and translation activities all done by MovieBloc participants 3 2 Supporting Creators MovieBloc will run blockchain based online festivals to discover quality movies and talented new creators The festival will be held every quarter and give out rewards worth 10 000 USD to the contest winners Producers can attain recognition and monetary reward from the festival which will motivate them to continually upload high quality movies on MovieBloc Also the creators can raise money to produce \xef\xac\x81lms from viewer donations In return the creators can provide special content such as unreleased director\xe2\x80\x99s cut or pre release \xef\xac\x81lms to donators 3 3 Creators Pro\xef\xac\x81t Guaranteed The creator is guaranteed up to 90% of the revenue at MovieBloc The creator can set the price exhibiting period and areas the conditions will be applied without any approval process The curators\xe2\x80\x99 advertising translators\xe2\x80\x99 foreign subtitle and designers\xe2\x80\x99 marketing material will enable the \xef\xac\x81lm to be distributed to diverse nations and boost creator earnings 3 4 Transparent Reward and Data MovieBloc rewards creators transparently according to the blockchain based smart contract once the creator uploads and users purchase the content Creators are provided with insights from their followers and viewer data such as gender age and tra\xef\xac\x83c source The insight will help creators to develop and cater content in order to satisfy their audience 10 \x0c3 Solution 3 5 Worldwide Screen MovieBloc MovieBloc will collaborate with KMPlayer to deliver \xef\xac\x81lms to

Translator Designer Design Market Fig 8 MovieBloc Market 4 4 1 Content Market Users can watch movies in two ways TVOD and AVOD TVOD (Transactional VOD) With TVOD consumers purchase content on a pay per view basis for a limited or permanent time In consideration of the token price volatility the price of content will be the median value of the three exchanges with the largest transaction volume of \xef\xac\x81at currency and MovieBloc token The pro\xef\xac\x81t will be shared by the creators and curators after deducting server fee such as CDN and cloud service fee AVOD (Advertising VOD) AVOD is an advertising based revenue model allowing users to watch the content for free Although advertising based content are widely distributed to the users only a platform that fully understands and can coordinate each country\xe2\x80\x99s eCPM2) \xef\xac\x81ll rate and advertising cost can operate successfully 2) E\xef\xac\x80ective cost impressions Total revenue divided by total impressions

Trade Contract Data Validation Hash Manager Fig 10 MovieBloc Architecture 5 1 Platform Structure MovieBloc shares a portion of the platform from existing services including KMPlayer MovieBloc will drive its blockchain service based on the stability and performance from existing services MovieBloc consists of three layers in order to have blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s transparency and security features and existing service\xe2\x80\x99s high performance and scalability 23 \x0c5 Architecture 5 1 1 Application Layer The Application Layer is the entry point for MovieBloc users and provides the ability for participants to intuitively and securely access the service MovieBloc users can easily participate in the platform and exchange various information Each participant can use the Application Layer to access blockchain and try various services available at the Service Layer The Application Layer provides applications and wallet module for key information management 5 1 1 1 Wallet On the Ontology main network a private key is required to access user accounts The wallet module is a system that securely manages key information essential for users to use Ontology network Users private keys provide secure transaction signing without being exposed to the external environment This provides participants with secure and stable managment of contracts that occur within MovieBloc The wallet module guarantees closed operation and provides a security function to prevent personal information from being leaked 5 1 1 2 KMPlayer KMPlayer plays various formats of media without any conversion process through its built in codec Speci\xef\xac\x81cally it is optimized for 4K HDR high de\xef\xac\x81nition video playback and VR KMPlayer supports the playback of various content and can be used on various devices such as mobile and PC and supports download contens and streaming Users can play diverse content provided by MovieBloc in various forms through KMPlayer 5 1 1 3 BLOC BLOC is composed of web and mobile app for service and uses API of an asynchronous service layer 24 \x0c5 Architecture 5 1 2 Service Layer The Service Layer is the core aspect of MovieBloc It connects the Application Layer with the Decentralized Core Even if the participants do not run the Ontology Node directly the transaction can be propagated to the Ontology main network through the Ontology Node provided by the Service Layer Most of the information on the service is stored and processed in the Service Layer and blockchain technology is used for transparent secure transactions and data validation 5 1 2 1 Blockchain Node The Blockchain Node is a module connecting the Decentralized Core and the Service which provides all the functions related to the blockchain to participants It is responsible for accessing the data accumulated in the Decentralized Core in order to verify the key and signature information of participants accessing the platform The contract manager manages all contracts that occur within the platform and guarantees rewards for the platform participants It also monitors all transactions occurring within the platform and manages access rights when a participant sends a request for a transaction in the Application Layer 5 1 2 2 Data Module The Data Module stores and controls a centralized database that stores large amounts of data and complex analysis results which are di\xef\xac\x83cult to store in a blockchain The Data module will collect and indexe information from blockchain e\xef\xac\x83ciently and complements the technical limitation of Ontology main network Sensitive information unable to be uploaded on blockchain like personal information is managed by a separate security database with restricted access 5 1 2 3 Service Module The Service Module organically connects the three layers of BLOC Market and Festival provided by MovieBloc according to the type of participant The Service Module enables each layer to smoothly provide services to participants Transmitting data produced by participants in layer activities to the Token Module leads to the correct formation of token reward and token economy 5 1 2 4 Global CDN CDN is a network that is required for e\xef\xac\x83cient delivery of content to each user In order to solve the bottleneck of transmission that can occur when tra\xef\xac\x83c is concentrated contens are distributed and cached to a plurality of CDN nodes for quick delivery The existing CDNs will increase the e\xef\xac\x83ciency of content distribution and applied to the decentralized CDN of Theta Network In particular Theta s CDN improves on demand VOD quality while reducing the backbone usage of traditional CDNs through a hybrid architecture 25 \x0c5 Architecture 5 1 3 Decentralized Core The Decentralized Core is a system that transparently manages token \xef\xac\x82ows occuring between platform participants Creators record and manage all data related to content in the blockchain such as content registered in MovieBloc content related information price etc Based on the recorded data it manages the token \xef\xac\x82ow between participants and creators allowing for transparent management of the token economy formed within the platform This is increases platform activation and stabilization 5 1 3 1 Token Module The Token Module manages the token economy \xef\xac\x82ow generated through the activities of the users participating in the platform as a whole It manages the token reimbursement policy paid according to the user s activity and the token staking by the curator to secure individual theaters The token contract manages the token \xef\xac\x82ow book arising from the platform participants and provides the transfer function for smooth transactions The Token Module enables decentralized token economy operations 5 1 3 2 Membership Membership is a system that records and manages the information of the participants within MovieBloc Participants personal information is not recorded in the module only the relationship between users is recorded This restricts access to data and allows only those with rights to create or manage featured data Their relationship consists of a mesh 5 1 3 3 Content Various content is uploaded to MovieBloc such as movies and foreign subtitle \xef\xac\x81les If the content is not properly managed the platform usage frequency will be signi\xef\xac\x81cantly decline This part is a system for managing information related to such contens When creators and translators enter their content information they are recorded in MovieBloc through the system and saved through smart contract when setting prices Trade contract is a system that supports smooth transaction according to the price contract registered by the creator when the participant purchases the content The system is associated with the Token Module to record the real time transaction information of the platform participants 5 1 3 4 Data Manager Data administrators review data validation according to service policies to eliminate invalid data unify redundant data and increase storage e\xef\xac\x83ciency 26 \x0c5 Architecture 5 2 Content on Blockchain All content uploaded on the MovieBloc such as subtitles advertisements as well as content uploaded by the creator is hashed and registered in the content contract on the blockchain The hash value is used as the identi\xef\xac\x81er of each content and transactions and records on the MovieBloc are represented by corresponding hash values Creator BLOC Content Hash Content Storage CDN Content Contract Content License Contract Fig 11 TVOD Request Process Application ( BLOC / KMPlayer) User The creator\xe2\x80\x99s movie or subtitle content created by the translator are registered in the license contract where the curators and users can purchase the license to play the content In order to distribute or use content a license key is generated and issued through the license contract This gives access to the content and concludes a contract for the use of the content The license contract records how many users have paid the MBL on the blockchain to obtain the license Based on this data legitimate and transparent rewards are paid to the creator and subtitle translators 27 \x0c5 Architecture When a free content is played pre roll and mid roll ads are executed and information related to the execution history is recorded on the blockchain Based on this information the creator of the content and the curator are rewarded through settlement The advertiser can grasp the utility of the advertisement e\xef\xac\x80ect by transparently checking the history of the advertisement cost paid by the advertiser Pre roll Content Content User CDN + Content Storage Creator BLOC AD Curator MBL Token Database Membership Fig 12 AVOD Content Play & Pro\xef\xac\x81t Distribution 28 Token Module \x0c5 Architecture 5 3 Data Validation The blockchain is not suitable for storing large amounts of data Ethereum consumes a lot of gas for data processing and data storage EOS has the cost issue due to limited RAM resources Therefore most projects implement large capacity data through a side chain or cloud server and the ability to verify the integrity of data as a contract on the blockchain MovieBloc is based on Ontology Mainnet Since Ontology consumes ONG gas fee fo data stoage it is di\xef\xac\x83cult to store all MovieBloc data on the blockchain Even if the result of only hashing the data is stored the burden on the RAM increases as the service continues In MovieBloc some information based on life cycle and importance of data uses existing cloud server and database For example a token transmission result of a transaction is stored in a multi index table of a contract while a transaction is performed on the blockchain and the result is stored in the blockchain Validator Data companison Database User User Review Data tx hash review text Insert transaction hash SHA hash Send transaction Blockchain SHA hash hash Get Get transaction Transaction Data Fig 13 Data Validation On the other hand in the case of compensation for \xef\xac\x81lm review the contens of the criticism are hashed and the content is transmitted in a blockchain transaction but not separately stored in the table The DB also stores the content of the review and the transaction hash value In this way the transaction history can be inquired through the transaction hash value to reward for the user s comment and the validity of the data can be veri\xef\xac\x81ed by comparing the actual hash value with the hash value in the data \xef\xac\x81eld 29 \x0c6 Token Economy A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow Wag The Dog (1997) \x0c6 Token Economy 6 Token Economy 6 1 MBL
