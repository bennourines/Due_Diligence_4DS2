describes the first sale of the Stem Cell Coin (SCC) As described in this paper SCC is a cryptocurrency which has been designed to use for all the services provided by the Stem Cell Project team and its affiliate companies The SCC token has been created on the basis of Ethereum network so this token has no nature of securities in any legal jurisdiction This paper is not for inviting investors or for offering securities by any means in any legal jurisdiction Please note that purchasing SCC is all definitive and non refundable Individual company and any other organization must consider risks of purchasing SCC and its costs and benefits carefully Information contained in this paper and the whole document is not comprehensive Also this paper does not represent privity of contract between our company and token purchasers The accuracy reliability and integrity of materials included in this paper or provided other sites in association with this ICO are not guaranteed and we accept no legal responsibilities for that For other companies and individuals SCC does not represent warrant or promise truth accuracy and integrity of any kind of information described in this paper and SCC does not intend to do so SCC also disclaims representation warranty or promise on them \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 3 \x0cImportant Items Requiring Confirmation Purchasing SCC can carry a serious risk We consider that the purchasers have already accepted the following risks before buying the coins \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 The purchasers recognize that some services in the Stem Cell Project are currently under development and a major modification may occur in the period to the start of the services The purchasers understand that expectations for the forms and features of the Stem Cell Project may not be fulfilled due to various reasons The purchasers understand that some cryptocurrency exchanges may deny connection to this project although SCC devotes best efforts to connect to major exchanges and as a result the liquidity provided through platform may become lower than that expected in this paper The purchasers understand that the date of official release may be late although SCC devotes best efforts to start as scheduled There may be broad fluctuations of the value of SCC and its lowering due to various reasons SCC will be issued in NEO blockchain Therefore transfer of SCC or purchasers\xe2\x80\x99 capability of holding the coin safely may be affected by troubles of NEO protocol or unexpected function \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 4 \x0cWhat is ICO ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a method for financial arrangements by issuing an original digital token and selling it This is not to assign equity like stock funding but to simply sell the token like rewardbased crowdfunding The token is not recognized as a \xe2\x80\x9ccryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of selling which means that the ICO is not the method for \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d by strict definition but is for selling the token Thus those who buy it are not \xe2\x80\x9cinvestors\xe2\x80\x9d for the project but are the \xe2\x80\x9cpurchasers of the token \xe2\x80\x9d At the point in time the SCC token cannot be used as repayment for a consideration for unspecified persons and it is considered that this ICO project fits the above mentioned definitions since it is in a situation where there is no exchange market between the token and the legal currencies Bitcoin and any other existing cryptocurrencies Purposes of ICO All the produced funds will be used for development of the Stem Cell Project 1 Development/introduction of payment system for the cost of Stem Cell treatment at our own hospitals/affiliate clinics

\xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 7 \x0cConcepts of Our Project In industrialized countries including Japan which have increasingly aging populations the number of people suffering chronic diseases are increasing Because of development of public transports people don\xe2\x80\x99t exercise enough and begin to have obese and metabolic syndrome Thus health maintenance/promotion captures their interest Concept of \xe2\x80\x9chealth care\xe2\x80\x9d becomes very important nowadays On the other hand the number of qualified professionals such as medical doctors and nurses is decreasing Time to wait for the physical examination by a doctor is getting longer and the burden of the medical experts is also getting heavier year after year In such a circumstance we will develop \xe2\x80\x9cAI Personal Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of the concept \xe2\x80\x9ceSelfcare\xe2\x80\x9d for health maintenance of people around the world We will provide \xe2\x80\x9cAging Well Concept\xe2\x80\x9d which is self maintenance of own health by oneself to the whole world From 60% to 80% of world population have a lack of exercise Assumed 1 billion people in the world become 60 years old or over by 2025 People tend to have a lack of exercise as their cultures are developing As a result they experience body weight gain which leads to chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension There have been tools which can lead them to a healthy state and maintain the state Our challenge is to find out how to utilize these tools to obtain better results for becoming healthy By 2025 it is assumed that the population of 60 years old or over is increased further In addition to the currently aging industrialized countries the developing countries with rapid population growth will soon become aging societies Do you think their dreams of life with peace safe and comfortable will come true What should we do before worldwide aging societies become reality 8 6 million people in the world suffer some chronic diseases Number of qualified professionals are reducing 8 6 million people in the whole world and the number is growing at a phenomenal speed In fact it is estimated that about \xc2\xbe of causes of death in the world will be chronic disease by 2020 If chronic diseases are well managed by patients their family members and health care teams patients can enjoy their life healthier and also the burden of treatment costs can be minimized Additional burden will cause a crisis \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT According to the report in 2006 by WHO we need 4 3 million more medical doctors nurses and medical support staff and such a situation is not expected to improve in the future They are already insufficient in number and how can we keep providing essential medical and welfare services 8 \x0c2 technologies playing a role in the future health will open new doors To obtain vital data such as body temperature blood pressure and pulse rate easily we need technologies to sense the physical quantities The obtained biological information are not discarded after temporal usage but accumulated and the course will be followed In order to make the above happen high security network which can transfer data freely is necessary When the 2 technologies are integrated people\xe2\x80\x99s lifestyles and environments will change significantly The change is what we are providing Future medical services achieved by IoT and Blockchain AI Personal Doctor (Keep all the doctors in the world for oneself) Our vision is to bring a new structure with AI and Blockchain to the old medical system This can be a breakthrough in the healthcare industry and bring affluent society in which people live in health We revolutionize medical services with AI and Blockchain The revolution however doesn\xe2\x80\x99t destroy the structure of the current medical services but rather aims to complement the current services and expand their breadth As an example utilization of cutting edge sensing technologies and chatbots reduce the burden of medical staff and improve the accuracy of medical examinations and also application of AI analysis and Blockchain create a new medical service in the area of private practice (no health insurance applicable) We aim to spread these across the world Our final goal is to create a environment that everyone can always receive high quality medical services wherever they are Labor force in the medical field also decreases as the population decreases In such a situation the condition to receive advanced treatment becomes even tougher for patients Along with improving the skills of doctors procedures associated with medical examinations need to be reduced \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 9 \x0cBrief Overview of Our Project Stem Cell Project is a medical project mainly focused on the following 2 points Development and popularization of (1) a means of payment for the costs of stem cell treatment at the affiliate hospitals and (2) pathological/diagnostic imaging systems by using AI and Blockchain The followings are the 4 main purposes of our project 1 Make stem cell treatment possible to pay in cryptocurrency Stem cell therapy helps to activate weakened cells and proliferate important cells declining in number daily After stem cell administration the cells are circulating through the body Once finding out damaged tissues the stem cells are activated by themselves and trying to repair and regenerate the tissues This therapy shows promise for treatment of anti aging diabetes mellitus etc However currently stem cell therapy can be provided only in medically advanced countries In recent years stem cell therapy has captured the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention So we are expecting worldwide financial inflow to regenerative medicine by means of cryptocurrency payment 2 Introduction of pathological/diagnostic imaging systems with AI and Blockchain We are developing the near future health check system which can share automatic diagnoses with images and pathological data among clinics and hospitals in the world by using AI and Blockchain technologies We will let the system grow to the level that can screen medical big data rapidly and accurately We are also planning to use the provided big data for revealing relationship to cancers on the basis of the patient information such as nationality race gender and age \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 10 \x0c3 Development of Virtual Clinic Platform When patients experience illness/disorders they often have following questions \xe2\x80\x9cWhich hospital should I go \xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhich department should I choose \xe2\x80\x9d Also visiting hospital just for receiving medicines is wasting time and becomes burden for patients In order to solve such problems we develop Virtual Clinic Platform which can make patients feel a closer connection to doctors by using the network among the member hospitals/clinics of Japan Society of Aesthetic Regenerative Medicine and AIbot diagnosis remote medical checkup system search/reservation of hospitals/clinics All the payments in the platform can be done in SCC \xe2\x80\xbbAIbot diagnosis AI can predict suspected patient\xe2\x80\x99s disease(s) only with asking questions regarding symptoms and affected parts \xe2\x80\xbbRemote medical checkup system Doctors can examine patients who cannot visit medical institutions for reasons of their living environments by using video calls etc 4 Research and clinical work of therapeutic formulations with stem cells The final goal of our Stem Cell Project is \xe2\x80\x9cpharmaceuticalization of stem cells \xe2\x80\x9d By doing research and clinical work of therapeutic formulations with stem cells and putting them into public circulation we will be able to achieve our aims to give more opportunities to those who need regenerative medicine and to optimize the treatment costs Keeping development of the world\xe2\x80\x99s first \xe2\x80\x9cCell Bank\xe2\x80\x9d in mind we also create a surrounding in which people with diseases can be treated with their own cells which took and stored beforehand at their healthy state \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 11 \x0cMore Details on 1 Stem cell therapy has been attracting worldwide attention in recent years however the therapy can be currently provided only in 5 countries such as the US Germany Switzerland Russia (only at governmental institutions) and Japan Amid increasing demand for stem cell therapy especially in Asia the therapy can be currently provided only in Japan among other Asian nations In Japan hospitals/clinics which can provide stem cell therapy need to obtain approval of Class II Regenerative Medicine accredited by the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare One of our project team Association of Medical Corporation Koge Kai is planning to obtain the approval of Class II Regenerative Medicine and is having a clinic where stem cell therapy can be given Although we have the clinic in which a number of people can be treated the payment method for the treatment costs is an issue Especially in China there is the regulation on annual limit of taking Chinese yuan out of China and thus although the demand is increasing it is currently difficult for them to bring their own currency to other countries for the treatment which costs about 6 to 8 million yen per time Introduction of a payment system in cryptocurrency can solve this issue While the number of individual investors holding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is growing we are planning to expand customers of our hospitals/affiliate clinics by using SCC as a payment method \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 12 \x0cMore Details on 2 The final goal of this system is to bridge the gaps among the worldwide medical technologies This system has been developed because of lack of medical specialists which is the issue of the current healthcare industry Rare diseases and diseases which are difficult to detect tend to be found out by thorough examinations in university hospitals or general hospitals and there are many cases which could not be detected or treated at minor hospitals/clinics This can be associated with the major issue of lack of pathologists A similar situation can be seen in other medically advanced countries Especially in China there are only around 10 000 pathologists for the population of 1 4 billion which is a serious scarcity of labor As a result patients gather at major hospitals Brief overview of the system is that data of CT and X ray images are scanned by AI system in which medical big data have been introduced This can lead to early detection of variety of diseases and detection of rare diseases Furthermore by using this system on Blockchain diagnostic data can be shared at the medical institutions with the system which can lead to medical technology improvement Thus even the minor hospitals and developing countries can manage high level medical technology and gaps of the medical technology will be filled by this system More Details on 3 We propose Virtual Clinic Platform Patients can receive various medical services on 1 device online wherever they are A variety of contents will be added such as remote medical checkup system chatbot and translation function \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 13 \x0cMore Details on 4 This is directly connected to the point of our philosophy \xe2\x80\x9cRegenerative Medicine to the World \xe2\x80\x9d Stem cell therapy has been attracting worldwide attention to a variety of symptoms and anti aging effect however only some wealthy people can receive the therapy (mostly for anti aging) due to the high cost Thus stem cell therapy is not considered as a therapy for patients in need For the issue our project is aiming to \xe2\x80\x9coptimize stem cell therapy cost \xe2\x80\x9d Since our project team has been established a special technology to culture stem cells rapidly and accuracy mass culturing is possible By improving this technology and optimizing the treatment cost we can give more opportunities to those who need regenerative medicine We aim to make regenerative medicine closer to our life by pharmaceuticalization of stem cells on the basis of research and clinical work Currently the clinics of our project team provides stem cell treatment under the approval of Class II Regenerative Medicine accredited by Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare however approval of Class I Regenerative Medicine is essential for pharmaceuticalization of stem cells We will obtain appropriate approval while the project is going further and then provide regenerative medicine to the people who need it Advantages of our project are not only providing IT services in healthcare but also holding a medical corporation JSARM and clinics in the team Our aim is not to raise funds for startup like a general feature of ICO but to grow our business further We can introduce and operate the payment system and diagnostic imaging system at our own clinics first which is because the Stem Cell Project includes the medical corporation \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 14 \x0cMarket Sizes and Growth Potential of Regenerative Medicine The market sizes of regenerative medicine will be 2 5 trillion yen on Japanese market and 38 trillion yen on the world market in 2050 and it is expected to be

more than 200 types of cells Each type of cells has a role to play such as cells to grow hairs cells to activate skin There are cells which don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific role and can become several types of cells This is \xe2\x80\x9cStem Cells \xe2\x80\x9d Stem cells have 1 Potential to divide repeatedly and proliferate the same type of cells 2 Potential to become several different types of cells Stem cells gather around damaged area and divide and proliferate repeatedly which facilitates regeneration of the cells and restores the tissue functions Cell (e g Fibroblast) Fertilized egg Adult Gene transfer Stem cells ES cell iPS cell Somatic stem cell Cell culture (Self replication) Induction of multi differentiation (Multipotential) Muscle \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT Heart Bone Cartilage Blood cells Skin Nerve Other (Liver blood vessel fat etc ) 16 \x0cWhat is Stem Cell Therapy Stem cell therapy helps to activate weakened cells and proliferate important cells which are declining in number daily After stem cell administration the cells are circulating through the body Once finding out damaged tissues the stem cells are activated by themselves and trying to repair and regenerate the tissues After catching SDF 1 signal from the damaged area the administered stem cells are migrating to that area And the cells repair the area rapidly and move to another area (hitand run phenomenon) The stem cells further stimulate pituitary gland which restores the hormonal balance and metabolism cycle to a healthy state The recent stem cell researches reveal that health of many organs can be maintained over a lifetime with permanent regeneration of stem cells On the other hand organs/tissues are aging as stem cells are aging In other words it is medically recognized that stem cells play an essential role in changes caused by aging \xe2\x80\x9cStem cells\xe2\x80\x9d = \xe2\x80\x9cCore role in research on aging\xe2\x80\x9d A feature of stem cells is to regenerate organs damaged by illness and injury and to restore functions of the organs Mechanism of regenerative medicine Stem cell collection Impaired organ Culture Regeneration \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 17

\xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 22 \x0cPathological/diagnostic imaging systems by AI and Blockchain Deep Learning has been greatly developed and is currently gathering attentions in various areas by tremendous improvement of computer performance collection of big data due to the spread of World Wide Web and internet devices and various research outcomes Deep Learning has overwhelming recognition performance especially in the field of pathology image recognition In the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) where competitions of recognition accuracy of generic object images are held the accuracy has kept greatly improving since 2012 when Deep Learning was introduced and eventually in 2015 it overtook human recognition performance Deep Learning will be applied in a variety of fields of healthcare with Blockchain Deep Learning comparing to other computational techniques can achieve great accuracy however in order to gain such accuracy it requires a great deal of leaning time even with currently available high speed calculators For instance Google spent 1 000 \xe2\x80\x93 2 000 hours of learning time to achieve 99 63% ultrahigh accuracy in convolutional neural network FaceNet which recognizes human face images We are going to handle much bigger Blockchain network and lead to complete solutions for various medical issues by using Deep Learning In terms of future issues since it is not considered practical that the each issue will be learnt with longer time our purpose is to reduce leaning time drastically by accelerating the leaning speed As an experiment which have already started we are turning an algorithm for speeding up of Deep Learning into reality with the idea of a new architecture of data flow by using distributed memory with a keyword of \xe2\x80\x9cparallelization \xe2\x80\x9d At the current stage we provide aforementioned pathological imaging diagnosis and capillary diagnosis in our medical practice Moreover we aim to get high throughput/high power efficiency with small temporal granularity by achieving high speed learning with dedicated processors \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 23 \x0cIssues Faced by Health Industry

of population and thus an increase in the number of cancer patients is expected \xe2\x97\x87 According to improvement of healthcare system major diseases causing death (e g infection) is decreasing even in developing countries \xe2\x97\x87 Although cancer is a disease which we haven\xe2\x80\x99t overcome yet a complete cure could be achieved if treatment is appropriately given \xe2\x97\x87 Phathologists who indicate treatment methods require sufficient training Needs Not enough pathologists throughout the world \xe2\x97\x87 Developed countries Computer aided systems are necessary due to busy schedule \xe2\x97\x87 Developing countries Very few pathologists \xe2\x86\x92 support system is necessary (if possible a system which can determine a certain level of pathology) \xe2\x97\x87 Important to have systems which cover and support improvement of infrastructure (e g Remote diagnosis) Pricing \xe2\x97\x87 Usage charge of APSAM will be covered by social insurance except in the US \xe2\x97\x87It is difficult to fix a price because pathologists have different status and role in each country \xe2\x97\x87 At this point in time 30% 40% of payment amount for pathological diagnosis is considered as the cost for a patient \xe2\x97\x87 Usually 90% of the part of a pathological sample is normal and thus development of a system which can extract abnormal parts only contributes to improvement of pathological diagnostic efficiency In light of that we will set the price in comparison with the actual hiring cost of a pathologist \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 26 \x0cConcept of Virtual Clinic Platform When patients experience illness/disorders they often have following questions \xe2\x80\x9cWhich hospital should I go \xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhich department should I choose \xe2\x80\x9d Also visiting hospital just for receiving medicines is wasting time and becomes burden for patients In order to solve such problems we develop Virtual Clinic Platform which can make patients feel a closer connection to doctors by using the network among the member hospitals/clinics of Japan Society of Aesthetic Regenerative Medicine and AIbot diagnosis remote medical checkup system search/reservation of hospitals/clinics Various contents are added to this platform and we create environment where patients can easily receive medical services online All the payments in the platform can be done in SCC All the process from reservation to payment of medical examination can be done online Patients can receive medicines and their prescription at home The storage of medicines and sales can be managed at the same time Patients visiting a hospital can use the BLE system which is used as a registration card \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 27 \x0cFrom the World to Japan Japan as the

are also acceptable We tell your symptoms as well as your personal data to that hospital and provide a referral form and your medical information in the language of that country \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 28 \x0cSensor Network A sensor network cognizes one\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances and autonomously cooperates with others This is an essential technology to realize a healthy and wealthy society and can be applied to a wide range of areas such as healthcare welfare crime prevention security disaster prevention environmental risks This is developing for our future social/economic activities Doctor Constant collection of major biological information (e g pulse BT BP O2 in blood) and its data base is very useful for doctors to make a decision Sensor network will change healthcare services Family Family can know how the person are by receiving the biological information whenever and wherever Family and the person is connecting though the network Pharmacist Physiotherapist Based on the biological information efficiency of the prescribed medicine(s) can be checked Compared with the past data pharmacists can prescribe most appropriate medicine(s) for the patient Physiotherapists can know how much the patient is doing exercise and consuming energy even they are away from the patient They can give the patient appropriate advice by knowing the exercise level A Person He/She is in the sensor network without noticing This is the purpose of Virtual Clinic Miniaturization and communication function of devices are the main points future key technology \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT Care and Welfare services If connecting to network care workers can check the patients\xe2\x80\x99 conditions all the time Communication with medical institutions and nursing homes is smooth This lessens the burden of carers 29 \x0cOur society has been established with the purpose of contribution to development of regenerative medicine in Japan by improvement and dissemination of research of regenerative medicine practices and publication/communication and exchange of their knowledge Although we named our society \xe2\x80\x9caesthetic \xe2\x80\x9d it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we are dedicated to cosmetic medicine We use the word \xe2\x80\x9caesthetic\xe2\x80\x9d because we develop the society into multiple fields of regenerative medicine including cosmetic medicine Of course we are going to mention alternatives of new treatment centering on dentistry In light of conditions of the times our activities (working together with other societies and organizations) include providing advice for observational studies for the medical guidelines which is applicable to the regenerative medicine law In regard to healthcare and studies applicable to the laws of regenerative medicine and clinical studies we cooperate with the certified special committee for regenerative medicine certified committee for regenerative medicine certified review board and research ethics committee Moreover a working group with knowledgeable people on human pluripotent stem cells and cell culturing was organized by Miho Furue in human stem cell applied research room in National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation Health and Nutrition a project leader of regenerative medicine practical project \xe2\x80\x9cA study on standardization of culturing technique aiming to quality variability and practical application of iPS cells\xe2\x80\x9d in Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) The group proposed the following 5 conditions in \xe2\x80\x9cFundamental principles in cell culturing \xe2\x80\x9d 1st condition Recognize that cell culturing is derived from a part of living body 2nd condition Confirm reliability of the source and applicability of methods of using 3rd condition Prevent contamination of culturing cells 4th condition Manage culturing cells and handling record properly 5th condition Consider health and safety of culturing technicians and environmental effect \xc2\xa9STEM CELL PROJECT 30 \x0cWe comply with the 5 conditions and have an affiliate cell processing center approved under Regenerative Medicine Ensuring Safety Law Article 40 Clause1 We are
