b Blockchain Airdrops Our Guiding Principles October 2018 \x0cABSTRACT In an \xe2\x80\x9cairdrop\xe2\x80\x9d the creators of a token based network distribute tokens directly to individuals for free or nominal consideration The rationale behind most airdrops is to drive decentralization and popularity or use of the network Advances in technology and growing legal clarity around their advantages in recent years have seen the popularity of airdrops soar In this document we discuss their economic and legal rationales together with a set of guiding principles for airdrop planning and execution Finally we set forth the foundation for the Blockchain Airdrops Program together with the criteria that will guide Blockchain in selecting which tokens we will airdrop to our users 1 \x0cTABLE OF

Selection Principles 6 Conclusion \x0c1 INTRODUCTION At Blockchain we\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about connecting the world to crypto and helping our users interact with cryptoassets in an easy and safe way The first step to becoming an active participant in the crypto ecosystem is to get cryptoassets This has become much easier than it used to be but significant barriers remain Airdrops are good for crypto users For those who want to use crypto three acquisition methods remain the most common \xe2\x80\xa2 purchasing it on a platform (i e exchange) or directly peer to peer \xe2\x80\xa2 mining it or otherwise earning it through direct efforts (e g selling goods or services) or \xe2\x80\xa2 receiving it for free or nominal consideration in an airdrop MINING EXPENSE BUY EARN AIRDROP DIFFICULTY Purchasing cryptoassets through an initial coin offering (\xe2\x80\x9cICO\xe2\x80\x9d) or exchange is popular but doing so requires financial resources can come with regulatory complexities that vary across geogra3 \x0cphies and can be risky Mining crypto can be difficult often requiring sophisticated and expensive equipment making it inaccessible to the general public Airdrops on the other hand provide a free and transparent way for anyone with an internet connection and a computing device to obtain cryptoassets at no cost Airdrops are good for crypto creators Airdrops are good for people who want their token based networks to flourish Airdrops can decentralize these networks quickly and effectively increasing their use through network effects In many cases they can lower the risks posed by the securities laws They can even lower the risks posed by the money services laws Decentralization is a powerful thing The relative ease and zero expense nature of airdrops makes them an important vehicle for millions of people to gain access to the digital asset ecosystem and we believe that airdrops will help pave the road to mass market adoption of cryptoassets However it is of paramount importance that airdrops are conducted in a responsible manner It is for these reasons that we have developed Principles outlining the Blockchain Airdrops Program 4 \x0c2 AIRDROPS DEFINED In an \xe2\x80\x9cairdrop\xe2\x80\x9d the creators of a cryptoasset token based network distribute tokens directly to individuals for free or nominal consideration From the perspective of the token creator an airdrop can enable the project to bootstrap and grow the utility of the network by acquiring and incentivizing unique users As CoinCenter\xe2\x80\x99s Peter van Valkenburgh put it \xe2\x80\x9ctoken based projects need network effects There needs to be a mechanism for fairly and widely distributing tokens in order for the project to function well upon launch \xe2\x80\x9d In other words decentralization of token ownership is of paramount importance for this new token based financial system to work effectively From the perspective of a user some airdropped tokens can simply \xe2\x80\x98appear\xe2\x80\x99 in the users\xe2\x80\x99 wallet Other times to receive airdropped tokens some action may be necessary by the user such as visiting a website While some similarities exist airdrops should not be confused with new tokens created by a \xe2\x80\x98hard fork\xe2\x80\x99 of a network In the case of the July 2017 Bitcoin Cash hard fork some wallet service providers made available the new BCH tokens in users\xe2\x80\x99 wallets without requiring any payment from the user (much like an airdrop) However hard forks create new tokens through a bifurcation of a network whereas airdrops simply represent a distribution mechanism of tokens on a single network Airdrops came into use shortly after Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s introduction a decade ago hearkening back to The Bitcoin Faucet which was a website developed by Gavin Andresen in 2010 that both accepted bitcoin donations and gave out up to five bitcoins per person Many of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrency received their first bitcoins from such faucets helping to broaden awareness and contribute to the early ecosystem More recently the use of 5 \x0cairdrops to reach the masses and drive activity has significantly increased as the number of token projects has grown 6 \x0c3 ECONOMIC & TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES From the perspective of the creators of a token based network the raison d \xc3\xaatre of airdrops is to facilitate network effects or what economists often refer to as positive network externalities Before delving into specifics around airdrops it is helpful to briefly summarize the general concept of network effects Network effects The fax machine an innovation that enabled the speedy electronic transmission of documents across distance is often used to illustrate the concept of network effects A fax machine requires both a sender and a recipient to be useful In other words if you are the only person who owns a fax machine then your machine is effectively devoid of utility at least two fax machines must be in operation for any one machine to be useful Furthermore the greater the number of fax machines in operation the greater the potential usefulness of any single fax machine due to the expansion of the universe of potential senders/recipients Finally as the number of fax machines in operation grows the stronger the incentive to acquire a fax machine and join the network 7 \x0cThe growing use and number of fax machines generated a network effect a term that Bob Metcalfe the inventor of Ethernet (another example of a technology that generated a powerful network effect) is credited with originating in the early 1990s Metcalfe\xe2\x80\x99s law was summarized in Varian and Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s 1999 book Information Rules as follows \xe2\x80\x9cIf there are n people in a network and the value of the network to each of them is proportional to the number of other users then the total value of the network (to all the users) is propor tional to n X (n 1) = n2 n If the value of a network to a single user is $1 for each other user on the network then a network of size 10 has a total value of roughly $100 In contrast a network of size 100 has a total value of roughly $10 000 A tenfold increase in the size of the network leads to a hundredfold increase in its value \xe2\x80\x9d1 Simply put larger networks are often more useful and valuable than smaller ones In cases where two or more network technologies are competing against each other the winner is often decided by which network was able to \xe2\x80\x9cgrow big fastest\xe2\x80\x9d An increasing number of network members leads to \xe2\x80\xa2 Greater utility of each individual network node (positive feedback loop) \xe2\x80\xa2 Increased incentives for non members to join the network (bandwagon effect) \xe2\x80\xa2 A more valuable overall network (positive externalities) Airdrops drive token network effects Like a fax machine a cryptocurrency is effectively devoid of utility if only one person holds the 1 Varian and Shapiro Information Rules (1999) p 184 8 \x0ccurrency In other words the more people who hold and accept a cryptocurrency (i e the more decentralized the ownership of the currency) the more potentially useful that currency becomes In recent times and often as a symptom of legal structuring new tokens distributed through ICOs have been increasingly concentrated in the hands of smaller and smaller groups of investors However as discussed above if tokens are only held by a small number of individuals then the utility of those tokens and the value of the overall network may be diminished As discussed in the Introduction to these Principles the option of purchasing or mining tokens (the two other primary ways individuals can acquire tokens) is inaccessible for millions of people Hence the interest in airdropping new tokens into the wallets of actual users A potentially important component of airdrops are the new \xe2\x80\x98demand drivers\xe2\x80\x99 (e g what new ways the token can be used) that accompany the announcement of an airdrop This is particularly relevant for tokens with established trading markets and liquidity where recipients have the option of converting airdropped tokens into another asset Airdrops can increase the available circulating supply of a token and demand supporting mechanisms that are simultaneously introduced alongside an airdrop may help with achieving an orderly post airdrop market equilibrium 1 Varian and Shapiro Information Rules (1999) p 184 9 \x0cAirdrop \xe2\x80\x98by way of private key\xe2\x80\x99 Airdrops can play a critical role in furthering decentralization particularly when they are distributed directly to private key holders Cryptoassets like bitcoin and ethereum \xe2\x80\x98live\xe2\x80\x99 on electronic networks On these networks there are public addresses where assets can be be sent and received Everybody on the network can see these addresses just as anyone can see all the post boxes in the lobby of a block of flats To send a cryptoasset from one public address to another a \xe2\x80\x98private key\xe2\x80\x99 must be used This means that whoever controls the private key paired to an address has the ability to send assets from that address just as the person in possession of the keys to postage box 1 can open the box retrieve a five dollar bill held inside and post that bill to postage box 2 In this scenario only the person with the keys to postage box 2 can access the five dollar bill Similarly whoever has possession of the private key to an address has control over that address\xe2\x80\x99 cryptoassets 10 \x0cAn airdrop \xe2\x80\x98by way of private key\xe2\x80\x99 is analogous to \xe2\x80\x98posting\xe2\x80\x99 cryptoassets directly into your \xe2\x80\x98personal digital bank vault\xe2\x80\x99 Only you the person with control of the private key to the corresponding address can access the airdropped asset Using their private key an individual can choose to store the asset transfer or trade it as they see fit Imagine if everybody in a country woke up one morning to find a genuinely valuable and useful gift in their postage boxes Imagine that the more people who had received that gift the more valuable and useful each gift was Airdrops have the potential to do this digitally and on a global scale Instant Adoption Though we believe airdrops can be a powerful tool to drive adoption for token based networks we must also understand their limitations Not everyone who receives an airdropped token will need it or even want it Some recipients will ignore the tokens they receive Some will sell them Some will try to game the airdrop mechanism Some after the airdrop will try to accumulate more tokens than intended by the network creator re centralizing the network incrementally These risks are real and they should temper the calculus for any prospective airdrop As such we have developed certain principles intended to mitigate these risks which we articulate in the final sections of this whitepaper 11 \x0c4 LEGAL ADVANTAGES From the point of view of the token based network creator achieving decentralization can solve significant legal complexities and make feasible otherwise impossible products In recent years in the United States and other jurisdictions decentralization has become a legal term of art used by regulators to define legal burdens Today the term \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized\xe2\x80\x9d is a critical part of both the federal money services laws and the federal securities laws More decentralized token based networks are less likely than their less decentralized peers to result in unlicensed money transmitter activity for their developers and less likely to result in an illegal sale of securities for their issuers US Federal Securities Laws Airdrops Can Drive Decentralization2 The current thinking within the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \xe2\x80\x9cSEC\xe2\x80\x9d) is that an offering of a token might not result in a security if the underlying network is sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized\xe2\x80\x9d This is important because assuming there is no registration statement in place with the SEC it is illegal to offer securities to the public in the United States By increasing the decentralization of the network airdrops can play a role in turning a token that would have been a security into a non security William Hinman the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC articulated some questions that can help determine whether a network is so decentralized that its tokens might not be deemed securities An airdrop can lay the groundwork for giving the right answers SEC Asks Are the assets dispersed across a diverse user base or concentrated in the hands of a few that can exert influence Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence Airdrops directly to users who own and control their own private keys can widely disperse tokens to a user base fighting concentration and minimizing the influence of the few Furthermore it can diffuse centralized incentive structures that might derail effective governance This distribution directly to private keys is the sine qua non of an effective airdrop today 2 Many laws in many jurisdictions could apply to tokens and airdrops We focus here on the United States federal securities and federal money services laws because they have been the most enforced and are among the most developed 12 \x0cSEC Asks Is the application fully functioning or in early stages of development Airdrops can disperse tokens widely so that no individual or small group can defeat the consensus protocols that ensure functionality of networks and the applications that use them This is particularly true for networks relying on proof of stake or that otherwise involve tokens (or sub tokens) which delegate power to control network functionality SEC Asks Is token creation commensurate with meeting the needs of users or rather with feeding speculation Are the tokens available in increments that correlate with a consumptive versus investment intent Is the asset marketed and distributed to potential users or the general public Targeted airdrops in the right amounts can bring proportionality to overall token distribution Selling thousands of tokens to individuals who would only use fewer than a hundred tokens in their lifetime would yield the wrong answer to this question Properly calibrated airdrops can be targeted to the right users in the right amounts These airdrops can achieve a broad distribution of tokens among individuals who will actually use them and in amounts that they will actually use Importantly Simply arranging or participating in an airdrop will not prevent a token from being a security The above is only a subset of the questions a token network creator should ask in determining security status according to Mr Hinman A well executed airdrop can however help to build the hallmarks of decentralization US Federal Securities Laws An Airdrop Does not Require User Investment Not all token distributions are illegal securities offerings but the SEC has taken the position that most ICOs are and enforced against many To have an illegal securities offering the thing being offered must itself be a security This might seem obvious to the layman but it is an axiom often overlooked by legal commentators Though conducting an ICO of a token could be an illegal securities 13 \x0coffering airdropping a token that is not by itself a security cannot be an illegal securities offering In fact for most so called \xe2\x80\x9cutility\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconsumer\xe2\x80\x9d tokens airdropping can count against security status In the United States a token is likely to trigger securities laws if it passes the so called Howey Test for an investment contract (one kind of security) To pass the Howey test there must have been among other things an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment of money\xe2\x80\x9d In a token sale or ICO this requirement is almost always met because the participants in the sale buy the token from its creator At minimum participants make a \xe2\x80\x9cdonation\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cfoundation\xe2\x80\x9d and hope to receive a token in return putting their capital at risk In a properly executed airdrop this requirement is never met because in such an airdrop individual recipients never pay money to receive the token They never put their capital at risk which in the United States is required to satisfy the Howey Test The typical objection to this point is that the standard for an \xe2\x80\x9coffering\xe2\x80\x9d is very low and does not even require an investment of money Indeed courts have even found free giveaways of stock to be securities offerings in some circumstances The standard for an offering is simply that the security was offered \xe2\x80\x9cfor value\xe2\x80\x9d So the objection goes even a mere giveaway of tokens can be a securities offering because the issuer received goodwill brand recognition or the like This objection confuses the standard for an \xe2\x80\x9coffering\xe2\x80\x9d (a low bar) with the standard for an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment of money\xe2\x80\x9d in an underlying investment contract (a higher bar) Indeed arguing that an airdrop can create a securities offering of a non security is like arresting someone for resisting arrest United States Federal Securities Laws Private Plaintiffs Beyond concerns involving the SEC a private plaintiff could also target a token creator in a lawsuit Class action lawsuits for example can be disastrous for token issuers especially when brought subsequent to an ICO Private plaintiffs will find it difficult if not impossible to reach issuers on the basis of an airdrop alone This is because private plaintiffs must prove damages to succeed in a lawsuit For well executed airdrops where the recipient plaintiff gave little or no consideration 14 \x0cmonetary damages will be rare Airdropping can be a powerful tool for the issuer looking to satisfy important United States securities law requirements United States Federal Money Services Laws Avoiding Money Transmitter Status According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\xe2\x80\x9cFinCEN\xe2\x80\x9d) the bureau of the Department of the Treasury charged with administering the Bank Secrecy Act token networks are divided into two kinds centralized and decentralized Centralized networks have \xe2\x80\x9cAdministrators\xe2\x80\x9d This is important because Administrators according to FinCEN must register as money transmitters identify their customers and report suspicious activity (known colloquially as \xe2\x80\x98AML\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98KYC\xe2\x80\x99) maintain transaction records and in many cases seek licenses from every state This is expensive time consuming and will be a poor fit for developers who had hoped to operate an ultralight software development company not an unwieldy financial institution The more individual owners and controllers that exist in a given token based network the less likely the developer is to be deemed an Administrator and thus a money transmitter That is to say less decentralized networks and less adopted networks are more likely to have smaller groups of individuals who either hold tokens directly or can unilaterally update the network\xe2\x80\x99s ledger either because of the network\xe2\x80\x99s consensus protocol (e g with 51% control) or by abusing the network\xe2\x80\x99s consensus protocol (e g via 51% attack) Unilateral ability to update the ledger means the power to control the circulation of tokens Or as FinCEN categorizes such activity \xe2\x80\x9cissuance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9credemption\xe2\x80\x9d When small groups have this power FinCEN is likely to consider the network centralized and the token issuer an Administrator with registration licensing recordkeeping and ongoing reporting obligations Airdrops can help to avoid this outcome 15 \x0c5 1 THE BLOCKCHAIN AIRDROPS PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION PRINCIPLES We have developed a set of principles to guide our facilitation of the Blockchain Airdrops Program In this section we discuss these principles and their importance in how we will help token creators conduct airdrops Fundamentally airdrops should be Direct Tokens should be airdropped directly to individual recipients who possess private keys that permit them to access and use the tokens Contrast this with a distribution of tokens to users of a custodial platform like an exchange where users do not control their own private keys cannot interact directly with the network and cannot use and dispose of the tokens directly without permission from the platform owner Attempting to increase decentralization by airdropping to a custodial platform is an oxymoron It would be no airdrop at all Targeted Airdrops should aim for broad distribution to as many individual users as possible within a properly targeted community Failure to ensure broad distribution would defeat the purpose of the airdrop At the same time airdrops can also be targeted at network influencers and connectors individuals or institutions that can help facilitate broader token adoption and use This aim can be addressed through the manner of distribution choice of distribution partners geographical focus or through a number of other distribution parameters In any event targeting should be calibrated to the nature of the intended user base while at the same time prioritizing utility For example tokens intended to be used for a limited purpose should be airdropped to as many individuals as possible within the group who are likely to use them for that purpose Tokens intended for a broader purpose such as tokens meant to act as fungible money would be most effective if airdropped to as many individuals as possible without such qualification 16 \x0cAccessible Airdrops should be free meaning no consideration need be paid for the tokens Requiring consideration is not always fatal to the offering but it does act to exclude those unable or unwilling to pay This limits the reach of the airdrop and more closely resembles a sale than a giveaway Likewise identifying the recipients limits the reach of an airdrop since some recipients will be unable or unwilling to provide identification and after all identification is not legally required for all airdrops Still requiring some form of identification process can prevent \xe2\x80\x98sock puppeting\xe2\x80\x993 which if permitted would limit the effectiveness of any airdrop Deterministic Chance should not determine the recipients of the airdrop Relying on chance to determine recipients is more akin to a sweepstakes than a giveaway Setting aside the potentially troublesome legal consequences relying on chance misses an important opportunity to calibrate for functionality use and adoption A successful airdrop should be conducted in a transparent and deterministic manner Once set in motion the airdrop process should be free from alteration or hidden manipulation Functional The ultimate purpose of an airdrop is to increase the decentralization of the token network and the utility of the token Any effect on price is independent of the airdrop itself Though the secondary market price of a token might increase after an airdrop due to increased utility and therefore demand the price might also decrease due to increased supply In either case the motivation for conducting an airdrop should be unrelated to speculation and price appreciation it should be focused on driving decentralization and network effects Further the airdrop needs to be calibrated so as to not lead to negative externalities (e g network congestion) 3 The creation and use of multiple credentials (here private keys) by a single recipient to create the appearance of multiple recipients to the airdropper 17 \x0c5 2 THE BLOCKCHAIN AIRDROPS PROGRAM ASSET SELECTION PRINCIPLES Selecting which assets to airdrop is critical Blockchain has developed a reputation for trust quality and innovation As such we have developed a set of principles to determine which tokens fit this reputation our mission and our values User Need Our users come first We collect feedback from our users and insist on understanding which assets and functionality is actually useful to them We\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about making the use of tokens easy and safe for the end user and this principle will always be of paramount importance when evaluating new assets Technical Quality Blockchain leverages its in house engineering and research talent to evaluate the technical quality of decentralized networks This includes assessing the soundness of the engineering theory robustness of the source code and security of the network It is also important for us to measure the future potential of the asset as well as what it is being used for today to contextualise business cases and adoption potential Community and Adoption The strength and depth of the community that uses and supports a network is a key consideration We look at the quality and frequency of open source developer contributions along with the nature of partnerships or support from reputable and meaningful entities Depending on the token type and functionality actual or potential market liquidity can be an important factor As such we may analyse historical volumes market capitalizations price volatility and high quality exchange venue listings (planned or existing) Network Activity and Use We acknowledge the importance of on chain data and statistics to uncover traction adoption and degrees of decentralization We take into account quantitative measures such as 18 \x0cdaily unique addresses consensus mechanisms transaction volume and active nodes amongst many other factors Regulation and compliance Blockchain is a global company serving users in over 140 countries Ensuring we serve our customers in harmony with the appropriate regulatory and compliance considerations will always drive our decision making Any asset or functionality we add will always be done in accordance with our comprehensive compliance procedures and any relevant laws or regulations Empowering the Radical Not all Blockchain Airdrops will lead to successful adopted networks More importantly not all Blockchain Airdrops should lead to successful adopted networks If all Blockchain Airdrops lead to successful networks then it will have proven that Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s asset selection was too safe too conservative The world of decentralized technology is revolutionary because it calls upon us to test radical theories of engineering finance and human psychology among others Many radical theories fail Similarly if all of the networks we endeavor to facilitate are ultimately successful then we shall know we have failed in our endeavor to facilitate the creation of truly revolutionary networks 19 \x0c6 CONCLUSION THE BLOCKCHAIN AIRDROPS PROGRAM Airdrops are coming into increasing use to help ensure that tokens are not concentrated in the hands of a few but instead are distributed to the hands of many Airdrops are good for people who want to use cryptoassets Unlike ICOs airdrops require no monetary consideration allowing individuals the ability to acquire cryptocurrency without an upfront cost Similarly where ICOs often drive speculation airdrops can drive actual use and functionality Unlike mining airdrops are easy and accessible to millions of people who lack technical sophistication or have yet to discover cryptoassets In contrast with exchange purchases airdrops can be open to everyone no matter their financial means or jurisdictional limitations Importantly airdrops are a useful tool for people who want to create cryptoassets Airdrops can decentralize token based networks quickly and effectively increasing real utility and value through network effects They can lower securities law risk because they decentralize networks and don\xe2\x80\x99t require investment They can lower money services laws risks because decentralized networks are less likely to have central controllers who can unilaterally affect transaction validation Today airdrops are a nascent mechanism for helping to increase the utility of token based networks With appropriate structural components and consistent implementation we believe they can be a key mechanism for kickstarting decentralization and use across innovative networks We believe that airdrops will increasingly play a vital role in expanding the use and accessibility of cryptoassets globally As the world\xe2\x80\x99s most popular crypto wallet and leading platform for cryptoassets we will apply our Guiding Principles as set forth in this document to the Blockchain Airdrops program In so doing we seek to ensure that decentralized networks can be harnessed as a force for good to empower our users and foster the growth of revolutionary networks 20 \x0c
