 Fifty years ago if someone told you that man could go to the moon would you believe it 
 
 Ten years ago if someone told you that the wisdom of machines would go up a notch better than 
 that of humans would you believe it 
 
 Now if someone tells you that digital money will become one of the main payment tools in the 
 world in the future do you believe it

 The Current Model of Digital Cash

 Point to Point Digital Cash System
 
 Bitcoin represented by POW mode needs the participation of physical miners 
 which consume a lot of power resources 
 
 According to Digiconomist sBitcoinEnergy Consumption Index as of November 20 
 2017 the annual power consumption of global Bitcoinmining is about 29 05 TWh 
 
 This means that Bitcoinmining now uses more electricity than 159 countries use 
 annually 
 
 Bitcoinearns block awards through competitive computing 
 
 With the upgrading of computer technology and the devaluation of mining 
 machines the result of vicious competition is that those who have no advantage 
 are forced to bear huge economic losses 
 
 E \ \ \ \LOGO\DSC png
 
 POS will be the direction of development 
 
 Difference between POS and POW
 
 Security mechanism
 
 The POS mechanism is simply a system that rewards 
 your block based on the amount of service you 
 provide to the block network Unlike the BitcoinPOW mechanism which uses computer power to 
 solve mathematical problems to get block rewards 
 the POS mechanism is that the holder provides 
 services to the network to get block rewards 
 Obtaining block rewards under POS mechanism is 
 related to the contribution of money holders to 
 network services without the high cost of power 
 consumption And the network transfer under POS 
 mechanism is faster and cheaper so it has become a 
 new direction of development 
 
 In addition the mining and interest of POS coins are 
 very different When POS is mining our coins are 
 still in our hands And when we get interest in the 
 bank we have already lent the money to the bank 
 POS mode is safer than bank 
 
 POS General Trend
 
 Since 2018 many digital currencies including ETH 
 have begun to shift from POW to POS mainly 
 because under the POW mechanism in the era of 
 scarce human resources mining machines consume 
 a large number of global power resources miners 
 consume enormous amount of computing power 
 thus raising the cost of handling fees which is not 
 conducive to rapid circulation the vicious 
 competition of mining computers traditional mining 
 machines are constantly eliminated because of 
 profits Great cuts high costs and the closure of 
 many large mines have made the whole network 
 face the threat of paralysis For all the above reasons 
 POW to POS will be the trend of the times

 In the era of global resource shortage with the progress of science and 
 technology in order to improve the efficiency of block chain network 
 people are developing other technologies that consume less energy such as 
 service certification and lightning network A new generation of computer 
 incentive mechanism POS mode came into being In May 2018 DashCashteam launched a more in depth research and development of POS mode 
 optimized and upgraded POS mode DashCash the world s first new full 
 incentive mechanism for POS masternodes was born

 The existence of POW mode can not fundamentally avoid 51% 
 arithmetic attack and double flower attack DashCashfull 
 masternodesreward mechanism avoids arithmetic attack and 
 double flowers originally making the DashCashnetwork safer 
 To attack DashCash more than half of the masternodesin the 
 world must be established This requires a lot of money to buy 
 more than 51% of DashCashfrom the market Due to the limited 
 total circulation of DashCash DashCashis held by a large 
 number of owners of masternodes which makes the attack 
 possible This is the inherent advantage of POS incentive 
 mechanism over POW Even VitalikButerin founder of ETF 
 Network plans to turn ETF from POW to POS 
 
 Super Clearing Capacity
 
 When tens of thousands of global masternodesjoin the 
 DashCashnetwork DashCash sprocessing capacity will reach 
 more than one million transactions per second (while Bitcoinsystem processes 3 4 transactions per second each transaction 
 takes 10 minutes or even hours) When there are tens of 
 thousands of global primary node networks DashCash sprocessing and settlement capacity will reach one million 
 transactions per second which will be more suitable for global 
 commerce even cocoa Compare with any payment system

 DashCashis based on Bitcoindeveloped by Satoshi Nakamoto which improves 
 and adds many new functions such as POS reward network also known as 
 masternodesnetwork such as de centralized point to point encrypted digital 
 currency It also includes anonymous payment (Darksend) to improve 
 interchangeability and InstantXto achieve instant transaction confirmation 
 without relying on central authority

 DashCashConcept
 
 In 2009 Satoshi Nakamotoproposed the concept of Bitcoin Since then Bitcoinhas 
 spread rapidly in mainstream applications and commercial uses becoming the first 
 digital currency to attract a large number of users and a milestone in the history of 
 digital currency However from the point of view of completing the transaction we can 
 find an important problem is that the confirmation time of Bitcoinblock is too long 
 Traditional payment companies have found a solution to achieve zero confirmation of 
 Bitcointransaction between buyers and sellers but this solution usually uses a trusted 
 third party outside the agreement to complete the transaction Bitcoinprovides 
 anonymous transactions realizes one to one transactions between senders and 
 recipients and records transactions that have occurred throughout the network forever 
 Bitcoinonly provides low level privacy protection which is well known in academia 
 Despite its shortcomings many people still believe in the transfer history recorded in 
 block chains Basedon Satoshi Nakamoto sachievements DashCashis the world s 
 leading encrypted digital currency with the purpose of protecting privacy We have 
 made a series of improvements on the basis of the concept of Bitcoin resulting in a de 
 centralized and well anonymous encrypted digital currency which supports tamper 
 proof real time transactions as well as a point to point network providing service 
 incentives for the DashCashNetwork 
 
 
 Full nodes are servers running on the P2P network 
 allowing nodes to use them to accept dynamic changes 
 from the whole network These full nodes need 
 significant traffic and other resources which consume a 
 lot of costs Therefore the number of these nodes on the 
 Bitcoinnetwork shows a steady downward trend over a 
 period of time which increases the block broadcasting 
 time by an additional 40 seconds Tosolve this problem 
 many schemes have been proposed such as introducing 
 new incentive schemes for Microsoft Research and 
 Bitnodesincentive schemes Thesenodes are very 
 important to the health of the network They enable 
 clients to synchronize and broadcast information quickly 
 through the whole network These nodes will have high 
 availability and will be rewarded by the masternodesafter providing services that meet the requirements of 
 the network

 How to establish the masternodes 
 
 DashCashGlobal Next Generation Ultimate Privacy Protection Point to Point Digital Cash System
 
 You need to deposit 10 000 DashCash(unlocked ready to pay cash) spend tens of dollars a 
 year to buy a server through a few simple steps to run the DashCashnode server can get the 
 masternodesreward the masternodesis similar to the BitcoinMiner the difference is only 
 the incentive mechanism of course you can cash the funds deposited at any time or you can 
 Retention continues to appreciate When your expenditure is realized the masternodeswill 
 stop running and the associated block rewards will stop paying 
 
 The masternodesis established as follows Select1 Host Masternodes NodeRunningpersonal 
 servers requires users to have a certain understanding of block chains and operating systems 
 Considering that not every user has such knowledge accumulation some community members 
 provide paid hosting services for users In other words users with hosting services can get a 
 block reward by depositing a master margin and paying a hosting service fee If you need to 
 know about the hosting settings of the masternodes please consult the community members 
 who provide the relevant hosting services Selection2 Self operated Masternodes NodeUserswho have a deep understanding (or curiosity) of the operation principle of DashCashHosting 
 Service Network can operate their own masternodeson personal hosting servers This requires 
 users to take a number of steps and assume the responsibility of erecting protecting and 
 maintaining servers and margins For more information about creating self operating 
 masternodes please refer to the online tutorial on creating masternodeson the official 
 website 
 
 E \ \ \ \LOGO\DSC png
 
 The main reason for the sharp decrease of all nodes in Bitcoinnetwork is the lack of rewards for running nodes With the passage of time more users will access the whole 
 network the demand for bandwidth will be higher and the demand for funds for node operators will be more As a result the cost of running the whole node will be increased 
 Considering the rising cost node operators must reduce their operating costs or run light clients but this is totally unhealthy for network health Likethe Bitcoinnetwork the 
 masternodesis the whole node but the difference is that the masternodesmust provide certain services to the whole network and need a certain amount of deposit to join The 
 deposit will not be lost and it is safe when the masternodesruns This allows investors to provide services for the whole network while earning a certain investment income 
 reducing price volatility Running a masternodesrequires storing 10 000 DashCash When the masternodestakes effect it can provide services for the clients of the whole 
 network and get rewards in the form of interest This allows users to invest in the service but at the same time get a certain return The benefit of the masternodesis that 100% 
 of the block incentives are included in the plan Consideringthe fact that the node of the masternodesfluctuates it is expected that the reward of the masternodeswill vary 
 according to the total number of active masternodes The following formulas can be used to calculate the benefits of running the masternodesfor a whole day (n/t)* R * b * aN 
 Number of masternodescontrolled by the operator t total number of masternodes r current reward for each block (current reward is 21 DashCash the number of blocks 
 decreases by 8% year by year) b average number of blocks per day in the current DashCashnetwork the number of blocks per day is usually 1440 a reward for the 
 masternodes(100% of each block reward) The revenue formula for running the masternodesis ((n/t)* R * b * a * 365) / 10000 (the variables in the formula are the same as those 
 mentioned above) It requires cost to run the masternodes which creates hard and soft constraints for the effective nodes on the network Soft constraints are caused by the cost 
 of configuring nodes and the amount of platform retention because DashCashis a currency in circulation not just for investment purposes Determinethe order Use a specific 
 deterministic algorithm to create a pseudo random sort of the masternodes Using the hash algorithm designed for each block the masternodesnetwork can provide security to 
 support this sort Select the code of the masternodes 
 
 For(mastenodein masternodes){
 
 n = masternode CalculateScore() 
 
 if(n > best_score){
 
 best_score= n 
 
 winning_node= masternode 
 
 }
 
 }
 
 CMasterNode CalculateScore(){
 
 n1 = GetProofOfWorkHash(nBlockHeight) // get the hash of this block
 
 n2 = Hash(n1) //hash the POW hash to increase the entropy
 
 n3 = abs(n2 masternode_vin) 
 
 return n3 
 
 }
 
 The example code can also be further extended to sort masternodes and the calculation of second third and fourth masternodes and so on 
 
 MasternodesAward Scheme Cost and Award
 
 
 Quorum without trust Currently DashCashmasternodesnetwork needs 10 000 DashCashguarantees to become a valid masternodes We created a system in which no 
 one could control the entire master network For example if someone wants to control 50% of the primary network they will haveto buy 50% of the total DashCashfrom 
 the open market This will greatly increase the price of the currency so it is impossible to get so much DashCash Onthe premise of having the primary node network and 
 guarantee conditions we use the secondary network in a non trust way for highly sensitive tasks and no one can control the evolution of the network N pseudo random 
 masternodesare selected from the total pool to perform the same task These nodes can act as referees without the participation of the whole network For example a 
 non trusted Quormfinds InstantX which uses Quormto confirm transactions and lock inputs Anotherexample is that untrustedQuorum can use the masternodesnetwork as a de centralized predictor of financial markets which makes it possible to achieve de centralized contracts Roleand service certification mechanism Themasternodescan provide arbitrary additional services to the network As pointed out in the concept our first successful applications wereDarksend(anonymous delivery) 
 and InstantX(instant payment) Using what we call a service volume certification mechanism these nodes can be required to be online and respond even at the correct 
 block height Malicious people can also run the masternodes but will not provide any substantive services to the network In order to reduce the probability that these 
 people will use the system to do something beneficial to their nodes it is necessary to Ping the remaining networks to ensure that they remain active This work is 
 accomplished by selecting two Quorums in each block through the masternodesnetwork Quorum A checks the services for each block of Quorum B Quorum A is the 
 nearest node to the current block hash while Quorum B is the farthest node away from the said block hash The main node A (1) checks the masternodesB (2300) A (2) 
 checks the masternodesB (2299) A (3) checks the masternodesB (2298) checks the network to verify that the node is valid which is completed by the masternodesitself 
 1% of all network blocks will be checked This allows the entire network to be checked about six times a day In order to keep the system untrusted we use Quorum 
 system to randomly select nodes but we also need at least six checks to detect a malicious node Inorder to deceive the system the attacker has to be selected six times 
 in a round Otherwise the purpose of deception will be discovered by the system so that it will not succeed and so will othernodes

 The masternodesbroadcasts the whole network using a series of extended protocols including the announcement mechanism of the masternodesmessage 
 and the Ping mechanism of the masternodesmessage 
 
 These two kinds of mechanisms are used to confirm that the whole network nodes are in effective state In addition to them Darksendand InstantXare also 
 required to implement the service certification mechanism Send10 000 DashCashto a specific address in the wallet and the activation code naturally 
 generates the masternodesthat can broadcast over the whole network followed by the secondary private key generation which is used to sign all other 
 information in addition it can be used to lock the wallet completely when running single machine mode Usingsecondary private keys on two separate 
 machines makes cold mode possible 
 
 The main hot client signs the input of 10000 DashCash which involves signing the information with a secondary private key Later the cold client can 
 discover the information containing the secondary private key and activate the masternodes 
 
 This invalidates the hot client (the client is closed) so that an attacker cannot access the activated masternodesto steal 10 000 DashCash 
 
 When the masternodesstarts to run it will send masternodesbroadcast information to the whole network including Information (10000 DashCashinput 
 accessible IP address signature signature time public key containing 10000 DashCash secondary public key public key for donation percentage of 
 donation)Thereafter every 15 minutes a ping message will be sent to the outside world to prove that the node is in effect Information (10000 DashCashinput signature (using secondary private key) signature time)Over time the network will remove the failed node so that the node is no longer used by the 
 client or used for payment 
 
 Nodes can also Ping the network continuously but if their ports are not opened they will eventually be marked as invalid and no longer be used for 
 payment Broadcastingof masternodeslistNewclients entering the DashCashnetwork must find active masternodesthroughout the network so that they 
 can use their services Once they join a mesh network their nodes receive instructions to request a list of masternodes 
 
 The purpose of setting the cache is to let the client record the masternodesand its current state so when the client restarts they simply load the file 
 without requiring a complete list of the masternodes Paymentsand mandatory regulations using blocksInorder to ensure that each masternodesreceives 
 the reward of block the network forces each block to pay the reward to the correct masternodes 
 
 We propose a strategy that the masternodesrepresents a Quorum select the winning masternodesand broadcast their information 
 
 After N broadcasts of information the same target receiver will be selected so that the selected block after consensus will be rewarded to the masternodes 
 
 MasternodesProtocol
 
 
 We believe that in order to enhance the intensity of client protection of user privacy it is important to achieve a standardnon trust system Clients such as electrum 
 Android and the iPhonewill also directly embed the same anonymity layer and make good use of protocol extensibility This gives users the same experience when 
 sending money anonymously using a solid system Darksendis an improved and extended version of CoinJoin which provides anonymous technology In addition to the 
 core concepts of Coin Join we have also made a series of improvements such as de centralization strong anonymity through links the same denomination and passive 
 advanced currency mixing technology Inorder to improve privacy and interchangeability of encrypted digital currency the biggest challenge is not to encrypt the entire 
 block chain In the encrypted digital currency system based on bitcoin we can see which outputs are not sent and which are sent Usually it is called UTXO which is called 
 unused transaction output This allows each user to act as a guarantor of honest transactions in public accounts Bitcoinprotocol is designed without the participation of 
 third parties Without the participation of third parties it is very important to be able to read user information at any time through the public block chain to achieve 
 auditing Our goal is to improve confidentiality and interchangeability without losing these elements We firmly believe thatthis is the key to creating a successful digital 
 currency Usingthe de centralized mixed currency service within the range of digital money we can make money itself fully interchangeable Interchangeability is the 
 property of money which decides that all units of money should be equal When you receive money in the form of currency themoney should not keep the previous 
 user s use record or the user can easily get rid of the previous use history so that all currencies are equal At the same time any user ensures that every transaction in 
 public accounts is honest without affecting the privacy of others Inorder to improve the interchangeability and maintain the honesty of the public block chain we 
 propose to use advanced non trust decentralized mixed currency technology In order to maintain currency interchangeability this service is directly integrated into the 
 currency system which is easy and safe for each user 
 
 Coinjointracks the flow of funds through accounts
 
 A simple strategy is to integrate Coinjoinon the basis of existing Bitcoins that is merge transactions together By tracking the flow of user funds in joint 
 transactions the identity of users will be exposed 
 
 Figure For example integrate two user transactions into Coinjointransactions
 
 In this transaction 0 05 bitcoinsare sent out using mixed currency technology In order to track the source of the funds you only need to add up the 
 amount on the right and match the amount on the left 
 
 Re portfolio Trading
 
 0 05+0 0499+0 0001(fee) = 0 10BTC 0 0499+0 05940182+0 0001(fee) = 0 10940182BTC 
 
 As more users join the mixing process the difficulty of getting results will increase exponentially However at some point in the future the results can be 
 traced and anonymity is invalid

 Direct Link and Relay Link
 
 In other implementations of Coinjoin it is possible for users to anonymizefunds and send transactions to platforms or individuals who know the sender s 
 identity But this breaks anonymity and allows others to track user transactions forward We call this type of attack relay links 
 
 
 
 Figure Relay conversion link
 
 In this example Alice sends 1 2BTC anonymously with 1BTC and 0 2BTC respectively and then 0 7BTC from the output of 1BTC Theremaining 0 3BTC is sent 
 to identifiable objects In essence Alice has successfully sent 0 7BTC anonymously 
 
 In order to identify the sender of anonymous transactions it is necessary to start with the exchange transaction link and trace forward through the block 
 chain until Alice sends 0 7 BTCs anonymously Once you find it you will find that your users have recently purchased something anonymously to see 
 through the anonymous transaction We call this type of attack mediation transformation links 
 
 Anonymous payment

 Because transactions are merged together it is possible for the masternodesto peep when user funds flow through Since each masternodesis required 
 to hold 10 000 DashCashand users choose random masternodesto deploy their funds snooping has little impact The probability of tracking transactions 
 through block chains is calculated as follows 
 
 The above table Considering the probability of tracking Darksendtransactions across the network when an attacker controls N nodes
 
 N attackers control the total number of nodes t the total number of masternodesin the whole network r the selection of masternodesin block chain 
 depth is random Considering the limited supply of DashCashand the low market liquidity it is impossible to control so many masternodesin an attack The 
 security of the system can also be greatly improved by expanding the system by hiding transactions occurring on the masternodes

 Masternodesmasking using relay system
 
 Above we describe the probability of using Darksend smulti round mixing technology to track a single transaction This can be further enhanced by 
 masking the masternodesso that they cannot see the user s input/output direction To achieve this we propose a simple relay system that allows users to 
 protect their identity 
 
 Instead of letting users submit input and output transactions directly to the mine we let them randomly select the masternodesfrom the whole network 
 and then request it to transmit the input/output/signature relay to the target masternodes This means that the masternodeswill receive N inputs/outputs 
 and N group signatures Each round of currency mixing only serves one of the users but the masternodescan not know which user it is 
 
 InstantXfor Instant Transaction
 
 Using the Quorum of the masternodes users can send and receive immediate irreversible transactions Once Quorum is formed the input of the transaction 
 is locked into the corresponding specific transaction which currently takes about 4 seconds for the whole network transaction to lock If a lock in consensus 
 is reached in the primary network all transactions and blocks that conflict with it will be rejected forever unless they match the ID of the transaction that 
 was locked at that time Thiswill allow businesses to use mobile devices in real business to replace traditional POS machines and users can do face to facenon commercial transactions as quickly as they do with traditional paper money There is no central authority to intervene in this process 
 
 Block reward quantity supply
 
 Another way DashCashcan reduce inflation caused by the number of block incentives is to cut production by 8% per year in supply DashCash sopening 
 plan will continue in this century until the end of the next century and eventually block awards will stop around 2180 
 
 Related improvement
 
 
 Mixed currency Technology
 
 To enhance the privacy of the system as a whole we use the same face values of 0 1 DashCash 1 DashCash 10 DashCashand 100 DashCash In each 
 round of currency mixing all users should input and output funds in the form of the same denomination In addition to using thesame par value 
 transaction fees will be removed and all transactions will be decomposed into discrete independent unrelated small transactions 
 
 When users raise their requests to the mixing pool the transaction begins with a deposit If the user does not cooperate at some time such as refusing 
 to sign the deposit transaction will automatically broadcast over the whole network The cost of persistent attacks on anonymous networks is extremely 
 high 
 
 Passive capital and block chain anonymity
 
 Darksend smixing limit is 10 000 DashCashper round and a considerable amount of money can be mixed anonymously in multiple rounds Darksendruns in a passive mode in order to make user experience convenient and attack difficult At the same time set the time interval the client of the user 
 should connect other clients through the masternodes Once entering the masternodes the amount of anonymous face value required by the user will 
 be queued for broadcasting in turn throughout the network but no information will expose the user s identity 
 
 Each round of the Dearksendprocess can be regarded as an independent event to enhance the anonymity of user funds However only three 
 participants are limited in each round Therefore one third of the observers have the opportunity to track transactions In order to improve the quality of 
 anonymity links are used to send funds through multiple masternodesin turn

 This white paper introduces various 
 concepts aimed at improving the Bitcoinprotocol which means better privacy 
 interchangeability less price fluctuations 
 and faster information broadcasting across 
 the network for ordinary users All of this is 
 achieved by using the main node incentive 
 model rather than borrowing the existing 
 single tier model of other digital currencies 
 such as Bitcoin Using this alternative 
 network design makes it possible to add 
 more types of services such as de 
 centralized mixing technology instant 
 trading and de centralized predictions using 
 masternodesquorum
