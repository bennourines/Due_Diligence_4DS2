not traded whether on any cryptocurrency exchange or otherwise In the event that the TVS Tokens are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange there is no assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the TVS Tokens 5 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 will develop or if developed be sustained There is also no assurance that the market price of the Tokens will not decline below the purchase amount paid for the TVS Tokens which is not indicative of such market price ii A TVS Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national supra national or quasi national organisation nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit Trustverse and its Affiliates are not responsible for nor do they pursue the circulation and trading of the TVS Tokens on the market Trading of the TVS Tokens merely depends on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants and no one is obliged to acquire any TVS Token from any holder of the TVS Token including the purchasers of the

market for the TVS Tokens or that the price upon which the TVS Tokens were purchased is indicative of the market price of the TVS Tokens if they are made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange Risks Relating to the Company its Affiliates and the Open Platform (a) Limited availability of sufficient information i The Trustverse platform is still at an early development phase as of the date of this Whitepaper Its governance structure purpose consensus mechanism algorithm code infrastructure design and other technical specifications and parameters may be updated and changed frequently without notice While this Whitepaper contains the key information currently available in relation to the Trustverse platform it is subject to adjustments and updates from time to time as announced on the Trustverse\xe2\x80\x99s website Purchasers will not have full access to all the information relevant to the TVS Tokens and/or the Trustverse platform Nevertheless it is anticipated that significant milestones and progress reports will be announced on the Trustverse\xe2\x80\x99s website (b) The digital assets raised in the sale of TVS Tokens are exposed to risks of theft i Whilst Trustverse and its Affiliates will make every effort to ensure that the ETH and other digital assets received from the sale of TVS Tokens are securely held through the implementation of security measures there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks mining attacks sophisticated cyber attacks distributed denials of service or errors vulnerabilities or defects on such blockchain addresses the Ethereum Blockchain or any other blockchain or otherwise Such events may include for example flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof In such event even if the sale of TVS Tokens is completed Trustverse and its Affiliates may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and Trustverse and its Affiliates may not be able to utilize such funds for the development of the Trustverse platform and the launch of the Trustverse platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed As such the issued TVS Tokens may hold little worth or value The TVS Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them In the event of any loss or loss of value of the TVS Tokens you may have no recourse (c) The blockchain address(es) may be compromised and the digital assets may not be able to be retrieved 6 \x0cwww TrustVerse io i 2018 09 The blockchain address(es) are designed to be secured However in the event that the blockchain address(es) for the receipt of purchase amounts or otherwise are for any reason compromised (including but not limited to scenarios of the loss of keys to such blockchain address(es) the funds held at such blockchain address(es) may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed and may be permanently unrecoverable In such event even if the sale of the TVS Tokens is successful Trustverse and its Affiliates will not be able to receive the funds raised and Trustverse and its Affiliates will not be able to utilize such funds for the development of the Trustverse platform and the implementation of the Trustverse platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed As such distributed TVS Tokens may hold little worth or value (d) There is no assurance of any success of the Trustverse platform and Trustverse and its Affiliates may cease the development launch and operation of the Trustverse platform i The value of and demand for the TVS Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the Trustverse platform There is no assurance that the Trustverse platform will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success The Trustverse platform has not been fully developed finalized and integrated and is subject to further changes updates and adjustments prior to its launch Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users and hence impact its success There are no guarantees that the process for creating the TVS Tokens will be uninterrupted or error free ii While the Trustverse has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate there is also no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the sale of TVS Tokens will be sufficient for the development and integration of the Trustverse platform For the foregoing or any other reason the development and integration of the Trustverse platform may not be completed and there is no assurance that its systems protocols or products will be launched at all As such distributed TVS Tokens may hold little or no worth or value iii Additional reasons which may result in the termination of the development launch or operation of the Trustverse platform includes but is not limited to (aa) an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies (bb) the inability of Trustverse and its Affiliates to establish the Trustverse platform or the TVS Tokens\xe2\x80\x99 utility or to resolve technical problems and issues faced in relation to the development or operation of the Trustverse platform or the TVS Token the failure of commercial relationships (cc) intellectual property disputes during development or operation and (dd) changes in the future capital needs of Trustverse or its Affiliates and the availability of financing and capital to fund such needs For the aforesaid and other reasons the Trustverse platform may no longer be a viable project and may be dissolved or simply not launched negatively impacting the Trustverse platform and the potential utility and value of the TVS Tokens (e) There may be lack of demand for Trustverse platform and the services provided which would impact the value of the Tokens 7 \x0cwww TrustVerse io i 2018 09 There is a risk that upon launching of the Trustverse platform there is a lack of interest from consumers merchants advertisers and other key participants for the Trustverse platform and the services and that there may be limited interest and therefore use of the Trustverse platform and the TVS Tokens Such a lack of interest could impact the operation of the Trustverse platform and the uses or potential value of the TVS Tokens ii There is a risk of competition from alternative platforms that may have been established or even from existing businesses which would target any segment of the potential users of the Trustverse platform fulfilling similar demands e g Facebook or other corporations targeting advertisers seeking purchase consumer data and market analysis Therefore in the event that the competition results in a lack of interest and demand for the Trustverse platform the services and the TVS Tokens the operation of the Trustverse platform and the value of the TVS Tokens may be negatively impacted (f) Trustverse and its Affiliates may experience system failures unplanned interruptions in its network or services hardware or software defects security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect Trustverse or its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 infrastructure network or the Trustverse platform i Trustverse and its Affiliates are unable to anticipate or detect when there would be occurrences of hacks cyber attacks mining attacks (including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks and \xe2\x80\x9cselfish mining\xe2\x80\x9d attacks) distributed denials of service or errors vulnerabilities or defects in the Trustverse platform the TVS Tokens or any technology (including but not limited to Smart Contract technology) on which Trustverse its Affiliates the Trustverse platform the TVS Tokens rely on or the Ethereum Blockchain or any other blockchain Such events may include for example flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof Trustverse and its Affiliates may not be able to detect such issues in a timely manner and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession ii Although Trustverse and its Affiliates will be taking steps against malicious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure which are critical for the maintenance of the Trustverse platform and its other services there can be no assurance that cyber attacks such as distributed denials of service will not be attempted in the future and that any of such security measures will be effective Any significant breach of security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability stability and security of the Company and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 network or services including the Trustverse platform Risks Relating to the Participation in the Sale of Tokens (a) You may not be able to recover the purchase amount paid for the TVS Tokens i Except as provided under any applicable terms of sale or prescribed by applicable laws and regulations Trustverse is not obliged to provide you with a refund of the purchase amount No promises of future 8 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 performance or price are or will be made in respect to the TVS Tokens including promises of inherent value or continuing payments and there is no guarantee that the TVS Tokens will hold any particular value Therefore the recovery of the purchase amount may be impossible or may be subject to applicable laws and regulations (b) You may be subject to adverse legal and/or tax implications as a result of the purchase distribution and use of the Tokens i The legal character of cryptocurrency and cryptographic assets remain uncertain There is a risk that the TVS Tokens may be considered securities in certain jurisdictions or may be considered to be securities in certain jurisdictions in the future Trustverse and its Affiliate does not provide any warranty or guarantee as to how the TVS Tokens will be classified and each purchaser will bear all consequences of the TVS Tokens being considered securities in their respective jurisdictions and bear the responsibility of the legality use and transfer of the TVS Tokens in the relevant jurisdictions ii Further the tax treatment of the acquisition or disposal of such cryptocurrency or cryptographic assets might depend on whether they are classified as securities assets currency or otherwise As the tax characterization of the TVS Tokens remains indeterminate you must seek your own tax advice in connection with the purchase of the TVS Tokens which may result in adverse tax consequences or tax reporting requirements for you (c) The loss or compromise of information relating to the purchaser wallet and your Trustverse platform ID may affect your access to and possession of the TVS Tokens i There is a risk that you may lose access to and possession of the TVS Tokens permanently due to loss of unique personal ID created on the Trustverse platform and other identification information loss of requisite private key(s) associated with the purchaser wallet or vault storing the TVS Tokens or any other kind of custodial or purchaser errors (d) Blockchains may face congestion and transactions may be delayed or lost i Most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions (e g Ethereum) are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost Individuals may also intentionally spam the network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens This may result in a situation where block producers may not include your purchase of the TVS Tokens when you intends to transact or your transaction may not be included at all Privacy and data retention issues (a) As part of the TVS Token sales the verification processes and the subsequent operation of the Trustverse platform Trustverse may collect personal information from you The collection of such information is subject 9 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 to applicable laws and regulations All information collected will be used for purposes of the TVS Token sales and operations of the Trustverse platform thus it may be transferred to contractors service providers and consultants worldwide as appointed by Trustverse Apart from external compromises Trustverse and its appointed entities may also suffer from internal security breaches whereby their employees may misappropriate misplace or lose personal information of purchasers Trustverse may be required to expend significant financial resources to alleviate problems caused by any breaches or losses settle fines and resolve inquiries from regulatory or government authorities Any information breaches or losses will also damage Trustverse\xe2\x80\x99s reputations thereby harming its long term prospects Macro Risks (a) General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on Trustverse and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 operations and the use of the Trustverse platform i Trustverse and its Affiliates could be affected by general global economic and market conditions Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large Weakness in the economy may have a negative effect on Trustverse and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 business strategies results of operations and prospects ii Suppliers on which Trustverse platform relies for servers bandwidth location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on Trustverse and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 operations or expenses iii There can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on Trustverse and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 business strategies results of operations and prospects and hence the Trustverse platform which may in turn impact the value of the TVS Tokens (b) The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies cryptocurrencies TVS Tokens offering of TVS Tokens and the Trustverse platform remain uncertain and any changes regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Trustverse platform and the utility of the TVS Tokens i Regulation of the TVS Tokens the offer and sale of TVS Tokens cryptocurrencies blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges is currently undeveloped or underdeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve Such regulation also varies significantly among different jurisdictions and is hence subject to significant uncertainty The various legislative and executive bodies in different jurisdictions may in the future adopt laws regulations guidance or other actions which may severely impact the development and growth of the Trustverse platform the adoption and utility of the TVS Tokens or the issue offer and sale of the TVS Tokens by Trustverse Failure by Trustverse and its Affiliates or users of the Trustverse platform to comply with any laws rules and regulations some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may 10 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 be subject to change could result in a variety of adverse consequences against Trustverse and its Affiliates including civil penalties and fines ii Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions Various jurisdictions may in the near future adopt laws regulations or directives that affect the Trustverse platform and therefore the value of the TVS Tokens Such laws regulations or directives may directly and negatively impact the operations of Trustverse and its Affiliates The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict but such change could be substantial and could materially adverse to the development and growth of the Trustverse platform and the adoption and utility of the TVS Tokens iii To the extent that Trustverse and its Affiliates may be required to obtain licenses permits and/or approvals (collectively the \xe2\x80\x9cRegulatory Approvals\xe2\x80\x9d) to carry out its business including that of the creation of the TVS Tokens and the development and operation of the Trustverse platform but are unable to obtain such Regulatory Approvals or if such Regulatory Approvals are not renewed or revoked for whatever reason by the relevant authorities the business of Trustverse and its Affiliates may be adversely affected iv There is no assurance that more stringent requirements will not be imposed upon Trustverse and its Affiliates by the relevant authorities in the future or that Trustverse and its Affiliates will be able to adapt in a timely manner to changing regulatory requirements These additional or more stringent regulations may restrict Trustverse and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 ability to operate its business and Trustverse and its Affiliates may face actions for non compliance if it fails to comply with any of such requirements v Further should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold maintaining the Trustverse platform may no longer be commercially viable and Trustverse and its Affiliates may opt to discontinue the Trustverse platform and/or the TVS Tokens Further it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications including the Trustverse platform and the TVS Tokens Trustverse and its Affiliates may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or make it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction In scenarios such as the foregoing the distributed TVS Tokens may hold little or no worth or value (c) There may be risks relating to acts of God natural disasters wars terrorist attacks riots civil commotions widespread communicable diseases and other events beyond the control of Trustverse and its Affiliates i The sale of the TVS Tokens and the performance of Trustverse its Affiliates and/or the Trustverse platform\xe2\x80\x99s activities may be interrupted suspended or delayed due to acts of God natural disasters wars terrorist attacks riots civil commotions widespread communicable diseases and other events beyond the control of Trustverse and its Affiliates Such events could also lead to uncertainty in the economic outlook of global markets and there is no assurance that such markets will not be affected or that recovery from the global 11 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 financial crisis would continue In such events Trustverse and its Affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 business strategies results of operations and outlook may be materially and adversely affected and the demand for and use of the TVS Tokens and the Trustverse platform may be materially affected Further if an outbreak of such infectious or communicable diseases occurs in any of the countries in which Trustverse its Affiliates and the participants of the Trustverse platform have operations in the future market sentiment could be adversely affected and this may have a negative impact on the Trustverse platform and its community Blockchain and cryptocurrencies including the TVS Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology In addition to the risks highlighted herein there are other risks associated with your purchase of holding and use of the TVS Tokens including those that we cannot anticipate Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein 1 6 No Further Information or Update No person has been or is authorized to give any information or representation not contained

traditional cryptocurrency & token usage In paradigm shift of global economy such as financial crisis pose a threat to currency security and its value depreciation Such is the same with cryptocurrencies which are built on IT advancements with no notable intrinsic value Extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies makes investors hesitate to purchase new tokens as part of the investment for new protocols or DAPP There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a structured financial model or even standardized taxation policy Even regulation is a huge issue Crypto market has been highly sentiment driven market This led to the creation of TVS Token TVS Token aims to eliminate inherent weaknesses of cryptocurrency information asymmetry lack of utility and provides investors with a credible portfolio based

Critical Review Of The Conventional Financial System In the current conventional financial system individuals contribute to economic activities Nevertheless assets accumulated by those individuals are exposed to risks due to various instabilities such as global financial crises uncertainties in macroeconomic policy state administrations and political turmoil In view of this shared capital and collective intelligence not influenced by specific countries or third parties have created the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology Still in its initial phase there are numerous technical restraints change in government policies and market volatility that the cryptocurrency market must overcome Furthermore most fund or financial product offered through private banking service or financial services are lacking its transparency For a currency to become a medium of exchange a reliable standard of value must be guaranteed However due to high volatility cryptocurrency is struggling with unreliability despite the hyped expectation as an alternative currency and an asset of the future This volatility is the reason we constantly hear warnings of the dangers involved in cryptocurrency investment Ever evolving blockchain enables Smart Contracts of different forms Now combined with multiple devices blockchain is opening an era in which it is widely accepted in our daily lives and the society due to its transparency and trust algorithm A new cryptocurrency system with the potential to dramatically resolve its volatility issues and to fundamentally improve its stability will present a whole new paradigm in asset management 1 1 Limitations of Conventional Currency (Currency & Cryptocurrency) It was from the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 that investors have become suspicious of conventional currencies Since the mid 2000s major banks in the U S indiscriminately offered mortgage loans that fatally weakened the financial stability of the U S as well as that of the world A series of events such as the collapse of subprime mortgages and the bankruptcies of subprime mortgage firms rapidly escalated into the global financial crisis The Republic of Venezuela recently on the brink of sovereign default went through a hyperinflation of 4 300% in 2017 followed by a plunge in currency value Now paper craftsmen in the country make handicrafts with 1 000 sheets of 16 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 100 bolivar notes the highest denomination of the local currency Today 100 000 bolivar values even less than 50 cents U S D As such when faced with the global financial crisis and collapsing local currencies certain individuals had no way out but to suffer financial losses even though they were unrelated to any of the causes that led to such events Throughout human history many economic downturns have unavoidably repeated themselves at multiple levels great recession lesser depression long recession and so forth Assets certain individuals have earned have been diminished regardless of the efforts they have made In the modern society where countries are hyper connected it is even less likely to predict what would impact an individual\xe2\x80\x99s assets As such blockchain appeared as an attempt to overcome limits of the traditional financial system and to ensure sovereignty of transaction parties run by centralized financial organizations This limit of volatility is also the case with cryptocurrency traded on blockchain systems In the wake of hacks targeting major exchanges coupled with regulations on cryptocurrency trading imposed in some countries like China and South Korea cryptocurrency prices went up and down like a roller coaster ride Bitcoin once exceeded USD 20 000 plummeted to below USD 10 000 after regulation announcements from some countries Such volatility is a sheer threat that needs to be addressed for investors however much of it is still unresolved 1 2 Limitations of Existing Asset Management Service Extended life expectancy and the age of the aging society is on the rise Demand for financial investment is increasing In particular asset management in relation to gift giving and inheritance has become a major financial service Funeral arrangements which are traditionally handled by family members are now being taken care of by the individuals themselves However these services provided through existing financial institutions have a high barrier to entry because of the cost time and or effort to understand complicated financial legal and tax matters Global assets (global stocks and bonds) are in the spotlight among financial investments However the information available is inadequate and management of such assets involves much time and high fees Taxes on inheritance and gift differ by country and asset type and additional costs such as legal fees are inevitable Many deceased generally have their wills as a hard copy describing how their assets should be allocated and inherited after their death Without sharing their wills with anyone some of the deceased do not leave evidentiary documents This explains frequent disputes among inheritors while distributing the deceased assets Although notarized services can solve this problem costs are incurred and the process is complicated In the case of cryptocurrency there is no way for an inheritor to get hold of the information should the owner suddenly pass away without providing a password and the form of money kept 17 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 \xe2\x80\x9c TrustVerse is the

Stability Conventional currencies and cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and are not insulated from risks Despite the expectation that cryptocurrency will be a substitute currency/asset for the future many investors fail to make that investment decision Bitcoins are included in the futures option and are listed on the CME (the Chicago Mercantile Exchange) yet they are not officially recognized as an alternative asset In order for cryptocurrencies to be accepted as a means of exchange price instability and volatility must be resolved TrustVerse aims to provide the right solution with the social vision of stabilizing the value of the currency and implementing a set value 2 2 From Anxiety to Safety Increase Credibility Through A Trust Machine TrustVerse seeks to stabilize the

Crypto/Digital Currency Portfolio The Challenge of Cryptocurrency Asset Management\xe2\x80\x93 High Correlation A new financial asset that began to come to light in 2016 encrypted assets are relatively vulnerable to volatility relative to other financial assets Encrypted assets are inherently risky investments and investors choose diversified investments in a variety of cryptocurrency to overcome these risks however this is a misconception The following table is the 90 day correlation for the most liquid crypto currencies as of April 7 2018 For financial instruments the correlation between two instruments is considered very high when it is above 0 3 Crypto currencies exhibit extreme correlation indicating the buying and selling behaviors and counterparties across currencies potentially overlap to a high degree This phenomenon is particular dangerous for crypto investors who attempt to diversify their portfolio among currencies \xe2\x80\x93 as all instruments are strongly linked with each other directionally there would be little diversification effect to reduce portfolio risk As the table indicates below in the short term one can see visually their trends exhibit similar patterns Therein imbedded the inherent challenge of construct a diversified portfolio as most liquid assets are highly correlated 31 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 Cryptocurrency Correlation Matrix 90 Days Source Sifr Data 32 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 The A I Initiative for a Superior and Safer Portfolio The A I system driven primarily by deep neural net utilizes forward looking short term trends of top 50 crypto currencies with respect to their a) risk b) correlation with each other and c) directional trends Traditional method such as Monte Carlo simulation has proven to be ineffective as the methodology in a strongly trending market such as Bitcoin had been in 2017 in essence reproduces a historical pattern with random white noise The following is a price simulation for Bitcoin as of Jan 26 2018 Source John Young at Cryptosheets com Based on the simulation the Bitcoin price would have climbed back to USD20 000 now (April 7 2018) and continue the trajectory to USD 60 000 at the end of the year This is by no means a criticism of the analysis but merely pointing out many conventional and supposedly advanced analytical tools are unsuitable for trending volatile prices with long future horizons Our initiative here is to carefully evaluate the relationships of crypto currencies with each other and with the global capital markets As crypto currencies behave similar to financial derivatives with hard to assess fundamental values they are highly speculative market driven products similar to the Dot Com Bubble in the late 90s 33 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018

neural network\xe2\x80\x9d broadly as they both incorporate many advancements and new techniques since 2016 specifically outside of visual recognition AI based asset management Smart Contracts and financial services engines are not used not only for lifetime portfolio composition asset management but also post mortem TrustVerse provides inheritance design services for efficient asset location after the user\xe2\x80\x99s death Deep Neural Reinforcement Learning AI analyzes the inheritance setting (realistic and legal setting) of a deceased person by the basis of a predetermined inheritance design that helps to select legally valid targets The AI function recommends not only the inheritance legal procedures according to the nationality of each user but also a tax free program for giving and inheriting Inheritance design results are stored on a private Smart Contract that can protect the privacy of the family through which the assets of the deceased are reliable distributed to the assigned recipient The private family Smart Contract can only be executed after the deceased person is confirmed either through submission of a death certificate or the consent of all the family members 35 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 5 4 TrustVerse Blockchain Technology (Smart Wallet & Double Encryption of Data) Everyone wants to safeguard their assets However there are many restrictions Our goal is to overcome these restrictions and be able to create a free trade environment In addition to this everyone wants to obtain professional knowledge and advice for asset stabilization As a solution we propose a `Smart Wallet` for personalized life management to address these needs TrustVerse blockchain technology ensures integrity and transparency of the main data set The advantage of the blockchain main technology is to protect anonymity and forgery of information TrustVerse intends to provide financial services such as asset protection gift inheritance and tax treatment of equity portfolio assets including cryptocurrency tax and legal data services for inheritance design Smart Contracts are also supported It is essential to treat personal information with care As long as the blockchain network (ERC 20) sustains personal information recorded in the blockchain through the Smart Contract it cannot be deleted or modified and will be permanently maintained Therefore personal information such as privacy violation related technical legal and institutional issues will be resolved 36 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 TrustVerse s Smart Wallet technology TrustVerse proposes smart wallet technology with Decentralized Identity (DID) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based on blockchain technology to overcome this privacy issue Unlike traditional financial institutions where a particular organization stores customer personal information on a centralized server TrustVerse does not store the users primary personal information but provides services to users who have been authenticated through DID DID is used to prove the identity of users and to provide services Also by using the official certificate of the government or the authorized organization for the DID the tax processing can be processed on the platform without complicated processes We are collaborating with Microsoft to develop DID technology and plan to co establish the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) in the future AI portfolio financial transaction information legal and tax data encryption TrustVerse encrypts the data stored in the Smart Contract with a public key to protect user\xe2\x80\x99s privacy A large amount of data frequently used by AI portfolio stock trading and life service is stored in the cloud DB The link between Smart Contract and cloud DB are linked to keys created by hashing user profile data In addition to the hashed key value users sensitive personal information is not stored in DB thus eliminating the risk of personal information leakage due to DB hacking TrustVerse ensures the integrity of the users digital assets and privacy with a DID enabled smart wallets and Smart Contracts for privacy Moreover TrustVerse simplifies family illiquid and liquid asset transfer (Inheritance and legacy) in a highly secure and transparent manner through private family blockchain (See 4 2) 37 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 6 TrustVerse Token Model TVS Token model can be categorized into a token usage for alternative currency and services 6 1 TVS Token TVS Token is a Dapp (Decentralized Application) which uses the smart contact on the ERC 20 standard and interface TVS Token is developed on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and uses Ethereum blockchain compatible with the EVM as its main platform The TVS token allows a user to access a variety of information service by accessing the DAPP For example the user is able to refer to portfolio investment options via information provided through the platform and at the same time refer to multiple legal tax hedging options The quantity of token is limited in supply TVS Token refers to ETH as its absolute value to track Total Volume Issued 1B TrustVerse Tokens = TVS = 1 000 000 000 \xe2\x80\xa2 Total Sales Volume 400 000 000 TVS (40%) \xe2\x80\xa2 Currency accepted ETH \xe2\x80\xa2 Minimum Participation 10 ETH \xe2\x80\xa2 1ETH = 2 000 TVS \xe2\x80\xa2 The number of TVS per ETH varies on participation stages (Private Pre Sales Public) Token Distribution All founders team & advisor\xe2\x80\x99s token will be lock up/vesting for a certain period in order to protect the overall token price Moreover a certain amount of tokens from token sales also will be engaged in a lock up period \xe2\x80\xa2 Token Sale 40% \xe2\x80\xa2 Eco system/R&D 30% \xe2\x80\xa2 Founder(Board Member) 20% \xe2\x80\xa2 Team & Advisors 6% \xe2\x80\xa2 Partner Alliance & Market Development 4% 38 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 6 2 Token Value Model TrustVerse token value is reflected on the demand and supply of the token Moreover it is reflected on its service usage Token value also could be reflected by its technologies that is used to provide quality service For example our portfolio construction and quality of tax& legal service information would increase the value of our token (TVS) Token usage to do legacy planning inheritance between family members with support of tax and legal services could be a useful value that token can provide Moreover funds raised through ICO will contribute to enhance portfolio model and will enhance the capability accuracy and performance of tax and legal information service As day to day business cash flow and revenue generation will also be our essential element of sustaining business 6 3 Mining TrustVerse is an ERC 20 based token and therefore it uses Main Network of the Ethereum Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s block generation algorithm is based on PoW (Proof of Work) TVS token does not support mining process Since when a new block has been generated in the blockchain network all token\xe2\x80\x99s PoW happens at the same time Therefore TVS\xe2\x80\x99s PoW finalizes at the same time so there is no mining process TVS Token is an Ethereum based DAPP service platform TVS Token generates blocks using the Proof of Work methodology \xe2\x80\xa2 Scalability Development of TVS Token on Ethereum enables TVS Token to run on a platform for Ethereum as well as other multiple blockchain platforms such as EOS which supports EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) Quantum and so forth This means that if another better platform is subsequently created it can replace the existing platform with an improved one \xe2\x80\xa2 Security All security features provided by Ethereum blockchain have been applied Every node data used for the TrustVerse service is protected with extra security features using hashed private key \xe2\x80\xa2 Compatibility Swap of tokens is easy with the ERC20 based token contract 39 \x0cwww TrustVerse io 2018 09 6 4 Token Life
