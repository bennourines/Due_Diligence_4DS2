advent of smart phone payments financial apps peer to peer lending crowdfunding and crypto currencies We anticipate this trend will continue especially through development and implementation of decentralized and/or distributed ledgers that will most likely become ubiquitous as protocols and a normal part of the web user experience and reduce the use or replace the current financial tools available on and offline While costs of securing the ledger will be lowered by the development of different ledger implementations the costs and profits of issuing new money supply are distinct and always presents a systemic problem for the particular currency a problem that immediately affects its value and consequently its price For this reasons Xaurum focuses on the function of preservation of value on ledger(s) viewing it as concern separate from the development of ledger implementation technologies and more general in nature The problem of storage of value is a problem of money in general one that Xaurum is solving by creating a representative crypto currency based on gold www xaurum org 3 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 2 Xaurum concept Xaurum is a representative cryptocurrency based on an increasing amount of gold It is designed as a store of value on the ledger and uses distribution of profit of money creation (seigniorage) to achieve its goal Regardless of the technology of its implementation Xaurum could be summed up as an economic game with the next economic agents the commonwealth gold reserves traders users money creators money destroyers and the foundation Increase of the commonwealth gold provides the basis of unity of interests of all economic agents this is the main systemic function of seigniorage its other functions are used to regulate the particularity of the interests of economic agents into unity Because the commonwealth is composed of physical gold that provides the guarantee to be exchanged for xaurum it requires centralized control over money creation (coinage) and destruction (melting fees) For this task a legal entity Auresco Institute was created to serve as the foundation to oversee the process of money creation that sustains itself with the rebate on gold Certified 999 9 investment gold is bought from Good Delivery refineries and because its retail prices are relatively high Auresco can charge its fee while still providing lower than retail prices of gold for the commonwealth Because xaurum in exchange has a higher market value than the value of its gold base the difference can be used for increasing the commonwealth and incentivizing coinage (details in Coinage section) Commonwealth is sustained by half of all seigniorage collection of fees of transactions and will seek additional forms of income through economic activity of Auresco 2 1 Seigniorage Seigniorage is the profit of money creation it is mostly used as an implicit or hidden tax or fee that benefits money creators to the detriment of money users This profit is not created out of nothing all existing money supply\xe2\x80\x99s value carries the cost of seigniorage therefore this debt must be repaid Xaurum proposes a shared system where seigniorage is shared equally between the money creator and the rest of the users (a) consensus Distributed consensus is currently achieved for cryptocurrencies in two ways by proof of work and proof of stake Proof of work requires mining the process of finding blocks bundles of recent transactions and verifying them by using computation Mining blocks verifies transactions and is rewarded by collecting transaction fees and seigniorage of money creation Proof of stake uses the tokens of www xaurum org 4 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 cryptocurrency as miners making them less dependent on electricity as most of electricity of proof ofwork is not used for useful computation but competition for seigniorage Proof of stake currencies use quantity of tokens for this competition and unite the interests of users and miners by making possession of tokens sufficient for creation of new money Xaurum separates the consensus mechanisms of implementation from the value on ledger and can be implemented on new ledger technologies as they are developed \xe2\x80\xa2 centralization of seigniorage / division of interests The antagonism of proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms is one between the security of the blockchains and centralization of money creation the security of a blockchain depends on the distribution of mining/staking and because mining/staking is collecting all seigniorage mining/staking is centralizing Its systemic function is limited to creation of consensus creating antagonism of interests between money creators (miners/stakers) and users Xaurum\xe2\x80\x99s commonwealth is an attempt to unify the interests of money creators and users and shares seigniorage between them according to the Coinage formula \xe2\x80\xa2 market loss of seigniorage Another problem of capturing seigniorage is potentiated by the increased money velocity of cryptocurrencies achieved by making the function of money as medium of exchange digital and therefore much more efficient This increased velocity of money means a loss of captured seigniorage to the market as the demand for new cryptocurrency is indistinguishable from a general demand for more exchange value www xaurum org 5 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 The result is the decrease in price that decreases the exchange value of users and increases the exchange value of miners in another currency this is factor is potentiated when real costs like electricity are relevant Xaurum\xe2\x80\x99s cost is determined by both the quantity of its gold reserves and the market price so the market loss of seigniorage can be at least partially avoided \xe2\x80\xa2 commodity loss of seigniorage In proof of work seigniorage is captured through competition and therefore partially lost in the form of electricity cost (negative seigniorage mechanism of difficulty) this loss is prevented in proof of stake as their cost is trivial (liquidity) yet this solution has its own problems The cost of liquidity is equal to risk of value and because value is correlated to technical innovation it is immediately endangered by competition these problems are perhaps good short term initiatives for innovation yet they reduce their functionality as money especially as store of value Xaurum bases all its other functions on its function as a storage of value Its value is the combination of intrinsic value of the digital asset and extrinsic value as a representation of a physical asset \xe2\x80\xa2 the end of seigniorage as the base of artificial scarcity The other issue of current PoW cryptocurrencies is their two fold model that demands the end point to the new money supply in order to produce artificial scarcity This is a consequence of the halving mechanism used for artificial scarcity where at a point in time production of new money supply is halved until the production is stopped completely When this happens the value could drop significantly with the number of miners or an inflationary model could be accepted Xaurum bases its artificial scarcity differently not on the quantity of new money supply but on quantity of gold required for new money supply to enter circulation even though the gold reserves currently grow mostly from profit of money creation an increase of use and an increase of commonwealth projects using Xaurum could shift this in favour of money destruction www xaurum org 6 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 (b) public ledger The blockchains combine the function of consensus with the function of public ledger they are nonetheless distinct and could be separated in different systems While consensus is used to prevent double spending by linking new transactions to the history of all transactions the function of the public ledger is to represent all transactions and distributions in currency or rather to publicly represent objective information in general Because the blockchain combines both functions it requires synchronicity of the system and the whole of the past must be included in every full node The true accomplishment of cryptocurrencies despite the dominant sentiment in favour of anonymity is the public ledger This is the practical intersubjective epistemic field created by consensus that enables the epistemic agents to know that they know what they know Public ledgers are a practical application of the positive introspection axiom of epistemic logic \xe2\x80\x9cKnowledge of p implies knowledge of knowledge of p \xe2\x80\x9d and useful for every instance of our dependence on objective information such as property relations law and money The classical functions of money that are based on representation that is unit of account standard of value medium of exchange can be achieved by public ledgers Ledgers elevate exchange to the mode of representation however the function of storage of value remains extrinsic to public ledgers That is we can know the unit of value the sender and receiver of value the type of value but not value itself 2 2 Xaurum monetary policy (a) Inflation Inflation is necessary in the sense that there needs to be enough tokens to function as a money this demand grows when the users increase however the cost of inflation is significant In fiat and fiat like crypto currencies the effect of money supply inflation is price inflation the decrease of value www xaurum org 7 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 All change of money supply is a redistribution of value In fiat currencies redistribution favours the upper class while disfavouring the middle and lower economic classes and increases wealth inequality In Xaurum model price and value inflation are positively correlated for its value in gold while its price remains determined by the market and speculative (b) Fractionality In representative currencies with fractional reserve banking the ratio is determined by the banks that can use the difference between required reserves and the full amount to profit while the money users are burdened by risk In Xaurum\xe2\x80\x99s model the fraction of gold to price is determined by the market so that the users that risk their capital are also the beneficiaries (c) Growth The main purpose of all Xaurum monetary policy is to sustain the common interest by increasing the commonwealth The commonwealth is stored as gold reserves that serve as the basis of Xaurum\xe2\x80\x99s value the increase of the commonwealth increases the base value of all Xaurum This means that the ratio of Xaurum to gold is increasing with coinage and the users of Xaurum are rewarded with an increase of value both as the determined increase of value in gold and the potential and speculative increase of its price Because coinage of new money pays part of seigniorage to the money creator the demand for Xaurum can be only a cloaked demand for more exchange value in general this would mean that seigniorage would not be captured and the commonwealth would not increase To distinguish between the demand for Xaurum and demand for exchange value in general some additional regulation of coinage is necessary The goal of coinage is sustainability of seigniorage for the benefit of the commonwealth www xaurum org 8 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 2 3 Money destruction \xe2\x80\x93 Melt and Fees (a) Golden fee Each transaction of xaurum pays a fee of 0 5 XAUR this fee is destroyed therefore increasing the Xaurum ratio The commonwealth can therefore profit on value from money destruction (b) Melt Melting is the process of provably destroying XAUR and receiving the quantity of gold determined by xaurum ratio at the time of melting Xaurum ratio is determined as the quantity of current gold reserves divided by the quantity of the current money supply Melting becomes economically advantageous only when the market prices are below the value of gold Melting serves as a mechanism of preserving value regardless of the market price www xaurum org 9 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 2 4 Money creation Coinage Xaurum is a representative crypto currency based on gold and therefore requires centralized process of money creation

loomis in case of melt www xaurum org 11 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 2 5 1 Coinage mechanisms The essential mechanism of Xaurum is the profitable inflation achieved by increasing the gold reserves more than increasing the money supply when increasing money supply Money creators are incentivized by receiving XAUR at a rate lower than the market price and money users are incentivized by the increase of the common gold reserves The seigniorage is therefore shared between the commonwealth and the money creator Money creator creates new money supply together with masternode reward and contributes more gold to the commonwealth Coinage price is determined as Xb\xcf\x81 + (S/2) PP Production price Production price is the price of producing new XAUR Market buy When the market price is lower than production

below base price it increases with the number of Xaurum coined Because the immediate relation with the market would result in a unsustainable inflation decreasing seigniorage coinage is restricted by

mechanism (e) Critical density price Xb\xcf\x81 = Xb*X\xcf\x81 USD Explanation Base price with density When Seigniorage is equal or less than 0 this is the price of Xaurum Coinage www xaurum org 15 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 (f) Production price PP = Determined at each coinage by Auresco Institute Explanation The price of producing new XAUR token is defined as Production price When the price on the exchange grows above production price it is a sign that market is demanding new XAUR tokens In this case supply will be increased through coinage and a new coinage price will be set Xaurum production price is an empirical variable for a mechanism of Xaurum Coinage that regulates Xaurum money supply inflation The purpose of this mechanism is to distinguish market demand for new xaurum from the general demand for profit and determine the ratio of seigniorage distribution between the Xaurum commonwealth and the money creator Coinage price is Xaurum\xe2\x80\x99s external parameter that allows Xaurum to respond to its external market conditions It defines the market price required for inflation and provides speculators with the well defined market price of XAUR when anticipating Xaurum growth Rules \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Production price can never decrease \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Production price can stay the same or increase \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 New Production price is set at every Minting event \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 When the market price is lower than production price 30% of minting funds can be used for a market buy to match the market price \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Production price is denominated in USD (g) Seigniorage S = Xm Xb\xcf\x81 USD Explanation Seigniorage is the difference between the market price and critical density price (h) Coinage price Xi=Xb\xcf\x81+A*0 5 if A<0 then Xi=Xb\xcf\x81 USD/XAU Explanation This is the price required for 1 Xaurum to enter circulation via minting When production price is not reached 30% of coinage funds can be used to acquire XAUR from the market to match the production price (i) Transmutation limit Value 5 000$ (There is a maximum of 5000$ per calculation ) Explanation Because Xaurum coinage is purposefully recursive the transmutation limit prevents money creators to avoid it therefore the amount of funds for one cycle is limited www xaurum org 16 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 2 5 2 Types of Coinage (a) Masternodes Minting requires a masternode possession of 8 000 000 Xaurum as the proof and guarantee of the common interest that the Xaurum commonwealth requires Because minter possesses 8 000 000 Xaurum he has the good of the whole in mind as he profits both from the increase of the commonwealth and from seigniorage It is therefore in his interest to sustain the market price both to keep profiting from seigniorage and for seigniorage to profit him directly Minting is additionally restricted by the last price of minting as there was demand for new Xaurum at the former minting we can consider that there is no new demand when the market prices are not higher Minting also requires a legal entity to be established to prevent issues with governments The goal of minting is to provide a distribution of xaurum for money lowering the costs of large amounts of new coinage (b) Mining and Farming Xaurum mining was done by mining other cryptocurrencies for value exchanging their value for gold and issuing Xaurum The goal of xaurum mining was to find an easy way to use distributed mining process to provide a distribution of xaurum for trivial costs to the miner and non trivial surplus in xaurum Farming like mining is done by creating other cryptocurrencies that support a proof of resource model that can be used by a greater number of users than specialized mining Farming will be applicable when other cryptocurrencies will establish infrastructure that enables crating value for xaurum commonwealth www xaurum org 17 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 3 Xaurum Commonwealth Commons are useful in overcoming the divisions produced by market competition In the case of money where the goal is to produce a unit of value equal to any other unit of value market mechanisms do not make sense and should be replaced by commons The commonwealth gold reserves are owned by Xaurum users each XAUR token has a value in gold in determined by the quantity of gold and the quantity of money supply Because half of the profit of the newly created money supply is added to the commonwealth the value of each XAUR in gold increases when money supply grows (a) Gold Xaurum commonwealth is composed of the gold reserves in the form of f 1 g good delivery gold bars of 999 9 purity from NADIR Metal Rafineri (b) Commonwealth Transparency Gold reserves audit / public The gold reserves are stored by Loomis at their Turkish office providing Xaurum commonewalth with safe storage and full insurance coverage http //www loomis com/en/Contact/Our country offices/Turkey/ The gold reserves from the Loomis account are announced daily to the audit mailing list To participate in the public audit of Xaurum gold reserves stored at Loomis The reserves are stored as 1 kg and 0 5 kg bars and the status of the storage is updated daily Note that there should be the total gold supply (availiable from the smart contract) minus 6036 g (local storage) minus whatever the ammount Nadir has before 1 kg is reached and stored at Loomis The gold is prepaid as 1g 999 9 good delivery gold bars and stored as 1 kg or 0 5 kg bars to decrease costs of storage https //groups google com/forum/# forum/xaurum Potential risks and mitigation Gold stored at Loomis is covered by insurance www xaurum org 18 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 4 Xaurum Ethereum implementation Xaurum is implemented as an ERC20 standard token This enables Xaurum to use smart contracts for its mechanisms and will enable the development of a user friendly interface as DAPP on the Ethereum network Xaurum is open source and its code can be reviewed on GitHub https //github com/XaurumTeam/XaurumOnEthereum 4 1 ERC20 The ERC20 standard defines a common list of properties for the implementation of Ethereum tokens Following is an interface contract declaring the required functions and events to meet the ERC20 standard (code snippet from https //theethereum wiki/w/index php/ERC20_Token_Standard) // https //github com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20 contract ERC20 { function totalSupply() constant returns (uint totalSupply) function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance) function transfer(address _to uint _value) returns (bool success) function transferFrom(address _from address _to uint _value) returns (bool success) function approve(address _spender uint _value) returns (bool success) function allowance(address _owner address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining) event Transfer(address indexed _from address indexed _to uint _value) event Approval(address indexed _owner address indexed _spender uint _value) } 4 2 Xaurum token specific mechanisms 4 2 1 Xaurum Proxies Xaurum proxies are the interfaces that users can use for the most basic Xaurum functions to send and receive xaurum This feature enables users to continue to use Xaurum even in the event that we update the codebase of Xaurum Token contract This is because proxy will be updated so that the reference will point to the new updated Xaurum with the same balances This feature was developed for the main purpose of updating the code that includes easy migration of users with Xaurum Proxies users migrate to the new code automatically In addition this type of token design helps by being compliant to the community standards even as they change without editing the core token in this way our contracts can never become outdated Xaurum proxies are already working however their full functionality will be improved with the release of our own wallet www xaurum org 19 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 Currently Xaurum uses Proxy ERC20 is a proxy that implements ERC20 Token Interface which is the current community defined standard for tokens Users can use this contract as any other token and never see the migration to new version of Xaurum The only particularity of this token is that because the Burn event does not exist in ERC20 implementation burning is simulated as sending the appropriate amount to burning address via transfer event You can always check the current implementation of Xaurum Proxies on the XaurumProxyContract that holds information about available proxies their status 4 2 2 Xaurum money supply and gold reserves Xaurum uses increasing gold reserves as the basis of its value Its current implementation on Ethereum transparently shows all the relevant data that can be easily seen in the smart contract Both the Total supply of XAUR and the Total gold supply are displayed if you click the Xaurum token (Xaurum proxy will only display Total supply of XAUR) in the \xe2\x80\x9cContracts\xe2\x80\x9d tab of your wallet With this data everyone can easily check and calculate how much gold is currently used as a basis of 1 XAUR All values be divided by 10^8 Both values can only change with the predetermined Xaurum mechanisms of adding XAUR and gold through Coinage and decreasing it with Melting (destroying XAUR in exchange for the gold of its base value) or Sacrifice (provably destroying XAUR) that are public events all users watching Xaurum token contract will be able to see totalSupply and totalGoldSupply There is an embedded counter of tokens issued and gold held in reserves With these two variables user can check and calculate how much gold is behind every XAUR at any time Values must be divided by 10^8 before used for computation 4 2 3 Sacrifice Xaurum is a representative currency and is always backed with some determinate quantity of gold because of this property the quantity of money supply directly determines a part of its value This means that whenever a xaurum is provably destroyed or burned or sacrificed it can be subtracted from the total Xaurum money supply while the quantity of gold remains the same it therefore distributes the gold it represented before it was destroyed to all other existing xaurum Because of this Xaurum benefits uniquely from destroying its money supply as the effects of this destruction are at least partly measurable For this reason sacrifice is an easy to implement way to help the Xaurum commonwealth as a whole or implement payments that reward all users Examples of mechanisms using sacrifice \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Golden fee \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Allies (a) Golden fee The transaction fee is embedded into our token which deducts from the sent amount when user is sending and burns the predetermined Golden fee With this the coin supply decreases and the gold www xaurum org 20 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 supply stays the same resulting in backing ammount rising At the moment golden fee is set to 0 5 XAUR and will be adjusted by its growth The amount is stored in the XaurumDataContract The fees for sending transactions are thought to be sufficient payment for blockchain security of the PoW model cryptocurrencies for example Bitcoin Their model tries to slowly replace the source of payment to the miners from seigniorage (profit of money creation) to payment with fees collected from existing money supply to limit inflation that reduces their value Xaurum does not require this replacement as its inflation is profitable it does however employ a similar fee collection mechanism that additionally benefits the users Its fees don\xe2\x80\x99t reward only the miners but all Xaurum users as xaurum collected as fees are verifiably destroyed and subtracted from the Xaurum money supply This means that the gold base backing each xaurum in exchange increases simply because the number of xaurum in exchange decreases (b) Allies There is a xaurum Allies Contract that holds all the data of our Allies and sacrifices (provably burns) the amount of Xaurum that the Allies want to sacrifice for the benefit of the Xaurum commonwealth It automatically ranks the allies in order according to the quantity of the Xaurum they have sacrificed The fees associated with using this contract as all the others are always sacrificed themselves 4 2 4 Time Lock In order to increase usefulness of Xaurum wallets we have included a Lockdown function that serves as enchantment of security of your wallet funds be it against other people or yourself This makes the function useful for either additional security of your funds or locking it as savings You can Time Lock your funds for an arbitrary time (estimated in blocks Ethereum current block time is 15 s) this means your funds will be impossible to access and transfer until the time that only you know The user can check whether the accounts is locked or not but he can never determine for how long this makes hacked accounts unusable for the period that only the legitimate user should know Please note that if you time lock your account for too long (100 years or 10000000000000 years) there is no way to retreive the funds as there is no possible way of reverting the lock and that you should remember or write down the number of blocks when your account becomes available as you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to check after you lock it We recommend that you lock for a half of a year at maximum as block times can change To access this function you can select \xe2\x80\x9cContracts\xe2\x80\x9d click \xe2\x80\x9cWrite to Contract\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clockAccount\xe2\x80\x9d lockAccount Is a feature that can make hackers life just a little bit harder User is able to lock all witdrawals from its account for some period of time accepted in blocks from now(block is approximatly 15 sec) When the account is locked user can still check if account is locked or not but he can not know for how long(if he is not a node) We added this second layer of security for users that are certain that they will hold coain for certain ammount of time and are affraid of hackers There is no way of reverting the lock so if user locks the account for 100 years it will remain locked for 100 years www xaurum org 21 \x0cWhitepaper 2 0 4 2 5 Refuel Anything you do on Ethereum costs a small amount of ethereum (gas) this means Xaurum has an additional cost of sending to its own fee until the Raiden Network and even though it is economically trivial it could be a time consuming task for a user to purchase ETH on the crypto exchanges To make things easier we\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented a direct way to exchange a small amount of XAUR for ETH in wallet When you click on the contracts tab and select the Xaurum contract you can click on the \xe2\x80\x9cWrite to Contract\xe2\x80\x9d to select one of the many functions If you wish to refuel your wallet with ETH select getGasForXaur This will deduct a small ammount of XAUR from user and send eth to the address specified The exchange rate is not favorable so it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used for exchange of large quantities only for getting gas to your account The exact exchange rate is shown in the data contract Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget you will need some gas to do this function so you should be mindful of the quantity of ETH on your account and refuel when you see you are running low on gas www

it is deemed that the change binds the Buyer as of the day of the receipt of notification via e mail Prices charging of services deadline and methods of payment ARTICLE 4 The price of services and deliveries is formed on a daily basis as per the formula for an individual submitted order published in the price list The price is not fixed but it constantly changes particularly in relation to the factors of market conditions whereas the formula itself is unchangeable regarding the currently applicable formula published in the price list and thus provides the specific method to calculate the price All submitted orders are calculated in the virtual currency \xe2\x80\x93 Xaurum (XAUR) All prices published on the website http //xaurum org/ are expressed in Xaurums (XAUR) if not otherwise specified in an individual price or service The price of one Xaurum (XAUR) is expressed in US dollars (USD) excluding value added tax (VAT) ARTICLE 5 The payment for services and deliveries is

verification are sent to the Buyer The Buyer performs the transfer in the currency and states the amount of cash in dollars to be exchanged for virtual currency Xaurum (XAUR) By confirming/verifying the order the Provider prepares the mint for the Buyer and notifies it about an approximate price or how much money the Buyer shall receive in the virtual currency the value of which is constantly fluctuating and cannot be fixed and is thus calculated using the formula published in the price list The Buyer pays a desired amount in the currency that is currently accepted by the Provider and after the purchase of Xaurums the Provider transfers to the Buyer its Xaurums to the submitted public cryptographic key as per the procedure described in the first paragraph of this Article The Buyer
