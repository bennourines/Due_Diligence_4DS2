know about this method of attracting money for projects Even start ups not related to cryptocurrencies started to carry out the initial placement of tokens Many people invest in these tokens believing in the technology behind it and hoping that they will become pro\xef\xac\x81table in the future Taklimakan Network is a platform designed to improve the professional level of crypto investors and make them more successful with the help of experienced traders and analysts This project will operate as business platform for e\xef\xac\x80ective interaction between newcomers of cryptomarket professional traders analysts and asset managers Extensive functionality variety of investment tools and services with an easy to understand and user friendly interface will be featured in the project A rating system that allows investors to identify the most popular and reliable providers of trading signals and analytics rewards to all users for participating in a crowd prediction and many other interesting platform tools will attract more users interested in the crypto industry As a result both beginners and experts will be motivated The Taklimakan Network platform allows users not only to be a project investor but also to receive the information that might be useful for their investment activity Often people participate in ICO in order to get a quick earnings buying tokens on pre sale and selling them on the stock exchange immediately after they got listed But to the current date with the increase in the number of ICOs conducted the speculative earnings of short term investors are becoming less and less realistic and sometimes they are not pro\xef\xac\x81table at all By having the Taklimakan Network Tokens in the investment portfolio user should not be considered as a speculative player he becomes an investor of a promising project which is useful for the whole crypto community and whose tokens will bring a huge pro\xef\xac\x81t after the project is fully executed instead Moreover the platform can be used for commercial purposes by generating passive income on a regular basis But the ultimate goal of this project is not only a commercial interest but also the creation of really useful platform for the entire crypto community www taklimakan io Page 3 \x0c2 Market TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK The development of blockchain technologies in recent years has created a unique situation in the \xef\xac\x81nancial market and provided active investors with a whole range of new investment tools In fact a new segment of the \xef\xac\x81nancial market has emerged \xe2\x80\x93 the cryptocurrency market capitalization of which has already exceeded US$240 billion At the same time the market is developing rapidly showing growth rates of more than 500% per year $300B $200B $150B $100B $50B $0B January February March April May June July August September October November Dynamics of capitalization of the market of cryptocurrency in 2017 In parallel the volume of trades in cryptocurrencies is constantly growing in the \xef\xac\x81rst week of January 2017 the average daily turnover in the cryptocurrency market was US$346 million as of mid November 2017 the average daily turnover already exceeded US$9 billion New cryptocurrencies and unique investment opportunities appear in the cryptomarket every week $0 35B $9B Dynamics of growth in the average daily trade volume on the cryptocurrency market in 2017 The ICO (Initial Coin O\xef\xac\x80ering) market is also growing exponentially along with the cryptocurrency market At present dozens of projects come to the market every month while the number of companies that consider this fundraising method is growing exponentially According to data of research companies specializing in crypto assets year to date startup projects raised over US$3 billion through ICOs which is 30 times more than in 2016 data is taken from the source https //coinmarketcap com/charts/ date 22 11 2017 www taklimakan io Page 4 \x0cMarket TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK According to the statistical data the number of users of the American currency date period from the end of January 2017 to November 2017 The number of >33 9M serviced wallets at the same time increased by 180% from 12 1 million to 33 9 number of wallets exchange Coinbase increased by 116% from 5 5 million to 11 9 million in the million units And this is only the data from on one of the largest exchanges Coinbase and there are more than 100 of the others Despite the current exponential growth the cryptomarket is in the initial phase of the growth cycle To the current date only 18 5 million crypto wallets have been registered in the blockchain info system and the process of transferring >18 5M funds requires serious technical training In the next few years due to the number of wallets development of technologies and simpli\xef\xac\x81cation of the funds transferring their Blockchain info number will increase to 300 400 million which will cause an ample in\xef\xac\x82ow of investments into the market The information website coinmarketcap com which allows you to monitor the capitalization of each of the existing cryptocurrencies has entered the top 400 most visited websites in theworld The next reason for the signi\xef\xac\x81cant growth of the cryptocurrency market is the entry of large institutional investors on the market Funds invested around US$100 million in cryptocurrencies to test the market in the \xef\xac\x81rst half of 2017 Once the funds\ initial hypothesis on the yield of the cryptomarket is con\xef\xac\x81rmed and funds receive a return that would substantially exceed the yield in other segments of the \xef\xac\x81nancial market only then large amounts of capital 30 50 times higher than the current volume of investments may enter to the market Countries with large stock exchanges are gradually entering the crypto industry \xe2\x80\x93 in March 2017 Japan legalized Bitcoin in June India and more countries would join the market Regulators are also ready to adopt the blockchain technology Japan already accepts cryptocurrencies as a means of payment Similar laws are being developed in Switzerland and a number of European and Asian countries Traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions show interest in blockchain technology The R3 consortium which includes banks such as Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Credit Suisse Barclays UniCredit and others announced that the largest banks are planning to actively implement blockchain technology More than 15 member banks of the consortium have already developed prototypes of smart contracts for factoring operations Simultaneously HSBC and the investment division of Bank of America announced that they have started to use the blocking technology to simplify settlements of international trade transactions The market for Taklimakan Network services users is a world crypto community from established investors to newcomers who enter to the market at the exponential rate every day Trading analytical managerial and almost any professional activity related to crypto investments can be applied on the platform for commercial purposes The platform will provide users all opportunities to increase the knowledge of crypto industry trading analytics for investing in blockchain start ups as well as a number of tools and services for increasing investment capital www taklimakan io Page 5 \x0c3 Problem TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK The rapid development of the cryptocurrency market provides unique investment opportunities It is important for individual investors with limited knowledge in cryptocurrencies to not miss such opportunities and get access to promising projects at their earliest stage of development when conditions for entering such projects are the most favorable The cryptocurrency market is at the very beginning of its formation and is very volatile and risky Individual investors often lack experience and analysis tools that are normally used to evaluate projects in traditional segments of the \xef\xac\x81nancial market Independent trading and independent asset management without the experience and knowledge of the market often lead to a loss of invested capital Additional risks create high volatility in the market and serious systematic problems have already become noticeable 3 1 Problems associated with independent trading The young not yet established market of cryptocurrency is not always amenable to technical analysis Sometimes even a professional trader with an experience cannot determine the medium term direction and not even the short term trajectory Financial education as well as practice in trading are prerequisite and necessary for professional trading in with cryptocurrencies It is required to understand and capture the favorable and unfavorable situation on the market before entering into directional trade With the in\xef\xac\x82ow of a large number of people interested in cryptocurrency a lot of low quality and fraudulent services appeared in the market o\xef\xac\x80ering trading signals participation in pumps and dumps and in the asset management As a rule mostly do not provide stability and sometimes even lead to the loss of funds Technical features and inferiority of young and still developing cryptocurrency exchanges cause certain inconveniences in the trading Exchange transactions and speculation on the exchange cryptocurrencies are identical to any other To make a pro\xef\xac\x81t you have to buy at the low price and sell at the higher price That is just like when you invest in an ordinary currency The base of instruments and the principle of determining the goals for trade are set in the same way as in the \xef\xac\x81xed income stocks or FOREX markets But even the certain knowledge of the basics of trading in the \xef\xac\x81nancial markets does not guarantee the pro\xef\xac\x81t from trading in cryptocurrencies www taklimakan io Page 6 \x0cProblem TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK 3 2 Challenges of individual investing There is a tendency in the market when many projects experience di\xef\xac\x83culties with the development of products announced during ICO and in the future the situation will only worsen Due to absence of high quality analytics and presence of constant information noise created around projects that go to the ICO a non professional investor is losing focus and the opportunity to distinguish high quality projects from those that have elements of signi\xef\xac\x81cant fraud (also called scam) With the growth of the number of ICOs potential high yield unicorn projects become indistinguishable from scam in the \xef\xac\x82ow of information noise and do not attract su\xef\xac\x83cient attention from independent investors The ICO market has relatively low barriers to entry which leads to a rapid growth of bubbles and attracts scammers seeking easy money At the current stage of development there are no clear criteria and guidelines for choosing projects for individual investing in the ICO market The only document describing the project that goes to the ICO is the whitepaper in which one can often see a description of the idea or concept of a future product and the whitepaper rarely provides a justi\xef\xac\x81cation for the return of investments Therefore it is not always possible to build a clear methodology for evaluating projects No less signi\xef\xac\x81cant problem is that investors have to collect information about projects in parts from various sources company websites discussions on forums and in social networks where there is a high probability of encountering unveri\xef\xac\x81ed information and rumors which create additional problems for individual investing in ICOs During periods of high volatility in the cryptocurrency market inaccurate construction of the portfolio and failure to follow risk management principles would immediately lead to a decrease in portfolio value and signi\xef\xac\x81cant \xef\xac\x81nancial losses In situations when there are no fundamental reasons for companies to grow and technical analysis does not work it is necessary to analyses projects using other tools that are often not available to individual investors Such tools are at the disposal of specialized business sites specializing in investing in crypto assets and one of them is the Taklimakan Network www taklimakan io Page 7 \x0c4 Solution TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK Taklimakan platform is aimed to empower and attract amature investors by providing new tools and great knowledge base Experienced traders and analysts will be encouraged to share their experience and help newcomers to become more e\xef\xac\x83cient in personal fund management Some Taklimakan innovations will seem new and exciting even to the gurus of investment world because it aims to interconnect social networks investments and blockchain and create unique and e\xef\xac\x83cient fund management experience for everyone Platform

reaction to anomalies observed in system function Monitoring is done at four levels 1 System Level Data about using system resources such as CPU GPU RAM Network resources and channels is collected at this level Monitoring is done by means of selected management solution for server administration or by means of 3rd party agents for metric collection 2 Infrastructure Application Level At this level Databases message buses and web servers are monitored Data about health status activity and degraded performance is collected Concrete metrics are de\xef\xac\x81ned for each subsystem individually and its purpose and use cases are taken into consideration Monitoring is conducted with the purpose of reliability and timely service 3rd party agent applications con\xef\xac\x81gured speci\xef\xac\x81cally to every object monitored are used to collect metrics 3 Application Level This level monitors results of application function Output to DB logs direct transfers of data to monitoring system Special modules are embedded into applications during development for this purpose These modules collect information in uni\xef\xac\x81ed manner In case if metrics collection is possible by means of collecting application artifacts (created DB records log \xef\xac\x81les etc ) speci\xef\xac\x81c agent applications will be used to send this collected data to monitoring system 4 Business Activity Monitoring Level Business processes are the object of monitoring on this level This level is used for determining of correctness of system function on the highest level as well as monitoring changes in user behavior Based on the analysis of information collected decisions are made about system development and deployment of new functionality Each level of monitoring has its own metrics and performance indicators de\xef\xac\x81ned 4 8 General functionality Registration and Personal Information Every user will need to register on the platform in order to access most of its

to Ethereum blockchain and reside there during their lifecycle www taklimakan io Page 22 \x0cTechnical solution TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK Containerized cloud microservices are deployed into a cloud infrastructure provided by a 3rd party as IaaS utilize its services such as databases and scale on demand This decision is dictated by necessity to expand services on demand and deploy services in regions where most users are located This will bene\xef\xac\x81t access times and also enable Taklimakan compliance with national regulations for user data storage location Platform prototype will be developed with consideration of horizontal scaling requirement Expected number of users is approximately 1 000 000 geographically distributed people Besides scalability this will also require balance loading Capabilities of NGINX are su\xef\xac\x83cient for intermediate scale balance loading and we may select Hadoop or OpenStack technology stack to enable automatic scaling which is going to be determined after initial load testing of platform prototype Blockchain Contracts There will be four main smart contracts deployed to blockchain TKLN Token Contract Crowdsale Contract Internal Payment System Contract and Airdrop Contract Two of Taklimakan smart contracts (TKLN Token Contract and Crowdsale Contract) are developed for the purpose of ICO funding but TKLN Token will be later used as platform currency for the whole platform lifetime Airdrop contract will be used for initial promotion and IPS (Internal Payment System) Contract will serve as a ledger to record token transactions when they are used as platform currency Blockchain smart contracts are developed in a recent version of Solidity language the version is \xef\xac\x81xed to prevent incompatibilities Unit testing is done in NodeJS using Tru\xef\xac\x84e framework The main reasoning behind the test framework choice was to prevent copy+paste when writing unit tests as well as avoid limitations of test sizes Cloud Microservices Microservices will be containerised in order to achieve necessary separation and performance In order to achieve close to bare metal performance LXD or Docker containers will be selected Primary choices for Cloud Apps development language will be Java C# or Python mainly for \xef\xac\x82exibility wide usage support and good integration capabilities with both SQL and NoSQL databases Custom con\xef\xac\x81gurations of concrete microservices will be described below Control Center Backend Control Center is used to interact with blockchain smart contracts Control center backend consists of several components Ethereum node ethereum client and control application Ethereum community pretty much dictates technology choice due to extensive support of GETH Go Ethereum Client and Web3 JS Ethereum JavaScript API so control application will be developed in JavaScript www taklimakan io Page 23 \x0cTechnical solution TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK Also Control Center will play a role of a link between blockchain and o\xef\xac\x80 chain databases If any immutable data is read from blockchain it will be cached in the microservice database to prevent additional fees Event monitors will be running in this microservice in order to record events emitted by blockchain smart contracts that are relevant to the functionality of the platform Events will be recorded in an SQL database Also events will be communicated to other microservices that will be able to subscribe to these events via streaming modules such as RabitMQ Flume or Kafka Internal Payment System IPS is used to facilitate inter platform payments made in TKLN tokens between users and platform For the reasons of scalability data integrity and transaction support best DataBase choice for this microservice is one of relational DBs such as PostgreSQL MySQL or MS SQL This microservice will have average to high load due to number of transactions and requires good scaling capabilities For this reason we will utilize data sharding slicing and denormalization when we design and con\xef\xac\x81gure the DB Also SQL based solution is chosen due to reporting capabilities requirement and requirement to integrate with analytical tools Internal Payment System will utilize IPS smart contract as a blockchain transaction ledger Smart contract will record o\xef\xac\x80 chain receipt ID with o\xef\xac\x80 chain transaction data hash We will use strongest hash algorithms such as salted MD5 or SHA 512 This will guarantee data integrity of transactional data stored in o\xef\xac\x80 chain database IPS will also allow recurring payments in the platform to enable miscellaneous service subscriptions Recurring transactions will be initiated by the microservice on the payment date and time User Accounts This microservice stores and operates information about user accounts and user data User data is considered to be sensitive information and will be handled appropriately The encryption and data integrity capabilities will be driving factors in de\xef\xac\x81ning technology For this reason we will consider relational databases for storage of user data Calendar Calendar keeps and operates scheduling information of all platform users and events Certain smart scheduling features such as required gapping between events or event dependencies require custom implementation of calendar in opposite to using existing solutions from Google or Microsoft www taklimakan io Page 24 \x0cTechnical solution TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK Transaction support and data integrity is not highly prioritized so the priority is put on performance For storage purposes NoSQL databases will be selected such as Cassandra Tarantool or Neo4j and application will be custom developed in C# or Python to satisfy high load requirements Additional reasoning towards NoSQL based solution is more \xef\xac\x82exible schemas which allow creation of events of di\xef\xac\x80erent structures and provide data access of adequate performance for the calendar application needs Published Materials Published Materials stores and operates materials such as analyst reports or knowledge base articles This microservice includes both database for document storage and \xef\xac\x81le storage NoSQL DB such as MongoDB or as a general solution Cassandra may be used for document storage OpenStack Manila shared \xef\xac\x81le storage or Hadoop File System (HDFS) may be used to implement a scalable and distributed \xef\xac\x81le storage depending on the technology stack preferred at the time of implementation Trading Tools This microservice facilitates publishing managing and generating of trading tools such as trading signals and trading strategies Trading Tools require high data integrity and high computational performance This microservice will require high CPU and RAM capacity as well as SQL database for data storage The load on the microservice is considered to be high so the application will be developed in C# or Python with certain high performance modules developed in unmanaged C++ possibly with use of GPU computing power ML / AI / NLP Certain Machine Learning and Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence modules (such as TensorFlow or Torch) and Natural Language Processing libraries (such as Apache Lucene OpenNLP etc ) may be deployed within this microservice to empower signal providers to create state of the art trading signals and strategies In the future this microservice will be extended with administration module and automated re training of arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence algorithms to enable constant improvement of prediction quality Machine Learning algorithms place additional requirements to storage and computational performance which may be achieved by using respectively distributed scalable solutions such as Hadoop and Spark and GPU hardware IM / Likes / Comments Facilitates inter platform communications between users likes comments and communications with non platform external users via external messengers www taklimakan io Page 25 \x0cTechnical solution TAKLIMAKAN NETWORK This microservice requires mainly two components Data Storage and Messaging Engine Data Storage choice is dictated to be non relational due to high level of interconnection between nonhomogeneous data such as \xe2\x80\x9cuser likes user\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cuser likes product X\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccomment about product X\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccomment about user\xe2\x80\x9d etc In order to simplify technology stack best choices will be universal no sql databases such as Cassandra Neo4j QuasarDB Tarantool or HBase Engine that powers messaging can either utilize functionality of RabitMQ as one of the most direct solutions or be implemented on top of data streaming technologies such as Apache Flume or Kafka Integration with external messengers such as WeChat Telegram WhatsApp and Viber will be implemented using corresponding services APIs Also in order to enable broadcast messaging integration with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter will be implemented Fund Management Fund management microservice will play the role of coordinator between Traders Investors and external Exchanges Information handled by this service is highly sensitive so data integrity for this microservice is prioritized over performance For this reason SQL database will be preferred for data storage and Python or C# will be chosen for the reason of integration simplicity In order to display information about current portfolio management performance input and output funds to/from external exchanges and control trading activities Fund Management microservice will integrate with external Exchanges via RESTful WebSocket or FIX interfaces depending on the frequency of communication and external exchange support Control and Monitoring Control and Monitoring system will be implemented with use of Elastic stack applications and services Logstash Logstash is a dynamic data collection pipeline with an extensible plugin ecosystem and strong Elasticsearch synergy Elastic search Elasticsearch is a distributed JSON based search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability maximum reliability and easy management Kibana Kibana gives shape to your data and is the extensible user interface for con\xef\xac\x81guring and managing all aspects of the
