customers and quickly grow into a global platform \x0cCryptoFlow History The story of cryptocurrency reaches much further back than 2009 and the launch of Bitcoin The origin of cryptocurrency can be traced back to 1982 with the publication of \xe2\x80\x98Blind Signatures of Untraceable Payments\xe2\x80\x99 by David Chaum at the University of California Santa Barbara[1] He theorized a mostly anonymous form of digital transacting that did not require a central authority Other cryptographers chased the idea of digital cash through the 1990s The first large cryptocurrency esque platform to make the news wires was Beenz[2] Launched in 1998 it was a product of the dot com bubble Companies would buy Beenz Then users could earn Beenz for visiting their websites shopping online and using specific programs Users could then sell Beenz for rewards With a stated goal of having the Beenz economy to resemble the real economy this was the first true digital asset to gain a worldwide user base Like most companies during the dot com bubble Beenz crashed gloriously in 2001 leaving a digital currency vacuum In November 2008 a paper was published describing the new decentralized peertopeer trestles cryptocurrency called Bitcoin[3] The genesis block for Bitcoin launched on January 3rd 2009 thus creating what would become the global phenomenon we know today The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto remains to this day and an endless number of alt coins have been created from its code During the beginning stages of the industry it was extremely hard to get your hands on Bitcoin Aside from the fact that barely anyone outside of cypherpunk circles knew about it but there was no easy ways to exchange your fiat currency for Bitcoin The website BitcoinMarket com launched in March 2010 the first Bitcoin exchange for investors to buy and sell their coins[4] As popularity and investors grew so did the sophistication of the exchanges Now there are hundreds of exchanges where alt coins are traded in massive amounts The largest current port of entry into cryptocurrency for investors is Coinbase A US based brokerage and exchange platform that exploded in popularity during the 2017 bull run reportedly was signing up 50 000 new users a day[5] \x0cCryptoFlow Problems in Cryptocurrency Despite having been in the mainstream for close to a decade cryptocurrency still finds itself having some glaring deficiencies that require solutions In its current form excited investors who are looking to invest are hampered by slow delayed deposits of their fiat currency into exchanges Their excitement quickly turns to frustration as the investment opportunity they saw sometimes evaporates before they can partake Cryptocurrency is still perceptually new to most people And a large percentage of the general public does not understand exactly what blockchain technology is Because of this their desire to learn struggles to overcome the perceived barriers to entry for them While some platforms help this the lack of convenience continues to hold many new potential investors back With the explosion in the number of cryptocurrencies there is a growing divide between the exchanges that allow fiat to be deposited and the specific coin investors are looking to purchase If the exchange that accepts fiat does not also trade the chosen digital currency another transfer and exchange is required This requires more time and additional fees all of which lessen the strength of the investment At the end of the day cryptocurrency is still a business And the scarcity of avenues for entry have made fees a growing issue within the space A simple issue of low supply and growing demand Unfortunately it also means a lack of options Between network fees and platform fees investors find significant chunks of their money missing if they move it around too much It creates an uphill battle for investors to grow their blockfolio \x0cCryptoFlow How CryptoFlow Will Help Investors need more and better options when it comes to entering the cryptocurrency market CryptoFlow will create an ecosystem that allows near instant entry into digital currency Acting as an intermediary between the investor\xe2\x80\x99s fiat currency and the cryptocurrency they aim to acquire CryptoFlow will facilitate fast transactions that maximize the investors time and money CryptoFlow is a platform that will provide investors new and experienced with a simple convenient path to entering the cryptocurrency market The fear of risk is usually based on the unknown CryptoFlow will provide curious and excited investors with an opportunity to invest without feeling as if they are wading into a large ocean of uncertainty With thousands of cryptocurrencies and hundred of exchanges the process of acquiring a particular coin or token is becoming more complicated CryptoFlow will simplify that for investors by doing the hard work for them A deposit into the CryptoFlow platform will quickly return the desired cryptocurrency without excessive fees No longer will investors need to spends hours and days waiting for funds to clear and transactions to confirm Fees are high across the crypto verse A begrudging truth that all investors have accepted But it does not have to be that way CryptoFlow will offer low fees and through their own cryptocurrency no fees whatsoever There is an equilibrium that can and should be achieved between platforms and investors That will result in higher investor confidence and repeat business and more of their money remaining in their pockets \x0cCryptoFlow Use Case Starting with the United Kingdom(UK) exclusively CryptoFlow will operate as a premier service that exchanges investor\xe2\x80\x99s fiat currency for their desired cryptocurrency Once established and operating in the UK CryptoFlow will begin expanding its services to additional European countries and the rest of the world An important note is that CryptoFlow will not be an exchange The easiest way to describe the process is that CryptoFlow will be completing Atomic Swaps for investors handling exchanges between currencies for the investor The CryptoFlow coin (CFL) will play a vital role in the growth and longevity of the platform A multi purpose coin CFL will be featured on multiple exchanges for trading investors can choose to hold and build masternodes to collect rewards as well as its utility within the CryptoFlow platform itself \x0cCryptoFlow The Process User will be able to register on the CryptoFlow website (www cryptoflow co uk) and set up their account Once a user has an account they can choose from 100+ coins that CryptoFlow currently exchanges fiat into The coin options will continue to grow as the platform matures Detailed in the Terms and Conditions users will then transfer the fiat currency into the CryptoFlow bank account listed With the amount of fiat acquired and cryptocurrency preferences expressed a user must only sit back and wait as their transaction will be executed for them The process will take between 5 minutes and an hour depending on the confirmation speed of the chosen currency \x0cCryptoFlow Rates & Fees Transparency and easy to find information will be the primary concern of CryptoFlow This includes the market rates of all available cryptocurrencies Within the platform users will be able to see live prices for all coins In addition to this feature volatility in the price will be considered up until the moment the transaction takes place Therefore the user is getting the best possible price for their exchange CryptoFlow will aim to keep all coin\xe2\x80\x99s transfer fees at 2% currently one of the lowest fees in the market Fees will be adjusted slightly depending on particular cryptocurrencies By utilizing the CryptoFlow coin investors will be able to gain access to 0% transfer fees This feature will drive demand for the coin bring revenue to the CryptoFlow platform and allow for the continued growth of the number of service areas \x0cCryptoFlow Coin Details Name CryptoFlow Ticker CFL Algorithm C11 Total coin supply 3 000 000 000 CFL Block Time 60 Seconds Masternode Collateral 100 000 CFL Masternode Rewards 90% Masternode / 10% Proof of Stake Premine 10 4% ROI Chart Block Rewards \x0cCryptoFlow Premine A Premine at 10 4% could be seen as a red flag by potential investors But what is important is the way in which the CryptoFlow Premine will be allocated This amount is vital to the success and longevity of the platform The 4% of the Premine is allocated to pay for initial costs of launching the platform as well as team funds The remaining 10% of the Premine will be locked away in addresses that will be public once the stability of the chain is fully acceptable These funds will be used to support the platform in a few important ways Once the platform is more mature and bringing in a strong revenue stream on a regular basis small portions of the 10% will be used as a liquidity tool to bring CFL coins to the market A second revenue stream for committed investors is the implementation of the Loyalty Program that will utilize a portion of the Premine \x0cCryptoFlow Loyalty Program One of the major issues with the current masternode structure is the discrepancy in the Return on Investment between the beginning stages of the coin and the later in the coin\xe2\x80\x99s life Because of this investors tend to cash out and fly off to a new coin which in turn can be very damaging to the project as a whole CryptoFlow aims to change the game of masternodes By introducing a Loyalty Program for the investors it will incentive the long term holding of a CFL masternode After the launch of the platform and revenue begins to flow in the team will launch the Loyalty Program as a revenue sharing opportunity for investors Paid out once a month to current masternode holders the equivilant of 25% of the amount of CFL transfers done by the platform that month will be paid out to the current masternode holders Coming from the 10% Premine these payouts will be recorded and shared publicly with the community The initial structure may be subject to change from the original plan but this will only be to secure the longevity of the company and to insure we can always offer a Loyalty scheme of a kind constantly Example January 2019 we do \xc2\xa3500 000 00 in CFL trades on the CryptoFlow Platform 25% of that is \xc2\xa3125 000 00 CryptoFlow has 500 masternodes are running Each masternode will receive an additional \xc2\xa3250 for that month The \xc2\xa3250 will be paid in CFL equivalent directly to the wallets For functionality there will be a sign up process As such the more MN\xe2\x80\x99s you hold the more the long term benefits \x0cCryptoFlow Directors Barry Doyle
