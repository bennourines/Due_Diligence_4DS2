36% and the expenses at 7% (Events / Airdrop / Core Team @ 7%) of the total supply This will give us the time to focus on the balance of 57% for the public to have Our price offered to the public on the day we release it shall remain (within) the same value as what have been offered to the Private Investors This is to avoid any speculation from all parties We are clear with the role of the private investors and it interests and we are very familiar with the public investors and the \xe2\x80\x9cHolders\xe2\x80\x9d reasons Therefore we must be clear about the released price so that everyone has (almost) equal initial investment However we cannot control the increment or decrement of the price from the date we agreed to the private investors compare to the public price at the time of released Since Asian Dragon depends on Supply & Demands we believe it will not be much gap difference IMPORTANT Price may differ from the date / time of released ASIAN

share disclose and boast about our organization identity to world we are being legally advised by our lawyers many times not to do so until several jurisdiction red tapes have been removed All our Solutions Partners and Private Investors also have chosen to remain anonymous until clearer mandate of the government\xe2\x80\x99s decisions and intentions on Cryptocurrency are made public We are an active registered company operating in countries where we face restriction from certain agencies enforcing the rules of law that being set upon companies that involve in Cryptocurrencies activities We are being brutally honest and truthful about our Whitepaper as we are an active Solutions & Technology company that develop and integrate smart payment system throughout South East Asia using our technology and application Realistically we are not prepared in any way to jeopardize our current business existent just to chase dreams and visions that will help many people benefits with our ideology Unfortunately technical legality does not believe in good deeds Therefore we wish to remain anonymous For now Due to this reason there will be NO allocating of tokens for the owner the management and advisors This have been decided and advised by our legal advisors since we decided to remain anonymous due to uncertain legal implication that may be enforce by the law of the land that govern it One may ask how are we going to profits if we take none honestly we have existing solution running that yield profits if we add Cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x9cAddon Solutions\xe2\x80\x9d onto the current payment technology without any legal implication for doing it we may make more than what we intended to get We are being realistic and that how we look from business perspective in long run The more people get onto the solutions the more business will be made With Cryptocurrencies enable there is so much more to look forward and with ASIAN DRAGON (AD) as the primary payment token we will generate more transaction ASIAN DRAGON/WHITEPAPER/GT&C/LEGAL/OCT/2018 \xc2\xa9 2018 2024 ASIAN DRAGON All Rights Reserved \x0cASIAN DRAGON V1 2 Projects & Developments As an active solutions company in Asia we will produce on our own solutions to support our intentions and vision This is the reasons why our existing partners agreed with our approach and concept by only introduce \xe2\x80\x9cAddon\xe2\x80\x9d into the existing application to accept all cryptocurrencies transaction in 2024 moving forward The existing system already running smoothly all we need to do is to enhance it so that it can transact alongside blockchain and not by creating entirely new system Nonetheless building a new solution solely on blockchain was never put off permanently we still have the plan and ready to go production if needed It will depend on the Business & Technology partners decision as they have agreed with the initial investment for us to develop it if needed Again we MUST stress out the legal implication which also a major concern to all our partners in Asia If the \xe2\x80\x9caddon solutions concept\xe2\x80\x9d faced major hurdle with the law due to integration with existing fiat we will switch to pure blockchain concept When the time is right and clear from all legal uncertainty over Cryptocurrencies we will announce the project that we have deployed and the enhancement tools or if we must release a new payment gateway purely on Blockchain due to banks restrictive rules We are looking at February 10th 2024 The Year of the Dragon to properly introduce it in Asia as we hope by then the respective people that govern the land will have finalized their intention and views towards Cryptocurrencies and the public may use our solutions without being afraid

INFORMATION OR UPDATE No person has been or is authorised to give any information or representation not contained in this White Paper in connection with the Issuer and its business and operations the Tokens the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS or protocol or the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) and if given such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised by or on behalf of the Issuer The ASIAN DRAGON (AD) shall not under any circumstances constitute a continuing representation or create any suggestion or implication that there has been no change or development reasonably likely to involve a material change in the affairs conditions and prospects of the Issuer or in any statement of fact or information contained in this White Paper since the date hereof RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND DISSEMINATION The distribution or dissemination of this White Paper or any part thereof may be prohibited or restricted by the laws regulatory requirements and rules of any jurisdiction In the case where any restriction applies you are to inform yourself about and to observe any restrictions which are applicable to your possession of this White Paper or such part thereof (as the case may be) at your own expense and without liability to the Issuer Persons to whom a copy of this White Paper has been distributed or disseminated provided access to or who otherwise have the White Paper in their possession shall not circulate it to any other persons reproduce or otherwise distribute this White Paper or any information contained herein for any purpose whatsoever nor permit or cause the same to occur There may be no inherent value of the Tokens and the Tokens are not a currency issued by any central bank or national supra national or quasi national organisation nor are they backed by any hard assets or other credit Unlike fiat currency the Tokens may have no use or recognition outside the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS The Issuer is not responsible for nor does it pursue the circulation and trading of Tokens on the market Trading of Tokens merely depends on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants (if any) and no one is or will be obliged to purchase any Token from any holder of the Token including the purchasers nor does or will anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of Tokens to any extent at any time Accordingly the Issuer cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for Tokens or that the Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of Tokens after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange Representatives of various central banks and regulatory authorities as well as senior market participants and academics have warned of serious risks in relation to (i) initial private or public token sales (ii) cryptocurrency and digital tokens trading including the extreme volatility the lack of underlying economic value the lack of regulation and (iii) the use of cryptocurrencies or digital tokens for money laundering or money transfers There is a real possibility that some or a conjunction of these factors will lead to government or regulatory intervention or market action which could severely affect the price and liquidity of the Tokens Unlike currency in bank accounts or accounts at other financial institutions which may be subject to deposit protection schemes the Tokens are uninsured unless a holder specifically obtains private insurance to insure them Thus in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by the Issuer to offer recourse to a Token holder Future sales of the Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price of Tokens Any future sale of the Tokens (which were not available for sale in the ASIAN DRAGON (AD)) would increase the supply of Tokens and this may result in a downward price pressure on the Tokens The sale or distribution of a significant number of Tokens outside of the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) or the perception that such further sales or issuance may occur could adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens The Issuer reserves the right to change the duration of any timeframe for the distribution of the Tokens including without limitation the unavailability or non functionality of the website or other unforeseen procedural or security issues Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Tokens Negative publicity involving the Issuer the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS the Tokens or any of the key personnel of the Issuer may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of the Tokens whether or not such negative publicity is justified The Tokens may not end up being popular prevalent or widely distributed The Tokens may remain of marginal interest in the long run appealing to only a minimal fraction of holders An absence of active holders or low level of utilization may negatively affect the long term development and future of the Tokens and reduce or adversely affect the utility of the Tokens There is no assurance of any success of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS The value of and demand for the Tokens depends on the performance of the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) sales volumes There is no assurance that the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial ASIAN DRAGON/WHITEPAPER/GT&C/LEGAL/OCT/2018 \xc2\xa9 2018 2024 ASIAN DRAGON All Rights Reserved \x0cASIAN DRAGON V1 2 success As with any project the development of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the execution of the project more broadly carries with it the risk of delay and even failure The core team has a relevant track record of development and business management experience but this is not a guarantee of success The team will endeavour to achieve the milestones outlined in this White Paper however it is under no obligation to do so The ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS has not been officially launched developed finalised or integrated and is subject to further changes updates and adjustments prior to its official release Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users and hence impact its success While the Issuer has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate there is also no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) will be sufficient for the development and integration of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS For the foregoing or any other reasons the development and integration of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS may not be completed and there is no assurance that it will be launched at all As such distributed Tokens may hold little value and this would impact their trading price Further while the Issuer will make every reasonable effort to complete the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS due to the technically complex nature of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS the Issuer could face difficulties from time to time that may be unforeseeable or unresolvable Accordingly it is possible that the development of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS could fail terminate or be delayed at any time for any reason and an official completed version of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS may not be released and there may never be an operational ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS Development failure or termination may render the Tokens untransferable of reduced or no utility or obsolete In particular any potential future utility of the Tokens indicated in this White Paper only represent the Issuer\ s strategic intention in the future development of the project and there is no guarantee or representation that such intention will be achieved in part or in full In particular the potential future token utility will be subject to a fully compliant regulatory infrastructure being set up and there is no guarantee that such infrastructure will be set up Further the project is still at an early development phase Its governance structure fees purpose consensus mechanism algorithm code infrastructure design and other technical specifications and parameters may be updated and changed frequently without notice While this White Paper contains the key information currently available in relation to the project it is subject to adjustments and updates from time to time The ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS may also be subject to regulatory supervision in a relevant jurisdiction and distribution of information relating to the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS may be restricted to qualified persons pursuant to applicable laws and regulations The Token holders may not have full or timely access to all the information relevant to the project (including the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS or the Tokens) Although we intend for the Tokens and the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS to follow the specifications set forth in this White Paper and we will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends we may have to make changes to the specifications of the Tokens or the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS for any number of reasons This could create the risk that the Tokens or the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS as further developed and maintained may not meet participants\ expectations Furthermore despite the Issuer\ s good faith efforts to develop and maintain the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS it is possible that the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained which may negatively impact the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the Tokens If and when the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS is fully developed there is no assurance they will be widely adopted or utilised by its target users The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) The prices of cryptographic tokens in general are highly volatile when compared to other assets such as stocks bonds and other alternative investment instruments and accordingly the prices of cryptographic tokens can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time The demand for and correspondingly the market price of the Tokens may fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to among others the following factors some of which are beyond the control of the Issuer new technical innovations analysts\xe2\x80\x99 speculations recommendations perceptions or estimates of the Token\xe2\x80\x99s market price or the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s financial and business performance changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with operations similar to that of the Issuer whether or not they are made available for sale and purchase on the same crypto currency exchanges as the Tokens announcements by the Issuer of significant events for example partnerships sponsorships new product developments fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges additions or departures of key personnel of the Issuer success or failure of the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s management in implementing business and growth strategies and changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology industry the general economic conditions or market sentiments or other events or factors No person should commit any amount to the purchase of any Tokens which exceeds an amount they would be willing to lose It is also possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same source code and protocol underlying the ASIAN ASIAN DRAGON/WHITEPAPER/GT&C/LEGAL/OCT/2018 \xc2\xa9 2018 2024 ASIAN DRAGON All Rights Reserved \x0cASIAN DRAGON V1 2 DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the Tokens These may attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to those provided by the Issuer through the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS Such alternative platforms may compete with the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS which could negatively impact the usage of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the value of the Tokens The funds raised in the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) are exposed to risks of theft The Issuer will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) will be securely held at such address as directed by the Issuer (\xe2\x80\x9cReceiving Address\xe2\x80\x9d) Further upon receipt of the funds the Issuer will make every effort to ensure that the funds received will be securely held by implementing security measures Notwithstanding such security measures there is no assurance that there will be no theft of any amount paid (in cryptocurrency or otherwise) as a result of hacks mining attacks (including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks and \xe2\x80\x9cselfish mining\xe2\x80\x9d attacks) sophisticated cyber attacks malware attacks coordinated attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing distributed denials of service or errors vulnerabilities or defects on the receiving Address the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) Blockchain or any other blockchain or otherwise Such events may include for example flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof In such event even if the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) is completed the Issuer may not be able to receive any amounts of cryptocurrency raised and the Issuer may not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the launch of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS might be temporarily or permanently curtailed As such the issued Tokens may hold little value and this would impact its trading price The Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them In the event of any loss or loss of value you may have no recourse To account for these risks the Issuer will continue to implement appropriate and proportionate security measures to safeguard the cryptocurrency obtained from the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) However such risks cannot be fully eliminated There may be tax implications the tax characterization of the Tokens may not be certain in your jurisdiction Participants must seek their own tax advice in connection with purchasing the Tokens or otherwise engaging in transactions in connection with the Tokens which may result in adverse tax consequences to participants including withholding taxes income taxes and tax reporting requirements There may be issues in relation to privacy and leak of personal data as part of the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) and the subsequent verification processes the Issuer may collect personal information from participants The collection of such information is subject to applicable laws and regulations (and where applicable the Issuer\ s privacy policy from time to time) All information collected will be used for purposes of ASIAN DRAGON (AD) and management of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS (or the project more generally) and may be transferred to contractors service providers and consultants worldwide as appointed by the Issuer Apart from breaches by external third parties the Issuer and its appointed entities may also suffer from internal security breach whereby their employees may misappropriate misplace or lose personal information of the Token holders 2 RISKS RELATING TO THE RECEIVING ADDRESS AND WALLETS The Receiving Address may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies may not be able to be disbursed The Receiving Address is designed to be secure However in the event that the Receiving Address is for any reason compromised (including but not limited to scenarios of the loss of keys to such Receiving Address) the funds held by the Receiving Address may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed and may be permanently unrecoverable In such event even if the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) is successful the Issuer will not be able to receive the funds raised and the Issuer will not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the implementation of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS might be temporarily or permanently curtailed As such distributed ASIAN DRAGON (AD) tokens may hold little value and this may impact its trading price The loss or compromise of information relating to your wallet may affect your access and possession of the Tokens where your access to the Tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet (\xe2\x80\x9cWallet\xe2\x80\x9d) depends on among other things the safeguards to your information relating to such Wallet including but not limited to your user account information address private key and password In the event that any of the foregoing is lost or compromised your access to the Wallet may be curtailed and thereby adversely affect your access and possession to the Tokens including such Tokens being unrecoverable and permanently lost The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Tokens the Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Tokens which may result in the delivery of Tokens being unsuccessful or affect your access to such Tokens You are responsible for your own selection of an appropriate Wallet There are risks associated with the underlying blockchain Since the Tokens are based on blockchain technology any malfunction breakdown or abandonment of the relevant blockchain may have a material adverse effect on the Tokens or the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS Moreover advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing could present risks to the Tokens by rendering ineffective any applicable cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain Loss of private key in general blockchain assets are controllable only by those who know the unique private cryptographic key relating to the network address at which the blockchain assets are held To the extent a private key is lost destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible you may not be able to access the blockchain asset ASIAN DRAGON/WHITEPAPER/GT&C/LEGAL/OCT/2018 \xc2\xa9 2018 2024 ASIAN DRAGON All Rights Reserved \x0cASIAN DRAGON V1 2 associated with the corresponding address and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the network Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store blockchain assets could have a material adverse effect on our business or you The loss or destruction of a private key will also permanently and irreversibly deny the holder access to their Tokens The Tokens are controlled only by the validation of both the relevant unique public and private keys through the local or online Wallet While it is recommended that all the Token holders protect and securely store their private keys each holder is responsible for safeguarding the private keys applicable to their own Wallets There may be verification failure Participants in the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) are required to complete know your customer (\xe2\x80\x9cKYC\xe2\x80\x9d) and anti money laundering ( AML ) and counter terrorist financing ( CTF ) checks The delivery of the Tokens to an entity or individual is contingent upon the completion of such checks If the entity or individual is unable to complete all required verifications they may not receive the Tokens or participate on the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS There is no guarantee that you will receive compensation or refunds of any purchase proceeds There may be risk during the transaction interval There is a time interval between the receipt of payments from the participant by the Issuer and the release of the Tokens to the relevant participant\ s digital Wallet During this time the Issuer may have possession of participants\ digital currency and it may itself be susceptible to various risks including credit risk and cybersecurity risk The Issuer may lose participants\ digital currency entirely due to unforeseen circumstances In any such scenario the Issuer will not be obliged to compensate participants RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER The ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS is operated and maintained by the Issuer Any events or circumstances which adversely affect the Issuer may have a corresponding adverse effect on the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS if such events or circumstances affect the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to maintain the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS This would have an impact on the trading price of the Tokens The Issuer may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively manage its operations as its business develops and evolves which would have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and consequently the trading price of the Tokens The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the markets in which the Issuer competes have grown rapidly and continue to grow rapidly and evolve in response to new technological advances changing business models and other factors As a result of this constantly changing environment the Issuer may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes and the longer term viability of the Issuer will depend on its ability to manage its operations adapt to technological advances and market trends and ensure that it hires qualified and competent employees and provide proper training for its personnel As its business evolves the Issuer must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure The Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s business relies on its blockchainbased software systems cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms blockchain technology and smart contract technology and to manage technical support infrastructure for the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS effectively the Issuer will need to continue to upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational systems procedures and controls These upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that the Issuer does not control If the Issuer is unable to adapt its systems and organisation in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected If the third parties on whom the Issuer relies are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services the Issuer utilises the integrity and availability of its internal information could be compromised which may consequently cause the loss of confidential or proprietary information and economic loss The loss of financial labour or other resources and any other adverse effect on the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s business financial condition and operations would have a direct adverse effect on the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to maintain the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS As the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS is the main product to which the Tokens relate this may adversely impact the trading price of the Tokens There may be weaknesses vulnerabilities or bugs in the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) smart contract The Issuer will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the smart contracts underlying the Tokens are audited tested and approved by technical experts However as smart contract technology is still in its early stage of development and its application of experimental nature carries significant operational technological financial regulatory and reputational risks there are inherent risks that such smart contracts could contain weaknesses vulnerabilities or bugs There is the risk that smart contracts may contain bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Tokens or result in the loss of the Tokens as well as the loss of ability to access or control the Tokens In such events there may be no remedy and holders of the Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy refund or compensation Purchasers of Tokens should understand and accept that there are no warranties that Tokens are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses vulnerabilities or bugs which would cause loss in their value In the event that any of the aforementioned risks materialises the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s business strategies results of operations and prospects may also be adversely affected ASIAN DRAGON/WHITEPAPER/GT&C/LEGAL/OCT/2018 \xc2\xa9 2018 2024 ASIAN DRAGON All Rights Reserved \x0cASIAN DRAGON V1 2 The Issuer may experience system failures unplanned interruptions in its network or services hardware or software defects security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure network or the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS The Issuer is unable to anticipate when there would be occurrences of hacks cyber attacks mining attacks (including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks and \xe2\x80\x9cselfish mining\xe2\x80\x9d attacks) malware attacks coordinated attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing distributed denials of service or errors vulnerabilities or defects in the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS the Tokens the Receiving Address the Wallet or any technology (including but not limited to smart contract technology) on which the Issuer the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS the Tokens the Receiving Address and the Wallet rely or in the ASIAN DRAGON (AD) Blockchain or any other blockchain Such events may include for example flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof The Issuer may not be able to detect such hacks mining attacks (including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks and \xe2\x80\x9cselfish mining\xe2\x80\x9d attacks) cyber attacks malware attacks coordinated attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing distributed denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with any such attack including without limitation where multiple service incidents happen simultaneously or in rapid succession While the Issuer adopts quality assurance procedures to help ensure the source code as accurately as possible reflect their intended operation the source code cannot be guaranteed to be flawless They may contain bugs defects inconsistencies flaws or errors which may disable some functionality create vulnerabilities or cause instability Such flaws may compromise the predictability usability stability and/or security of the Tokens and the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS Furthermore where the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS may be based on open source software there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Issuer\ s team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS which could negatively affect the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the utility of the Tokens The Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s network or services which would include the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS could be disrupted by various events including natural disasters equipment breakdown network connectivity downtime power losses or even intentional disruptions of its services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorised users some of which are beyond the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s control Although the Issuer has taken steps against malicious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure which are critical for the maintenance of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and its other services there can be no assurance that cyber attacks such as distributed denials of service will not be attempted in the future and that any of the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced security measures will be effective The Issuer may be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology financial data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to the Issuer and users of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS Any significant breach of the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability stability and security of the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s network or services (including the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS) may adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens If the demand for processing power outgrows that forecasted the network of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS could be destabilized and/or stagnated This may create opportunities for fraudulent activities to arise including but not limited to false or unauthorized transactions All of these may adversely impact the usability stability and security of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and affect the utility and value of the Tokens We are dependent in part on the location and data centre facilities of third parties The Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure network is in part established through servers which it owns and are located on premises owned and operated by third parties and servers that the Issuer rents at data centre facilities of third parties If the Issuer is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all the Issuer may be required to transfer its servers to a new data centre facility and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with the relocation These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from among others natural disasters arson terrorist attacks power losses and telecommunication failures Additionally the third party providers of such facilities may suffer breaches of security as a result of third party action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and a third party may obtain unauthorised access to the data on such servers As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and typically are not recognised until launched against a target the Issuer and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures Any such security breaches or damages which occur and which impact upon the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure network and/or the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS may adversely impact the utility and value of the Tokens General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s operating performance results of operations and cash flows The Issuer has been and will continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect on the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s business operations and financial condition including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows Additionally in a down cycle economic environment ASIAN DRAGON/WHITEPAPER/GT&C/LEGAL/OCT/2018 \xc2\xa9 2018 2024 ASIAN DRAGON All Rights Reserved \x0cASIAN DRAGON V1 2 the Issuer may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and a slowdown in commerce and usage of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and may delay or suspend the structuring licensing and launch of the anticipated future business lines Suppliers on which the Issuer relies for servers bandwidth location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s operations or expenses There can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s business financial condition and results of operations and hence the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS which would correspondingly impact the trading price of the Tokens In addition even if the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS is launched the ongoing success of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS relies on the interest and participation of third parties There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS The Issuer or the Tokens may be affected by regulations The regulatory environment relating to blockchain and cryptocurrencies is still developing Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world Regulatory initiatives by governments and uniform law proposals by academics and participants in the cryptocurrency economy may impact the use of cryptocurrency and digital tokens in a manner that adversely affects the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS or the Issuer The global regulatory landscape for digital assets has been inconsistent and continues to evolve There are various approaches a government may take Some governments have taken an accommodating approach to the regulation of digital assets while others have banned their use Different jurisdictions may apply different legal categorization of digital assets characterising them as for example currencies commodities virtual currencies virtual commodities or other property or instruments Some jurisdictions may restrict or ban cryptocurrency or digital token related activities Some countries have taken and one or more countries may in the future take regulatory actions that severely restrict the right to acquire own hold sell or use cryptocurrencies or digital tokens or to exchange them for traditional currency Furthermore many aspects of the Tokens and ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS also involve untested areas of law and regulation The Tokens could be deemed from time to time a virtual commodity a digital asset or even money securities or currency in various jurisdictions and therefore could be prohibited from being sold purchased traded distributed or held in certain jurisdictions There is no guarantee that the Tokens and the Issuer can maintain any particular legal or regulatory status in any particular jurisdiction at any time The Issuer may have to disallow people based on their citizenship or location from accessing the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS or engaging in any transactions that involve the Tokens if doing so becomes legally or commercially unsustainable There can be no guarantee that new laws regulations and practices specifically relating to blockchain and cryptocurrencies digital tokens and transactions in relation to ICOs will not be promulgated in the future The promulgation of such new laws regulations and practices may operate to the advantage or disadvantage of the Tokens the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS or the Issuer The Issuer or the Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency markets including having to take measures to comply with such regulations and be subject to regulatory licensing or registration requirements in certain jurisdictions or having to deal with queries notices requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities which may come at a substantial cost The ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS could be impacted by one or more regulatory actions that could impede or limit the ability of the Issuer to continue with the development of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and may also require substantial modifications to the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS This may impact the appeal of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS for users and result in decreased usage of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS The Issuer cannot foresee how regulations may impact the project and the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS development Further should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold maintaining the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS may no longer be commercially viable and the Issuer may opt to discontinue the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and/or the Tokens Further it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications including the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS and the Tokens The Issuer may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or make it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction In scenarios such as the foregoing the trading price of Tokens may be adversely affected or Tokens may cease to be traded Even where the Issuer core team seeks to obtain the relevant licenses and registrations in the relevant jurisdictions as necessary for the operations of the ASIAN DRAGON SOLUTIONS there is no guarantee that such licenses and registration will be approved by the
