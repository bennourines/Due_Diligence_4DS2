b A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 7 2018 5 \x0cWITNESS VALUE DAEX is a clearing solution for centralized cryptocurrency trading exchanges Its clearing service is based on distributed ledger technology Clearing and settlement rules are preprogrammed into clearing smart contracts on the DAEX clearing chain The clearing process is automatic without people\xe2\x80\x99 s interference The objectivity of clearing is guaranteed by the consensus mechanism on the clearing chain Also customers\xe2\x80\x99 digital assets are registered and stored on the DAEX\xe2\x80\x99 s clearing chain No other institutions or individuals can access these assets without the owner\xe2\x80\x99 s permission Disclaimer This whitepaper in English is a modified version of the same whitepaper in Chinese This paper tries to keep the content of the program consistent with that expressed in the Chinese whitepaper If there is any discrepancies the content in the Chinese whitepaper should be recognized as the true one DAEX thus can effectively address flaws and risks of the current cryptocurrency industry and lay a solid foundation for the healthy development of this industry \x0cContents 1 Background 01 4 The Usage of Token 19 1 1 The Cryptocurrency Market 01 4 1 Token Allocation Plan 19 1 2 Risks with Current

DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 \x0c1 Background 1 1 The Cryptocurrency Market The current total market value of all cryptocurrencies has far exceeded $280 billions Among all of these cryptocurrencies bitcoin stands out with over 50% of the market share At the same time new cryptocurrencies keep pouring into the market Bitcoin derivatives are also entering the market Regulated exchanges like CBOE and CME followed each other in listing bitcoin futures Until the third quarter of 2017 investment return on cryptocurrencies is as high as 448% which has far exceeded investment returns on other assets like the stock market gold and real estate Cryptocurrency trading has been very active Almost 60 cryptocurrencies boast average daily trading volume of 10 millions dollars Such active trading leads more and more trading exchanges entering the market 1 2 Risks with Current Exchanges There are currently two types of cryptocurrency trading exchanges centralized exchanges and distributed exchanges Each type has its advantages and disadvantages A distributed exchange is usually based on distributed ledger technology It runs on its own It does not need people to maintain its operation Trader\xe2\x80\x99s asset on a distributed exchange is held in his own account The exchange does not have access to it Traders trade directly with each other on a distributed exchange The exchange\xe2\x80\x99s underlying technology guarantees the trade go through and cleared and settled correctly Such distributed exchanges include BitShare and EtherDelta The advantages of distributed exchange are very obvious Trader\xe2\x80\x99s asset is well protected trading and clearing costs are low traders can freely join and leave and they can trade with anyone in the world as long as the other party also uses the same exchange Despite of all these advantages however distributed exchanges also have serious disadvantages particularly in terms of liquidity matching speed and flexibility Because of these disadvantages distributed exchanges never become widely used in cryptocurrency trading DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 01 \x0cCentralized exchanges are exactly the opposite of distributed exchanges in almost every aspect It provides a centralized order matching mechanism for traders It receives trader\xe2\x80\x99s cryptocurrencies as deposits and holds these cryptocurrencies in its own storage The exchange then issues IOUs to trader\xe2\x80\x99s exchange account Traders effectively trade these IOUs with each other at the exchange When they want to transfer their cryptocurrencies to other places they use their IOUs to instruct the exchange to send corresponding cryptocurrencies to specified addresses While current cryptocurrency centralized exchanges have strong advantages in providing liquidity matching speed and flexibility they are inherently flawed in their current infrastructure Each exchange maintains its customers\xe2\x80\x99 assets This exposes customers\xe2\x80\x99 assets to both serious internal and external risks The operation of such exchanges is also opaque There is no way to guarantee an exchange\xe2\x80\x99s objectivity in being an unbiased matching mechanism In fact security incidents keep happening to centralized exchanges in recent years from Mt Gox to the most recent Yubit Such incidents will for sure keep happening because of the basically flawed infrastructure of centralized exchanges 1 3 The Goal of DAEX The goal of DAEX is to provide a better infrastructure for the cryptocurrency trading industry by taking the reasonable parts of the mainstream securities trading industry and by taking advantages of new opportunities brought about by the distributed ledger technology Specifically trading and clearing will be separated into different entities Current centralized exchanges will continue to provide trading service But the clearing work will be handled over to a common clearing service which is based on the DAEX solution But different from current centralized clearing services the DAEX clearing service is based on distributed ledger technology The distributed ledger technology guarantees that trades are correctly and safely cleared and settled By using distributed ledger technology trader\xe2\x80\x99s assets are kept in their own accounts on the blockchain No one else can access traders\xe2\x80\x99 assets without their permissions This effectively removes trader\xe2\x80\x99s asset risks in current centralized exchanges DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 02 The DAEX solution will be an open sourced clearing service based on a public blockchain Its code is open for public inspection and supervision \x0c1 4 Terminology The clearing chain Cryptocurrency clearing service based on distributed ledger technology It uses Clearing as a Service (CaaS) method to provide clearing services for cryptocurrency exchanges DAEX Wallet A cryptocurrency wallet that supports multiple signatures and multiple digital assets It accesses exchanges to trade cryptocurrencies and the clearing chain to manage its assets Multiple part private key A private key that is broken into several parts Some parts have to be used together to access assets in the wallet Clearing as a Service\xef\xbc\x88CaaS\xef\xbc\x89 A clearing service that is provided using a cloud mode The clearing facility is deployed on a public cloud Exchanges and clearing members obtain clearing related services through APIs or clients DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 03 \x0c2 The DAEX Ecosystem The rapid development of cryptocurrency trading calls for a more effective and secure clearing service After a series of hacker thefts and security incidents many exchanges have to come to the consensus that a common clearing and asset custodian service is required to protect the market and to guarantee the sustained growth of the market DAEX is therefore the answer to this market need 2 1 The Ecosystem DAEX ecosystem is composed of a clearing service that is based on distributed ledger technology centralized exchanges and user wallets Traders use their wallets to perform trades on exchanges After trades are matched at exchanges exchanges send matched trades to the clearing service The clearing service CaaS is performed by smart contracts on the distributed ledger technology During the initial phase of DAEX cryptocurrencies will be serviced During future phases of DAEX cryptocurrency derivatives will be serviced That is DAEX will provide clearing service for cryptocurrency derivatives traded on exchanges Exchanges CaaS Clearing Blockchain Options DAEX Wallet Smart C ontrac t Cryptocu rrenc ies Futures Payment DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 04 Digital Assets Delivery \x0cThe DAEX ecosystem provides the following advantages to participants in the system Secure Participating exchanges must meet the business and technology requirements of the ecosystem thus the quality of trading service is maintained User\xe2\x80\x99s assets are all held on the blockchain Assets cannot be moved without user\xe2\x80\x99s admission Multiple part private key further protect user\xe2\x80\x99s assets and also a safe recovery mechanism in case a user loses his private key Smart contract and the blockchain technology guarantees the correctness of clearing and settlement Trust Decoupling between trading and clearing is the best way to guarantee the safety of customer trading assets The insurance fund contributed by participating exchanges provides another layer of safety The DAEX ecosystem therefore provides a trustworthy environment for exchanges and traders Open First of all the DAEX ecosystem is open to and welcome new exchanges Exchanges that participate in the DAEX ecosystem can use all products and services provided by DAEX including wallets and clearing Secondly participating exchanges can expect to use more value added services DAEX is going to provide including cryptocurrency derivatives trading DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 05 \x0c2 2 Participants \xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89The DAEX Foundation The DAEX Foundation is registered in Singapore Its mission is to develop the DAEX solution and promote its use among cryptocurrency exchanges in the world The Foundation also manages the fund contributed by global investors The DAEX Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities include but are not limited to the following \xc2\xb7Information revelation \xc2\xb7Compliance and auditing \xc2\xb7Fund management \xc2\xb7Strategic decisions \xc2\xb7Arbitrage and reconciliation \xc2\xb7Public relationship \xef\xbc\x882\xef\xbc\x89Wallet Users Wallet users whose identity have been certified can use various functions such as trading and asset delivery \xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89Exchanges Provide cryptocurrency and derivatives trading services for wallet users Counsel member of the clearing union Provide a node on the clearing blockchain 2 3 Value The cryptocurrencies industry is still in its very early stage Inevitably it has many problems just like the internet industry in its early stage But it has a strong growth potential which is probably many times greater than that of the internet industry The goal of the DAEX ecosystem is to help the industry grow in a more orderly and secure way by providing a solid infrastructure that benefits many industry players DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 06 \x0c\xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89CaaS Current cryptocurrency exchanges all clear their own trades There are inherent risks in this kind of infrastructure Customers \xe2\x80\x98digital assets on the exchange are exposed to exchange\xe2\x80\x99s internal and external risks A trader\xe2\x80\x99s trading capital also cannot be fully utilized because he has to meet the capital requirements of different exchanges Also since each exchange has to do its own clearing work the whole trading industry is not making good use of its resources The goal of DAEX is to provide CaaS for the cryptocurrency trading industry Since this CaaS is based on distributed ledger technology its operation is thus objective and transparent It is not in favor of any type of organization or a specific organization or any group of people It is effectively an infrastructure service to the whole industry By using this service the industry becomes unbiased objective and transparent industry resources become more effectively used The industry is thus growing on a more solid foundation \xef\xbc\x882\xef\xbc\x89More effective way to list digital assets With the booming of ICO events more and more cryptocurrencies are entering the market everyday Lots of them are either pure fraud schemes or low quality coins that will never survive At the same time because of the low entry barriers and the booming industry more and more trading exchanges start to provide cryptocurrency trading services Selecting quality coins to list and make related business and technology work ready become a very burden some work for many exchanges As a clearing service it is DAEX\xe2\x80\x99s job to list new clearing products so that participating exchanges can trade The DAEX wallet can also simplify the work exchanges and users start trading a new cryptocurrency With DAEX\xe2\x80\x99s services exchanges therefore can significantly expedite the new product listing work and become more competitive in this rapidly growing industry DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 07 \x0c\xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89Help exchanges to become more competitive Cryptocurrency exchanges nowadays offer the same service Trading service is more and more becoming a commodity DAEX ecosystem offers participating exchanges a new competitive advantage over competitors First of all the token rewarding mechanism for everyone clearing will attract more new users generate more frequent trades and more trading quantity Secondly the DAEX multi asset wallet lowers the delivering cost Thirdly the separation of trading and clearing helps exchanges to focus more on their core competencies thus maintain their competitive advantages 2 4 Comparison of Different Modes The DAEX ecosystem is the best combination of centralized trading and distributed clearing DAEX users can enjoy the best trading experience provided by centralized exchanges and also at the same time do not have to worry about the safety of their trading assets DAEX also significantly lowers the technical and business entry barriers for aspiring exchanges providing a solid foundation for their business growth Comparison of Different Trading and Clearing Mechanisms DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 08 Centralized Exchange Distributed Exchange DAEX Asset custodian by single party Yes Yes No Customer owns private key No Yes Yes Private key change No No Yes Deposit and withdrawal Takes a long time to approve a withdrawal No restriction No restriction Internal

AML Yes No Yes Punitive measures against exchanges No No Yes \x0c2 5 Future Development \xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89Clearing for margin trading and short Margin trading is a trading method when a user borrows money to establish long positions on certain cryptocurrency Short is a trading method when a user borrows certain cryptocurrency to establish a short position In both methods the trader hopes that the market will move in the expected direction then he can make a profit and return borrowed money or cryptocurrency During the first development phase of DAEX the clearing service for cryptocurrency trading will be developed During the second phase clearing service for margin trading and short will be developed \xef\xbc\x882\xef\xbc\x89Derivatives clearing Because of the tremendous profit potential of cryptocurrencies exchanges are going to provide more financial instruments for their customers to trade or hedge Cryptocurrency derivatives such as futures and options will be provided to hedge or speculate CBOE and CME have already introduced bitcoin futures It is expected that derivatives based on other cryptocurrencies will be gradually introduced Although the introduction of bitcoin futures met the market demand in a timely manner it however has some serious drawbacks The most obvious one is that both future products are cash settled not with the underlying asset Traders still cannot use bitcoin derivatives to obtain bitcoins DAEX will address this issue by supporting the underlying asset delivery in cryptocurrency derivatives trading Also by using smart contract technology DAEX will use trader\xe2\x80\x99s digital assets on the blockchain as collaterals raising trader\xe2\x80\x99s capital efficiency and controlling risk at the same time DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 09 \x0cThe DAEX clearing solution also offers the following advantages \xe2\x80\xa2 The distributed ledger technology guarantees the objectivity of the clearing process and protect the safety of customers\xe2\x80\x99 assets \xe2\x80\xa2 The settlement price is based on a composite price of the underlying asset of participating exchanges The blockchain technology guarantees the authenticity of these prices The weighted price also guarantees the objectivity of the settlement price \xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89Smart inclusive financing The blockchain technology creates a brand new form of asset This new asset form which we call smart digital asset is represented by bits and bytes in computer code and programs registered on the blockchain exchanged from account to account and can run automatically without human participation With this smart digital asset we can create all kinds of assets defined by the current legal framework from tangible assets such as car and real estate to intangible assets like stock savings and intellectual properties The essence of smart digital asset is the control of asset ownership The DAEX system gives every user the right to issue smart digital asset using DAEX tokens A user can create new smart digital asset such as commercial paper and personalized asset by collateralizing certain highly liquid digital assets After it is recognized by certain users and exchanges in the DAEX ecosystem it then can be traded among approving users and exchanges and cleared by the DAEX clearing chain objectively and transparently DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 10 \x0c3 The Clearing Solution 3 1 The Clearing Chain The clearing chain is the core of the DAEX clearing ecosystem It is an open sourced cryptocurrency clearing solution based on distributed ledger technology It provides clearing and settlement services to both individual and institution users This chain is deployed on multiple nodes on a public cloud It uses one kind of POS consensus mechanism to validate transactions 3 1 1 Clearing Contract A clearing smart contract that is based on the smart contract technology plays a pivotal role in this clearing service All clearing and settlement business rules are preprogrammed into this clearing contract This smart contract finishes the whole clearing and settlement cycle of a matched trade After a matched trade is formed in a DAEX participating exchange it is sent to the clearing chain A clearing smart contract is then formed for this matched trade This clearing smart contract will first validate the matched trade to make sure that it meets all the business requirements After the validation the smart contract goes through the consensus mechanism and then updates corresponding accounts on the ledger 5 6 Trade Matching Re signature of Smart Contract by Wallet Key Clearing Blockchain 7 Clearing and Settlement Transaction Consensus Transaction Adapter 4 Ledgers Pre verification Exchanges 2 3 8 Trigger the Transaction Sign Smart Contract by User Key 1 DAEX Wallet API User DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 11 Result \x0c3 1 2 The Clearing Mechanism DAEX customizes a specialized consensus mechanism based on clearing value factor (CVF POS) It is a governance standard of distributed digital clearing ledger its purpose is to prevent the malicious sabotage behaviors through strict clearing responsibility arrangements The high performance of CVF POS will avoid the centralization of computing power and clearing power through technology democratization expanding network effect with relatively low network cost reaching relative decentralization Every wallet user with digital asset can participate in the clearing process becoming witness of clearing \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone participate\xe2\x80\x9d clearing mechanism provides an effective way for DAEX wallet users to obtain real financial reward At the same time the clearing responsibility mechanism can identify a process that leads to mistakes in consensus and perform punishments according clearing rules In the classic POS mechanism the weight of every node is linked to the capital on this node This can lead to Matthew Effect which makes the rich richer In the DAEX clearing ecosystem every DAEX wallet user has equal accounting power but different accounting scores The accounting power is determined by the ecosystem it acquires specific number of accounting scores through value factor evaluation and exchange Those nodes with a certain number of accounting scores can be defined as a validator Validator on the clearing chain is similar to miner Wallet users can select a validator to delegate their accounting scores Validator is a safe machine that is delegated responsibility to generate blocks carrying out accounting and consensuses through broadcasting encrypted signatures DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 12 \x0cDAEX token is like chips on the clearing chain Users are responsible for selecting trustworthy validators The clearing union will keep raising validators\xe2\x80\x99 judging ability and the also binding power of the ecosystem in order to protect user\xe2\x80\x99s benefits When wallet users trust their DAEX tokens to any validator to earn some DAEX token rewards if the validator is hacked or it violates any agreements then the collateralized tokens will be penalized The CVF POS provable security mechanism and the collateralized assets of concerned parties provide node and even light clients measurable security The administration system of the clearing chain can solve temporary trading exchange problems For example when detecting malicious attacks it can suspend clearing requests DAEX can support enough number of validators to achieve global distributed blockchain and also within a very short period of time With the development of bandwidth storage and parallel computing the DAEX clearing chain can support the scale of more validators The accounting power in the DAEX ecosystem is determined in the early stage including accounting range and ecosystem parameters But with the development of the ecosystem users can propose to make amendments to change ecosystem parameters Users can also propose to make amendments to ecosystem rules These rules bind related parties together to solve asset theft and contract loophole problems reaching better and clearer solutions DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 13 \x0c3 1 3 Clearing Account A dedicated clearing account will be opened for each user This account is used to registered digital assets keep asset balances and clearing history Smart Contract Clearing Transactions DAEX Wallet Address ID State Assets Balance BTC 2 000 ETH 1 000 000 Clearing Account Clearing Blockchain Digital Assets Pool Settlement Transactions Since all DAEX participating exchanges use one clearing ledger customer accounts are created and managed on the same ledger Customers\xe2\x80\x99 trading assets are also managed on the same ledger The same underlying technology and clearing rules significantly reduces exchanges\xe2\x80\x99 costs and errors The technology as well as the business rules DAEX uses are open and transparent to exchanges and traders DAEX thus provides them with a reliable and trustworthy clearing and settlement service The DAEX clearing chain will accommodate the existing infrastructure of exchanges Adapters that make sure the matched trade meets the DAEX clearing protocol will be provided to exchanges to facilitate their adoption of DAEX service End users can use wallets that meet DAEX specification to access and manage their trading assets on the clearing chain The DAEX clearing service is different from existing clearing services Its service is accessible to all regions of the world and it is not regulated by any regulation body in the world It relies only on the distributed ledger technology to guarantee an objective and correct clearing service This nature makes it more appealing to cryptocurrency traders and exchanges in the world DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 14 \x0c3 2 Clearing Protocol In the DAEX ecosystem business standards and protocols such as clearing protocol data structure and encryption standard are made collectively and implemented by technology The clearing protocol specifies the communication mechanism between exchanges and the DAEX clearing service It is a critical element of the DAEX ecosystem The clearing protocol uses lightweight stateless remote communication mechanism The protocol may be in the form of the following examples Data structure of clearing request Mode Element Note Version Version number of the protocol Channel Channel specification Requester Requester\xe2\x80\x99s ID Timestamp Request timestamp Business ID Message ID to identify one clearing process Module Clearing chain service element exchange or wallet Method Clearing method such as spot trade option or future Params Structured parameters containing user identification type of matched trade trade time quantity etc Encryption Encryption parameters specified

such as signature of public keys address of smart contracts clearing message random number and signature The clearing message is a binary string specified in the form of the above protocol and the signature is the ECDSA result through calculating the clearing message through hash calculation Data structure of clearing reply Mode Header Element Note Version Version number Channel Channel specification Requester Requester ID Timestamp Clearing process finish timestamp Business ID Clearing request ID Code Clearing return code Message Clearing return message Message 3 3 The Atomic Settlement The clearing chain supports multiple assets These assets can be transferred between different chains via IBAS\xef\xbc\x88Inter Blockchain Assets Settlement\xef\xbc\x89 protocols Based on the clearing chain the atomic settlement supports the settlement of asset transactions between different chains Using the atomic settlement DAEX wallet users can safely and directly transact different types of digital assets the underlying clearing chain perform all the necessary work such as encrypting and consensus reaching The atomic settlement on the clearing chain solves the current digital asset isolated islands situation making digital asset exchanges safe and convenient DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 16 \x0cThe internal network of IBAS will speed up the final confirmation speed without compromising integrity To guarantee the synchronization of transmission of digital asset packets among different blockchains the clearing request party needs to publish a proof on the clearing chain showing that it has issued a trustable IBAS request The clearing chain validates this proof and produce a send/request data packet with consistent block header This mechanism needs to insert a clearing chain based connector between different asset chains The connector confirms clearing operations by proving the existence of assets sent from related chains DAEX Wallet Clearing Blockchain Blockchain A Blockchain B IBASCommitTx From Status tID Operation IBASDeliveryTx From Status tID ChainID

LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 17 \x0c3 4 The DAEX Wallet The DAEX wallet is the client system of the clearing chain It is an unmanaged and distributed wallet that supports multiple types of cryptocurrencies It has the following characteristics \xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple part private key Uses three parts private key Needs any two parts to be used together to access assets in the wallet \xe2\x80\xa2 Private key can be restored A private key can be restored if a user loses his part of the private key \xe2\x80\xa2 Complete autonomy User has full autonomy over digital assets in his own wallet After a user goes through a KYC process and become registered on the clearing chain a unique public address on the clearing chain will be assigned to him His trading digital assets will be managed in this address He uses digital assets in this address to trade in all participating exchanges At the time this DAEX wallet is produced a three part private key also generated These three parts are kept at different places to provide a safe and recoverable mechanism for private key management \xe2\x80\xa2 User part Stored on user\xe2\x80\x99s mobile client It is not stored in a readable format and cannot be copied or exported It is usually kept in a cold wallet state It only finishes level one signature when user moves assets in the wallet \xe2\x80\xa2 Wallet

BTC\xe3\x80\x81ETH\xe3\x80\x81 QTUM and NEO We will issue corresponding ERC20 coins Received cryptocurrencies will be managed by the DAEX Foundation and supervised by exchanges collectively We will also make a comprehensive token repurchase program to avoid inflation and a phased lock in program on some assets issued during the initial offering phase The goal of these programs is to maintain a reasonable amount of tokens in the market DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 19 \x0c4 2 Usage of the Fund Fund and cryptocurrencies received from private and community donations will be managed by the DAEX Foundation in accordance with open and transparent principles The usage of fund can be traced and audited and will be periodically publicized to the community through multiple social media The fund will be used in but not limited to the following fields operation of the foundation development of product and technology community building reward for the clearing ecosystem team building global strategy development sales and marketing asset custodian and other specialized expenses 4 3 Value Factor In the DAEX ecosystem every asset owner can create digital assets based on DAEX tokens These digital assets should meet current legal requirements Such assets may be tangible assets or intangible assets such as commercial paper and customized assets With the development of the DAEX ecosystem the types and quantities of digital assets registered on the clearing chain will grow rapidly But people\xe2\x80\x99s ability to estimate the value of smart digital assets on the clearing chain is still at an early stage users and exchanges in the ecosystem need a tool to reach a consensus on the value of these assets so that these assets can be traded freely DAEX A CRYPTOCURRENCY CLEARING SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY Non Technical Whitepaper V0 9 8 20 \x0cTo help members of the ecosystem we introduce factors in the following five dimensions to evaluate user clearing ability and smart asset value \xe2\x80\xa2 Clearing Value Measure user\xe2\x80\x99s clearing contribution by calculating user\xe2\x80\x99s accumulated clearing contract numbers and total clearing quantities within the most recent sliding time window \xe2\x80\xa2 Capital Value Calculate user\xe2\x80\x99s total digital asset value in the clearing ecosystem based on factors like ranking market value circulating ratio and daily transaction volume \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction Value Calculate transaction values based on the scientific combination of periodic peaks and clearing time trade components trade channels and other factors \xe2\x80\xa2 Active Value Based on user\xe2\x80\x99s clearing

Reward Plan When the DAEX solution is in production those original ERC20 tokens will be repurchased and destroyed The clearing chain\xe2\x80\x99s new native tokens will be issued with a 1 to 1 ratio The remaining DAEX tokens will be distributed to reward virtual computing power\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to clearing booking The main clearing booking will be performed by the full nodes of the clearing chain which include DAEX public nodes exchange nodes and super nodes The difficulty level of all these nodes are the same but their respective numbers are controlled in proportion in order to protect individual user\xe2\x80\x99s income rights \xe2\x80\xa2 DAEX public nodes Public nodes deployed on the DAEX public chain They provide the infrastructure to maintain the stable operation of the clearing chain and also the virtual computing power for \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone clears\xe2\x80\x9d of DAEX wallet users lowering the resource cost of individual\xe2\x80\x99s participation and raising clearing efficiency at the same time \xe2\x80\xa2 Exchange nodes Nodes deployed at participating exchanges It is one source of exchange\xe2\x80\x99s income The number of nodes deployed at one exchange
