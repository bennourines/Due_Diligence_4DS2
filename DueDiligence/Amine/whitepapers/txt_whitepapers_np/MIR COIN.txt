is also focused around short term speculation MIR COIN started from the considerations on the alternatives of solving these problems and developing the blockchain ecosystem into a more sound and productive environment We need a system which enables exchange of equivalents between the cryptocurrency and the im/material values in the real economy for the cryptocurrency to become more than a means of speculation When using MIR COIN people can use all kinds of everyday services including the transportation services of taxis buses and chauffeurs they can buy goods and use services they need with everyday currency MIR PAY and cryptocurrency MIR COIN MIR payment system benefits both the affiliates and the users with its cheaper commissions Especially the users can get 5% payback for their purchases As MIR payment system brings more users together MIR COIN affiliates can benefit not only from the cheaper commissions but also by saving excessive marketing fees MIR COIN aims to form a win win economic ecosystem which benefits both its affiliates and users by constructing a MIR LAND ecosystem through MIR Payment Furthermore this will lead to the activation of everyday cryptocurrency usage and arouse awareness on the blockchain market which until now had been limited to speculation and contribute to the development of a more sound blockchain ecosystem Currently MIR COIN is constructing the MIR LAND starting with its partnership with about twenty companies It plans to expand the MIR LAND by developing the Payment system and securing more partners from 2019 INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND There are mainly three reasons of MIR COIN\xe2\x80\x99s coming into existence 1 The need for a new and upgraded crytocurrency MIR COIN adopts the Scrypt algorithm which is an improved version of SHA 256 algorithm used by early Bitcoin to maximize its mining efficiency However to overcome the problem of excessive use of electricity inherent in the Proof Of Work method and the limit of 51% Attack it changed into the Token based on an EOS Network which is an evolved version with Delegated Proof Of Stake in February 2019 Therefore it prepared a basis for processing large amount of transactions rapidly and opportunities for expanding its range of use 2 The need for a public multi electronic wallet suitable for cash transaction through cryptocurrency For cryptocurrency transactions not only a synchronized wallet but public multi electronic wallets designed for the users are needed For MIR PAYment system MIR LAND has constructed a system for cash transactions and service payments by providing a multi wallet by which the cryptocurrency MIR COIN and the everyday currency MIR PAY can be used \x0c01 Problems and Visions 3 The need for a platform which can expand MIR COIN and form the ecosystem We need bases and plans for increasing the value of cryptocurrencies and a platform which can operate by those bases and plans Only the cryptocurrency which is used shared and provokes constant demands can be given true livelihood We have studied the most optimized platform for these purposes to create MIR PLATFORM MIR land is a service for real economy and cash transactions on MIR Platform MIR Land provides cash transactions and service provision through various partners The Key to a Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are their Ecosystem and Customers Currency and financial market is the most developed field among the innovative blockchain technologies as cryptocurrencies including BitCoin are proved to be safe and convenient as a payment method and a value delivery system However we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that guarantees a cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s survival as it has a long way to go to be used as a type of an everyday currency For a Blockchain cryptocurrency to survive constantly it should embrace the mos proper markets and users As in the case of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s iPhone discovering a smartphone market and exploding its potentials by eager users the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency shall find a market with explosive potentials and customers to continue surviving Blockchains and cryptocurrencies also have to overcome some technical limits Even after discovering a market and platform we want it does not mean anything unless we reach a level of technology in need Therefore we need to think what kind of platforms can be explosive among cryptocurrencies to induce the customers\xe2\x80\x99 choices and supports We have created the MIR PLATFORM based on Blockcahin to solve these problems \x0c01 Problems and Visions INTRO MIR PLATFORM Distribution breaks down Boundaries and Aims for Diffusion Sharing and Bonding Previously we have confirmed that Blockchains are distribution networks Distribution is the opposite of concentration concentration makes boundaries against other concentrations Distribution breaks down boundaries and signifies diffusion Most business models have depended on centralized systems working within a certain boundary a traditional border composed of customers and providers Even businesses sharing common qualities have existed within the limits of a certain providers and competition only accentuated the boundaries Customers were passive and incomplete in those boundaries We have a philosophic ideal which argues that Blockchains are distribution diffusion sharing and bonding we believe that breaking down the boundaries between business models of various kinds and sharing a value network of correlation and integration fit the true ideal of Blockchain networks MIR LAND is the Value Network of Correlation and Integration We have tired to discover a platform which enables the breaking down and sharing of the value of correlation and integration in everyday life As a link by which various business models can be connected we\xe2\x80\x99re concentrating on building a MIR LAND ecosystem The Fittest Cryptocurrency for Applying Everyday Platform Point/mileage systems which provides bonus points for customers\xe2\x80\x99 purchases and service usage records are a representative marketing strategy for maintaining customer loyalty As e commerce is expanding due the development of Internet technologies using those points like cash is becoming more common and larger in scale Also those points have become the third type of currency following cash and credit cards as the range of use have expanded to include paying taxes and utility bills other than purchasing goods on/offline However points are limited in that they can only be used in affiliate companies and that their values are not preserved as they go extinct after a certain period time without using However these limits can ironically become the key to become a new type of everyday currency through the cryptocurrencies based on Blockchain technology \x0c02 MIR LAND 2 1 MIR COIN VISION The ecosystem of MIR COIN project consists of MIR COIN which can be exchanged with other cryptocurrencies through exchange markets and has a variable value according to the market situation a fixed currency of MIR PAY which can be exchanged with MIR COINs equivalently and MIR land in which users can purchase goods and services using MIR COINs and MIR PAY MIR COIN MIR COIN is a central currency which connects the cryptocurrency market and MIR LAND Users can exchange MIR COIN with the fixed currency of MIR PAY to purchase various goods and services from partners of MIR LAND MIR COIN is built as a cryptocurrency based on protocols providing a rapid processing and zero commissions to be the fittest for payment Previous MIR COIN based on POW mining users couldn\xe2\x80\x99t use MIR COINs when paying MIR LAND partners they could use MIR PAY only However the updated second MIR COIN based on EOS protocol introduces a partial system which enables immediate payment through MIR COIN to increase user convenience Users can chose MIR COIN or MIR PAY when using goods and services provided by partners of MIR LAND \x0c02 MIR LAND 2 2 MIR PAY PAYMENT MIR PAY can be exchanged equivalently with MIR COIN It is a currency used when purchasing goods and services from partners of MIR LAND Unlike MIR COIN which has a variable value it has a fixed value to be optimized for payment systems Users can exchange their variable MIR COIN with fixed MIR PAY to use in partners of MIR LAND It is more suitable for the users who prefers using the currency in their everyday lives to investments 2 3 MIR LAND MIR LAND is a hub which connects partners providing various goods and services withtusers of MIR COIN and MIR PAY It is a common name for MIR PLATFORM Each partner composes MIR LAND in which MIR COIN and MIR PAY can be used for payment Users can buy good and services with MIR COIN and MIR PAY in MIR LAND TOKEN ECONOMY Token Economy an Ecosystem of a Virtuous Circle When users pay for the goods and services they purchase in MIR LAND partners the partners pay 10% of the total amount paid to MIR LAND as commissions MIR LAND offers 5% of the 10% to the users as a payback Partners can get economic benefits as they pay the commission only when an income occurs and do not pay a separate marketing cost or commission Users benefit from the payback of 5% they spent ** Refer to the image on the back page \x0c02 MIR LAND NEW PARADIGM \xe2\x80\x98A New Paradigm for Platforms\xe2\x80\x99 Limits of Previous Business Models \xef\x83\xbc Provides points for its customers \xef\x83\xbc Fixed value according to the payment policies \xef\x83\xbc The points can be used only in partners of the point provider \xef\x83\xbc Limited usage range according to regions and nations \xef\x83\xbc The points can be used only before the expiration date \xef\x83\xbc Extinction due to business failures \xef\x83\xbc Low point accumulation rates \x0c02 MIR LAND A New Platform Based on Blockchain CONCEPT MIR LAND is defined as a one value network which applies the blockchain technology to the correlation and integration of various business models MIR LAND is a distribution network system which shares and diffuses the values and integrates various business models through electronic currencies previously used for certain businesses i e points (cash cyber money accumulated money coupons game tokens etc ) \xe2\x97\x8f Interlocking MIR COIN \xe2\x86\x94 (MIR PAY) \xe2\x86\x94 Previous POINTS of Partners = MIR LAND Electronic Wallets We secure trustworthiness and stability of providing points currently being handled by each business through MIR LAND and include transactions We aim to enhance bonding between various business models We can guarantee free exchange and transactions between companies and members even without the third arbitrator MIR LAND can reduce efforts and costs of Point publication and operation system currently managed by each business It does not demand any change in the software MIR LAND maintains the server client system between companies partners and members while providing a technological solution to become a member of a blockchain network This will protect the unique areas of each company while expanding its boundary and provide secure trustworthy transactions and data processing in the expanded area Customers(members) will overcome the limits of existing point systems and have a medium of exchange which can be used freely wherever and whenever This will provide them with a convenient safe and different payment option * Please refer to the image on the back page \x0c02 MIR LAND INSIDE The environment where MIR LAND would be applied can be divided into two areas of combining \xe2\x80\x98member(partner) company\xe2\x80\x99 and combining \xe2\x80\x98company company\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98user user \xe2\x80\x99 The first field is where a specificity is required by each business(service) it is run by hierarchical system The second area exists as a horizontal system MIR LAND acknowledges the specificities and present operating systems of both the areas while guaranteeing an effective and secure interlocking of services MIR LAND can integrate both these areas by utilizing MIR COIN It is an innovative platform system which can be used for marketing purposes In Request Response between MIR LAND network and the present systems of each business same encrypting method as the blockchain network will be applied Also a client solution based on a powerful API and a light website needed for each business will be provided We will provide a solution for the long pointed out problems of existing blockchains namely the transaction of large amount of data processing and delaying \x0c02 MIR LAND 2 4 MIR WALLET MIR Wallet is an electronic wallet where users can store and transmit MIR COIN and MIR PAY This is a special feature for MIR COIN and MIR PAY only to let users have a new user experience We have researched how to expand the electronic wallets\xe2\x80\x99 functions and concluded that the solution depends on how effectively and stably combining the existing systems run by each business that composes each level of blockchain networks By this solution MIR Wallet\xe2\x80\x99s encryption method can be applied to the interlocking with each company\xe2\x80\x99s network to avoid exterior attacks information leaking and information forgery Furthermore it can provide a powerful API suitable for each business\xe2\x80\x99s various demands \x0c02 MIR LAND 2 5 MIR PLATFORM OUTLINE LAND MIR PLATFORM is an integration of various systems based on MIR COIN and MIR LAND It comprises the ecosystem of MIR COIN MIR PLATFORM is a combination of application solutions and systems equipped with various client interfaces on the MIR Chain Network It is also the storage of MIR COIN It also includes MIR LAND which is an assembly of partners and their services with the electronic wallet MIR Wallet and the payment system MIR PAY These all have independent structures and features while being organically united On MIR PLATFORM users can buy MIR COIN freely whenever and wherever they want through the exchange market The secured MIR COIN can be encashed whenever through the market or changed to MIR PAY which is an integrated payment accumulation point MIR COIN changed into MIR PAY can be used as a payment method for purchasing goods and services provided by various partners of MIR LAND According to the paid amount accumulation of MIR PAY is possible This MIR PAY can be changed into MIR COIN in the future Users can change as much MIR COIN as they want for payment into MIR PAY MIR COIN has a variable value according to the price in the exchange market However MIR PAY has a fixed value MIR COIN is changed into MIR PAY with the variable market price of the MIR COIN exchange market\xe2\x80\x99s API The changed MIR PAY has a fixed value Users can evaluate and store their MIR COIN freely and change it into MIR PAY when necessary for convenient payment This payment process will be moduled as MIR PAY a convenient payment system through the optimized UI design MIR COIN multi electronic wallet with MIR PAY will be realized as an innovative transaction payment solution based on cryptocurrency On MIR PLATFORM users can overcome the limits of existing Points(limits of time space and invariable values) and have an everyday currency where they can pay whenever and wherever they want in various forms According to the fluctuation of MIR COIN they can respond actively and contribute to the expansion of the MIR COIN ecology \x0c02 MIR LAND MIR PLATFORM is a web/app application which interlocks and integrates various business models usinig MIR LAND It provides a unified UI/UX meeting the user needs and functions as an integrated solution for sharing and expanding network values MIR PLATFORM is an integrated solution designed for everyone to share various contents and business plans without any owners or monopolizer Various user contents and affiliated business plans are loaded on MIR LAND and provided to the users The users who use theses services can use MIR COIN by changing it into MIR PAY and coupons Later MIR LAND\xe2\x80\x99s MIr Pay and Coupon can be changed into MIR COIN again to be bought and sold in the global exchange markets In the global exchange market the MIR COIN\xe2\x80\x99s value can fluctuate therefore the users can recover the cost they have paid to a certain service by increasing market price of the coin Also MIR COIN will have a fixed value when changed into MIR PAY and coupons to secure the partner companies\xe2\x80\x99 service prices and form an ecosystem Even in the environment where large companies are predominant small and middle size companies can solve their problems of ambiguous market awareness sales and visions by becoming a MIR LAND partner MIR LAND\xe2\x80\x99s integrated solution embraces these companies to share customers between the new and existing partners to maximize their sales and advertisement effects Users can solve their problems of the inconveniences of cash and card usage by using the MIR LAND \x0c03 Smart Mobility VISION Plans for building a database based on data collected from the services developed and operated by Smart Mobility and combining the database with the AI movement system based on blockchain to provide a true form of smart mobility are in progress Mobility is closely connected to every aspect of human life Especially the representative keyword of mobility car is becoming the human life itself AI Automatic Driving cars are being developed along the line of mobility development and the tests are under way We have concluded that much bigdata are needed yet and that a certain company cannot collect enough data to develop a system by itself as mobility data differ greatly according to each nation\xe2\x80\x99s culture geography and laws A much bigger amount of bigdata should be collected Existing bigdata can be manipulated simply causing side effects and damages MIR LAND Smart Mobility was launched from the absence of this integrated system We are planning to run the following services to construct a complete system by combining the previous systems and the record managing system based on blockchain by building a database of the large amount of records in the field of mobility \x0c03 Smart Mobility 3 1 TAXI KING TAXI KING _BACK GROUND An unfamiliar concept of sharing a
