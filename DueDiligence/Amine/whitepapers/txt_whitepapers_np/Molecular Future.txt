excellent opportunity to disrupt the market As an early projects have seen tremendous success over the years in improving accountability connec project that successfully transitioned from traditional

decentralization People need a more just tivity speed transparency and privacy across just about every industry We have seen spe reum (smart contract platform) which within its own protocol has enabled many distributed applications and projects such as Matic Network (for DApps) or Augur (for predictions) to thrive From a technological perspective blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic of immutability o\xef\xac\x80ers users transparency and fairness giving assurance that users\xe2\x80\x99wealth is accurately account ed for With the increasing popularity of digital asset transactions the traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial industry is also beginning to play catch up and rapidly developing their infrastructure to lar Future \xef\xac\x81rmly believes that traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial markets that rely on centralized trading fair e\xef\xac\x83cient and transparent blockchain \xef\xac\x81nancial infrastructure to meet their \xef\xac\x81nancial service needs Molecule Future will be driven by its forward looking demand for the market and the professionalism of its \xef\xac\x81nancial services to create a comprehensive \xef\xac\x81nancial public chain that o\xef\xac\x80ers users a better alternative to the traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial service system they are used to today In order to meet the growing needs of users the Molecular Future \xef\xac\x81nancial public chain

the rapid development of blockchain technology today the global connection of multiple independent blockchains in the form of domains and operates with accounting and transaction system \xef\xac\x81nancial market is still dominating payments and transactions with daily transaction amounts hitting the tens of trillions of dollars There is still no real blockchain project in the \xef\xac\x81eld of \xef\xac\x81nance that can replicate the complex infrastructure that supports a system of this scale as such the barriers to entry into this industry remains incredibly high Since \xef\xac\x81nancial giants essentially monopolised this market they determine the way users can manage their money and they charge hefty fees every step along the way Fortunately the advent and development of blockchain technology has levelled the playing \xef\xac\x81eld for people Its ability to resolve the issues of trust and accountability has eliminated the need for third parties and allowed users to regain control of their assets This is is the classic Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm MOS is based on the inter the BFT consensus algorithm as the core driving force The main domain of MOS is de\xef\xac\x81ned as the Mega Domain the central management system that enables domains to communicate with each other As the world\ s \xef\xac\x81rst public blockchain

COMPLIANT DECENTRALIZED STOCK EXCHANGE One of the main reasons why blockchain technology is hailed as a revo lution that will change money business and the world is its innate property of accountability and security that arises from being a mass replicated dis tributed ledger To illustrate every block on the blockchain has to be veri\xef\xac\x81ed by nodes and every new block produced contains veri\xef\xac\x81ed data of the previ ous block a malicious hacker would not be able to simply change the data in a given block the hacker would have to alter the entire blockchain to change any data but that in itself is impossible as it will require too much computing power In the same way we can make exchanges less vulnerable to hacking by running the entire system on a blockchain This is called a distributed exchange The industry has seen dozens of hacks on centralised exchang es throughout the years but why do users still choose to trade on these exchanges despite its security drawbacks This is mostly because centralised exchange can provide greater liquidity since they can create deep orderbooks of limit orders Naturally exchanges that provide more liquidity will attract even more liquidity For a decentralised exchange to com pete with a centralised exchange it would need to support deep orderbooks with limit orders The issue is that many of the decentralised exchanges we see today requires traders to be online at the time of trade which is why you see many decentralised exchanges with shallow orderbooks Only a distributed exchange on a blockchain can allow users to submit orders and go o\xef\xac\x84ine the blockchain matches and completes the trade on behalf of the trader COMPLIANCE DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE \x0c\xe5\x88\x86\xe5\xad\x90\xe7\x99\xbd\xe7\x9a\xae\xe4\xb9\xa6 2 0 M O L E C U L A R 1 2 CUSTODY \xe2\x80\x92 OWNERSHIP OF OUR OWN ASSETS Current \xef\xac\x81nancial markets and stock exchanges are all centralised The main implication of a centralised exchange is that users\xe2\x80\x99assets and data are handled by a third party which acts as a custodian For example the New York Stock Exchange uses a third party custodian to manage the investors\xe2\x80\x99assets This has several drawbacks Firstly investors are not in control of their assets This means that their assets can be frozen or blocked without consent \xe2\x80\x92 this has happened on many occasions resulting in huge losses for the investors Secondly these assets being in the control of one central entity makes it an attractive target for hackers Over the years investors have lost money as well as exposed their private information because of hacks With the development of blockchain technology investors regain control of their own assets and cut out an unnecessary middleman that charges hefty fees and are vulnerable to hacks and mismanagement t This also presents an opportunity for the custodian market to be disrupt ed The top 400 global \xef\xac\x81nancial asset managers cumulatively manage a total of US$73 8 trillion in assets in 2019 Custodian fees typically fall between 0 1% to 0 15% of assets under management that is approximately US$70 0 to 100 0 billion in custodian fees paid to third parties every year a sizeable market that is very likely be made redundant when blockchain technology achieve mainstream adoption 1 3 03 / 32 FASTER CHEAPER AND MORE RELIABLE TRADING The \xef\xac\x81nance market is notoriously volatile where pro\xef\xac\x81ts or losses are determined in seconds and traders who gain early access to crucial information will have an edge over the less informed Over the years issues regarding trans parency have come into question as cases of information asymmetry emerge A report from the Wall Street Journal had found that professional money man agers who are using the paid version of Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval system (EDGAR) have been able to get access to market moving documents before free users These delays in information distribution ranged from no delay to lasting more than a minute giving traders some extra time to act on the news before others An obvious advantage of blockchain technology especially in the \xef\xac\x81eld of \xef\xac\x81nance is the transparency it guarantees For one discounting other variables such as internet speed any information on the blockchain will be avail able for interested parties to view at the same time with a timestamp on the block as proof of when it was made available This innovation will undoubtedly change the way the \xef\xac\x81nancial system disseminates information The use of blockchain on the stock market extends beyond just improved information symmetry it can also signi\xef\xac\x81cantly decrease the counter party risk in trading Currently stock markets use what is known as the Delivery versus Payment (DVP) system The DVP is a securities industry settlement method that guarantees the transfer of securities only happens after payment has been made The bonds and securities market we are familiar with today employs the DVP method using custodians The system requires these third \x0c\xe5\x88\x86\xe5\xad\x90\xe7\x99\xbd\xe7\x9a\xae\xe4\xb9\xa6 2 0 M O L E C U L A R parties primarily because these systems are not linked automatically The transfer of the asset takes place in a di\xef\xac\x80erent system from the payment system as such there exists counter party risk due to defaults or frauds Blockchain however solves this problem amicably The idea being that using smart contracts sellers can deposit an asset onto the system and the buyer will deposit the payment amount once it has been shown that the terms and conditions are met the smart contract will automatically execute the trade without the risk of any party defaulting Using this system exchanges will be able to cut down what usually takes three days for trades to settle to mere minutes or even seconds This is especially important in complex derivatives markets where market conditions can change drastically before a trade is settled This could result in potential costs savings of between 50% to 80% for processing and bookkeeping However the issue is that this only works when both the assets and the payment currency operate on the same network (e g Ethereum) The reality is that most chains do not have cross chain capabilities This is where Molecular Future has an advantage over other public chains Molecular Future\xe2\x80\x99s MOS system fully supports cross chain capabilities and is deliberately built in a way that allows new blockchains to integrate into the system in the future This means that new forms of chains can be included to be compatible with the MOS bringing greater liquidity for users of the Molecular Future\xe2\x80\x99s plat form Users can also also choose from the many tribes on the network depending on the quality of their service such as user experience settlement speed and transaction costs Tribes on the other hand will compete to pro vide the best service This will ultimately result in lower transaction settlement and transfer fees for users 1 4 04 / 31 MARKET VALUE COMPARISON Since the advent of bitcoin in 2009 the cryptocurrency market has seen rapid growth over the years Although compared with the traditional stock and securities market that has decades of development history the crypto currency market is still in the early stages of development According to Forbes as of September 2019 the market value of the NYSE alone has reached 28 5 trillion USD while the entire cryptocurrency market is only valued at about 200 billion US dollars MARKET VALUE OF TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL MARKET AND CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET \x0c\xe5\x88\x86\xe5\xad\x90\xe7\x99\xbd\xe7\x9a\xae\xe4\xb9\xa6 2 0 M O L E C U L A R Both the cryptocurrency market and the stock securities trading market have primary and secondary markets that share similar func 05 / 32 However factors such as a small market size insu\xef\xac\x83cient trading tions In the secondary market the cryptocurrency market has various depth few types of trading pairs and restricted \xef\xac\x81at conversion ave traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial market on the other hand has a large number of di\xef\xac\x83cult to increase liquidity for the market types of centralized and decentralized digital currency exchanges The order driven stock exchanges The cryptocurrency market has vanilla over the counter (OTC) and the traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial market has bro kered OTC In recent years the cryptocurrency market has also been able to develop contract trading and pledged mining similar to derivatives and \xef\xac\x81xed income that traditional markets o\xef\xac\x80er Although there are many similarities the traditional \xef\xac\x81nan cial market has developed substantially for over 100 years since its inception The cryptocurrency market however had only been established a little more than 10 years ago There of course is a lot of potential for the industry but given the limited amount of exposure it gets and the lack of capital injection to develop its infrastructure the markets remain immature The biggest issue that arose from the mar ket\xe2\x80\x99s immaturity is the lack of liquidity Good liquidity is essential for the development of cryptocurrencies For cryptocurrency traders markets that are liquid are preferred because it means they can convert between assets and cash quickly enabling them to adjust to any market changes e\xef\xac\x80ectively Furthermore high liquidity attracts even more liquidity nues has made trading unattractive for many making it even more Take the types of assets and trading pairs available for example In the traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial market the NYSE alone has more than 2 800 companies\ securities listed for trade In contrast the top exchanges in the cryptocurrency market such as Binance Huobi and OKEx have between 160 230 cryptocurrency projects and about 570 trading pairs available to trade Both the types of assets and trading pairs available for trade cannot be compared to that of the traditional market To take advantage of this opportunity Molecule Future will launch a cryptocurrency liquidity management system that provides users with comprehensive liquidity

deposits hedge funds and quantitative funds Users can use the three major currencies BTC ETH and USDT to invest in these funds One of the advantages of MOF Asset Management is the ability to tailor investment plans based on the needs of users MOF Asset Management categorises products in a modular and meticulous manner Whether an investor is conservative or aggressive he or she can \xef\xac\x82exibly choose from a variety of strategies and invest using di\xef\xac\x80erent cryptocurrencies In a general sense MOF Asset Management can be seen as a\xe2\x80\x9ccryptocurrency asset management supermarket\xe2\x80\x9d In order to serve users to the greatest extent Molecule Future has launched nine hedge funds and quantitative funds all which have achieved positive returns Since June 2018 six of the hedge funds have completed settlement by the \xef\xac\x81rst half of 2019 The lock up period of these six hedge funds is 3 months and the average annualized return is close to 50%

M O L E C U L A R 2 2 CRYPTOCURRENCY FINANCING MOF LENDING MOF Lending is another major function available in the Molecular Future application The main aim of MOF Lending is to provide a loan service that allows users to obtain loans with minimal requirements and favourable terms and conditions At present MOF Lending supports lending of mainstream The cryptocurrency market 09 / 32 is renowned for its volatility and while that brings great opportunities investments are also riskier MOF Lending hopes to help users control risk as such MOF cur rently only o\xef\xac\x80ers its services to individual cryptocurrency holders and not cryptocurrencies such as BTC ETH and MOF \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions In order to improve the user experience Molecular Future will also the \xef\xac\x81nancial attributes of cryptocurrencies Long term \xef\xac\x81nancial services such their lending or borrowing requests The system will help to match these The booming blockchain industry has enabled a deeper exploration of as lending \xef\xac\x81xed deposits and custody have gradually replaced short term speculation of the market MOF Lending intends to build a lending system that enables cryptocurrency holders who do not wish to sell their cryptocurrencies an avenue to borrow by mortgaging their digital assets Len d er ey on tm t e G u ins ho w i t n g co i l sel Mortager y cal odi i r r pe a go y g a t r Rep o mo t n Loa implement a Consumer to Consumer (C2C) segment where users can post requests providing users with OTC like functions Users will also be able to directly use bank cards Alipay or WeChat payment to conduct transactions In order to better ensure the security of user assets and ensure the smooth execution of loans Molecular Future will introduce a liquidation mechanism in the lending segment in the future For example after depositing BTC as collaterals the user will receive a loan equivalent to 70% of total amount of collaterals Interests will be settled on a daily basis Through the use of a margin formula which will be described in detail later a liquidation ratio is set If the price of Bitcoin falls below a certain level the system will automatically liquidate the loan Users can choose to maintain the loan by depositing more collaterals until a safe level is reached If the user chooses to close its position or if there is an automatic liquidation the loan will be settled directly according to the current bitcoin price MORTGAGES AND LOANS INTRODUCE \x0c\xe5\x88\x86\xe5\xad\x90\xe7\x99\xbd\xe7\x9a\xae\xe4\xb9\xa6 2 0 M O L E C U L A R The lending process is as follows 1 2 3 4 5 6 Step 1 The holder (borrower) initiates a loan application on the lending platform Step 2 The borrower transfers the digital currency to the wallet address speci\xef\xac\x81ed by the platform Step 3 Loan amount is made available to borrower Step 4 If the value of the collaterals falls below a certain level (risky) the platform will require the borrower to increase the amount of collaterals If no action is taken and the value of the collaterals falls to the liqudation level the platform will automatically liquidate the loan Step 5 If no liquidation occurs the borrower must return the principal and any incurred interests at the end of the loan term t Step 6 After the platform receives the principal and interests it will unlock the collaterals to the borrower A fee of 0 3% will also be incurred as a handling fee At this point the mortgage loan process ends The margin calculation formula is as follows c_a^p = pr*ci c_1^p c_a^p value of collateral that needs to be added to remain at a safe level pr is the mortgage ratio (not less than 150%) ci Value of the loan (70% of the value of the collateralised cryptocurrencies) c_1^p Current value of collateralised cryptocurrencies Note This formula is the basic formula for margin calculation The actual calcula tion will consider more variables so it may be more complicated but the core con tent is unchanged 10 / 31 Case Show\xef\xbc\x9a User A deposits 10 BTC on the lending platform as collaterals and chooses to borrow for 3 months At this time the current price of BTC is $ 10 000 User A can obtain a loan of 10 * 10 000 * 70% = 70 000 USD from the platform If the price of BTC rises to US$15 000 after 3 months then the total value of BTC of User A in the currency bet will be US$150 000 User A can choose to return the borrowed US$70 000 to the platform and pay the corresponding collection fee to withdraw the 10 BTC that is now valued at US$150 000 If within 3 months the price of BTC drops to USD 9 000 which is below the liquidation level User A will need increase the collaterals to ensure that the loan is not liquidated Currently the actual mortgage rate of user A\ s mortgage becomes (9 000 * 10) / (10 * 10 000 * 70%) \xe2\x89\x88129% which is lower than the healthy mortgage rate of 150% so the amount of margin that the user needs to pay is 150% * 10 * 10 000 * 70% 9 000 * 10 = 15 000 USD \x0c\xe5\x88\x86\xe5\xad\x90\xe7\x99\xbd\xe7\x9a\xae\xe4\xb9\xa6 2 0 M O L E C U L A R In order to increase the liquidity of the platform 11 / 32 MOF Lending is a more convenient and safe way to e\xef\xac\x80ectively solve and to provide users with more options the platform the problem of short term capital needs for users It also provides a vari user chooses to use a non mainstream cryptocurrency gage escrow method of the cryptocurrencies is transparent users can see will support more currency types in the future If the to obtain a mortgage loan on the lending platform must use MOF tokens as collaterals The MOF collateral ratio is determined based on the market liquidity of the cryptocurrency The lower the liquidity of the currency in the market the more MOFs need to be provided by the borrower For individual holders when there is a strong upward or downward trend in the price of digital currencies users can hedge their risk through loans For users

industry generally chooses Black Scholes pric ing model binary tree pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing The pricing model adopted by the Molecular Future\xe2\x80\x99s quantitative team takes into account the two main models of Black Scholes pricing model and binary tree pricing model Binary tree pricing model Binary tree option pricing model and Black Scholes option pricing model are complementary methods The binary tree option pricing model is based on a basic assumption that is within a given time interval the price movement of the security has two possible directions up or down Although this assumption is very simple since a given time period can be subdivided into smaller time units the model is suitable for processing more complex options However the above pricing model is mainly applicable to the traditional stock and securities markets Therefore Molecular Future will also fully con sider pricing models that can be applied to the cryptocurrency market in the future HackerNoon a well known blockchain rating and data consulting agency pointed out [4] that the three stage price derivation modi\xef\xac\x81ed three stage price derivation and Silicon Methodology are important in obtaining the fair value of cryptocurrencies MOLECULAR 15 / 32 Black Scholes Pricing Model The Black Scholes model is based on the principle of no arbitrage which is simply that there is no risk free arbitrage opportunity in the market if any two assets have equal cash \xef\xac\x82ows at any time in the future their current prices must be equal

function for normally distribut ed variables Three stage derivation Three stage derivation is the most basic method for cryptocurrencies to obtain fair value This derivation method \xef\xac\x81rst calculates the weighted average price of bitcoin (weighted by transaction volume) through the price of all bitcoin / \xef\xac\x81at transaction pairs Secondly it lists the cryptocurrency pairs involving Bitcoin or \xef\xac\x81at Using the weighted average price of bitcoin calculat ed in the \xef\xac\x81rst step we can further derive the weighted average price of other listed cryptocurrencies (weighted by the transaction volume) Finally we can calculate the price of other cryptocurrencies that do not have a USD value For cryptocurrencies the cryptocurrency USD price calculated in the previous step is used as the reference price to calculate the USD prices of these crypto assets \x0c\xe5\x88\x86\xe5\xad\x90\xe7\x99\xbd\xe7\x9a\xae\xe4\xb9\xa6 2 0 M O L E C U L A R

average LTC USD price using three sets of trading pairs and then apply the LTC found in step 2 The USD price (or the latest calculated LTC price) is incorporated into the LTC / ETH equation and the ETH USD price and new transaction volume of the LTC pair are obtained 4 Step 4 Calculate the price of EOS 5 Step 5 Recalculate ETH and LTC prices In the revised three stage derivation process more niche transaction pairs were covered and the prices of each cryptocurrency were repeatedly calculated in the process which should help reduce bias and increase reliability

for each trading platform After selecting a trading platform the calculation should start with the best trading pair in the platform that is those trading pairs that require the least transaction procedures and the largest trading volume For a cryptocurrency trading platform that has not opened \xef\xac\x81at currency trading you can anchor all the remaining cryptocurrencies to a mainstream cryptocurrency (such as BTC) and then calculate the total transaction volume of all cryptocurrencies in the trading platform and then calculate the weighted average price of all cryptocurrencies in the market (weighted by transaction volume) 18 / 32 CASE SHOW Assume that there are the following trading pairs in a cryptocurrency trading platform called Exchange A XYZ/BTC=\xcf\x811 XYZ/ETH=

independent blockchains called domains Molecular Future is essentially a system of many independent blockchains running domains As anyone can connect a new domain to the MOS the system allows for forward compatibility when there are new blockchain innovations together they are called domains The domains are run based on the Octahe dron Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) an in house modi\xef\xac\x81cation of the PBFT algorithm which provides an e\xef\xac\x83cient and secure consensus engine The main domain on Molecular Future is the Mega Operating System (MOS) MOS is a public chain which serves as Molecular Future\xe2\x80\x99s multi chain management system much like a master server that runs on a simple gover nance mechanism that allows new domains as long as they are compatible to connect to MOS for integration and upgrades The domains communicate with each other via inter chain transmission (ICT) protocol Since all token transfers within each domain will be processed through the MOS the MOS keeps track of the total amount of tokens held by each domain This enables tokens to be transferred from one domain to another quickly without having to worry about liquidity between domains This mechanism also makes the system more secure as it isolates each domain from the failures of other 3 2 TRIBES The main di\xef\xac\x80erence between the Octahedron PBFT and classical BFT is that instead of having the same weight for each node in the case of the BFT Octahedron PBFT nodes have voting power which are determined at genesis

super tribes that will represent them Voting requires the use of MOF super tribe is responsible for community governance and on chain maintenance They have rights to mine blocks and vote on governance proposals 3 2 2 Super tribe elections and replacement In order to ensure fairness the super tribe election is an on chain voting process where MOF holders\xe2\x80\x99s votes will be recorded on the blockchain In order to ensure the stability of the community and to avoid the excessive con centration of power in certain super tribes who are allies the super tribe election is set to automatically occur every 100 000 blocks All users with MOF can vote through smart contracts Each MOF is equiva lent to 20 votes Users can vote for 0 20 candidate sets according to their own 3 2 1 Super tribes In the MOS system super tribes play a signi\xef\xac\x81cant role in the community governance The MOS consists of 101 super tribes These super tribes are pri marily involved in voting as part of community governance These super tribes can be replaced but the number of super tribes allowed will always be \xef\xac\x81xed at 101 needs but each MOF can only cast 1 vote for a maximum of 1 candidate at a time After each super tribe election is completed the newly appointed super tribes must pay no less than 300 000 MOF as a performance bond and the deposit is locked to the super tribes\xe2\x80\x99contract address The security deposit is locked after the election is successful and can only be withdrawn after exiting they retire from being a super tribe The 300 000 MOF is the

Super tribes and each tribe is identi\xef\xac\x81ed by their public key Tribes will attempt to come to guarantee amount In the future with the progress of community autono Super tribes are an important part of MOS community architecture and organizational governance The most important obligation of the super tribe is to produce blocks (that is package transactions) on behalf of MOF holders provide computing resources and ensure the smooth operation of the net work In order to ensure that the super tribe can properly ful\xef\xac\x81ll the obliga tions of maintaining the governance on the chain all super tribes must have certain technical capabilities hardware equipment and the ability to operate and maintain the blockchain The super tribe is responsible for participating in the on chain governance of MOS It can create proposals for community governance (such as MOS parameter changes MOF transfer fee rates etc ) and vote In order to prevent malicious proposals super tribes must pay a minimum of 100 MOF when launching a proposal Once a proposal is released the proposal fee is automatically transferred to the chain and destroyed A proposal is considered approved if and only if it meets the following con ditions \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 No less than 2/3 (ie 68 and above) of super tribes participate in voting No less than two thirds of the super tribes voted in favor of the proposal CONSENSUST The Octahedron protocol requires a \xef\xac\x81xed known set of tribes to operate consensus on one block at a time Voting for consensus on a block proceeds in tranches Each tranche has a tranche leader or chief who leads a block In stages the tribes will vote on whether to accept the proposed block or move on to the next The chief for a tranche is chosen from an ordered list of tribes based on their voting power Octahedron\xe2\x80\x99s security derives from its use of optimal Byzantine fault tol erance via super majority (>2/3) voting and a locking mechanism Together they ensure that \xe2\x89\xa51/3 voting power must be Byzantine to cause a violation of safety where more than two values are committed The protocol can identify any set of tribes that attempts to violate safety protocols including voting for con\xef\xac\x82icting blocks and broadcasting unjusti\xef\xac\x81ed votes MOLECULAR \x0c\xe5\x88\x86\xe5\xad\x90\xe7\x99\xbd\xe7\x9a\xae\xe4\xb9\xa6 2 0 M O L E C U L A R 32 / 32 Since no non synchronous BFT algorithms can come to consensus when more than 1/3 of votes are malicious yet a fork assumes that malicious attack has succeeded the coordination of a fork cannot be done automatically via a protocol Hence the fork will only proceed when users have come to an agreement via a social consensus perhaps via a phone app voting mechanism In unusual cases where 2/3 of votes are malicious these malicious actors can commit arbitrary invalid states This is the same for any BFT consensus system 3 4 PREVENTING ATTACKS Since having more than 1/3 of voting power can in\xef\xac\x82uence a block mali cious actors can stop the blockchain by going o\xef\xac\x84ine or by not broadcasting their votes These malicious actors can also censor speci\xef\xac\x81c transactions by rejecting blocks that include these transactions This would cause a signi\xef\xac\x81cant portion of block proposals to be rejected thus slowing down the rate at Invalid states are more di\xef\xac\x83cult to detect because they require non validating peers to verify blocks which means that they will have to keep a local copy of the state and execute each transaction again to compute the state root independently for themselves Similar to forking and censorship attacks when the invalid state is detected the only solution is to come to a manual decision based on social consensus As a means of deterrence domains of Octahedron blockchain must go through Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures malicious attackers can be identi\xef\xac\x81ed and brought to the law the system by slowing down the speed at which they broadcast votes 3 5 CROSS CHAIN CAPABILITIES dinate externally to fork the chain and decide the initial subset of domains cies These domains whose primary role is to connect two domains together is they forgo any collaterals on all other forks End users will then be prompted ing System and the domains both must keep up with the latest blocks of the which blocks commit to the blockchain They can also signi\xef\xac\x81cantly slow down In the case that these attacks succeed a subset of the domains must coor with their signatures Domains must bear in mind that if they decide to fork to decide on whether to support the fork If more than half of the original domains vote in support the fork will proceed A specialised domain can act as a bridge between two or more cryptocurren called a\xe2\x80\x9cbridge\xe2\x80\x9d A bridge is similar to the relationship between the Mega Operatother in order to verify proofs that tokens have moved
