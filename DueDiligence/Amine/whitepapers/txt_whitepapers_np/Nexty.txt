without cash anywhere at any time and without any transaction fees There are lot of growing cryptocurrencies that help to build such payment method but none of them have completed so far With foresee as a mean of future payment Nexty shall support businesses of all sizes and scopes to overcome barriers of trading to make the future possible Nexty is having three deciding factors Fast Instant

3 \x0c1 Businesses & individuals have not found a really convenient payment method It is easy to see that although information technology is booming the banking system is cumbersome and it is difficult to put the change into practice quickly The difficulty is faced especially with reference to international payment In addition to that the payment time is very long from 1 to 3 days for the form of transfer Usage of payment tools such as credit card and online payment system face a big barrier in the form of transaction fees and the security of those systems Cryptocurrency has been drawing a lot of attention recently although it is \xe2\x80\x98evaluated\xe2\x80\x99 to be the solution of the above backlog but has not really solved these problems Some Cryptocurrencies has reduced international settlement time to near instantaneous threshold but soon after it 4 \x0cbecame slow when the number of users increased drastically In addition payment fees are relatively high even some types have higher costs using old payment methods such as online credit card online payment system etc Average Transaction Time in 2017 (blockchain info) Average Transaction Value in 2017 (bitinfocharts com) 5 \x0cAverage Transaction Fees in 2017 (bitinfocharts com) 2 Nexty has a vision Prospective transactions Leica is an intern She is new in the city carrying a small luggage and her phone She has been in contact with her landlord Jimmy to discuss sub renting his studio apartment After receiving the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s location and pictures she transferred the deposit to Jimmy\xe2\x80\x99s Nexty account On handover day they set up items of the existing digital contract established by Nexty\xe2\x80\x99s partners To accept the contract and confirm the payment on a period of six months Nexty just 6 \x0cneeds to scan the QR code on Jimmy\xe2\x80\x99s phone After that all other steps will be performed automatically All daily payment activities of Leica are that simple From food to fashion or other expenses can be performed through Nexty\xe2\x80\x99s account by easily scanning the QR code Jimmy has his own business importing large amount of lamb from other countries to sell in domestic market Every time performing an international transfer to a business partner abroad it requires a lot of time with high transaction fees However with the help of Nexty\xe2\x80\x99s technology Jimmy does it quickly by the guarantee of partners belonging to the ecosystem of Nexty in terms of creating and following LC The Contract\xe2\x80\x99s articles are intelligently formatted under the electronic form 7 \x0cThis can be well reflected by this new business transaction stream Jimmy recently signed a contract with Lambrovider a lamb exporter in New Zealand The disbursement is guaranteed and payments are fully made at each point the action is compliant with the contract Lambrovider has a bunch of orders this year With its limited cash available on account they are not able to gather enough lamb meat to export They have worked with ecoBank one of the partners in the Ecosystem of Nexty Since ecoBank could verify that the contract with Jimmy is reliable and they are able to reimburse the payment the loan was quickly approved Everything needed was the information of digital contract between Lambrovider and Jimmy For online and traditional payment transactions ecoBank and Nexty have collaborated and issued MasterCard which allows 8 \x0ccustomers to pay traditional credit card merchant by swiping cards or through apps such as Apple Pay Google Tez and Samsung Pay So why can Nexty work together with partners to build a convenient payment for the future Shortly after the ICO succeeded Nexty would build a very active service network through its connection to Nexty s system Among them there are numerous of start up businesses using Nexty s own token system to call for capital because they can take advantage of the existing system with the superior features that Nexty has 5 important elements of a payment system of the future \xe2\x80\xa2 Fast \xe2\x80\xa2 Low fees \xe2\x80\xa2 Commitment to privacy & confidentiality \xe2\x80\xa2 Simple to use 9 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Low volatility 3 The rise of Fintech & what Nexty will do 3 1 The rise of Fintech Fintech is a term being mentioned repeatedly in the usage of information technology and how it is used in the financial sector As Forbes magazine mentioned in their recent article there is a rise of Fintech for three reasons There is a strategic contradiction between technology and finance Market realities encourage short term thinking Incumbents in the market are powerful and resistant to change However that resurgence requires a currency platform with low transaction time and low transfer costs This can be met with the Duo Cryptocurrency Confirmation System invented by Nexty With the Duo Cryptocurrency Confirmation System 10 \x0call transactions will be transferred in near instant (only delayed due to Internet connection) at no cost 3 2 Dual Cryptocurrency Confirmation System (DCCS) Duo Cryptocurrency Confirmation System includes two types of Cryptocurrency operating in parallel The former called NTY is the main cryptocurrency for using in daily transactions The latter called NTF is for transaction confirmation system Transaction confirmation system is built on a peer to peer network with specific criteria to meet operational requirements The breakthrough here is that instead of charging per transaction those who are the holders of the second type of cryptocurrency will be rewarded with a small amount of cryptocurrency at the minor rate at the end of sealing round which is about 30 minute to 360 minute long This will allow the transaction fees to be zero while still 11 \x0cguaranteeing the benefits to the persons who contribute to transaction confirmation system This bonus is generated by the POF algorithm (described below) The method of operation is as follows Appendix NTY Code name of Nexty Coin pNTY Package equivalent to 10 000 NTY NTF Nexty Foundation Coin DCCS Dual Cryptocurrency Confirmation System PoF Proof of Foundation the new consensus algorithm was invented for transaction confirmation system The proportion of generated amounts is based on the PoF algorithm to pay for the machinery and personnel operating the transaction confirmation system helping to ensure that 12 \x0cthe two features of the cryptocurrency are superior for properly operating However NTF holders do not have the right to vote for NTY currency decisions in the future such as block size upgrades mining speeds transaction confirmation The rights will belong to NTY holders with fair votes The Appearance of NTF \xe2\x80\x93 Nexty Foundation For only the first 10 billion of NTY joining Smart Staking program within 3 months 10 000 NTY in the wallet will have one NTF generated automatically At the end of 3 month Smart Staking when NTY s total current supply is up to 100 billion the NTF (which had automatically calculated before) will be available in the market Since only the first 10 billion NTY can generate NTF the amount of NTF is limited to 10 million 13 \x0cOnly NTF holders will be given the right to build mining and confirmation machine for NTY There will be a total of 40 billion NTY generated by POW and after that time the machine system will only be responsible for transaction confirmation At present there are many investors mining with great power on the former coin systems such as BTC ETH but more and more difficult to mine and cause the value of the machine fell Thus NTF will help to make use of these miners through leasing or acquisition and that is fully within reach What will be another source of income for NTF holders besides mining We have a new concept PoF (Proof of Foundation) Every month only holders with NTF will receive NTY by that algorithm divided by the percentage of them their amount of NTF over 10 million NTF The NTY generated by the POF algorithm is calculated as follows 14 \x0cMonth NTY from POF Less than 12 months 0 5%/month 12 23 0 4%/month 24 35 0 3%/month 36 47 0 2%/month 48 months onwards 0 1%/month Do not worry about the decrease in NTY rates for two reasons a Total NTY increases (by PoF) b NTY values increase due to its popularity community acceptance and ecosystem expansion Specifications Nexty Specifications Coin name Nexty Abbreviation NTY Algorithm PoF Presale Date December 12 2017 15 \x0cICO Date December 19 2017 Total

Block spacing in 2 second Nexty platform had successfully reached the hard cap with 9 460 000 pNTY were distributed All the pNTY left were added into Smart Staking Pool Thus initial amount for pool for smart staking is 5 540 000 pNTY 16 \x0cThere will be at least 220 000 000 000 NTY in total which ensures that there will not too many confusing zero digits after the decimal point in daily transaction In the long run the target price will reach about 1 USD for each NTY in next 5 years then going to be stable This target will be achieved thanks to algorithm of Price Stabilization System This system is controlled by a group of expert economists at the first year then going to be managed under an automated and decentralized system Nexty Foundation Specifications Coin name Nexty

joining Smart Staking only those who own 10 000 000 pNTYs will initially be granted NTF 10 000 000 without increasing NTF coin will be very rare because the quantity is not much there are many advantages in the future In addition only NTF holders are allowed to equip mining and transaction confirmation machines NTF holders enjoy a high monthly income through the operation of transaction
