Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Cloud \xc2\xa0Overview \xc2\xa0 Acute Angle Cloud is a globally distributed IaaS platform It is designed to be a globally distributed cloud computing service with a basic layer platform based on the New PC Network (distributed hardware terminals) the Acute Angle Chain and CAN (Content Addressable Network) Its construction will be achieved though the Acute Angle Chain Acute Angle Cloud 1 0 and Acute Angle Cloud 2 0 1 1 Figure Overview of Acute Angle Cloud History \xc2\xa0of \xc2\xa0the \xc2\xa0Internet \xc2\xa0 On October 29 1969 the first node of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) was connected to the second node of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) on the ARPANET marking the inception of the Internet era Looking back at the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s history from the very beginning to its current high speed development we can divide it roughly into three stages Web1 0 Internet Web2 0 mobile Internet and Web3 0 interplanetary Internet The Web1 0 Internet began in the 1990s when the Internet was initially opened to the public At that point the technology needed for uploading information was incredibly expensive and had to be operated by professionals Therefore a large amount of online information was released and consumed by media firms commercial institutions schools and authorities A vast reduction in cost and impressive increase in technological advancement has led to our current reality almost every Internet user can upload information in various forms of content Such a change has introduced the concept of Web2 0 mobile Internet The Web2 0 mobile Internet is mainly manifested by users\ participation or social interaction the blog space community websites peer to peer tools etc While developing the Web2 0 the founder of the world wide web network Tim Berners Lee (along with other computer scientists) began to conceptualize Web3 0 interplanetary Internet The original intention of Web3 0 interplanetary Internet was to facilitate communication using devices as terminals rather than to communicate and aggregate information on the Internet thus achieving decentralization Due to the development of the Internet and further progress in telecommunication people can talk to almost anyone from anywhere in the world \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Blockchain \xc2\xa0A \xc2\xa0New \xc2\xa0Trend \xc2\xa0 On October 31st 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cA Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System\xe2\x80\x9d declaring the inception of the value transmission network Bitcoin has many creditable designs such as data backup relative anonymity of those involved and most importantly a new system that eradicated the need for trusted third parties However its own transaction performance and Proof of Work (POW) consensus mechanism gradually revealed some problems The underlying technology of Bitcoin is known as the blockchain In recent years people have innovated mainly concerning transaction performance consensus algorithms and safe anonymity of the blockchain such as promotion of transaction performance by graphene and the lightning network enrichment and improvement of consensus algorithm by Proof of Stake (POS) Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) improvement of transaction safety by Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) and mixing As a promising blockchain ecosystem Acute Angle Cloud perfectly combines the strengths of Ethereum and BitShares and solves inherent defects of the existing blockchain system Acute Angle Cloud is expected to gradually form a blockchain economy promote industrial efficiency and boost efficient and synergetic development of society It plans to accomplish this by the setup of a basic platform exploitation of various products and through the development and iteration of commercialized and implemented projects Acute Angle Cloud defines a new blockchain economy Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Cloud \xc2\xa0Relevance \xc2\xa0 1 \xc2\xa0 Prevention of resource waste Through virtual machines the Acute Angle Cloud solves the issue of unused hard disk and CPU resources in the personal computer (PC) It can aggregate and allocate the users\ idle hard disk and CPU resources with full cyclic use forming an integrated application in a chain ecosystem 2 \xc2\xa0 Storage potential Through distributed storage technology the issue of storage waste is solved Data can be automatically re distributed enhancing the utilization rate of storage space and connecting all the computing devices with the same file system The principle behind it is to replace address based content with domain name content In other words users can find content saved in a location instead of an address and the hash of the content is verified instead of the identity of the content creator It will enable webpage browsing to be faster safer and more robust 3 \xc2\xa0 Cost Reduction Through blockchain technology cloud computing and CAN technology the Acute Angle Cloud creates a distributed IaaS platform It dramatically cuts the high operational and maintenance costs of traditional centralized server rooms and reasonably utilizes idle resources and shares the returns with its users Strengths low user cost globalization durable storage and high stability Acute Angle Cloud can be used as \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 A virtual machine\xe2\x80\x99s root file system \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 A server \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 A database \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 A (cryptographic) communication platform \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 Any type of CDN \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 A long lasting Web Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Cloud \xc2\xa0Development \xc2\xa0plan \xc2\xa0 Centralized \xc2\xa0Cloud \xc2\xa0Computing \xc2\xa0Service \xc2\xa0Model \xc2\xa0Overview \xc2\xa0 The structure of the cloud system has gained popularity in recent years and it has unique advantages compared with conventional and locally deployed IT modes The cloud service has won the favor of enterprises because of its many benefits such as round the clock supported access resource sharing self service instant use on demand pay as you go and can meet enterprises\ needs of use in a flexible way so as to reduce the cost of use As estimated by Gartner an international research and advisory body the global public cloud services market has massive scalability reaching US$209 2 billion in 2016 The figure is expected to hit US$246 8 billion in 2017 and exceed US$383 3 billion in 2020 4 1\xef\xbc\x9aGlobal Cloud Service Market Scale Even though cloud computing models are constantly evolving the industry is currently divided into three major categories IaaS PaaS and SaaS The infrastructure is the first tier the platform is the second tier and software is the third tier namely \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 PaaS (Platform as a Service) \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 SaaS (Software as a Service) With the progression of the era we live in cloud computing is no longer an option but a requirement for enterprise development To borrow a statement from Gartner Cloud is not a strategy it is a tactic (Cloud computing is no longer a strategic issue It is a tactical issue ) \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Cloud \xc2\xa0based \xc2\xa0on \xc2\xa0the \xc2\xa0IaaS \xc2\xa0Service \xc2\xa0Model \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There are still two main problems associated with the current centralized cloud computing model (1) Users do not own their own data (2) Remote servers are susceptible to security breaches Blockchain technology is separate to the centralized cloud computing model and allows it to become decentralized Bitcoin and other decentralized systems explicitly return digital assets to end users eliminating the need for a third party server or for trust in the infrastructure IaaS as the name implies enables consumers to access services from a well developed computer infrastructure over the Internet 2016 Cloud Service Market Shares 4 2 Cloud Service Market Shares in 2016 The value of IaaS services in 2016 reached US$25 2 billion with a growth rate of 56% far more than 18% for the cloud service and 20% for SaaS It\ s expected to maintain its rapid growth with a compound annual growth rate of 29% expected by 2021 The development of IaaS infrastructure is relatively advanced and the rapid distribution after its announcement has reached a considerable market size Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Cloud \xc2\xa0vs \xc2\xa0traditional \xc2\xa0IaaS \xc2\xa0platform \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The basic hardware of a computer is simple It consists of computing components and storage components The working process of the computer is just as conceptually basic draw data from the storage component into the calculation component and compute After the results are obtained the output goes to the display and other devices and thus a cycle of work tasks is completed The deployment of hardware terminals as global nodes is assisting the Acute Angle Cloud to gradually complete the transition from cloud to fog computing \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Fog computing is a paravirtualization frame model of service computing between cloud computing and personal computing Fog computing focuses on small clouds such as Personal Clouds Private Clouds and Enterprise Clouds which operate differently from general cloud computing Fog computing focuses on quantity which aids in its success and every computing node plays a role regardless of how weak its capacity is Fog computing has several major features low latency and location awareness broader geographical distribution applications suitable for mobility and support for more fringe nodes These features make deployment of mobile services more convenient which can satisfy a broader connection of nodes Cloud computing is a computing model which takes advantage of the Internet to use resources (such as storage devices of shared computing facilities and applications) anywhere at any time conveniently and efficiently Cloud computing consists of four basic parts Cloud Platform Cloud Storage Cloud Terminal and Cloud Security From the user\ s standpoint it can be divided into Public Cloud Private Cloud Hybrid Cloud etc From the service viewpoint it can be divided into Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) Platform as a service (PaaS) and Software as a service (SaaS) The main problems associated with the cloud computing industry are as follows 1 \xc2\xa0 Computing needs increase exponentially and the cost of bandwidth remains high leading to an increase of relevant operating costs This becomes an obstacle for the development of a global industrial chain 2 \xc2\xa0 The cost of traditional CDN self built nodes is high and the node implementation is slow which negatively effects users as computing needs increase 3 \xc2\xa0 Traditional cloud model\ s utilization of broadband is insufficient resulting in a large number of wasted resources which is also the main reason for the conflict between computing needs and computing power Fog computing adds a layer between the terminal and the data center known as the network edge layer It\ s like adding another small server or router with a memory that can process and save data without having to put it into the Cloud directly This reduces stress on the Cloud and improves efficiency and transmission rates while simultaneously reducing time delay Compared with cloud computing the framework adopted by fog computing is more distributed and closer to the edge of the network Fog computing concentrates information data processing and data application on the devices at the edge of the network rather than saving almost most of the info onto the cloud (as cloud computing does) The storage and processing of the data is more dependent on the local device rather than the server Therefore cloud computing can be referred to as the new generation of centralized computing whereas fog computing is the new generation of distributed computing which corresponds to the feature of internet decentralization and solves the problem that the cloud computing market currently faces With P2SP technology Acute Angle Cloud can provide shared computing services to the enterprises The Acute Angle Cloud will incorporate blockchain technology to build a fair and transparent incentive mechanism compelling members of the public to participate in the sharing and exchange of the data resources Opening the shared computing services of the Acute Angle Cloud to individual users comprehensively makes each common user a resourceful node of the decentralized shared computing system allowing them to benefit from it Due to the cloud service\xe2\x80\x99s beneficial features such as low cost instant access etc the rapidly growing O2O E business and social networking (to name a but a few) lead the way in realizing the benefits of transferring from the traditional self built servers to cloud servers Many surveys have shown an increase in the industries using cloud services Cloud services are still at an early stage but the settlement in security will result in more sectors migrating to the cloud This crossover is expected to cover government administration healthcare finance industry and other sectors in the next five years \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 4 4\xef\xbc\x9aCloud Service Usage Trend for Different Industries According to a Global IaaS report issued by Gartner Amazon AWS Microsoft Azure and Alibaba Cloud are the top three cloud services in the world with a market share of 44 2% 7 1% and 3% respectively Amazon takes a dominating position but Alibaba is the fastest growing The three major cloud service providers are actively developing their ecosystems Amazon AWS is joining forces with other mainstream IT producers while Microsoft Azure is also supported on the OS Linux Alibaba Cloud is taking advantage of the ecosystem which has already been built by Alibaba potentially allowing a more seamless transition and user experience Ecosystems have been a major force driving the growth of IaaS cloud services Competition Analysis 1 \xc2\xa0 The cloud services that are directly serving individual users remain immature The Acute Angle Cloud allows everyone to be at a crucial point of the distributed cloud network and builds an ecosystem based on the users giving it both a competitive edge and commercial value 2 \xc2\xa0 The concern for security and privacy is still the greatest resistance for the adoption of a public chain However blockchain and CAN technology can solve the issues of data storage and user privacy 3 \xc2\xa0 The cost for centralized physical storage can be reduced but the cost in manpower operations and maintenance remain difficult to curtail In contrast the distributed cloud storage does not need centralized servers making the cost significantly lower 4 \xc2\xa0 The centralized servers can ensure data security but not as well as CAN which is capable of further reducing the system\ s redundancy and ensures that the files are more secure through blockchain technology \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Cloud \xc2\xa0v1 0 \xc2\xa0 Overview \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle Cloud v1 0 is based on the New PC Network (as the storage nodes) and the CAN peer to peer hypermedia distributed protocol to create a globally distributed file storage system 1 \xc2\xa0 Operational principle of the Acute Angle Cloud v1 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 Each file and its block are given a unique \xe2\x80\x9cfingerprint\xe2\x80\x9d called an encrypted hash \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 CAN deletes the files with the same hash value throughout the network judges which files are redundant and also traces the version history of each file \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 Each node stores the content that they want and the relevant index information which helps locate the source \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 Files can easily be located using their hash value \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 Using IPNS (decentralized naming system) each file can be named with a readable name instead of the hash making it easy to find What CAN envisions is not only to turn all the network terminal nodes into a Browser or Client but also to make anyone the operator of the network and storage server 2 \xc2\xa0 Characteristics of the Acute Angle Cloud 1 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle Cloud is based on content addresses not the domain name address Each file (content) is unique one file connected to the CAN network would be given the only encrypted hash value based on its computing content This would change our habit of utilizing domain names to access the network \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 Supplies a history version controller (such as git) of the file and stores the different versions of the stored file to multiple nodes \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle Chain operating on the CAN network is just the hash value table used for storing the internet files The content (file) address on the link will be queried while accessing the network every time it is necessary \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 Uses the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s reward distribution to encourage the user to contribute more shared space for storing data The users obtain the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s rewards by providing available disk space processing power and bandwidth to the network The users can exchange the rewards for storage space and other services within the ecosystem \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s reward system allows a lower cost of data storage to the user and the storage network is made more stable by setting online time goals to motivate users to stay online \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle Cloud v1 0 helps build a freer and more independent network \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Phased \xc2\xa0upgrading \xc2\xa0of

the deployment of the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s global resource nodes and improve the efficiency of point to point end to end data transmission on the chain the Super Network project emerged as a stand alone application It\ s based on the Acute Angle Chain and developed in the Acute Angle client dedicated to serving the world Blockchain believers and enthusiasts can invite more users to easily join in Both new and existing users can concurrently build a blockchain node network architecture that covers a wider area and more densely distributed network finally realizing a self healing cloud computing storage network In addition in order to reach a consensus with the Acute Angle Cloud early adopters we conducted a user survey (110 samples) before the Super Network plan was officially launched The following are some of the findings \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Do you support the creation of the Super Network A Heavily Support B Support C Do not support D Indifferent What do you believe SN\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to be A Necessary for accelerating the deployment of global nodes making the ecosystem more powerful and stable B Necessary but there needs to be a balance between it and the Acute Angle Series C I am against having SN D Indifferent The more point to point nodes there are in the network the faster the data transmission will be The Super Network plans to serve blockchain enthusiasts around the world with its low threshold high participation and easy to use interface Super Network plans to follow the open transparent and tamper proof features associated with blockchain technology allowing more users to easily get involved The SN (ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s generic Token) reward is distributed to the resource contributors through an additional incentive mechanism that can be used within the cloud\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem The Super Network plan will inspire more users to enter the blockchain world The Acute Angle series hardware products (along other PC equipment) will serve as New PC Network devices and jointly serve as resource nodes in the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem Users with other PC devices can not only participate in the construction of the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem easily and receive the SN Token reward but will also receive AAC rewards (10% of the total amount of AAC coming out of the Acute Angle Foundation reserve) This will help Acute Angle Cloud build a blockchain network architecture with nodes that cover a wider geographical area and larger distances It will also lay the foundation for the integration of the resources gathered by the Acute Angle Cloud into a cloud computing storage network that anyone in the world can rely on New \xc2\xa0PC \xc2\xa0Network \xc2\xa0Overview \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The New PC Network is made up of global PC devices that make up the Super Network To help collect a large amount of idle resources from computing devices we will build a complete Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem and provide users with safer and more convenient data storage services The New PC Network is open to all users who have PC devices but are not fully utilizing the hardware and computing resources in them they can share these idle resources and get rewards in return Users can activate the Super Network by installing the Acute Angle client and exchanging AAC for a certain amount of SN to purchase an activation code The activation is bound to that single device and the device becomes a node registered on the Acute Angle Chain The New PC Network devices join the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s global node layout strategy in exchange for rewards Thus a complete blockchain full node network is created by linking blockchain users assets applications etc and the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s global node coverage is expanded while accelerating the point topoint data transmission efficiency We call on more users around the world to use their PC devices join the Super Network program and share the \xe2\x80\x9cdividends\xe2\x80\x9d brought about by blockchain technology innovation After the Super \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Network application is successfully activated the user can select the devices\xe2\x80\x99 idle disk test the network environment as well as other operations to complete resource sharing and become a new node registered on the Acute Angle Chain The joint construction of the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem is rewarded with token rewards New \xc2\xa0PC \xc2\xa0Network \xc2\xa0Advantages \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa2

Token reward distribution Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Chain \xc2\xa0 Overview \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle Chain is a decentralized public blockchain platform used by developers to quickly easily and safely distribute tokens smart contracts and blockchain systems The Acute Angle Chain is committed to building a blockchain network system of global information which values interconnection and trust exchange The philosophy and technological mission of the Acute Angle Chain is to build an unobstructed blockchain world Background \xc2\xa0and \xc2\xa0Importance \xc2\xa0 Blockchain is a decentralized network capable of achieving peer to peer value exchange which is referred to as value Internet Helped by Acute Angle Chain we can create a decentralized and value driven world of mutual cooperation and peer to peer exchange where an individual is directly connected to another as part of a community or society First we build a safe and stable modular blockchain network allowing us to use smart contracts and digital assets At this stage we introduce the Acute Angle PC a hardware capable of intelligently testing monitoring and running a suitable environment The Acute Angle PC can ensure that contracts running in the Acute Angle Chain are safe thus preventing events such as DAO The Acute Angle Cloud can meet different industries\xe2\x80\x99 storage needs including insurance companies electronic files digital currency trace origin and personal credit record The blockchain network is constantly evolving easy to use low cost and susceptible to customization With the Acute Angle Chain we connect user information and might even get through to other networks (possibly non blockchain) for data interaction thus building a cyberspace of multidimensional data correlation Through multidimensional data such as personal credit assets production and consumption data we can better integrate community consensus individual behavior and value exchange Carrying value in the ecosystem the digital currency issued by the Acute Angle Chain and named after it as AAC Using the AAC can allow us to share CDN services idle hard disk resources original resources and other basic blockchain services \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Design \xc2\xa0Philosophy \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle Chain puts stability security scalability and ease of use among its design priorities By introducing modular virtual machines value exchanges and bifurcation mechanisms we create a blockchain network that is easy to use low cost and moderately customizable In theory the Acute Angle Chain can achieve 1 000 TPS of available performance by optimizing the block intervals block capacity and consensus algorithm The New PC Network which is one of the core parts of the Acute Angle Cloud is a globally distributed hardware terminal system that is aggregating all the hardware devices of individuals around the world and is designed based on the edge calculation technology of fog computing to build a web 3 0 interplanetary Internet Everyone who uses a hardware device that is not saturated and has sufficient computing capabilities to join the Super Network program will become a resource node for the Acute Angle Cloud With the development of its global nodes the Acute Angle Cloud will increase its distributed cloud space and its capability to achieve a fully functional distributed cloud computing network system We believe that through the adoption of blockchain technology innovation will be able to solve the crisis of trust between people and create new network relationships to better integrate community consensus individual behavior and value exchange 1 \xc2\xa0 Stability Stability is necessary to ensure the existence of the Acute Angle Chain The blockchain incorporates distributed features for intermediation and the decommissioning of the network is usually complicated and uncertain Therefore we use block design tools to abstract and simplify the blockchain By building a stack type smart contract running WebAssembly (WASM) encoding format we draw two main benefits Firstly it optimizes the performance of the virtual machine and directly improves the contract execution efficiency and reduces the interference caused by the system coupling Secondly it weakens the correlation between the blockchain network and the smart contract running status even if the contract execution has problems or the virtual machine runs abnormally the block and chain\xe2\x80\x99s network stability can still be guaranteed 2 \xc2\xa0 Safety Proof of Work (PoW) has contributed tremendously to the safety of the Bitcoin network However due to the increasing difficulty of computing almost all the rights were concentrated in the miners and mining pools Through professional cooperation they have in fact become highly centralized central servers If their combination exceeds 51% of the computing power it can theoretically control most Bitcoin transactions such as the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack we are familiar with In addition the high power consumption is equally plagued by criticism The Proof of Stake (PoS) mode is still developing compared to PoW These developments are mainly based on security and applications The PoS model has a major advantage in terms of security over the PoW model but the premise is to attract enough holders to fully get the advantages of that security Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is an improvement of PoS and is equivalent to PoS in terms of security Theoretically it can improve block response and increase network stability and security In addition the Acute Angle Chain innovatively proposes a smart sandbox mechanism Contracts issued by any person must first be tested in a smart sandbox The Acute Angle Chain will conduct full path automated testing and continuously monitor its operational status If the health level deteriorates or if a flaw is found the network will judge it at its own discretion and avoid problematic contracts that may cause damage to the blockchain ecosystem 3 \xc2\xa0 Extensibility Extensibility is put forward to solve the information island problem of incompatible blockchains Firstly we believe that upgrading and forking are effective approaches for network evolution with a \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 main chain and some sub chains taking shape after forking Technically main chain and sub chains are completely equivalent but are arranged with different identifications on the basis of community consensus Each sub chain may be customized for different commercial applications and Value Exchange Protocol (VEP) is constructed among sub chains which works similar to a gateway and via which sub chains can interact exchanging information and value This can form a blockchain ecosystem of multiple applications Furthermore non blockchain online data is incorporated into the Acute Angle Chain ecosystem supplemented by smart contracts to respond to events in the real world 4 \xc2\xa0 Usability Acute Angle Chain is a decentralized public blockchain platform Developers can use the Acute Angle Chain to release Tokens smart contracts and blockchain systems simply quickly and safely The Acute Angle Chain is committed to building a global blockchain network system that allows for the exchange of information interconnects value and trust The philosophy and technical mission of the Acute Angle Chain is to build a blockchain world without obstruction \xc2\xa0 Working \xc2\xa0Principle \xc2\xa0 Acute Angle Chain connects numerous forks via Value Exchange Protocol (VEP) and even gets through to other networks (maybe non blockchain) to make data interaction to build a cyberspace of interconnection and multidimensional data correlation 1 \xc2\xa0 Contract creation and LVM Smart contract implementation Traditional smart contracts limit the input and output of data on the chain and can only support some simple application scenarios The Acute Angle Chain besides allowing for data on the chain also allows for interaction with data on and off of the chain itself It further supports the update of data on and off the chain simultaneously It\xe2\x80\x99s commercial applications in the real world are varied and very complex this complexity is reflected in the data structure and the logic A complete Turing programming language and virtual machine are needed to create and execute smart contracts WASM (WebAssembly) is a portable underlying bytecode technology whose stack type virtual machines are custom designed and optimized for a blockchain environment and can run smart contracts at speeds close to native machine code The benefits of WASM lie in industry standardization and extensive support Programmers can develop smart contracts in familiar languages such as C C++ Golang and Rust greatly reducing the cost of learning and improving development efficiency Therefore the Acute Angle Chain selects WASM as the execution code of the smart contracts The life cycle of a contract in a blockchain network can be divided into five stages 1) Select programming language and create source code 2)The compiler assembles the source code into WASM bytecodes 3) The Smart Contract is registered with the Acute Angle Chain 4) Request the contract to open API 5)Upgrade or destroy the contract \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 In the above life cycle Tokens need to be consumed for registration request and upgrade of smart contracts On the one hand because the implementation of the contract must consume CPU memory hard disk and network bandwidth the resource providers need to be rewarded On the other hand it also uses economics to raise the threshold of network attacks and thus reduce risks The open APIs of smart contracts are shown to users as RESTful APIs The contents of HTTP requests are encoded in JSON format Users can generate and send requests through the browser or mobile phone APP Acute Angle Chain\ s RESTful API plug in receives and recognizes requests from a smart contract\xe2\x80\x99s API and if it is one it passes the request to the middleware of the WASM virtual machine The middleware translates the request content into the byte code of the WASM then calls the corresponding API of the equivalent contract and finally returns the result of the API execution to the user The entire process is shown in Figure 2 1 2 \xc2\xa0 Consensus Mechanism Due its distributed nature the blockchain needs a consensus mechanism that functions properly Currently widely used consensus algorithms mainly include PoW (Proof of Work) PoS (Proof of Stake) PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) From a safety and practicality standpoint the Acute Angle Chain uses an improved DPoS consensus \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 mechanism Result delegated Proof of Stake (R DPoS) not only inherits the advantages of DPoS no need to consume additional resources to distribute rewards \xe2\x80\x93 but it can also decide whether to validate the agent\xe2\x80\x99s or the node\xe2\x80\x99s smart contracts according to the network\xe2\x80\x99s transaction status The Token associated with the Acute Angle Chain can not only be traded for the blockchain basic services such as contract release and network bifurcation but it also participates in voting and has the opportunity to become a proxy node and provide Token rewards The Acute Angle Chain named this Token \xe2\x80\x9cAAC\xe2\x80\x9d Each AAC holder is called an equity person and is allocated the corresponding voting weight based on the number of AACs held The agent node is selected by the equity holder The first 31 winners agent nodes with the most votes become deputy nodes which in turn authenticate the transactions The work order is determined by the number of votes The agent node can accumulate rewards if it works normally If it works abnormally or does not work it will be punished The election is conducted in real time and is unending New users can participate in the voting process at any time and users who have already voted can also withdraw their votes at any time or change them Therefore the elected agent node is not permanent nor do they have a fixed term and may be surpassed and replaced by others at any time In addition we have made some optimizations in the consensus algorithm to prevent the agent nodes from being fixed and avoid the network from gradually becoming centralized 3 \xc2\xa0 Account model In the blockchain network the account address was designed to provide safety The address creation follows the following steps public key private key as follows private key\xe2\x80\x94>public key\xe2\x80\x94 >account address All three items use the Secure Hash Algorithm (referred to as SHA) which can ensure safety Hash is the extraction of information with less output than input and fixed length The hash with strong encryption is irreversible i e the private key information cannot be deduced by using the account address The detailed generation process of the private key public key and account is as follows The creation of a private key public key and account can be divided into two kinds of accounts based on the byte length of the account address main account and sub account 4 \xc2\xa0 Value Exchange Protocol(VEP) VEP refers to standard protocol between different blockchain networks As mentioned above the applications that can be loaded on a network are limited but when different networks connect to form a larger network this leads to an exponential increase in value How do single network nodes trust other nodes at first The biggest advantage of the blockchain network is to provide reliable information and such reliability is embodied on the distributed account ledger and consensus A blockchain network is a community that agree on a consensus \xe2\x80\x93 this develops a mutual trust relationship between nodes which is needed for taking a blockchain network as the node and forming connections among several blockchain networks VEP creates rules for cooperation It registers the information of each chain and provides services to the chain in letter list for query and connection requests VEP supports two kinds of application circumstances cross node interaction and cross chain contract request The former develops interaction between contracts indirectly by checking the status of data saved on the node or external data and tries to generate new information For example unpaid loans due in accordance with the contract will affect the individual credit A loan record can be saved in the blockchain A while the credit data can be saved in the blockchain \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 B \xc2\xa0Individual identity information may come from an external public database While the latter refers to mutual invocation between contracts A simple case is that the total value is always constant after exchanging the Tokens of the two chains Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Platform \xc2\xa0Application \xc2\xa0Scenarios \xc2\xa0 Scenario Supply chain finance Supply chain finance refers to a financial service with the lowest risk that is controlled by information integration under financial institutions (generally refers to banks) managing capital flow and logistics of medium and small sized enterprises Due to a large number of participants different kinds of information are saved in each link which means that commodity information of supplier is stored in the warehouse information of the supplier shipment information is grasped by the logistics company capital information is distributed in the bank system and transfer information is grasped by core enterprise Because of information asymmetry and non transparency of information required by collaboration the effective supply chain credit system is hard to be established Due to high cost of credit establishment the financial institution has to operate prudently responding to risk control Thus some high quality items are often missed Acute Angle Platform is able to help enterprises and financial institutions to reconstruct the credit system and establish more efficient supply chain finance Endorsing the core enterprise the blockchain platform for warehouse logistics digital bill and enterprise credit can be developed through Acute Angle Chain which can realize commodity warehouse logistic and accounts receivable commonly witnessed by the up and down stream enterprises and financial institutions on the supply chain The issuance approval transfer splitting and acceptance of digital bill shall be triggered by each participant of supply chain through contract with trigger condition based on change of data status of warehouse logistic blockchain and core enterprise database and prepared by the contract of each participant The behavior of compliance or violation of the rules will be ALL recorded in the credit blockchain which cannot be tampered Acute \xc2\xa0Angle \xc2\xa0Hardware \xc2\xa0Series \xc2\xa0 Overview \xc2\xa0 The Acute Angle hardware series is one of the components of the New PC Network It establishes a reward for users through smart contracts based on Content Addressable Network (CAN) peer to peer hypermedia protocol storage and Acute Angle Chain public chain digital asset management These include all kinds of hardware devices from personal computers to mobile devices Using contentaddressing technology the hardware terminal that joins the New PC Network is used as a node to complete the network CAN connects all computing devices under the same document system CAN is like a bit stream group that can exchange objects at the same Git warehouse In other words CAN provides a contentaddressable block storage model and content addressable hyperlinks creating a generalized Merkle Directed acyclic graph (DAG) In this data structure we can establish an edition control system blockchain or even a permanent world wide web CAN has combined distributed hash tables block switching with an incentive mechanism and a self authenticated name space CAN has no single point of failure and there is no need for mutual trust between nodes \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 3 1 \xc2\xa0 Acute Angle PC I generation We named the first product of the Acute Angle hardware series the Acute Angle PC We designed both the Acute Angle PC I generation and II generation with triangular shapes in order to reflect the trust stability and firmness of the blockchain spirit The Acute Angle PC I generation is a product based on the blockchain technology It can use the distributed cloud storage idle hard disk space shared cloud computing and bandwidth (contributed by Acute Angle hardware series) to provide comprehensive and sustainable CDN services for Internet businesses It is also capable of speeding up its service to meet the demand of a large number of innovative businesses such as download platforms UGC acceleration platforms online streaming platforms and dynamic acceleration platforms whilst also allocating the ecosystem\ s reward for those contributions The customers with the first generation Acute Angle PC are considered founder nodes and get extra rewards 3 2 \xc2\xa0 Acute Angle PC II generation The Acute Angle PC II generation is the second PC from the Acute Angle hardware series and an upgrade from the first generation We have built in crypto chip technology in the Acute Angle PC II generation providing users with double encryption to more safely protect their digital assets It also has a new fingerprint identification and unlocking boot form more in line with identity \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 identification\xe2\x80\x9d which is particularly important in the blockchain era More powerful performance and configuration upgrades will provide users with a better product experience Hardware \xc2\xa0Advantages \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 1 \xc2\xa0 Blockchain technology empowers products The Acute Angle hardware series not only retains the hardware\xe2\x80\x99s original features to bring users a familiar but fresh product experience but also gives them blockchain attributes and distributed architecture thus applying the blockchain technology to people\ s daily lives The blockchain + model facilitates people learning and understanding of the technology 2 \xc2\xa0 Eco friendly low power design The Acute Angle hardware series adopts today\ s mainstream hardware configuration with even better performance leading to a better user experience At the same time however priority is given to a configuration that has a lower energy consumption ensuring the user as a node of the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem can be online all day long still taking advantage of safe and stable services for energy consumption and getting more rewards 3 \xc2\xa0 Facilitating equipment maintenance The internal structure and configuration of each Acute Angle hardware series device is highly uniform at the time of shipment to ensure that all products are efficient safe to operate and accurately respond to user\xe2\x80\x99s needs Application \xc2\xa0Scenarios \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 1 \xc2\xa0 Surfing the Internet and entertainment The Acute Angle PC I and II generations use Windows 10 and can be used to perform the same functions of an ordinary PC 2 \xc2\xa0 Sharing storage The Acute Angle PC I generation can provide users with a large safe reliable and low cost CDN cloud storage service and provide data reliability Users can save information on it access the Internet and connect it to an external hard drive to expand its storage capacity and processing capability 3 \xc2\xa0 Reward System Based on the Acute Angle Chain\ s ecosystem users can contribute with their own idle broadband storage and computer capacity to obtain rewards In the future the Acute Angle Cloud will open more significant service capabilities and provide users on the cloud with CDN acceleration services that meet the needs of Internet businesses Not only can users join the New PC Network to share computing resources such as idle CPU hard disk space and upstream bandwidth to get ecosystem rewards but they can also easily gain community rewards through sharing content gain both intellectual and material fulfillment and sharing the technological \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 innovations\xe2\x80\x99 dividends Acute \xc2\xa0 Angle \xc2\xa0 Coin/AAC \xc2\xa0 and \xc2\xa0 Super \xc2\xa0 Network \xc2\xa0 Token/ \xc2\xa0 SN \xc2\xa0 Overview \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 AAC \xc2\xa0and \xc2\xa0SN \xc2\xa0Introduction \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 With the development of the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem stability the applications in the ecosystem will gradually be used This requires a constant value exchange process to meet users\xe2\x80\x99 needs The use of the application under the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem is not affected by fluctuations in the market value of digital assets so the exchange of applications does not depend on price Therefore we will issue the value based circulation medium Acute Angle Coin (AAC) based on the Acute Angle Chain and the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s universal Token known as the Super Network Token (SN) AAC \xc2\xa0introduction \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 In order to ensure the smooth operation of the Acute Angle Cloud Platform and the needs of commercial applications the Acute Angle Chain main network was based on Ethereum to release the Acute Angle Coin/AAC with a total volume of 1 billion units AAC is used as a valuable and exchangeable medium in the Acute Angle Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem AAC will also be used as a digital asset for the Acute Angle Cloud Users can take advantage of the AAC to exchange for SN and acquire storage space content review and application development among other series of interactions the application performs AAC is based on the sharing economy of cloud computing technology and blockchain technology Through smart contracts smart regulations and reporting systems users are ensured that sharing computing resources and content awards them a reward equivalent which cannot be denied or tampered with through the decentralization of account records we ensure that all transactions are true open and transparent we use the blockchain to register users\ copyrights and modify records thus protecting them from infringement We designed the first application scenario of the AAC as a universal token exchange method for all application services It was also created as a medium for users to provide and exchange computer resources and to ensure the user\ s rights Early participation is a big advantage due to the increase in difficulty of obtaining awards over time as the limited amount of AAC is distributed as competition grows In addition we will provide users with an array of community activities encouraging more users to join and deliver more data nodes and bandwidth storage computing power and other resources for the shared computing ecosystem The entire ecosystem has maintained a good cycle at the Customer end \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 SN \xc2\xa0Introduction \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 In order to ensure the availability of operational applications and the stability of application prices in the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem we will issue a negotiable equivalent interchangeable ecosystem universal token based on the Acute Angle Chain It is named Super Network Token/SN The value of each SN token will be anchored to the US dollar to set the price for all applications/functions in the ecosystem When the user requests the use of a certain function only a certain amount of AAC needs to be converted into SN (according to the conversion ratio at the time) to be allowed to use the application/function Throughout the exchange process point to point and end to end transaction data security is ensured through the use of encryption technology distributed ledger technology trusted cloud technology and chip technology AAC \xc2\xa0and \xc2\xa0SN \xc2\xa0application \xc2\xa0Scenarios \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 In the entire Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem AAC is used to complete the application conversion and SN is used to complete the application activation AAC acts as a digital asset for users in the ecosystem and the SN acts as a generic token consumed for activating applications/functions or exchanging resources The application scenarios of AAC and SN are as follows AAC \xc2\xa0application \xc2\xa0scenarios \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Cloud storage service The token can be exchanged for cloud storage space based on the users\ needs Shared Cloud computing service The token can be exchanged for safe and stable Cloud computing services as well as for a large scale of distributed underlying structure and a decentralized and specialist Cloud encryption technology service Shared CDN service Based on a high quality network infrastructure and Cloud computing technology low cost and extensible Internet content distribution services with high performance As the shared economic of Cloud computing and blockchain technology developers the AAC will have more application scenarios including Shared content services Users can acquire AAC through the Acute Angle PC reward system or by participating in official activities/events e g by advertising different unique content published by other users on the content sharing platform \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 Open platform for Acute Angle applications Applications developed on the platform can be purchased using AAC SN \xc2\xa0application \xc2\xa0scenarios \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Acute Angle client SN application activation The first time the user turns on the Super Network application it requires a certain amount of AAC to be exchanged for SN Once the exchange is complete the user can then activate the Super Network application Acute Angle Cloud Application Exchange After the creation of the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem platform the SN can be used in exchange for services and applications on the platform Trading on the Acute Angle trading platform When the SN reaches a stable stage of development the Acute Angle trading platform will be launched as a ratio exchange between the designated currency trading pair of the platform and other digital currencies Super Network Node election vote As the number of nodes in the global layout of the Acute Angle Cloud expands and in order to protect fairness and improve the operational efficiency of the network\xe2\x80\x99s decentralization we will adopt a Super Network proxy voting campaign and use the SN to vote on Super Network Nodes and conduct dynamic elections Any node can participate in the election as long as the number of votes can catch up it will replace the original Super Network proxy Create a public chain service based on the Acute Angle Chain Users can create a public chain based on the Acute Angle Chain by using SNs facilitating the threshold to develop shorten the development time of public chain linked projects and save on costs With the establishment and gradual improvement of the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem SN will be applied to more scenarios AAC \xc2\xa0and \xc2\xa0SN\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0distribution \xc2\xa0plan \xc2\xa0 With the development and maturity of the Acute Angle Cloud it will gradually support a value service system using AAC as its medium of circulation and SN as its universal token Both AAC and SN will be used to implement applications including activation replacement of storage space content sharing application development etc calculating and recharging exchange functions \xc2\xa0 \x0c \xc2\xa0 AAC \xc2\xa0Distribution \xc2\xa0plan \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 When the user participates in an activity initiated on the platform the smart contract attributed to that activity will automatically generate AAC Initially the total amount of AAC will be 1 billion units The percentage allocated for users\xe2\x80\x99 rewards is 45% fully
