 1 2 Overview
 Platin is a lightweight secure verifiable decentralized and blockchain agnostic Proof of Location (PoL) protocol
 that finally makes cryptocurrency so real that you can see feel and touch it To achieve that Platin decentralizes
 the location services marketplace with secure location capabilities and proof verification for any digital asset such
 as cryptocurrencies and secure documents fueled by Platin›s own PTN coin Platin makes available to businesses
 worldwide its secure decentralized and incentivized peer to peer location protocol 
 Platin’s architecture uses decentralized peer to peer protocol for location centered operations Platin provides
 GIS extensions to well known blockchains including Ethereum/Solidity EOS and others These extensions can
 be used by developers to request and define secure location proofs on the blockchain The Platin Plexus™ is
 scalable and robust providing pluggable and modular security that evolves over time as needs arise Platin’s
 Proof of Location protocol has the potential to transform every industry from retail to ride sharing and from
 supply chains to the disintermediation of large scale international humanitarian relief efforts 
 The Internet and the World Wide Web was not invented just for GAFA (Google Apple Facebook and Amazon) or
 MNOs (mobile network operators) to track and sell our location data Platin’s 
 5
 Location information enables digital systems to connect with the real world Navigating via GPS is just the
 beginning enabling local services emergency interventions the tracking of business assets enterprise location
 intelligence and geospatial analysis that accelerates business models and more 
 Yet such systems must cope with fake and missing location identifiers caused by users on VPNs web proxies 
 TOR networks GPS spoofing apps shared account credentials ad blockers and dozens of other tools 
 This paper discusses the problem and solution and shows how location credentials can be handled in a better
 way while decentralizing location value from GAFA back to the private individual 
 First let’s review the current state of the centralized location ecosystem 
 Silos govern the current location information market Insecurity characterizes the existing location information
 market it is prone to spoofing and abuse Often a smartphone’s owner has an incentive to falsify its
 location A decentralized securely incentivized and privacy preserving platform would protect
 against such attacks 
 Indeed poorly consented location information subverts people’s
 basic rights to privacy Today’s adblockalypse—tracker
 blockers installed by millions of people—is one signal that
 people are unhappy with constant surveillance by GAFA 
 MNO and CDM A decentralized securely incentivized
 and privacy preserving location credentials platform
 could provide credentials only when needed 
 This usage would be fair to people’s desire for
 privacy and would conform with GDPR PSD2
 and other on coming regulations that are
 responding to privacy rights complaints 
 Tim Berners Lee invented the
 World Wide Web to open up such
 siloes and connect all information 
 regardless of network Recently Sir
 Tim has spoken repeatedly against
 the centralization of web services In
 this spirit the W3C is standardizing
 digital credentials such as location 
 Its Verifiable Claims Working Group
 formed in April 2017 is dedicated
 to making “expressing exchanging 
 and verifying claims easier and more
 secure on the Web ” Platin’s team
 Problem in a Nutshell 1 3

 1 4 System at a Glance
 The Platin system is a collection of inter cooperating subsystems that enable privacy preserving
 location credentials on a scale and security assurance level never before possible End users can
 enjoy Platin powered apps that make digital assets become real such as a crypto coin or
 other digital asset appearing as really present on top of a desk at a street corner 
 Developers working with the Platin protocol find that Platin has a short
 learning curve By using Solidity GEO and other Ethereum oriented
 methods programmers can stack extend and re use Platin PALs
 (Platin Algorithms) to enable use cases bound to location behavior
 that were unimaginable before Platin such as offering a
 discount to rental car drivers if they visit certain local tourist
 sites For businesses Platin is a way to earn revenue 
 monetize existing infrastructure and track activities 
 In this “system at a glance” section we fly over Platin’s full
 stack Like an airplane flying over a city we will see all the
 main sites and attractions to understand how they work
 together 
 For end users Platin is a mobile app that allows its users
 works with Sir Tim and other W3C members in this Working Group to codify the creation storage presentation 
 verification and user control of location credentials 
 A decentralized securely incentivized and privacy preserving location credentials service is being rolled out
 today by Platin It is only possible today—not last decade or even last year—due to our increasingly mature
 communication infrastructures ever more powerful smartphones with rich mobile sensor detection DLT
 (distributed ledger technology) game theory based incentivization via tokens maturity of crypto currency
 exchanges and advancements in privacy preserving zero knowledge proofs These affect the handling of location
 credentials past present and future The past is the realm of DLT cryptography ensuring immutability accuracy
 and auditability of claims The present is the realm of assurance and reliability of claims made possible by
 advances in smartphone sensors secure proximity RF artificial intelligence and opportunistic networking And
 the future of the platform is ensured by game theory incentives for distributed systems 
 The maturity of these relatively new technologies along with ongoing growth of location based services in
 urban outdoor environments shopping malls museums and other indoor settings the mass adoption of social
 networking gaming along with emergency services tourism services intelligent transport services assistive
 services and more means the time has come 
 The time for Platin is here

 Figure 1 Platin Scenario where collecting the coin requires scanning verification of nearby celltowers 
 wifi routers and Bluetooth devices 
 to see feel and exchange cryptocurrencies as for example in the diagram below An individual running the Platin
 Pocket™ sees a Platin coin on the street via augmented reality she waves the phone and in a movement like
 capturing a Pokémon Go™ Monster attempts to touch the coin to take possession of it The end user now owns
 the coin and it appears in her wallet for her personal use 
 This scenario is supported on the Platin protocol by configuring the proper Platin Policy and transferring PTN to
 it This policy is composed of PALs plug and play algorithms that are simple to configure and deploy 
 8
 Figure 3 Relevant Non Platin Services that Integrate with Platin
 Figure 2 Proof of Location policies are composed of PALs modular algorithms that can be
 selected and added as needed 
 The Platin Protocol is standards compliant to integrate efficiently into the current world of geospatial activity and
 location based services The relevant services are summarized below

 Figure 4 Platin Pocket™ Mobile Application Internal View
 The Platin Pocket™ is the mobile application that provides wallet capabilities location anomaly detection and
 serves as the user interface for Platin mining Its high level architecture is a typical smartphone application using
 the typical hardware and sensors found in any smartphone 
 1 5 Free and Open Source
 Platin is an infrastructure protocol providing incentivized decentralized secure positioning
 for the web3 economy As such Platin follows the tradition of FOSS that has long been an essential part of the
 location and geospatial landscape Anyone can use the system and its utility services inspect the code that
 enables its functioning and fork it if desired We work this way because it is the right way to deploy such a global
 protocol In addition some enterprise value propositions can be built on the platform in the same way that Red
 Hat monetizes FOSS Linux providing SLA and QoS guarantees in return for remuneration 
 An example of Platin’s FOSS approach is its contributions to the W3C’s Verified Credentials standard a
 technology intended for broad adoption on the World Wide Web that supports immutable reliable yet privacy
 preserving declarations in a distributed way This standard is codified by groups of the World Wide Web
 consortium and Platin’s representatives devote their time to completing this standard which will be interoperable
 and open to all users 
 Check out our code in git and get involved 
 Our high level flyover is concluded Let’s take a closer look at the platform that is Platin

 Why
 Platin 
 This section reveals why we made Platin and includes sample use cases of
 how Platin can help your business 
 02
 11
 2 1 Digital Assets Lack Something
 The computer age introduced digital artifacts to our everyday lives 
 These artifacts lack something making it difficult for the average
 person to deal with digital assets—no matter how much moral
 excellence a digital asset may have it still feels less than real 
 Take money as an example A seemingly random string of letters
 and numbers represented by a QR code (see below) is difficult
 for most people to understand and use as money People literally
 cannot “grasp it” and so mentally cannot either I can print a
 copy of it and so can you—then who has it How do I protect it 
 It is these confusions that cause digital assets like Bitcoin to fail
 the “grandmother” test meaning that my grandmother cannot
 understand it and so does not use it 
 Physical assets on the other hand are easy to grasp The money
 pictured below can be held in my hand put on a table and
 manipulated as surely as any other physical object It is unique there
 is only one and it cannot be copied It passes the grandmother test 
 Figure 5 A QR code representing
 money a Bitcoin address “16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk ” worth nearly $1 Billion
 USD at the time of this writing 
 vices that Integrate with Platin
 Figure 6 Photograph of a paper Federal Reserve Note representing one hundred U S Dollars serial
 number LG04727792 
 Pikachu a creature from the “Pokémon Go” game shows us how we may bridge this gap between virtual
 and real Pikachu though a virtual artifact is more “graspable” than the QR code above The game by Niantic
 harnessed the power of ordinary smartphones with their screens audio and sensor capabilities to make
 Pikachu real enough to see him and capture him passing the grandmother test 
 12
 Figure 7 Screenshot of Pikachu standing on a sidewalk Pikachu seemed so real that 750 million
 people downloaded the app and at the time of this writing 65 million were still looking for Pokémon
 monsters 
 Location and AR are the critical smartphone capabilities that makes Pikachu feel real However its location data
 is not secure and as a result the game is plagued by spoofers people who sit in their homes but simulate their
 presence on a street falsify their location and capture Pokémon monsters fraudulently 
 Similar location fraud plagues other location based services such as Uber drivers who use location spoofing to
 artificially inflate ride fares In fact the potential for spoofing and false claims goes up as you move from games to
 taxi fares to money itself in the form of cryptocurrency 
 13
 2 2 Digital Assets Made Real With Location
 The computer age introduced digital artifacts to our everyday lives These artifacts lack something making it
 difficult for the average person to deal with digital assets—no matter how much moral excellence a digital asset
 may have it still feels less than real 
 Take money as an example A seemingly random string of letters and numbers represented by a QR code (see
 below) is difficult for most people to understand and use as money People literally cannot “grasp it” and so 
 mentally cannot either I can print a copy of it and so can you—then who has it How do I protect it It is these
 confusions that cause digital assets like Bitcoin to fail the “grandmother” test meaning that my grandmother
 cannot understand it and so does not use it 
 Physical assets on the other hand are easy to grasp The money pictured below can be held in my hand put on
 a table and manipulated as surely as any other physical object It is unique there is only one and it cannot be
 copied It passes the grandmother test 
 14
 2 3 Simple Use Cases
 The ability to locate something or someone is a basic human need as is found at the heart almost every form of
 economic activity A few examples 
 • Lawrence leaves cash on his dining room table for the cleaners The cleaning crew enter the apartment clean it and collect the payment for their services There is another payment at the end of the day
 as well Lawrence is assured that the crew was present at my location both those times 
 • Olivia proves to her bank that she is present at her home and office The clerk uses this proof to
 grant Olivia a loan The bank is assured of meeting their KYC and AML requirements surrounding identification as it relates to physical location 
 • Coffee Roasters Chain drops their branded CAF coins at the doors of all their cafés to attract
 customers The Coffee Roasters Chain present in all major cities issues a CAF “branded coin” on Platin’s
 blockchain taking advantage of its low cost high throughput and native location capabilities to promote
 Coffee Roasters Coffee by dropping their tokens at the doors of every branch a few times a day The
 people who turn up collect the money and spend it in the stores or use them to purchase discounted
 coffee beans Coffee Roasters has drawn more people to their locations has successfully promoted foot
 traffic and has ensured uptake and trading of their CAF token 
 • Antonio prevents speculators from manipulating his national currency Anthony is the Treasurer
 of a South American Nation Trade within his economic zone is regulated with geo fencing The ledger
 handling currency exchanges recognizes where the transaction was made and trades made with outside communities are disincentivized or blocked altogether Antonio protects his currency’s value from
 speculators who are not physically vested and involved in our community 
 • Thomas subsidizes his automobile fleet Thomas manages a fleet of automobiles on behalf of his
 corporation He adds to the drivers’ software a location protocol witnessing layer As the cars are used 
 the software contributes location witnessing validations to the system and earn cryptocurrency just by
 driving subsidizing the cost of the fleet 
 • Evelyn records her fitness record Evelyn’s insurance company gives Evelyn a discount if she makes
 her fitness routines visible to them Using Zero Knowledge cryptography an immutable record of Evelyn’s fitness is stored in her personal data store The insurance company can gain assurance that Evelyn
 is meeting her weekly movement goals without Evelyn revealing unnecessary details about her exact
 location 
 • Daniel helps diffuse urban traffic Daniel’s fleet of self driving cars are routed via different parts of
 the city where strategically placed PTN coins can be collected by his cars While the new routes add
 10 15 minutes the drive Daniel’s cars are compensated in PTN (or branded municipal tokens) for having
 accepted modified routes that reduce traffic congestion 
 • Humanitarian Aid Platin is setting up a humanitarian task force to focus on airdropping crypto assets
 on needy communities and communities affected by natural disaster and catastrophic events such as
 war economic collapse earthquakes famine and other 
 • Characteristics Airdropping crypto assets to populations affected by catastrophic events Real time aid 
 15
 distributed directly to affected populations Help citizens and avoid inefficient aspects of government 
 NGOs and endless red tape Ensure fair & even distribution No waste unclaimed coins revert back to
 donors No hoarding enforces throttling rate limiting & per wallet limitations 
 • The Puerto Rico disaster like most enabled many bad actors to siphon off humanitarian aid and funds
 before they can reach the needy In fact today philanthropy overall is reduced because people suspect
 even large organizations such as the Red Cross of not delivering all the value to the target community 
 Platin enables direct delivery to the people on the ground disintermediating middlemen 
 • The law of unintended consequences means it will take time and experience to perfect disaster recovery coin drops Platin intends to facilitate the community development of a set of best practices for
 instance people may be spread out at the time of a storm but then may cluster together at aid centers
 afterward It does no good to leave most of the aid out in disaster areas that could incentivize people to
 return to unsafe areas (gas leaks waterborne diseases etc ) before repairs/remediation and end to any
 immediate danger 
 Note Platin has signed letters of intent with international aid organizations to explore humanitarian air drops under their auspices 
 What all of these cases have in common is the use of a low friction high assurance location credentials to
 advance a value proposition And all use PTN or a branded token on top of the Platin Protocol for locationbased incentivization

 2 4 Development Team
 The Platin team is truly global The founders are based in Israel Platin software developers are based Platin’s Tel
 Aviv and Kiev offices which include a team of full time Platin employees experts in blockchain (Ethereum EOS) 
 mobile (Android iOS) full stack programming designers and 3D modelers Solidity developers and more Platin’s
 Japan team leads partner relations and business development 
 2 5 Economics
 Users of the Platin protocol pay for its use using the Platin coin (PTN) In this way Platin behaves like Ethereum 
 the leading open source public blockchain based distributed computing platform co founded by Vitalik Buterin 
 PTN like “Gas” in Ethereum measures how much “work” an action or set of actions takes to perform for
 example to collect a sensor fusion location report may cost some fractions of a PTN An operation on the Platin
 platform costs a certain number of PTN with operations that require more computational resources costing
 more PTN than operations that require fewer computational resources 
 Note PTN is a utility token enabling incentivized proof of location
 operations PTN holders have a right to access and drive usage of
 the platform by running in EVM compatible code (i e smart contracts) paying usage fees The tokens may be used for payments
 and transactions relating to location claims PTN is not an investment vehicle 
 2 6 The Decentralized Location Market
 Platin is a leading player in the Decentralized Location services space We are proud to share this space with
 some other companies engaged in similar services 
 17
 2 6 1 Foam space
 Foam space ‘s go to market consists of deploying radio beacons that stakeholders pay to operate which then
 participate in a proof of stake consensus system that interacts with a map of the world Foam operates on
 Ethereum smart contracts They propose Crypto Spatial Coordinate (CSC) Ethereum smart contract addresses
 with corresponding addresses positioned in physical space that are verifiable both on and off chain CSCs are
 verifiable both on and off chain They are related to token curated registries which people can stake

 2 6 2 XYO
 XYO network is the reverse ICO of a hardware oriented company formerly called XY Find It that sold small
 Bluetooth tracking tiles for finding lost items like handbags and keyrings Their first Kickstarter campaign in
 February 2014 raised over $200K They have since sold many of these keychain beacons Pivoting to blockchain 
 they proposed an architecture and hired some blockchain experienced developers to build and promote the
 new approach XYO’s communication strategy is strongly hyped with emails and content consist of phrases like

 While XYO and Platin can engage in “co opetition” to develop the market for trustless location claims Platin can
 use XYO’s insecure Bluetooth beacons and satellites for its own location proofs 
 2 6 3 Fysical
 Fysical is predominately a data analytics company It is the reverse ICO of a data aggregation company originally
 called “Beacons In Space ” Beacons In Space aggregated locations of retail Bluetooth beacons They then
 expanded to purchasing data and recently pivoted to the blockchain and rebranded themselves as “Fysical ”
 Fysical plans to enable a distributed marketplace of data with more transparency into data provenance They
 claim that people will be paid for the use of their mobility data while also protecting anonymity

 2 6 4 Principal Platin Differentiators
 Security High value assets can be leveraged on Platin due to security being baked in from day one by experienced 
 proven team full time cryptographers who are part of early core team hires 
 Interoperability Very flexible leveraging of existing infrastructure due to being hardware agnostic 
 Coverage Can be used anywhere on earth rather than limited to areas of prior deployment 
 Early Mover Great market timing one of the first Proof of Location solutions out of the gate 
 Platin Team Committed tireless co founders core team blockchain evangelists security specialists with proven
 business traction proven ability to recruit manage and deliver while providing business value to
 stakeholders 
 Experience Platin’s CEO and CTO have decades of experience with secure cryptographic systems tech innovation and
 delivery of large scale systems Platin’s advisory team includes security experts at world class universities
 such as the Technion and ETH Zurich 
 Standards Other tokens depend on the creation of new standards and new technologies (e g time synchronizations) 
 Platin uses proven deployed and standardized ISO and W3C accepted standards such as Simple Feature
 Geometry and others
 Visualization Other projects focus on visualizing a map of staked claims Platin focuses on visualizing the location of
 digital assets such as cryptocurrency branded coins and others depending on the underlying business
 case 
 Security Competitors focus on their own hardware and less on the security of their software components On the
 converse Platin is a security and privacy focused entity in all regards 
 ZK Platin has already released its first location Zero Knowledge proof and will soon have ZK Snarks and Starks
 implementations as well as new innovative proofs No other PoL player has made any announcements on
 the subject of privacy preserving zero knowledge proofs or location blinding 
 Tokens Other project tokens staked to places and hardware beacons leading to slow growth (one location at a
 time) Platin tokens earned by Sensor based Mining (faster global uptake) and Staking secure beacons
 (can be software based faster deployment)
 2 6 5 Summary
 Together the above listed companies work with Platin in “coopetition” to make the location space more mature
 and enable a mutual benefit proposition for service providers and consumers of location based services

 3 6 The Utility of the PTN/PTNX Tokens
 The PTN/PTNX utility tokens enable secure and verifiable location proofs to be requested via Platin’s Proof of
 Location (PoL) protocol on the blockchain or to enable the coupling of and representation of geographical
 information within secure digital assets These tokens are also the mechanism underlying incentivization for
 participating nodes to witness verify and attest to location claims Proof of Location exists primarily as a result of
 the PTN/PTNX (PTN/X) tokens 
 The application of incentives to Platin’s Proof of Location protocol is one of the insights that founded Platin 
 and is based on game theory models that are working in other cryptocurrencies They both encourage actors
 to nurture Platin’s strong safe peer to peer operation and discourage bad actors by punishing those who act
 maliciously 
 Platin’s fungible utility token the PTN/X with its smallest unit pli is the primary continuously operating incentive
 unit on Platin’s blockchain PTN/X is fungible meaning it can be exchanged for other currencies empowering it
 to incentivize and mold the behavior of platform participants Varying amounts are rewarded to nodes that run
 Platin Policies (with their associated PALs) of varying complexity A simple policy pays minimal fees An elaborate
 policy such as one requiring AI powered location history analysis or zero knowledge credentials rewards higher
 fees Baking these fees into Platin’s consensus and incentive structures ensures that the Platin ledger does not
 become bogged down with low value high bandwidth work or malicious attempts to create artificial bottlenecks 
 Nodes can earn PTN/X by participating in attestation and secure location witnessing Secure beacons whether
 standalone or integrated into IoT devices can continuously earn PTN/X over time The rate of earning correlates
 with the number of Platin policies that request a validation from that beacon Therefore beacons in more
 populous areas have the potential to perform witnessing more frequently and as a result earn more PTN/X 
 Platin received a legal opinion stating that the Platin token is incontrovertibly a utility token The legal opinion is
 comprehensive and includes a number of tests used by various jurisdictions

 Location
 Credentials

 28
 4 1 Location Before Platin
 A typical location credential the kind done by most people’s mobile phones several times a day to one’s
 cellphone mobile network operator Google search and other service providers looks like this 
 This type of location statements are the least privacy preserving and the most troubling to many people 
 particularly Sir Tim Berners Lee the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the consortium (W3C) that
 oversees its continued development 
 device d is at location (x y) at time t
 4 2 W3C Credentials and Platin
 In honor of the web’s 25th birthday its inventor Sir Tim advocated at the United Nations and other public forums 
 “We have built an amazing web but we still have a lot to do so that the web remains truly for everyone… How
 do we secure the web to protect our personal information ” As a direct result of his concerns the W3C is
 standardizing digital credentials Its Verifiable Claims Working Group formed in April 2017 is dedicated
 to making “expressing exchanging and verifying claims easier and more secure on the Web ” Platin’s
 co founder Dr Wolberger works with Sir Tim and others in this Working Group to codify the
 creation storage presentation verification and user control of location credentials 
 Platin treats location as one such verifiable credential being a set of claims created by
 an issuer about a subject—a person group or thing—in a decentralized privacy
 preserving way that is supportive of self sovereign identity and can be integrated
 into the typical web browser 
 Platin’s Proof of Location protocol is compatible with the latest standards 
 Platin’s continuing work with the W3C ensures Secure Proof of Location
 credentials will be available in people’s everyday digital life via their ordinary
 web browsers and phone apps 
 Platin applies three strategies for enhancing privacy while Proof of
 Location credentials are shared data minimization selective disclosure
 and progressive trust 
 29
 Data minimization is a policy of minimum data collection and/or access for maximum value Services using
 people location data shall limit the amount of shared data strictly to the minimum necessary in order to
 successfully accomplish a task or goal 
 Since data minimization is largely a policy decision the fact that Platin relies on a shared ledger greatly enhances
 its ability to promote data minimization and invoke it via community enforcement and transparency Platin also
 supports minimization through organizational processes documentation and sample code 
 4 2 1 Data Minimization
 Selective disclosure is the ability of a Platin Pocket™ user to granularly decide what information to share Selective
 disclosure is a means by which data minimization can be achieved Data formats and cryptographic operations
 are harnessed throughout the system to format the location claims inspect those claims and store them safely 
 Platin location statements are constructed so as to ensure privacy as well as interoperability They extend the
 technology behind TLS—the “green padlock” you see on your browser when you connect securely and privately
 with a company—with certain Zero Knowledge cryptographic routines 
 4 2 2 Selective Disclosure
 • In the Platin Pocket Public/Private key pairs are computed with some other mathematical calculations required to curate the essential ingredients of the operations we are about to perform A related
 “Proof of Correctness” is created the computational algorithm that will be used to validate the location
 information A location claim is formatted comprised of the public key and the proof of correctness A
 cryptographic accumulator is constructed in order to enable zero knowledge queries further on It is a
 one way membership function embedding the location data as part of a membership
 set The operation can then answer a query as to whether a potential candidate is a
 member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set 
 • In the Public Log a Platin Algorithm (PAL) is executed and the relevant
 public keys are aggregated for use in validating the signatures The
 PAL also commits to some given value while keeping it temporarily hidden making the calculation binding The PAL can then
 verify the proof of correctness and record the result on the
 Public Log 
 • The Ethereum ledger records the successful conclusion of
 the Public Log 
 By following this process Platin and other services in the Location
 Credentials community can leverage location information for more
 and more value while still preserving privacy 
 30
 Progressive trust is the ability of an individual to gradually increase the amount of relevant location data revealed
 as trust is built or value generated As trust grows an individual may choose to share more and more location
 data conversely if trust is eroded a person can shut down access to their location information 
 Trust scores enable progressive trust in the Platin platform Handled in ways similar to location credentials trust
 scores are a specialized credential that represents the trust relationship between parties between a given Platin
 Pocket and the Platin Plexus a Pocket to a specific Secure Beacon a Beacon in relation to another Beacon etc 
 Machine evaluation of trust scores enables the platform to support both increasing trust where two entities may
 increase the amount of shared information between them or decreasing trust where for some reason trust has
 been lost and a party is deprecated in its ability to vouch for certain proofs 
 4 2 3 Progressive Trust
 4 3 Public Maps and Privacy
 Location information is gathered and stored by many commercial and governmental services under a wide
 variety of databases terms licenses and trust chains Other services such as search engines generate their own
 databases that mirror internet content with enriching contextual information added Mapping services work
 alongside to fulfill the critical function of visualizing correlations between data sets Often these geographic or
 geospatial information (GI) are locked into silos and are difficult to access Some charge fees while others are
 monetized by the mining and sharing of people’s personal data Still others are operated by oppressive regimes
 or are used by attackers to cause harm 
 Platin is aware that its information will be discovered and accessed by these services so Platin implements
 ongoing procedures to ensure that abuses do not creep in and users are protected while enabling transparency 
 This section details some of those procedures and methods 
 Note Platin is guided by its work with the W3C Working Group and
 was founded by longtime advocates for individual privacy rights and
 data sovereignty We work closely with the relevant thought leaders
 on the process of sharing location credentials and information with
 proper consent and preservation of dignity 
 Platin is a stackable protocol that operates within the GI ecosystem and so interacts with these GI services The
 Platin smart contracts are written with this ecosystem in mind Its PALs can use and contribute to open data
 tracking of Wi Fi access points cell towers Bluetooth beacons and other publicly known sources that contribute
 to sensor fusion such as wigle net opencellid org and wikibeacon org 
 31
 Location services such as Platin must deal with the implications of affecting actual human movement Since
 Platin’s use cases such as coin drops and “Pokemon Go” style competitions have this impact Platin builds in
 safety features to mitigate the possibility of accidents These include rate limiting the ability to limit the rate at
 which a set of policies can be fulfilled density limits limiting the amount of Platin digital assets within a particular
 area density place information to assist developers in knowing what types of human activity occur in that place
 (e g is it a private field an urban area or the middle of a lake) monitoring of the platform for hazards and so on 
 In the end Platin implements ongoing oversight and transparency to ensure that location harms do not creep in
 and instead best practices continue to spread in the GI space

 4 4 Calling the Platin Protocol
 To request and consume secure location credentials in your application call the Platin API The API is broken out
 into easy to understand API calls that simplify working with Platin’s secure location credentials 
 32
 Some features of the API include 
 • Query for location information on a variety of categories for up to date information about a given location such as coin drops on that location and their status (completed in progress) secure beacons in the
 area attesting witnesses in the area 
 • Setting and querying information relevant to the location claim such as location radius and time of availability 
 • Integration of place identifiers to enable cross communication with other geo spatial APIs 
 • Queries for various Platin Policy properties such as the cost of the call security assurance level and
 PALs included 
 Protocol API calls function as any other activity on the Platin Platform and have to be paid for in PTN to complete
 properly 
 33
 Decentralized
 Ledger
 In this section we dive a bit deeper into Platin’s blockchain technology 
 05
 34
 5 1 Blockchain
 Platin harnesses the power of blockchain to enable its operations The following are the primary aspects that
 characterize Platin’s blockchain 
 The Platin™ system began development using Ethereum smart contracts and an Oracle architecture Since then 
 Platin™ fine tuned this architecture to be a general purpose location engine that interfaces with other blockchain
 software 
 Platin’s first release uses the Ethereum blockchain and we are extending the solidity language to SolidityGEO™ to
 optimize the handling of location and geographic information Ethereum remains our primary blockchain since its
 critical components—the Ethereum Virtual Machine solidity programming language and active community—are
 ideal for Platin’s core feature set 
 Platin also operates on the EOS EOS is a newer blockchain that has the potential to work
 more quickly than Ethereum at greater scale and with lower (or no) user fees Platin
 will optimize geospatial operations on EOS as well 
 In the end Platin will develop and roll out a custom blockchain technology
 best suited to its operation This blockchain will complete the best
 optimized software stack dedicated to location operations top to
 bottom We call this the blockchain the Plexus™ its seeds have
 already been planted 
 • Is robust able to scale
 • Developer friendly
 • Has conversion and trading tools
 • Has a good consensus model
 • Is Immutable
 • Is reliable has a testnet and proven track record 
 • Has high participation rates and a vibrant supportive community 
 35
 As mentioned above Ethereum offers a programming language suited to Platin’s Proof of Location tasks The
 following is an example of a Platin location Policy written in solidity which in turn creates the EVM compatible
 bytecode necessary to execute the contract 
 Developers can view Platin’s solidity code on Github See https //github com/platinprotocol
 5 1 2 EVM Compatible Software
 While some of Platin’s code is available for inspection on Github 
 most of Platin’s private repos will be publicized in the near future 
 Platin’s mission requires geographically secure positioning enabled by blockchain technology To enable this 
 Platin contributes to the blockchain community extensions and simplifications of geography for smart contracts 
 SolidityGEO™ extends Ethereum’s Solidity language to create a highly flexible powerful and extensible contracts
 for binding location based behavior to any digital asset GEOS™ builds on EOS’s C++ implementation to enhance
 EOS contracts 
 5 1 1 Geography for Smart Contracts
 These extensions integrate concepts from existing Geographic Information Systems and ISO standards in order
 to specify a common handling storage and access model for location data on the blockchain The extensions
 are based on “ESRI Shapefile Technical Description” (http //www opengeospatial org/standards/sfa) and (http //
 portal opengeospatial org/files/ artifact_id=25355) We also use Simple Features as defined in ISO standard
 19125 
 Platin’s SolidityGEO™ and GEOS™ help simplify and define performance of geo fencing zero knowledge air drops 
 location based three factor authentication requesting secure location verifications geolocating assets with strict
 Platin Escrow capabilities any of the use cases supported by Platin™ and more Both are to be released under a
 free and open source (FOSS) license 
 36
 5 2 Platin Pocket™
 The Platin Pocket™ app runs on smartphones and provides a simple user interface and experience (UI/UX)
 to mediate interaction As with all aspects of Platin the app is built and deployed with security and privacy by
 design 
 Users operate or own nodes but it is technically the nodes that earn the money Nodes earn PTN coin in
 providing witnessing and attestations to location claims There are several types of nodes Pocket (mobile) full
 node and secure trusted beacon node 
 • Transaction ordering dependence The system validates dependence and warns developers of
 possible poor dependencies 
 • Timestamp inconsistencies The system uses secure time and makes clear to the developer
 how latencies in processing could be windows for attack
 • Call stack depth In general we work to reduce cyclomatic complexity being the number of
 linearly independent paths through a program s source code 
 • Examine the unhappy cases and exception handling as for example using send or transfer instead of the pull payments pattern 
 • Include dynamic parts in the code so these cannot be swapped out in future versions 
 The Platin ecosystem thrives on community participation in writing PALs (Platin Algorithms) which in turn run on
 secure encrypted computational engines To ensure the health of this environment Platin’s software semantics
 have security and privacy by design and enforce opinionated best practices 
 Platin builds in the lessons to date regarding static analysis of location oriented software as well as broader
 pitfalls in logic and purpose In addition to the basics of missing input validation reentrancy avoidance integer
 value limits and loop length limits Platin’s semantics prevent security vulnerabilities and bad practices by
 protecting developers regarding 
 5 1 3 Semantics and Security

 5 2 2 Function
 The Platin Pocket™ enables a device’s owner to securely install the application connect with the Platin distributed
 system and benefit from Platin in the way that they choose 
 The application mediates on its owner’s behalf all the critical processes such as hosting and executing PALs in
 order to earn PTN currency 
 Note Platin Pocket™ resource consumption is similar to that of a
 typical navigation application such as Waze™ or Google Maps™ 
 The app’s high level architecture is that of a typical smartphone application using the typical hardware and
 sensors found in any smartphone 
 The Platin Yellow Paper describes the operation of the application in greater depth 
 The Platin Pocket™ app provides the user interface to the Platin wallet direct sending and receiving of PTN
 tokens geographic airdrop capabilities for PTN tokens with basic policy definitions and more The Platin Pocket™
 also serves as the mining interface for PTN coins showing how many witnesses and verifications a node passively
 attested to and the node’s cumulative earnings of mining rewards The Platin Pocket™ is a powerful privacy
 preserving app that enables Platin’s three pillars of secure location Sensor Fusion Behavior Over Time and Peer
 to Peer Witnessing 
 Following are pre release shots of the Platin Pocket™ application for iOS

 are the utility tokens fueling location proofs for any digital asset or
 crypto currency

 5 3 Platin Plexus™
 Platin’s blockchain is called the Platin Plexus™ The Plexus will be built on state of the art blockchain
 technologies 
 Platin is extending classic Solidity to create Solidity GEO to smooth the handling and coding of geospatial
 semantics and zero knowledge functionalities all while remaining compatible with the W3C Distributed Identifiers
 and Verifiable Credentials standards 
 41
 The Platin
 Verifier
 The Platin Verifier is an open software service that anyone can run to conduct location proofs 
 The bulk of Platin’s location processing is done on the Platin Verifier introduced because a
 secure location protocol requires scale computations low latency and privacy that cannot be
 met by any blockchain today 
 06
 42
 The Platin Verifier operates in the following way 
 • Coordinate validation of location proofs and manage cryptocurrency transfers between parties involved
 into location proof generation This activity consists of hosting policies PALs and any associated witnessing or signal harvesting 
 • Communicate with the appropriate ledger (Ethereum EOS etc ) for token transfer via payment channels
 • Host Platin Policies along with PALs and their code Claimants are provided with PAL descriptions from
 an instance of the Platin Verifier 
 The Verifier hosts the following critical operations 
 • Support signal harvesting operations receive and store harvested signal data and/or their proofs in a
 distributed storage Pay token rewards to miners 
 • Coordinate PoL validation Assure that coordinates obtained by a device are correct with sufficient
 probability by executing the server side portion of the PAL code and producing a validation result This
 feature relies on the distributed storage 
 • Assess and conclude the secure proof of location for ledgers that cannot host smart contract EVM code
 e g Bitcoin IOTA etc Verify the location proof and push the concluded transaction into a blockchain in
 order to release funds to the address of the claimer 
 The Platin Verifier is an open software service that anyone can run to conduct location proofs 
 6 1 Scalability
 The Verifier allocates a unique address and associated state machine for each Platin Process This machine then
 functions as a channel much as payment channels and side channels function on other blockchains The channel
 is bookended by a pair of significant transactions The first is the initiation transaction which serves as an anchor
 for the entire activity and inaugurates the machine The final one is a settlement transaction which publishes the
 channel’s outputs and closes it out 
 To understand a channel let’s examine the trivial case of the uninspected location claim “I am at location X Y ”
 The unverified claim has no witnesses no security validations or any security at all The channel is initiated with
 its anchor configuration key material and algorithms The uninspected claim is received The settlement process
 then formats the claim for privacy preserving publication publishes it and destroys the channel 
 Channels are the heart of the Platin ecosystem and we expect them to do much much more The power of the
 Verifier and its open architecture really shines when you add the Platin Algorithms or PALs 
 43
 6 2 PALs Platin ALgorithms
 A platform is only as useful as the applications that run on it like the apps that run on your smartphone PALs are
 algorithms lightweight software components that run in both the Verifier and on a mobile phone They can do
 anything from requesting a location (e g 10 Main Street New York NY) to requesting audio witness signals from
 nearby nodes The PAL store makes available all PALs with information about their provenance and popularity 
 and PALs can be combined in a channel in endless ways 
 Some examples of PALs include 
 PALs enable speed extensibility flexibility and moveable security They are implemented in a transparent way 
 with secure signatures to prevent tampering 
 • Checking hashes 
 • Collecting secure beacon messages from near the client
 • AI inspection of behavior over time
 • Collecting audio near supersonic signals
 • Multisig and time controls 
 6 3 Zero Knowledge Within Platin
 Platin’s Platform features zero knowledge (ZK) implementations to preserve privacy such as ZK SNARKS ZKSTARKS and CL Signatures 
 ZK is needed because obfuscation is not enough Obfuscation refers to the use of seemingly random mixtures
 of letters and numbers on DLTs (distributed ledger technologies) like the addresses used in Ethereum Security
 specialists know that analysis of IP addresses transaction history patterns including time
 zone service providers and so on can link those seemingly anonymous strings of letters and
 numbers back to real people More robust methods are needed 
 Location data differs from currency
 balances Currency balances need to be
 forever traceable all the way back to the
 genesis block by all users Location claims
 need be accessible until they are validated 
 consumed and later (optionally) audited 
 These are sharply restricted time and visibility
 requirements as compared with currency balances 
 Furthermore currency balances are their transaction
 history while location claims are independent 
 44
 attributes and not linked in that way In the case of a coin placed at a location the coin is associated with location
 information much as a restaurant rating is associated with the restaurant the location is an attribute 
 Note The Platin Platform offers Zero Knowledge Proof Operators
 (ZKPO) in a wide range of privacy and security assurance levels 
 from in the clear GPS declarations all the way up to completely
 blinded ZK and CL Signatures compatible with W3C credentials 
 Platin renders location attributes as credentials that are effectively tamper proof whose authenticity can be
 verified in an automated fashion ZK can be applied when the credentials are shared and inspected with the PAL
 assisting in privacy enhancement provided that it can understand and work with the data in question For users
 who select ZK in W3C formats Platin standardizes the location data in such a way as to ensure confidentiality—
 the hidden part of the location claim cannot be understood by anyone for whom it is unintended—as well as to
 ensure integrity—the claim and its verifying elements can be validated as authentic and the revealed part of the
 location information cannot be altered without such alteration being detected 
 The Platin Yellow Paper shows the detailed implementation of each type of Zero Knowledge Platin Algorithm
 (ZK PAL) Each ZK PAL enables the mathematical calculations required to curate the essential ingredients of
 the operations required the proofs that are performed to validate the PAL the credential itself formatted in a
 privacy preserving manner and the computational primitives compatible with the Verifier’s trusted execution
 stack 
 This ensures that each device involved in the Platin protocol is indeed in the hands of its rightful owner and
 making honest claims without revealing anything about the owner their history location or other sensitive data 
 6 4 Trusted Private Computing
 The Verifier assures privacy preserving computation and decentralized (aka trustless) operation by running its
 state machines in confidential enclaves It achieves this goal by being security by design and privacy by design
 from the processor up to the application layer The Verifier offers transparent data encryption key management
 and secure compute features ensuring that each channel is working only with its creators and users—the verifier
 sysadmins only see the existence and bare facts about the channel and cannot access the channel’s exact
 activity even if under subpoena This is achieved by creating a secure application layer encrypted connection
 from the PAL participants directly to the protected channel in the Verifier The authorization for trusted
 connectivity is managed using the same cryptographic keys anchoring the Platin wallets and Ethereum smart 
 45
 contracts Connectivity between nodes is protected by TLS 
 The Verifier performs like an internal confidential application from a performance and connectivity aspect Its
 secure computing model allows the strict partitioning and role based access that is a standard feature of secure
 data centers 
 6 5 Anchoring
 Some Platin™ information is stored off chain such as complex geometries or behavior over time logs To make
 sure that this data is immutable and that its integrity is protected Platin will with store a signed address on
 the blockchain or commit a hash of the data to the blockchain Output from Platin processes is anchored to
 the blockchain by the most suitable method either as a merkleized chain as hash commitments broadcast
 periodically to the root blockchain (i e Ethereum) or Plasma compatible blockchain computations 
 46
 Incentivizations
 The application of incentives to Platin’s Proof of Location protocol on the blockchain is one
 of the insights that founded Platin and is based on game theory models that are working in
 other cryptocurrencies They both encourage actors to nurture Platin’s strong safe peer topeer operation and discourage bad actors by punishing those who act maliciously 
 07
 47
 Platin’s fungible utility token the PTN with its smallest unit pli is the primary continuously operating incentive
 unit on Platin’s blockchain PTN is fungible meaning it can be exchanged for other currencies empowering it
 to incentivize and mold the behavior of platform participants Varying amounts are rewarded to nodes that run
 Platin Policies (with their associated PALs) of varying complexity A simple policy pays minimal fees An elaborate
 policy such as one requiring AI powered location history analysis or zero knowledge credentials rewards higher
 fees Baking these fees into Platin’s consensus and incentive structures ensures that the Platin ledger does not
 become bogged down with low value high bandwidth work or malicious attempts to create artificial bottlenecks 
 Platin allows arbitrarily complex location validations to be processed so it is important to measure the work done
 directly instead of just choosing a fee based on the length of the policy being processed 
 Nodes can earn PTN or pli by participating in attestation and secure location witnessing Secure beacons 
 whether standalone or integrated into IoT devices can continuously earn PTN over time The rate of earning
 correlates with the number of Platin policies that request a validation from that beacon so beacons in busier 
 more populated areas have the potential to perform witnessing more frequently and as a result earn more PTN 
 Secure beacon PALs can share analytics enabling participating businesses to project revenue as for example
 “How much can a vehicle in my fleet earn as it drives around a metropolitan neighborhood running a secure
 beacon ” These models will be shared as they mature 
 PTN pricing can also enforce disincentives For example creating overly aggressive policies that hoard location
 proofs will be made to cost more PTN 
 Preventing large swings in token price and maintaining the cost effectiveness of everyday transactions is achieved
 by protections similar to Ethereum’s price adjustments around Gas These transparent robust and adjustable
 mechanisms rest on the three main approaches to token stability 
 • Static price fallbacks a fallback price since static pricing changes relatively slowly
 • Price indexing An index based on a gross moving average
 • Real time demand pricing market forces dictating how much people are willing to pay and how much
 nodes are requesting
 7 1 Incentive Prices
 Just as the Wei and the Satoshi are the smallest units of an Ether and a Bitcoin respectively pli is the smallest
 indivisible unit of a PTN The Platin pli is also an acronym describing the function of the pli within the Platin
 incentive mechanism the Performance Linked Incentive 
 Note PTN is a utility token enabling incentivized Proof of Location operations PTN holders have a right to access
 and drive usage of located digital assets on the platform by paying transaction fees in PTN The tokens may be
 used for payments and transactions relating to location claims PTN is not an investment vehicle 
 48
 To better understand the structure of the PTN a single PTN token is divisible into one billionth or ten decimal
 places as follows 
 Platin’s incentive model is based on nodes running the Platin Pocket™ providing witnessing to surrounding
 location claims within proximity Depending on the complexity of the transaction and policy each transaction on
 the Platin blockchain may include a different gas price which is paid to miners and participating witnesses 
 0 0000000001 PTN = 1 pli
 1 PTN = 1 000 000 000 pli
 7 2 Signal Harvesting (Mining)
 The enormous field of digital signals that surrounds us everywhere enables Platin users to engage in Proof
 of Location mining Radio waves cell tower signals WiFi Bluetooth and other signals in a node’s vicinity are
 harvested into Merkle trees Like harvesting wheat growing in a pasture Platin nodes collect signal meta data and
 measurements and receive a reward in PTNX utility tokens (the ERC 20 variant of the PTN utility token which is
 dedicated to compensating participating nodes in signal harvesting and location data mining) 
 Signal harvesting is truly democratized cryptocurrency mining representing a low cost low friction way to quickly
 become involved with PoL mining as the data collected by harvesting enables the Platin Plexus to perform secure
 location verifications for future PoL requests 
 7 3 Gas Price Tables
 Pricing structures in Platin are dynamic in order to accommodate changing market conditions and maintain
 proper gas levels At any given moment a clear list of prices will be available for transactions

 Secure
 Verification of
 Location Claims
 One of the key mechanisms that underpins the security of Platin is secure verification of
 location claims Platin supports a wide range of localization techniques and takes a pragmatic
 approach to location verification it therefore provides a good tradeoff between user effort 
 service availability and security 
 Platin relies on sensor fusion on mobile device user’s behavior over time and peer to peer
 observations In addition Platin leverages trusted anchors to increase the confidence in
 asserted location claims 
 One of the core strengths of Platin is diversity of sensing modalities and witnesses 
 and their smart aggregation that will make it challenging and costly for adversaries to
 successfully claim fake locations In addition Platin rewards honest behavior therefore
 disincentivizing cheating Platin does not rely on a single technology but on a range of sensing 
 communication and positioning technologies 
 08
 52
 8 1 The Three Pillars
 The three pillars of security in Platin are as follows 
 8 1 1 Sensor Fusion
 Platin makes use of on device location relevant sensors such as GNSS (e g GPS Galileo) Bluetooth 
 accelerometers WiFi and cellular network observations Both Android and iOS allow for these sensors to be
 combined in different ways and provide sufficient precision Platin combines different sensors’ values in a robust
 manner to counter simple spoofing attacks It will further where available use trusted computing technologies
 such as ARM TrustZone [TZ] and Intel SGX [SGX] to protect location reporting from on device manipulations (e g 
 [NDSS14]) A dedicated user can still jailbreak the platform and spoof the measurements [REF] as well as spoof
 the GNSS BT WiFi and cellular signals that the platform receives [REF][REF] Such spoofing although feasible 
 comes at a cost for the user The user needs to relay cellular signals generate GNSS signals and emulate BSSIDs
 and WiFi access point MAC addresses as well as make all these signals mutually consistent Such an effort would
 be justifiable only if the reward is high 
 In order to thwart these spoofing attacks Platin will analyze consistency among sensed values user behavior
 over time and use peer to peer witnessing 
 8 1 2 Behavior Over Time
 Platin will track mobile device locations over short time windows and user behavior over longer periods of time 
 Short time observations will allow Platin to implement anomaly detection techniques and evaluate the validity
 of location claims Platin will also peer into users overall behavior over time including their location and prior
 coin claims and use these to build up users’ reputation scores All this will be done securely and in highly privacy
 preserving manner that protect users’ identities These scores will increase when users behave honestly and
 decrease when suspicious activity is identified To incentivize honest behavior high scores will be rewarded 
 XAIN Technologies XAIN technology in partnership with Platin brings the strengths of modern machine
 learning algorithms particularly reinforcement learning to Platin’s secure Proof of
 Location 
 XAIN enables Platin’s PALs to send advanced machine learning based algorithms to the
 node and return an assurance that the history of behavior is within expected ranges 
 Artificial
 Intelligence
 New and existing developments in artificial intelligence enable to secure both sensor
 fusion and behavior over time With the availability of large quantities of data one can
 train AI models that capture and classify fine nuances in high dimensional data thereby
 allowing sophisticated pattern validation in an efficient yet secure manner Techniques
 like federated learning can help to ensure privacy and gain expertise from the data 
 without actually sharing the data The partnership with XAIN enables Platin to delve into
 established AI expertise and technology to create custom and optimized solutions 
 53
 Anomaly Detection To enable secure Proof of Location one needs to be able to distinguish between regular
 or expected behavior on the one hand and irregular or unexpected behavior on the
 other One important technique to realize a system that can make such distinctions
 is machine learning based anomaly detection Its overall goal is to find a model that
 represents the “normal” state of a particular subject i e regular location behavior over
 time With the support of sensor fusion such patterns become increasingly difficult to
 forge since even slight deviations from correlated behavior of different sensors can be
 detected 
 8 1 3 Peer to Peer Witnessing
 Users will be able to act as witnesses for each others’ locations through the use of short range communication
 techniques such as Bluetooth WiFi ultrasound and camera Platin envisions that most of this interaction
 happens without any user involvement Platin relies primarily on Bluetooth beaconing mechanisms but will
 integrate any new types of proximity detection technologies that become available Some witnessing will be
 more interactive and involve user interaction (e g the use of QR codes) Users’ efforts in verifying other’s location
 claims will be rewarded 
 8 1 4 Potential Attack Vectors
 The Platin system is built with security baked in from the start To understand how the Three Pillars cooperate to
 protect the system let’s examine two possible attacks 
 Attack Scenario #1 A Fortune 500 retail chain has issued its own cryptocurrency and is offering free money
 at a new store opening in a major city The coins are worth about $10 so hackers are motivated to spoof their
 location to collect the coins They pay a local citizen to record the signals at the site and share them over the
 internet They set their phones to fake locations label a local Wi Fi APN to the name of the APN on site install the
 Platin Pocket™ and attempt to claim the coin 
 Prevention The Verifier detects that the sensor fusion and behavior over time are fraudulent The claim is
 denied 
 Attack Scenario #2 A national cryptocurrency establishes a tax free zone using Platin Proof of Location to
 determine if a person is physically in the zone when a transaction takes place This includes digital transactions 
 such as ordering goods from online retailers Total tax savings over a year may add up to thousands of dollars 
 attracting attackers They raise a botnet of virtual Android mobile phone instances They “train” these virtual
 devices on fake GPS and mobility data from the region then install the Platin Pocket 
 Prevention Real witnesses in the region and other nearby nodes regularly cannot be detected by the botnet
 virtual devices failing witnessing proofs Furthermore behavior over time is often inaccurate The claims are
 denied 
 54
 8 2 Trusted Anchors
 Trusted anchors are dedicated devices and high trust users that provide witnessing and beaconing and
 witnessing services for Platin They record beacons from users and provide beacons and challenges to the users 
 These challenges will come in a form of location and time unique beacons and interactive challenge response
 protocols over the wireless and ultrasonic channels as well as in the form of a visual challenges where the user
 will be asked to scan QR codes or take photos to prove its presence in a particular location Platin anchors will
 also be integrated within different IoT devices like Amazon Echo [ECHO] Apple Homepod [POD] and leverage
 different sonic and wireless secure proximity verification technologies such as [SEC] and [3DB] 
 8 3 Secure Proximity Verification
 Future radio technologies such as WiFi 802 11mc/az [MC][AZ] and Ultra Wide Band 802 15 4f/a [15A][15F] all
 allow peer to peer distance measurements This means that soon all devices will be able to seamlessly measure
 their mutual distances and establish proximity therefore naturally supporting witnessing In addition some new
 802 15 4f compatible radios also offer full spoofing protection preventing proximity manipulations by users
 [3DB] This means that in the future secure proximity verification could become fully integrated within all main
 mobile platforms therefore enhancing the imperviousness of Platin to location manipulation attacks

 Conclusion
 What we do with our location information is deeply shaped by the format of the location
 information Your location is known to the people around you but they only see your
 physical presence and may not know your name Your phone’s location is known to your
 mobile telephone network operator but you cannot share this say with your insurer even
 if you wished to When your friend wants to know where you are you have a whole set of
 expectations that differ when your bank your insurer your search engine your browser your
 delivery service your doctor your lawyer your mother want to know where you are Your
 cellphone provider knows where you are your package delivery service knows where you are 
 your cleaning lady knows where you are your mother knows where you are and on and on 
 Each bring about in you a different set of desires as to whether you wish to share your location
 or not 
 Platin enables a new way of sharing location information You decide who to share it with and
 how Privacy preserving easy to use PALs lock up your information with cryptography so that
 your information only does what you wish it to do And you can earn money for participating
 in the system Such a privacy preserving location protocol is a game changer Yesterday 
 location claims were made separately insecurely without one claim being able to be used with
 another
