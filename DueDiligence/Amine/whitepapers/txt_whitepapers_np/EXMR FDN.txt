Blockchain The blockchain of the Ethereum has a high technological level it works very similar to Bitcoin but above all the most important thing the blockchain consists of a series of blocks and each block contains a pointer to the previous block and an ordered list of operations Blocks are secured by the proof of work with a long chain (as defined by the total difficulty) by defining the set of committed transactions and order that must be processed To get to the current state of the Ethereum blockchain a node can start from the State of genesis (a common initial state that is included with each client from Ethereum) and process each transaction any balance/sequence resulting from the application number code storage changes sequentially processing and code of execution of the transaction The same process occurs in Bitcoin Although Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99 s emphasis on transition state of the execution of the transaction model is unique (for example in Bitcoin a transaction often philosophical is seen as an expense outputs from a previous operation in history not in objects in the State) the way it works the code Ethereum Bitcoin and other protocols such as Ripple Dogecoin etc is essentially the same 10 EXMR FDN EXMR FDN is replacing EXMR was created the last October 2017 EXMR FDN believes that up to 75 million this means an increase in our community Name EXMR FDN Symbol
