Ubricoin (UBN) as a utility token for producing health and for building incentives for excellence in education The information set forth in this document may be changed for any reason may not be exhaustive and does not imply any elements of a contractual relationship Although Ubricoin holders have a claim to the coin and access to the Ubrica ecosystem they are not entitled to any dividends or other revenue The distribution of UBN coin is governed by the distribution program described in Chapter 10 of this document The price of the UBN will largely be controlled by the action of its users The owners of UBN are granted an opportunity to contribute to the larger systems facilitating excellence in education and production of health This third edition of Whitepaper\xe2\x80\x99s sole purpose is to provide relevant and reasonable information to you in order for you to determine whether to take part in Ubrica Project by acquiring UBN VERSION 2 2 This version contains material revisions of previous versions dated September 1 2018 and December 1 2018 The revisions are occasioned by deeper understanding of use of blockchain in global health space and the implication of token economy in a lifescience and health ecosystem The second version contained in depth explanation of the token economy created by UBN and about how UBN will work as a utility token The third version remodels the distribution of UBN by giving out the coin to a target user population instead selling it to random people in the world Giving away UBN in this manner obviates that need to conduct an initial coin offering UBN is already money and does not need to be sold for money As a utility token we just need to give individuals in an ecosystem who would be future users of the coin We distributed tw0 billion UBN units for to future users of the Ubrica ecosystem By creating a large user community in a concentrated target population UBN will gain value spontaneously in the market and will spread organically to other populations in the world VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 4 DOCUMENT DEVELOPMENT TEAM Dr Macharia Waruingi Chief Document

TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 12 1 INTRODUCTION We developed Ubricoin on blockchain to serve as a platform devoted to improving quality of health for all Ubricoin will help achieve universal health and therefore global health We will use Ubricoin to develop health industry and create market intelligence through a cryptocurrency reward system that will inspire positive contribution to health improvement around the world We will use a smart review system to reward consumers for positive health behavior Educators at all levels of education researchers and practitioners at all levels will receive rewards for excellence quality of work and positive contribution to society We believe in a future where everybody has access to best health products and services We believe in great health that is easily accessible and affordable to all We believe in a future of universal health access We expect that Ubricoin will improve health related quality of life (QOL) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) In addition we believe that Ubricoin will reduce the enormous burden of disease (BoD) particularly in the developing world and eliminate years of life lost (YLL) due to disease 1 1 Blockchain Blockchain is a time stamped set of immutable records managed by many independent computers owned by many people and distributed all over the world Each record is tied together with many other records to form a block Each block is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic code VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 13 The blockchain has no central authority As a shared open and immutable ledger the information in the blockchain is open for anyone and everyone to see Hence anything built on the blockchain is by its very nature transparent The blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated and safe manner it carries no or negligible transaction cost A transaction is verified by millions of computers distributed around the net The verified transaction is added to a chain which is added to a block This creates a unique record with a unique history Altering a single transaction would alters the entire chain and it would be rejected by the chain This makes it impossible to alter information on the chain Ubricoin uses this security model for monetary transactions but it can be deployed in many others ways One of the problems that blockchain will solve is that of money transfer Today if a person A in United States wants to send money to person B in Kenya he/she has to go to a trusted third party say a bank Person A in United States will deposit the money with the trusted third party who in turn will identify and validate person B in Kenya The trusted third party will then move the money to person B after taking a fee (Figure 1) The process may take three or more days sometimes a week VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH Person A Send money to B Trusted Third Party Identifies and validates Person B 14 Person B Receives money after three days and after three days and after trusted third party takes a fee FIGURE 1 TRADITIONAL METHOD OF MOVING MONEY Blockchain enables transfer of money without trusted third party without delay and without fees (Figure 2) Blockchain enables people to move money directly to one another Nakamoto (2008) referred to this method as peer topeer Person Person A B Send money to B Immediately No transaction fees Receives money FIGURE 2 MOVING MONEY ON THE BLOCKCHAIN VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 15 In a nutshell blockchain moves money faster than three days Indeed it moves money immediately Moving money on blockchain is cheaper there is no third party collecting fees 1 1 1 How the Blockchain Works How does the blockchain address this money transfer problem For the blockchain to work it relies on three major process (a) open ledger (b) distributed ledger and (c) miners 1 1 1 2 Open Ledger Blockchain is a public ledger The chain of transactions done on blockchain are open for everyone to see Everyone in the network can see where the money is where it is going and where it has come from The open ledger shows how much money each of the actors has in his or her wallet and everyone can decide whether a transaction is valid or not If a transaction is not valid it is not added to the open ledger It is rejected and does not become part of the chain 1 1 1 3 Distributed Ledger Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to get rid of centralized ledger Blockchain takes the centralized ledger and distributes it across all actors We call all these actors nodes each person in the network is running the software application on his or her computer or mobile device In a network of four actors A B C and D actor A\xe2\x80\x99s application downloads and continually updates a copy of the ledger so does actor B and so does actor C and so does actor D Each of the four has the same copy of the ledger updated continuously Anyone else who joins the network will have the same copy of the ledger The ledger is distributed across a network of nodes VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 16 To avoid problems all the copies of the ledger in the network must remain synchronized All participants in the network must see the same copy This leads to the third principle of the blockchain miners 1 1 1 4 Miners Now we have an open ledger that everyone can see The ledger is distributed across multiple nodes The question becomes how in a distributed ledger can nodes understand and synchronize the ledger among themselves Miners are special nodes which can hold the ledger The miners compete among themselves to validate transactions and put them on the ledger The first miner who will validate the transaction will get a financial reward for example a Bitcoin In order to be the first to take the transaction and put it on the ledger a miner needs to do two things \xef\x82\xb7 Validate the new transaction This is easy the ledger is open and anyone can immediately calculate whether the sender has the funds in order to make the transfer \xef\x82\xb7 Find a special key that will enable to take the present transaction add to the previous transaction and lock it In order to find this key the miner needs to invest computational power and time because the search for the key is random The miner is repeatedly guessing new key until he/she finds the key that matches the random puzzle The first miner to do that will get financial reward This economic incentive essentially ensures that collectively they agree on what is the official ledger that should be used by everyone Synchronizing the ledger across the network a miner will be able to solve the transaction and add it to the ledger The miner will then broadcast that information to the entire network He will say \xe2\x80\x9chere is a validated transaction VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 17 and here is the key that enables everyone on the network to take it and add it to their own ledger \xe2\x80\x9d What are the other minors going to do They will see that the transaction is already validated and added to the ledger which means there is no point in trying to solve this transaction again The other miners will immediately take this transaction add it to their own ledger and will look for another transaction to work on and hopefully get a reward next time 1 2 WHY BLOCKCHAIN A fully decentralized business needs both a decentralized infrastructure and a decentralized decision making Every user in this network becomes the owner of the network too Blockchain facilitates the inclusion of fringe stakeholders to position of salience at the core of decision making We will use blockchain to facilitate meaningful interactions among peers working together in Ubrica ecosystem To start Ubricoin will facilitate point of sale payment system for Ubrica\xe2\x80\x99s e commerce platform (sokojanja com) Ubricoin will reduce friction of currency in the trade and facilitate real time transfer of cash Ubricoin will also act as the escrow to protect its members from fraud by eliminating middlemen who do not usually provide value for money Blockchain aims at changing the external environment by including the distant voices from the fringe stakeholders who are most of times neglected in our societies This will help us understand the concerns of distant and diverse stakeholders Including the fringe stakeholders allows Ubrica to understand the complex and evolving issues that may potentially affect the basis of its future and addressing them Ubricoin gives us an opportunity to build an incentive structure for goodwill and excellence We will therefore focus on giving incentives to traditionally VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 18 marginalized hardworking people who contribute knowledge for the betterment of humanity 1 3 Relationship between Blockchain Money and Law Blockchain money and law interact to create a new phenomenon of freedom of measuring value of information (Gilder 2016) Information technology has existed since its inception in the 1930s without building capability for measuring value Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s (2009) discovery of time stamp to solve the double spending problem on the blockchain gave information network a valid measurement of value that translate into money Bitcoin was born as a smart contract that enables transfer of value among people transacting on the network Buterin\xe2\x80\x99s (2012) innovation gave us Ethereum blockchain that allows everyone to build smart contracts This system can resolve disputes directly and efficiently reducing lawyer/client work load Smart contract escrow will replace escrow accounts managed my law firms The escrow in the smart contract will manage the promises of payments and release money when conditions are met Blockchain will also improve the effectiveness of the criminal justice system The blockchain works with three processes open ledger distributed ledger and miners Information recorded on open ledger is there for everyone to see therefore improving the quality of police work who investigate crime and the court system that prosecutes the offenders The distributed ledger is immutable and indestructible because it is hosted on millions of nodes in the network All the nodes agree on the valid document by consensus Business will benefit from blockchain technology The earlier a business adopts the blockchain technology the better Industries that implement blockchain will find it far easier to enforce standard operating procedures within their organizations Information is readily verifiable on the immutable record Mission critical terms and conditions specified for particular products cannot be changed Blockchain uses consensus algorithm to validate transactions In order VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 19 to participate in validating transactions a person must expend enormous energy and computing power The validator also known as a miner has to pay out of pocket for the electrical energy and powerful computers The validator is paid only when he or she verifies a valid transaction and posts it to the open ledger for everyone to see Posting an invalid transaction does not attract a reward it results in a loss of money spent on electrical energy and computing power This mining process secures accountability that could spur widespread improvement in capitalist ethos It will make it easier to discover exploitative or environmentally damaging practices Blockchain in a powerful technology whose power will expand in the coming years In the legal and business world it will enhance precision and accountability VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 20 2 UBRICOIN Ubricoin is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum protocol It is a peer to peer utility token that will give incentives to anyone in the world to facilitate global health We will use Ubricoin to create platforms to support life science research and development generic drugs manufacturing and health services delivery Ubricoin will be the gateway to the biomedical world which comprises Soko Janja health services delivery science and technology parks and biomedical industrial city (Figure 3) Ubricoin will expand Ubrica\xe2\x80\x99s capability to host future worthy life science and health blockchain projects and spinoffs UBRICOIN Ecosystem r&d Soko Janja publishing spinoff company generic manufacturing health services new product development FIGURE 3 USES OF UBRICOIN LIFESCIENCE AND HEALTH PROJECTS BUILT ON UBRICOIN BLOCKCHAIN VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 21 We created 10 000 000 000 (ten billion) Ubricoins (UBN) UBN refers to one Ubricoin The smallest unit of UBN a Brevis is one billionth of a UBN As an ERC20 token a UBN is configured to be used globally by all individuals A UBN derives value from the exchange with Ether We intend to distribute and sell the 10 billion UBNs on Ethereum blockchain The UBN will comply with the ERC20 standard and it will be transferable on Ethereum platform 2 1 Ubricoin as a Utility Token A UBN is a utility token that represents future access to Ubrica ecosystem We will use Ubricoin to develop products and services that the token holders will later redeem for goods and services developed by the token Tokens are of two types (a) equity tokens and (b) utility tokens Equity tokens are investment instruments There are two types of utility tokens (a) digital coupons and (b) tokens that provide users with access to its decentralized forum (i e Soko Janja) Ubrica tokens are classified as utility tokens and participants in the Ubrican community can buy them for to access the Ubrica ecosystem Ubrica will issue tokens for development of its projects and creation of excellence This will allow the token holders to buy different Ubrica products or services in future The main purpose of Ubricoin is to get access to the Ubrica ecosystem but not to gain profits or dividends Token holders will be enrolled on Soko Janja at no cost and get medical services at a URCC near them The main value of the token is access to Ubrica\xe2\x80\x99s proof of stake protocol tokenization platform In proof of stake Ubricoin will incentivize actors by assigning them units of Brevis for creating blocks (i e block rewards) It will also give privileges to incentive actors by giving them decision making rights that can be used to extract rent (e g transaction fees) In proof of excellence Ubricoin will increase actor token balances or give them privileges if they do something good If they VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 22 do something bad Ubricoin will reduce actor token balances and revoke privileges 2 2 WHY UBRICOIN Ubricoin will support design development and implementation of Ubrica project to decentralize global health Ubrica project involves building world class capability for high quality life science and health production (LSHP) in the world We will build a model physical project in Kenya Ubrica project in Kenya will create a node for highly advanced biomedical research and development and highest quality health care services The project will ensure sufficient support for discovery of solutions to most vexing health problems in the world particularly those emerging from the African continent and other developing parts of the world Ubricoin will help gather intelligent data about health nutrition information and diseases Artificial intelligence will facilitate the presence of global health Data gathered will help us develop smart community health decision support system smart public health decision support system and smart clinical decision support systems The implication of artificial intelligence will include \xef\x82\xb7 early disease detection algorithm built on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) \xef\x82\xb7 health and diseases monitoring \xef\x82\xb7 effect and impact evaluation of health programs \xef\x82\xb7 improved data security accuracy and speed of diagnosis Blockchain technology will create cash incentive tokens for supporting development of scientific products and the commercialization of products in the online marketing and retail platform called Soko Janja We will use Ubricoin to create incentives for research and development and commercialization of VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 23 complete research products This involves building world class capability and capacity for health and clinical research in African countries It also involves research reporting through peer to peer reviewed papers by creating incentive token to the authors This will lead to more people taking part in growing scientific knowledge in Africa 2 3 COIN DISTRIBUTION We plan Ubricoin distribution in the following manner \xef\x82\xb7 3 4 billion (17%) UBNs for community development The community

3 UBRICA GLOBAL HEALTH PROJECT We created Ustawi Biomedical Research Innovation and Industrial Centers of Africa (UBRICA) to address three key problems of health in Africa (a) lack of access to health services (b) poor quality of health services and (c) high cost of care We plan to overcome access problem in two ways One way is to support construction of widely distributed clinical facilities integrated with retail centers and produce processing workshops Such facilities will be known as URCCs The other way is to increase supply of money by facilitating trade by online and onsite retails markets We shall improve quality of medical services by supporting design development and science and technology parks (STPs) adjacent to all universities in Kenya The STPs will promote translation and commercialization of university and community knowledge This will bring to being new knowledge technologies and services that of great quality We shall overcome high cost of medical services by construction of a biomedical industrial city (BMIC) It is in the BMIC that we will support education and manufacturing of a full range of medical devices and all products used in health system Locally manufactures technologies will be cheaper than imported versions VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 29 Ubrica is embodies as a global health project built on three pillars (Figure 5) (a) smart contract pillar (b) human engagement pillar and (c) projects pillar We describe the phased implementation program for the three pillars UBRICA PROJECT SMART CONTRACT HUMAN ENGAGEMENT CRYPTOECONOMICS BREVIS EXCELLENCE INCENTIVES PROJECTS URCC SOKO JANJA STPs BMIC FIGURE 5 THREE PILLARS OF THE UBRICA PROJECT\xe2\x80\x94STRATEGY FOR FUNDING UNIVERSAL HEALTH ACCESS 3 1 SMART CONTRACT A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract and facilitates all steps of contracting process (Szabo 1994) Computer program enforces a contract between two or more parties It executes the rules when all conditions are met Smart contracts are built on blockchain and inherits blockchain property (i e immutable distributed and decentralized providing digital security) Smart contracts are self executing They eliminate the third party by solving issues in a way that does not require trust and remove human judgment The smart contract facilitates verifies and enforces negotiations by implementing deterministic rules through a logic in a computer code (Buterin 2012) Smart contracts help exchange money property shares or anything of value in a transparent conflict free way while avoiding the services of a middleman Smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does but also automatically enforce those obligations VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 30 3 1 1 Smart contract escrow in Soko Janja Ubricoin smart contract will act as an escrow to the Ubrica e commerce Soko Janja During purchase the consumer will order an item and send Ubricoins to the smart contract The smart contract will generate a code and send it to the buyer The code will only be known by buyer The smart contract will hold the Ubricoin until delivery Upon delivery of the item the buyer will give the seller the code to add to the smart contract or the buyer will send the code to the contract as an acknowledgment of the receipt of the item The smart contract will have a provision to divide the proceeds to different pools such as courier services and health fund Time is set upon which if the item is not delivered in time the contract becomes void and the money is sent back to the buyer The time limit helps incase the seller decides not to deliver the item We will also use the smart contract for health financing by pooling health funds as explained in chapter 7 This will allow risk sharing in the health sector while thinking about how to put money in people pockets to fund health Ubricoin smart contract will facilitate verify negotiate and conclude contracts between individuals and their contracting party VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 31 3 1 2 Smart Reward Using the smart contract we will create a crypto currency program to reward excellence through a reward system The smart reward system will help actors in the various industries to act properly towards the betterment of the community We will issue rewards in different sectors affected by poor quality of services or inactivity In the education sector we will create a reward system for teaching research and practice The current health sector is dominated by poor quality of services The reward system will give incentives to health professional who demonstrate quality of care and document their work for others to learn from We shall also reward the use of Ubricoin for financial transactions in everyday practice Buying from local suppliers and manufacturers on Soko Janja (peer to peer) will attract rewards The reward system will allow every consumer of services to get a chance to rate his/her provider in the decentralized application 3 2 HUMAN ENGAGEMENT The human engagement pillar involves engaging people at their basic level of existence to discover how they can work together to create wealth Members engaged will enter into a distributed autonomous organization (DAO) known as the Co operative Society of Ubricans (CSU) We have created an online retail store known as Soko Janja (see shop ubrica com) where members can buy and sell produce products and services from one another 3 3 PROJECTS Ubrica project comprises three distinct scientific real estate projects a series of world class health centers university science and technology parks and a biomedical industrial city in Kenya These projects are the rationale for issuing UBNs We will sell coins project wise with each project taking four phases VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 32 3 3 1 Ubrica Retail Clinical Centers We intend to construct at least 100 health centers that will be leased to qualifying health professionals on a 20 year mortgage agreement 3 3 2 University Science and Technology Parks We will facilitate design development and implementation of 66 Science and Technology Parks (STPs) for universities 3 3 3 Biomedical Industrial City We propose to implement Biomedical Industrial City in Kenya known as Ubrica One Ubrica one project is planned and designed to meet the full range of health needs including curative and preventive services of those residing and working in the Medical City as well as those visiting the Medical City for medical tourism and other purposes VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 33 4 SMART REWARD (CRYPTOECONOMICS) We have built on blockchain technology a decentralized model that will overcome shortage of financing for health which has been the thorniest issue in global health Lack of funding for health in many countries of the world has led to increased burden of disease years of life lost due to illness very poor quality of life and very low quality adjusted life years We strive to create a health conscious community that rewards people who provide valuable contribution to education and knowledge in lifescience and health Through a smart reward system we will see a rise in emergence of new knowledge and solutions to most vexing issues in health Ubricoin will reach a broad market for knowledge production that will include billions of people in developing countries who have been excluded from health care and from financial systems Ubricoin on blockchain for global health is extremely powerful as it will build financial incentives for traditionally marginalized hardworking people who contribute knowledge for the betterment of humanity For the first time in history of mankind hundreds of millions of people who contribute good deeds to improvement of health related quality of life of human race will receive incentives for their good deeds VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 34 This smart reward system will unlock unprecedented amount of funds to support advancement in knowledge in general particularly in lifescience and health production in the world Good teachers who care deeply about their students good researchers who contribute to new knowledge and good practitioners who strive to provide greatest quality of service will receive financial incentives for their good deeds Ubricoin crypto currency reward program involves creating incentive programs to reward excellence in education research and practice The program rewards the use of Ubricoin for financial transactions in everyday practice Buying from local suppliers and manufacturers on Soko Janja will attract rewards By doing so quality of medical and health care will improve all over the world It is widely documented that people living in developing countries do not have access to good quality education products of research and professional services Much worse developing countries are not at the forefront of biomedical research development innovation and commercialization of research knowledge into commercial products and services The enterprise for translation of science into products for everyday domestic use and clinical care does not exist in developing countries because there is no incentive for creating such enterprises Absence of biomedical and health care innovation has resulted in a huge burden of disease in developing countries Innovation in biomedical and health ecosystems rely on good financial incentives The global financial community has not created financial incentives for biomedical innovation and health production Lo (2016) explained that when financial innovation is absent in a particular field of science large scale innovation in that field is not possible By contrast with financial innovation any level of innovation is possible in any field of science According to Lo when financial innovation in a field is present large scale VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 35 innovation is possible in that field Lo adds that financial innovation is a necessary and sufficient condition for any other innovation to occur Furthermore the global financial system has enough financial resources to solve all global health problems This means that we have enough money in the world to support best quality health care for everyone We however have lacked the technology to organize it To overcome this problem Ubricoin will build financial incentives that will ensure continuous throughput of scientific innovation in service of health production in the developing world To be successful Ubricoin will have to reward all stages of knowledge production beginning with primary school education (Table 1) Education excellence reward system will offer tokens to primary school teachers secondary school teachers university educators researchers and post university practitioners Service quality smart reviews will provide community of users the power to incentivize quality and eliminate mediocrity in academia and industry Ubricoin self executing smart review contract will be the most powerful tool to improve service quality and establish loyal customer base TABLE 1 SMART CONTRACT

\x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 37 4 1 1 Incentives for high Quality Knowledge in Primary and Secondary Schools For primary school and high school teachers we will create a rating system on blockchain to reward excellence in practice We will issue Brevis to teachers who demonstrate commitment and dedication to student learning The students will use the system to rate their teachers and the rating points will convert to Brevis The rating system will be embodied on teachers\xe2\x80\x99 class attendance quality of teaching and engaging students in practical work 4 1 2 Incentives for High Quality Knowledge in University University lecturers/professors will be rewarded for demonstrating quality knowledge transfer to their students This will be done through the rating system where the students will rate their professors based on the knowledge gained and their satisfaction on the content delivered Brevis will be issued based on a rating system with those with good rating receiving the tokens We will also offer incentives for lecturers who will develop original proposals and peer reviewed papers To encourage sharing of research work we will offer incentives to people who present their original research in conferences and commercialization their research We will reward lecturers and professors who show interest and commitment in reviewing of research papers and publishing and running journals on Ubrica Journal System 4 1 3 Incentives for Professional Practice Professionals lack incentive to do good in society today Using Ubricoin we will issue tokens to individuals who demonstrate good professional practice work ethics and good customer service We will create a rating system where professionals will be rated by peers and consumers This will act to improve quality in all sectors and eliminate inadequacy and corruption in practice 4 1 4 Incentives for Shopping on Soko Janja VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 38 To promote village level commerce we will offer tokens to people who buy things made by local manufacturers To facilitate local economy we will issue rewards for user registration into on Soko Janja platform Consumers who will register and provide additional profile information will receive Brevis Purchasing and referring new users in Soko Janja will attract reward 4 1 5 Airdrops Airdrops are coins sent to the users wallet addresses at no cost The coins are sent in the process of distributing tokens to users of a cryptocurrency (e g Ubricoin) The users are required to perform certain task as directed during airdrops announcements The airdrops are used to create awareness of the coin and to reward loyalty We will use the airdrops to create a larger Ubricoin community A large community will create a more decentralized network which in turn will increase the level of security in the Ubricoin network We will offer airdrops inform of Brevis to users (people who hold the Ubricoin on their wallets) and to Ubrica project supporters We will also issue Brevis to people who will use our coin to do transactions We will have two forms of airdrops planned and surprise airdrops The planned airdrops will be used to create awareness and the surprise airdrops will be used to reward loyal coin holders (i e those who will hold the Ubricoin and those who will use Ubricoin for transactions) VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 39 5 HUMAN ENGAGEMENT Our human engagement pillar involves engaging people at their basic level of existence to discover how we can work with them to create wealth The common Notions We know that a person becomes poor when he or she is unable to exchange his goods or services for currency When a person cannot find market for his or her products services or farm produce he or she ends up being poor Nearly 95% of people living in Kenya are unable to find market for more than 80% of their farm produce Kenyan subsistent croppers and pastoralists living in rural areas are extremely impoverished because they cannot find market for their produce The only available market comes to them in form of organized cartels who buy the farm produce and livestock at a throwaway price Even at this throwaway price cartels are only able to purchase less than 20% of all the produce The rest goes to waste Perishable produce such as fruits vegetable flowers animal products are rotting away in the villages of Kenya This extreme waste of produce of the land kills all possibility of generating wealth for the local people and multiplies by several orders of magnitude the rotting capital in the country (see e g de Soto 2002) 5 1 The Quandary Without anywhere to sell produce a subsistent cropper or a livestock producer slides into extreme poverty When sick she is afraid to seek medical service until the disease advances and becomes incapacitating She is forced by worsening 5 2 VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 40 disease to seek medical care and arrives at a medical facility without enough money to pay for medical service Her money does not cover for the medical service offered by the provider at the medical facility The provider reduces the quality and quantity of service offering to match the little money available from the patient The problem is that the provider of medical service receives hundreds of patients with advanced disease but with little or no money In most cases the patient cannot pay anything at all This severe lack of money to pay the providers in Kenya has led to a severe decline in the quality of medical service Many owners of health facilities have to cut corners just to make ends meet Cutting corners by a medical provider means cutting a critical service increased risk of worsening of disease medical errors or introduction of new diseases Distressed medical providers in Kenya are offering the lowest quality experienced in the world Low quality medical service is a serious health hazard to the people which by itself results in death of health consumers in many instances Health providers are seriously concerned by this problem Without access to money however and surrounded by masses of people with advanced disease they are between a rock and a hard place This is the quandary of health service 5 3 Fundamental Solution Logical reasoning indicates that the fundamental solution to health production problem lies in a system that improves the economy of each individual In line with this logic we have created a system to help people find market for their produce services and products In order to help a person he or she must first join and become a member of distributed autonomous organization (DAO) known as the Co operative Society of Ubricans (CSU) We intend to enroll 14 million families in Kenya alone Once joined our community workers help the member to send to market whatever he or she is producing We have created an online retail store known as Soko Janja (see shop ubrica com) where members can buy and sell produce products and services We have started enrolling individuals onto Soko Janja Enrolled individuals can post pictures of their products produce and services to the online retail store Members of the CSU VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 41 will use their wealth to finance health production for themselves and their loved ones We will use Ubricoin to facilitate the management of the online store Ubricoin will also be used at the point of sale in Soko Janja as well as an incentive structure to encourage people to buy from each other to activate local economy 5 4 SOKO JANJA 3 02 BILLION UBN We will distribute 3 02 billion UBNs to support our online retail store Soko Janja (see shop ubrica com) to help operationalize wealth creation by each individual in any given community We are proposing to build a platform that will be decentralized The platform will facilitate peer to peer trading without Ubrica mediating The trading will involve the use of Ubricoin as means of payment which will be validated by blockchain 5 4 1 The Reward System We will create an incentive structure to facilitate peer to peer trading and purchase of locally produced products produce and services Holders of Ubricoin purchasing locally produced products and services in Soko Janja will receive the services and products at a discount They will also receive loyalty points for shopping in Soko Janja VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 42 5 4 2 Reuse of Points Points received from shopping at Soko Janja will be used to access more products produce and services in the Ubrica ecosystem such as shopping at Soko Janja or access to health services in the URCCs and BMICs These 1 billion coins will be sold in four phases at $0 5 per UBN TABLE 2 UBRICOIN DISTRIBUTION

\x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 45 6 UBRICA RETAIL CLINICAL CENTERS Achieving universal health involving ensuring access Ubrica will build retail clinical centers called Ubrica Retail Clinical Centers (URCCs) We will use the URCC model to organize village level commerce A URCC will have three primary components a medical clinic a retail store and produce value addition and quality improvement workshop We intend to support design development and construction of at least 100 health centers that will be leased to qualifying health professionals on a 20 year mortgage agreement We will construct an average of two units per county in Kenya Some counties with greater population may have more than two Each center will have a fully furnished health center and a retail store Individuals enrolled into the CSU form the consumer base of the URCC Each URCC will serve a catchment population of about 300 000 people Thus 100 URCCs will serve at least 30 million people The URCC project requires US$ 1 billion We shall allocate 3 02 billion Ubricoins to fund design development and implementation of 100 URCCs in Kenya 6 1 URCCS 3 02 BILLION UBN We will allocate 3 02 billion UBNs to help in design development construction and management of the URCCs We intend to construct at least 100 health centers average of two units per county The 3 02 billion UBNs will be allocated in four phases 6 1 2 The Reward System VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 46 The aim of creating the URCCs is to build a healthy conscious community We will use Ubricoins to create an incentive structure to facilitate healthy behaviors We will issue points to people who \xef\x82\xb7 Practice preventive health such as exercise proper diet optimal sleep and early screening of diseases \xef\x82\xb7 Basic and secondary prevention of diseases such as diabetes hypertension and diagnosis checkups All points earned will go to the pooled smart

raised will be used for the design of the URCCs Desktop research will be carried out to determine the structure and requirements needed to construct the URCCs Field research and visiting the sites will be done to determine suitable areas for constructing the URCCs We will also do environmental studies and acquire permits We will do marketing to create awareness and identify doctors who will be running the clinics Public outreach and evaluation will be carried out to understand the scope of the project User research will also be done to determine our target audience and capacity for utilization of health services in each county User studies will include consumers of care providers of care and payers of care This will help in determining the optimal number of clinics for each county Counties with greater population may require more than two URCCs We will develop a program for quality training This will help improve the quality of care that will be provided in the clinics The identified doctors who will own the clinics will go through continuous professional development A fraction of the funds raised in this phase will be used for project planning (i e getting proper legal documents permits and doing feasibility studies) 6 1 2 Phase 2 allocation We will allocate 453 million UBNs in this phase These funds will be used for the development of URCCs We will hire consultants architects engineers planners construction security personnel and IT professionals This team will be responsible for planning and generating of construction documents for different counties 6 1 3 Phase 3 allocation VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 48 In this phase we will allocate 1 51 billion UBNs This will help us in acquisition of land and their title deeds for the implementation of the URCCs project This land will be sourced from different counties in Kenya Our goal is to ensure that we at least have land in all the 47 counties so as to effectively start the construction of the URCCs We will also use these funds to purchase clinical equipment required in the clinics 6 1 4 Phase 4 allocation We will allocate 906 million UBNs for management of the URCCs The funds will support mortgages to the doctors who will own the URCCs The mortgages will make it easy for fresh graduates to own clinics Some of the funds raised will be used in an incentive program We will reward health professionals with Brevis for provision of quality of care We will also issue tokens to individuals with good health seeking behaviors These incentives are meant to improve the quality of care and as motivation to the doctors Offering tokens to the patients will lead to early disease detection and prevention of diseases Funds raised from this phase will be used for continual growth and maintenance of the clinics and to set stage for long term success We will also hire teams which will be in charge of maintaining the equipment VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 49 7 UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE We focus on our intent to build Sustainable One Health Communities (SOHCs) comprising six primary components shown in Figure below FIGURE 6 PHYSIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF A SUSTAINABLE ONEHEALTH COMMUNITY VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 50 \xef\x82\xb7 A co operative Society of Ubricans (CSU) constituted by our members drawing from local communities \xef\x82\xb7 Produce/product workshops for improving quality and packaging of things produced by our members \xef\x82\xb7 A retail store that serves as a market for produce and products by members of the CSU \xef\x82\xb7 A one health clinic that provides clinical services to members of the CSU \xef\x82\xb7 A web/mobile platform (http //shop ubrica com/) for managing the commerce issuing from the retail system \xef\x82\xb7 A biomedical industrial city The retail store the one health clinic the co operative workshop and ecommerce platform activates the 4th element of health production We have designed SOHCs to overcome grand challenges in global health We recognize the critical role of animals environment and economy in human health We believe that sustainable health production in global health is a function of a system that integrates simultaneous operation of these four elements of human health animal health environmental health and economic health Our SOHCs are rooted in the conception that economic development is the most powerful means of health production Economic development is the greatest cause of improvement in health Economic health the 4th element of health production is the primary driver of sustainable one health in any community in the world It is common knowledge that compared to a wealthy person a poor person is more likely to get sick more likely to FIGURE 7 THE FOURTH ELEMENT OF HEALTH develop complications of disease more likely to succumb complications and to VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 51 develop disability due to disease and more likely to die from a disease It is impossible to improve health of a poor person in the long term without improving the wealth of the person in the long term 7 1 Fundamental Solution When we strike a sale at Soko Janja we divide the proceeds of produce/product sale into three fractions One fraction goes back to the member in form of profit Second fraction goes back to the co operative to meet operations and administration needs The third fraction sits in a health fun This is what is called health risk pooling A member seeking care at a health facility is fully covered The owners of health facility are happy because they are assured of payment of the quantity and quality of their service offering 7 1 1 Health Risk Pooling Pooling refers to collecting money from many people in a group so that the money collected is then used to pay for health services for its members Pooling risks together allows the higher costs of the less healthy to be offset by the relatively lower costs of the healthy Pooling ensures that the risk related to financing health is borne by all the members of the pool Its main purpose is to share the financial risk associated with disease disability and death for which there is uncertain need Smith and Witter (2004) explained that there are four classes of risk pooling (a) no risk pool under which all cost lies with the individual (b) unitary risk pool under which all cost is transferred to a single national pool (c) fragmented risk pools under which a series of independent risk pools (such as local governments or employer based pools) are used and (d) integrated risk pools under which fragmented risk pools are compensated for the variations in risk to which they are exposed Small fragmented risk pools which are the norm in developing countries have seriously adverse outcomes for the users of the health system VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 52 7 1 2 Pooled Smart Contract Each individual holder of Ubricoin will receive a smart contract to use health services at a URCC at the time of need Ubric6oin holders who will shop at Soko Janja practice healthy behaviors will get loyalty point inform of Brevis The Brevis will go to the pooled smart contract to be used to access health care services in the URCCs The smart contract will cover preventive and curative services for the holder by the contract Pooled smart contract will recreate a pooled smart contract (PSC) that will act as health risk pooling VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 53 8 UNIVERSITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS A science and technology park also known as a research park is a property based development that fosters the growth of tenant firms and affiliated with a higher institution of learning The purpose is to facilitate sharing of knowledge promote innovation and advance research to viable commercial products Ubrica will facilitate design development and implementation of 66 Science and Technology Parks (STPs) for Kenyan universities We will also provide STP Development and Management Service through our Scientific Real Estate Development Division (SREDD) The Science and Technology Park Development and Management Service will involve setting out the strategy and objectives of the 66 new parks and deciding on the best model for implementation SREDD will manage many complex processes and diverse relationships We shall allocate 3 02 billion Ubricoins to fund design development implementation and management of 66 STPs in Kenya 8 1 How Science and Technology Parks Benefit the Local Community The Science and Technology Parks provide locations that foster innovation and development and commercialization of technology and where government universities and private companies may collaborate \xef\x82\xb7 Science parks may offer a number of shared resources such as incubators program and collaboration activities telecommunication hubs reception security among others VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 54 \xef\x82\xb7 Science parks also aim to bring together people who assist the developers of technology to bring their work to commercial fruition \xef\x82\xb7 They can be attractive to university students who may interact with prospective employers \xef\x82\xb7 Apart from tenants science parks create jobs for the local community for example they may be built with restaurants sports facilities etc \xef\x82\xb7 Science parks catalyze community innovation 8 2 Translation and Commercialization of Science We opened dialogue with several Universities in Africa for commercialization of science We developed a Science and Technology Park Development and Management and Technology Transfer Services Agreement that will be used to guide our relationships with Universities This science and technology park development and management and technology transfer or knowledge conversion services agreement will be made with UBRICA as the \xe2\x80\x9cManager\xe2\x80\x9d and the University as the \xe2\x80\x9cInstitution \xe2\x80\x9d 8 2 1 Ubrica University Science and Technology Park Management and Technology Transfer Services Ubrica will provide two services to Universities science park development and management services and technology transfer or knowledge conversion services 8 2 2 Knowledge Conversion/Technology Transfer Service Ubrica will establish a University Technology Transfer Office (UTTO) to facilitate the commercialization of University intellectual property including patents and copyrights UTTO will work with researchers and students in every college to prepare new inventions for the patenting process and potential licensing opportunities VERSION 2 2

centers of excellence for (a) discovery development and commercialization of cutting edge technologies in biomedicine and (b) world class health care services in health promotion disease prevention and treatment Two major and closely interrelated problems motivate our intent VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 62 \xef\x82\xb7 The severe inadequate infrastructure for global health Health services in many countries of the world are unsafe of low quality and inaccessible to majority of the people People afraid to use health services locally seek medical care in other countries Indeed healthcare consumers would be willing to pay more for better care that is of high value of efficient supply of drugs of better technical quality of well maintained health facilities and of short wait times The specific problem is that an entity that can produce comprehensive world class medical service is lacking Ubrica One will be home to five ultramodern academic specialty medical centers structured as world class hospitals to deliver care of the highest quality possible \xef\x82\xb7 The absence of health services and biomedical innovative research and development (R&D) capability Ubrica One is poised to create a worldclass research facilities attached to the world class hospitals The research facilities will serve as centers for research excellence in Kenya The centers will produce the best in class researchers in health medicine and basic sciences The research facilities will also serve as technology transfer organizations that will manage intellectual property licensing and commercialization of products of research and industrial development to meet health needs of people 9 3 BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM In this section we present the background of the problem addressed in this proposal from the framework of knowledge conversion The section underpins knowledge conversion as the centerpiece of national development emphasizing the central importance of comprehending knowledge conversion to comprehend development 9 3 1 Theoretical Underpinning National Development a Function of Knowledge Conversion VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 63 Knowledge conversion is the work of discovering knowledge residing in the local environments and mastering the discovered knowledge to create products and services that people and organizations can use to advance themselves and to defend themselves from enemies Knowledge converts in five steps starting from exploration going to research then to publication then to translation and finally to application of knowledge (Figure 10) FIGURE 9 USTAWI STAGES OF KNOWLEDGE CONVERSION CONTINUUM Note From Macharia Waruingi (2010) Knowledge conversion by open innovation Ustawi the knowledge conversion organization Minnetonka MN Ustawi (Used with permission of author ) Human development depends on capability of people residing in that nation to muster all the five stages of knowledge conversion in all fields of knowledge A developed nation in biomedicine for example is the one that has built a fullscale capability for exploratory work in biomedicine biomedical research publication and dissemination of biomedical knowledge translation of published biomedical knowledge into products such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices and systems for delivery of health care services and application of biomedical knowledge in health promotion disease prevention cure of VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 64 disease and education of present and future generations of care providers Table 5 depicts the steps in the knowledge conversion continuum in biomedicine TABLE 6 STAGES OF THE KNOWLEDGE CONVERSION CONTINUUM AND PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED TO EACH STAGE Stage 1 Process Exploration Product Discovery of facts theories and propositions Stage 2 Research Verification of facts theories and propositions Stage 3 Publication Journals Thesis Text books Popular books Art Stage 4 Translation Intellectual capital management patents Stage 5 Application Pharmaceuticals Medical devices Health delivery systems Education systems Typically underdeveloped nations lack the will to develop capability for exploration research and translation of knowledge Because they lack the will to develop these capabilities they rely for their existence on application of products and services created from knowledge discovered in other countries They rely on foreign facts theories and propositions to implement their work programs in their nations Facts theories and propositions from foreign sources do not have working capacity in local situations because they do not fit Because of this problem nations that rely on theories developed from knowledge products generated for a foreign nation remain underdeveloped and subservient to the nations from where the theories originated 9 3 2 Relevance For example theories about approach to diseases developed from knowledge collected in Boston Massachusetts in the United States is of little help to a clinician in Nyeri County dealing with medical conditions local to Nyeri County Hospital in Kenya much less in a health center in Mukurweini or Othaya in Kenya Geography culture climate and other local forces have it that diseases that occur in Nyeri are different from the diseases that occur in Boston VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 65 Furthermore the local environments (culture diet nutrition climate geography economy) affect the human physiology in such manner that the physiology adapts to local conditions Indeed the local environment modifies human genetic expression which in turn modifies the human physiology for adaptation to needs of the local environment 9 3 3 Relevance Paradox Humans who live in hot climates are comfortable in high temperatures and do not tolerate the cold climates without a period of acclimatization Similarly humans who live in the lowlands with high oxygen tension do not tolerate low oxygen tension highlands without a period of acclimatization This physiological adaptation of individuals means that the human body tolerates medications differently according to local environment Rather factors in local environment determine the effectiveness of a medical treatment given to an individual As such medicines developed with knowledge gathered from Boston dwellers may have lower effectiveness on Nyeri dwellers Thus use of knowledge from Boston to solve problems plaguing people in Nyeri leads to incomplete solutions with attendant negative consequences 9 3 4 Exploration and Discovery Theories and propositions about how do help people deal with medical problems in Nyeri must come from the work of discovery of such knowledge in Nyeri and not Boston Theories and propositions about health and disease in Nyeri must be verified through formal research about health and disease in Nyeri 9 3 5 Intellectual Property Protection The discovered theories propositions and their verifications must be protected with appropriate regulations and patents to safeguard loss of intellectual property Unprotected intellectual property is open to exploitation by outsiders leading to tremendous loss VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 66 9 3 6 Publication After appropriate protection the discovered theories propositions and their verifications must be published in journals books thesis monographs for dissemination to schools universities government organizations nongovernmental organizations business organizations and indeed to all interested individuals The published knowledge is then available for creation of new products and services that have fit and working capacity in the local environment Local companies can use the translated knowledge to create medicines medical devices health delivery systems medical services systems etc 9 3 7 Application The glaring absence of medical manufacturing in African countries and the extremely poor quality of medical services is the product of lack of attention to exploration research publication and translation of local knowledge A country that has no local knowledge resembles a human being whose higher center of the brain is amputated 9 3 8 Knowledge Conversion in Biomedicine for Global Health Developing countries lag behind in knowledge conversion in biomedicine Many governments of developing countries allocate no investments on exploration of knowledge that would lead to discovery of bio medical facts theories and propositions Furthermore governments of developing countries invest very little in research that would lead to verification of facts theories and propositions They do not invest in discovery and verification for the benefit of the citizens of their nations To overcome this problem we must discover new ways of funding knowledge conversion in biomedicine for global health using blockchain 9 3 9 Private Sector and Knowledge Conversion in Biomedicine in the World VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 67 Private health care sector has historically played an important role in health services delivery in developing countries The absence of a well organized health insurance system and ambivalence in health care financing however limit the growth of the private health care In recent years several developing countries have rapidly re emerged from grinding poverty and business is springing back The national leadership is supportive of the private health care enterprise encouraging private investment in health care and medical facilities The general problem is inadequate health systems in developing countries This countries suffer long term neglect and lack of investment with high rate of infection in hospitals and limited medical equipment Investment in world class Ubrica One Biomedical Industrial City will help to overcome the problem of global health Specifically Ubrica One will be the beacon of hope for biomedical discovery and a source of excellence in bioscientific publications In addition Ubrica One will lead to a new horizon of translational medicine medical devices and pharmaceutical manufacturing for global health 9 4 BMIC 6 04 BILLION UBNs We will allocate 6 04 billion UBN to fund biomedical industrial city The fund raised will be used for design development construction and management of BMIC We will issue coins to facilitate construction and post construction management of biomedical industrial city The biomedical city will function as an epicenter for discovery and development of medical innovations for global health 9 4 1 Reward System Holders of Ubricoin will receive discounted services at the biomedical industrial city The discounted services will include healthcare services hospitality and tourism The users of BMIC will receive loyalty points 9 4 2 Reuse of Points VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 68 The loyalty points will be used to assess services in the Ubrica ecosystem such as shopping on Soko Janja and receiving services in URCCs The points will also be used in the pooled smart contract The 6 04 billion coins will be issued in four phases each

facilitate the design of the BMIC setting out the strategy and deciding on the best model for implementation We require a lot of desktop and field research to understand the BMIC scope This will be done by a team of professionals 9 4 4 Phase 2 allocation In this stage we will issue 604 million UBNs This will be used for the development of BMIC We will identify and hire architects engineers and planners who will be responsible for developing the project scope and planning the implementation of the BMIC These funds will be used to do feasibility studies which will include physical planning geotechnical studies suitability analysis architecture engineering economic planners construction planning security information technology 9 4 5 Phase 3 allocation We will issue 3 02 billion UBN to facilitate the construction of the BMIC We intend to construct BMIC in Kenya These funds will be used to purchase land entitlement and the construction material for this project The raised funds will also be used to do monitoring and evaluation of the project 9 4 6 Phase 4 allocation We will issue 2 01 billion UBN to support management of the BMIC We will use the funds to create a mortgage program to facilitate ownership of medical and scientific real estate We will also create a reserve fund to support operation of innovation hubs within the BMIC until breakeven Operations of an innovation within the BMIC will be responsible for generating high quality research idea innovation translation/commercialization of knowledge into products and services that help solve local problems The BMIC will bridge the university with the industry and with the local community VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 70 To stimulate new innovation we will create bounty programs to reward individuals or groups with new scientific ideas that will help provide solutions to our vexing problems We will issue tokens to people who will \xef\x82\xb7 do original research \xef\x82\xb7 publish the results of their original research \xef\x82\xb7 present the results of their research in scientific conferences locally and internationally \xef\x82\xb7 translate their research knowledge into commercial prototypes and \xef\x82\xb7 commercialize their prototypes into products of everyday use VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 71 10 DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM Our goal is to get Ubricoin to be accepted by 2024 as standard method of payment for the 14 million families in Kenya Complete acceptance will mean that all transactions will go through Ubricoin We hope that people will use Ubricoin for making payments for groceries school fees medical care transport entertainment and for capital purchases such as vehicles buildings land for funding capital projects In addition people will use Ubricoin to pay for all kinds of professional services to providers Architectures engineers doctors lawyers teachers and the like will accept Ubricoins for services provided Paraprofessionals technicians plumbers carpenters and all labor providers in general will accept UBNs as payment for their labor Business people will pay for the purchasers in UBN Petrol station owners will pay petroleum dealers with UBN The dealers will then pay the refiners in UBN thus covering the supply side On the demand side people will buy petroleum using UBN Similarly restaurant owners will pay for groceries and other restaurant supplies in UBN The customers will in turn pay restaurant owners in UBN In the travel business people will pay for tickets hotel accommodation meals and other travel amenities in UBN UBN will generally be accepted in all transactions in both the supply and the demand side of business Implementation Strategy VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 72 According to Rogers (1962) adoption of innovations such as Ubricoin encounters five categories of people 1 Innovators who want to be the first to try the innovation Innovators are venturesome and interested in new ideas Innovators are willing to take risk They are often the first to adopt new ideas Very little if anything needs to be done to appeal to innovators 2 Early adopters are opinion leaders who enjoy leadership roles and embrace change opportunities Early adopters are already aware of the need to change and so are very comfortable adopting new ideas Strategies to appeal to this population include how to manuals and information sheets on implementation They do not need information to convince them to change 3 Early majority are rarely leaders Early majority typically need to see evidence that the innovation works before they are willing to adopt Strategies to appeal to this population include success stories and evidence of the innovation s effectiveness 4 Late majority are skeptical of change They will only adopt an innovation after it has been tried by the majority Strategies to appeal to this population include information on how many other people have tried the innovation and have adopted it successfully 5 Laggards are bound by tradition and are very conservative They are very skeptical of change and are the hardest group to bring on board Strategies to appeal to this population include statistics fear appeals and pressure from people in the other adopter groups Among the 14 million families in Kenya the following table indicates the number of families in each category VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 73 TABLE 8 ADOPTION PROFILE OF UBRICOIN BY FAMILIES IN KENYA BY 2024 Categories Percentage % Number of families Innovators 2 5 350 000 Early adopters 13 5 1 890 000 Early majority 34 4 760 000 Late majorities 34 4 760 000 Laggards 16 2 240 000 Total 100 14 000 000 By 2024 we expect that Ubricoin to be used for transactions by 11 760 000 families of the 14 million families in Kenya The 2 240 000 families remaining represents the laggards who in Roger\xe2\x80\x99s model may not adopt Ubricoin as their standard mode of payment Non the less they are highly likely to interact with people using Ubricoin such that they will become indirect users For example a laggard could receive Ubricoin sent to him or her through a neighbor Other laggards may request friends relatives or neighbors to help with shopping using UBN Value Creation While Roger informs us about the likelihood of people adopting particular innovation Metcalfe\xe2\x80\x99s law (1980) is instructive about how Ubricoin will gain value in the market According to Metcalfe the value of a network is directly proportional to the square of its users (V = n(n 1)/2 ) Ubricoin is already a currency We do not need to hedge the value of the coin with fiat currency We only need to create a network of Ubricoin holders to use it as common tender (see e g Bendell Slater & Ruddick 2015) Our target in the primary stage is to help at least one million people create Ubricoin wallets By Metcalfe\xe2\x80\x99s law this translates to a value of one million squared that is a value of one trillion VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 74 We have set aside two billion UBN to be distributed to one million people to facilitate adoption by 11 760 000 people by 2024 The principal mechanism for distributing the two billion Ubricoin is by allocating the coins directly from the main contract to individual wallets held by people in disparate locations in the country Primary Network Creation We have developed a program for creating and building the UBN network Network creation involves distributing UBN to clusters of nested generations with disparate distribution conditions Generation refers to the source of the Ubricoins For example first generation (G1) comprises people who receive UBN directly from Ubricoin contract assisted by Ubrica team The second generation (G2) comprises people who receive help from the first generation (G1) to open wallets The third generation (G3) comprises people who receive help from the second generation (G2) to open wallets and so on We have created a referral program to reward each generation as an incentive to help us reach the one million target G1 will receive 10 000 Ubricoin from the Ubrica team G1 will then receive 20 000 UBN when they help ten people open wallets and sent 1000 UBN to each of ten The ten people receiving 1 000 become G2 G2 then receives 9 000 UBN from the contract to top up to 10 000 UBN G2 in turn will help 10 people in their network open wallets and distribute 1 000 to each wallet G2 wallets receives 20 000 UBN after distributing all the 10 000 UBN to 10 new wallets The new wallets forming G3 are then credited with 9 000 UBNs to top up to 10 000 UBN G3 in turn will help 10 people in their network open wallets and distribute 1 000 to each wallet G3 wallets receives 20 000 UBN after distributing all the 10 000 UBN to 10 new wallets In all the generations Ubricoin transferred after they open new wallets are reimbursed and are encouraged to continue recruiting And the cycle continues to G4 G5 \xe2\x80\xa6 Gn VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 75 Secondary Network Creation Soko Janja will be our secondary mechanism for coin distribution and adoption People will use Ubricoin on Soko Janja for purchases People will also receive new coins as loyalty points for purchasing in Soko Janja The incentive program will also act as a mechanism of distributing Ubricoins in future When the rating system is built people will receive Ubricoin for doing good in the community VERSION 2 2 \x0cUBRICOIN\xe2\x80\x94BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH 76 11 ROADMAP Our
