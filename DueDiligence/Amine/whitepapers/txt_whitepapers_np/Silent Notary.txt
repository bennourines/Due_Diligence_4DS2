file and an e mail can be an event SilentNotary converts an event into a legally significant evidence excluding the possibility of falsification Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com 2 \x0cContent Introduction Our Product Use Cases User Interfaces Development of the System Roadmap Token Sale Future Conclusion Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cIntroduction Just a few years ago a solution was found to build a Trust Machine \xe2\x80\x93 distributed ledger was a fact The first thing that people started to write down in the ledger were records about a financial transaction that everyone could trust and so Bitcoin was born We live in a world full of distrust And in case of misfortune we must prove that certain facts were intact We use distributed ledger technology for its intended purpose trust Data about the events that occurred are recorded There is no need anymore to prove anything distributed ledger solves the problem of distrust Suddenly we have a way to make the world better and our lives safer with a global system of confirmation of event existence Distributed ledger is a sophisticated technology Bridges are needed between the user and the technology These bridges are user interfaces allowing users to transfer data to the system about events recorded in any form photos videos chats audio recordings or documents Now we have developed all the main interfaces possible for you Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com Tokes sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cOur Product SilentNotary is an ecosystem which develops around Smart Contracts ensuring the evidence of existence and permanence of certain events To achieve the goal of a global solution various user interfaces have been developed which are as follows To promote the product in the global market it was necessary to adapt it for different categories of customers 1 1 2 B2C (Business to Consumer) The simplest interface understandable to the common user and can be integrated with social networks 3 B2B (Business to business) License scheme corporate accounts (available in beta version) access delimitation and API for integration with corporate document management systems available 2 3 4 Chatbots for Facebook messenger and Telegram bots are developed to record information available in production and beta versions Chatbots are installed on almost all smartphones They are convenient and common for users They allow us to record video send files and communicate with many users in real time Web interface (developed and available in beta version) Mobile applications for Android and iOS Apps have been developed and available now in AppStore and Playmarket Mail bot has been developed and is available in production version It is used to certify e mails and records written communication with any number of counter agents SilentNotary worldwide market capacity B2C 2 3 billion users B2B Sectors Insurance companies 11 388 Online media 1 371 Banking insurance 5 API for IoT solutions integration with applications and corporate systems 7 987 Construction 43 347 Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cIn which cases do we need SilentNotary and what can it do to help Let\xe2\x80\x99s study several examples of legal relations which may require delivery of evidence 1 Performed work rendered services It will be easy to record the results at each stage of the process Just launch the messenger and send images or video files of the results to the SilentNotary chatbot You can share the received link with the employer By doing so you will be able to prove the fact that at that moment the work was completed If the work was not finished within the agreed timescale or there were deficiencies detected the employer can do the same and record the problem in the format of certified images or video Certified records can be used for preparation of acceptance certificates for work performed or objections as to quality and timescale claims 2 Communication via e mail Letters of critical importance can be saved and certified by just adding the SilentNotary address into the list of recipients The system certifies the letter content and data from the mailing servers (RFC title of the letter) It means that the list of recipients the fact of dispatch delivery and email routing will be recorded 3 Offers are made in a digital format Any company selling anything via the Internet makes a public offer to its clients In this case the text of the offer is just published on the website This text may be changed at any time There are many cases that require confirmation of the offer content and the fact of publishing it on the website Both the seller and the buyer may need it You can use the SilentNotary website to certify the documents and the pages where it was published Just send a link to the page and order a certification of the page content 4 Website content copyrights Almost every website shows the users a \xc2\xa9 symbol As a matter of fact placement of the copyright protection symbol is a meaningless ritual It is very hard to prove that some content was present on the website at some time in the past Just certify the website content using SilentNotary if you need to protect your rights and fight against plagiarism Just send a link to SilentNotary and order a certification of the website pages and content That will be enough Afterwards you can publish a link of the certified content next to the notice of copyright protection Token sale | Whitepaper | wwww SilentNotary com www SilentNotary com \x0c\xd1\x82 5 Priority of authorship Code text picture story music Any intellectual property item which can be represented in digital format is subject to legal protection SilentNotary cannot replace a patent solicitor but it helps to prove precedence in the case of dispute To certify the item just send a file via email to the SilentNotary address certify it by yourself on the website or share it in a message to the chatbot 6 Agreements You can record any negotiation and decision taken Just conduct negotiations through the multi chat feature in our chatbot The chatbot will prepare and certify the conversation protocol on your command 7 License agreement How many times has each of us agreed to the terms of use of some software program That said the text of the agreement is only a text on the website page which can be replaced at any moment If a user violates the terms of the agreement it is hardly possible to prove which text was published at the moment the user agreed to it Send a link of the page with the agreement to SilentNotary We will record the fact of publication at a specified address date of publication and content of all the published documents 8 Whitepaper and other types of public statements Oftentimes to refer to someone\xe2\x80\x99s statement we should prove that this exact text that existed in the past during a certain action was performed For example to participate in an ICO you should record the whitepaper content and the fact of publishing it at the moment of the transaction Just send a link of the published document to the SilentNotary website and certify the fact of publication date of publication and document content 9 User guides Financial success of a product manufacturer depends on the accuracy of the user guide and the fact of publishing it on the website You can certify the page with the publication via the SilentNotary website by just sending a hyperlink to the page 10 Evidence gathering from an accident site In case of an incident (for example a car crash) an acute need for records of the circumstances of the incident often arises Just launch the SilentNotary chatbot and send images and video files of the relevant circumstances 11 Verbal agreements It is very hard to prove a verbal agreement in court Do not risk it During conclusion of the agreement launch the SilentNotary chatbot and record your conversation The audio file will be recorded and certified for you Usage of SilentNotary service is not limited to the mentioned examples There may be a need for evidence in all situations resulting in rights and duties We believe that the users will find a lot of new ways to use our service Important Warning Usage of SilentNotary service should not contradict local norms rules and laws In case of wrongful use of the service responsibility for its usage lies with the user Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cUser Interfaces As stated in the previous section the user interacts with the service using the following interfaces messengers web mobile apps and email The working schemes of these interfaces are Messengers The capabilities of the chatbot are determined by the functionality that the messenger provides In addition during the development of the messenger these opportunities may change Our development plan involves working with all popular instant messengers For implementation in the demo version the Telegram and Facebook messenger have been selected At the launch time of the chatbot the Facebook messenger did not support group chat To solve this problem we implemented a synthetic multi chat allowing the participation of an unlimited number of users and an unlimited number of simultaneously running multichats Each of the users communicates only with the chatbot the chatbot collects two way communication in the common multi chat The user can now switch between simultaneous conversations API Prot 1 k Chat 1 k Smart Contracts Prot K+1 I Prot I+1 N Certified Protocols 1 N The service allows the conversation\xe2\x80\x99s participants to assure the protocol in the blockchain and store it in the SilentNotary Vault Archives will be available to users in their own personal account Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cWeb The scheme of working with SilentNotary through the web is the following The registered user drags (drag & drop feature) the file to the appropriate area on the SilentNotary website or places the link of the file to the webpage that he wants to certify www silentnotary com Smart Contracts When you save a file or page of a site an archive is created with the content of the file or page the hash value is calculated user confirmation is requested the service is paid the hash of this archive is deployed into the decentralized ledger (f e Ethereum blockchain or ByteBall DAGbased graphchain) and the archive is saved in the vault The archive with the hash and the transaction data is available for downloading in the user\xe2\x80\x99s own personal account Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cMobile applications The mobile apps for iOS & Android have been developed and are available now at AppStore and PlayMarket Functions planned and implemented \xe2\x80\xa2 Personal and corporate account \xe2\x80\xa2 Real time video and audio recording capabilities \xe2\x80\xa2 Access to the Notary Vault for all the uploaded and certified content \xe2\x80\xa2 Real time video recording using our innovative LightStamp Technology (in development) \xe2\x80\xa2 Secure mode (in development) Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cLightstamp technology During the development of the SilentNotary it became necessary to determine the time range of a certified event Using the hardware capabilities of smartphones a solution was found and the Lightstamp (tm) technology was developed to determine the time interval of the event recorded with the smartphone video camera The Lightstamp technology allows the following 1 Counteracts forgery and any modification of the recorded video facts 2 Records the time interval of the event (the time of beginning and end of the video) and 3 Provides evidence of a real video shooting event National patent app #2017144897 \xe2\x80\x9cMETHOD OF PROVIDING THE RELIABILITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE DEVICE FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND THE METHOD OF USING THIS DEVICE\xe2\x80\x9d Intellectual Property priority date is 21 12 2017 registered by RosPatent Next step is international patent application according to the PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) procedure of WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) for simultaneous protection of intellectual property in 152 countries More information about LightStamp Technology will be provided soon as we are registering a patent now Secure mode While selling a product we received requests from customers to develop a technology to certify extremely confidential information Instead of using particularly robust cryptographic technologies a simple solution was found For particularly sensitive data the enhanced security mode will be used hash will be calculated on the Client side and transferred to the system without transferring and storing data to NotaryVault For certification the system does not need to have the original data only a digital fingerprint (hash) is enough If necessary the User will provide source files for the technical expertise This mode will be available only to users of mobile applications and when integrating corporate systems through API Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cEmail The scheme of working with SilentNotary via e mail is the following The user sends an email directly to our mailbot address (go@silentnotary com) or adds the mailbot address in cc SilentNotary creates an archive with the email\xe2\x80\x99s details RFC title content and attached documents The hash of the archive is calculated and then the user is required to confirm the saving by replying to a message To a@gmail com CC go@silentnotary com Smart Contracts After the document is saved and payment for the service is confirmed by the user DApp SilentNotary records data hash in the distributed ledger (blockchain/graphchain) The user then receives a link for the hash transaction The archive is stored in the repository (In the demo version Google cloud storage is used and in the main version the possibility of using decentralized systems will be considered ) After the operation is completed the user will be able to access the saved history in his/her personal account Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cTechnical description of the product The scheme of operation of the service is quite simple In accordance with various interactions with the user an archive is formed including the date of the event details of the document and the document itself (it can be a file and a protocol of correspondence among others) Web Smart Contract Block Chatbot } TxHash 0x156 Hash a89df5 ID Block Input Data Hash a89df5 Email Cloud { Hash a89df5 Tx Hash 0x158 Next the hash of this archive is calculated by the algorithm SHA 256 with the help of a Smart Contract written into the distributed ledger (blockchain or grapgchain) The archive itself is saved in the cloud storage The user receives a hash which is the result of computing the hash function on the user\xe2\x80\x99s archive The TxHash of the transaction in the distributed ledger platform and a link to the document in his/her personal account are then made available Legal issues SilentNotary uses blockchain (graphchain) as a service Dealing with any complex technical system we need to use a special technical expertise to prove the authenticity of the created evidence Thus we need to develop a methodology for experts in different countries explain how to use created evidences in a court collect and generalize judicial practices certify lawyers and experts to use SilentNotary technology and create a marketplace for decentralized legal services These are prime functions of our SilentNotary foundation The principal legal scheme of SilentNotary product Recording Digital Smart Record in Hash device file Contract blockchain Event \xef\x83\xa0 \xef\x83\xa0 \xef\x83\xa0 \xef\x83\xa0 \xef\x83\xa0 1The event is fixed with the user s device and recorded as a digital file 2 The digital fingerprint (hash of the file) is calculated 3 Hash is sent to a smart contract which records it in the distributed ledger Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com Evidence \xef\x83\xa0 \x0c4 The record in the ledger the hash of the file and the file itself is used as evidence in the court 5 An application is made for technical expertise to determine that the file hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been changed (corresponds bit by bit to the one presented as evidence) at the specified time (at the time of recording in the distributed ledger) For this the expert should determine that It is not possible to create a file that is different from the one presented but with the same hash It is not possible to change the presented record in the distributed ledger The timestamp of presented record corresponds to the actual recording time with the required accuracy Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cMultiplatform Concept We use a distributed ledger as a service to store our evidences immutable and timestamped But distributed ledger technology is developing rapidly and we have a choice of platforms now with different features Some of them more stable but more expensive others are young but very fast and cheap Some of them will lose their positions but new stars will arise We are open for different platforms and provide our customers with a choice Our customers can choose more suitable platform for their specific case For example it is very expensive and almost impossible to use Ethereum to certify data flows from IoT devices now but we can use such solution as a DAG based platform ByteBall in this case 13 Tokes sale Token sale ||Whitepaper Whitepaper ||www SilentNotary com www SilentNotary com \x0cThe principal scheme of Multiplatform Concept SilentNotary users can choose the platform used to store evidence SilentNotary is an open system for the use of various platforms The basic requirements for a decentralized distributed ledger are the unchanged records and the time synchronized between all nodes User Interfaces choice of platforms Web Messenger Email } User\xe2\x80\x99s account Hash Platform 1 Hash Platform 2 Hash Platform 3 At present Ethereum is used as the main platform To ensure low cost and fast transactions for example to certify data flows from IoT devices test integration with the DAG based non blockchain platform ByteBall was made Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cDevelopment of the System The main directions of development The main problems for the development of the system are the indefinite legal status of the record in the public stable blockchain and low awareness of potential customers about the new product Accordingly the following strands of work are planned for the successful development of the system 1 To develop legal opinions perform technical and legal expertise create instructions and ways of using the system and legal support in case based litigations with leading legal companies 2 To promote use of the blockchain notary in everyday life develop recommendations and collect and generalize judicial practices 3 To finish development of user interfaces (integration with WeChat KakaoTalk LINE and Skype launch Product and SilentNotary Foundation sites) and move servers on own hardware 4 To create an ecosystem around the main application This ecosystem would consist of service provider organizations end users and decentralized applications 5 We have planned to include public notaries in the ecosystem to organize a remote notarization of the existence of online and electronic documents to cover the maximum range of needs for notary services For this purpose it is planned to create a distributed ledger of notaries and organize interaction within the ecosystem World distributed ledger of public notaries will allow the users to remotely verify the existence of electronic documents in a classical way but with a more convenient user interface And 6 To advertise and promote services those use the SilentNotary Smart Contract These activities are financed by the sale of the system tokens Legal structure of the project The project consists of 3 different parts by function and purpose 1 Classic IT holding providing services to end users It owns intellectual property and develops software provides

participants The main contract for its operation is required by SNTR Only the SNTR token holder can use the services of the contract The main SilentNotary contract was developed and deployed to Ethereum blockchain before token sale and available for users at address 0x2ed9b0A70702F52808A27B60cF451652DBD75f8f In a future a new contracts can be developed but any new contract will be able to accept SNTR tokens Token contract address is 0x2859021eE7F2Cb10162E67F33Af2D22764B31aFf The amount of SNTR tokens needed to execute the contract is as follows Main contract Rate USD/ETH Priceofcertification $ USD Since the service is aimed at rendering its facilities in the real economy the cost of services shall be denominated in fiat currencies However calculations within crypto economics are made in crypto currencies Compared to crypto currencies the cost of fiat currencies is marked by high volatility The following solution is proposed to resolve the issue of regulating the cost of services and linking it to the fiat currency Control the SilentNotary contract execution costs by changing the basic cost for document certification (serves for recording the market conditions and competitive environment) Coefficients USD/ETH rate and certification costs are published on the webpage SilentNotary com For example as per the calculation formula if a basic cost of certification equals to 0 5 USD and USD/ETH exchange rate is 1000 the requirement of the contract will be 500 SNTR For the service of the ordinary user it is planned to create own or support the creation of independent service providers and commercial organizations that are acting as intermediaries between the end customer and the SilentNotary service To render services the providers must buy the SNTR tokens These tokens can be obtained in the following two ways 1 During the token sale by exchanging ETH/GBYTES/BTC for tokens in accordance with the rules of the sale 2 Exchange from the existing owners in a transaction Token sale | Whitepaper | www SilentNotary com \x0cLet\xe2\x80\x99s consider a case were the Smart Contract of SilentNotary is used by a service provider License agreement Platform Terms & Conditions general Smart contract Service Client Crypto The Service provider a company rendering commercial services to end users submits an offer (Terms & Conditions) to the user according to which the user sends certified content to the provider and pays for the service in line with the rate (USD) To provide services to its customers the service provider uses the main Smart Contract of SilentNotary under the terms of the license agreement To execute the main contract the Service provider needs to transfer a certain number of SNTR tokens to SilentNotary smart contract He can use Crypto agent for processing crypto operations As a result the Service Provider will receive a link to TxHash and sends it to the user while the information itself is stored in the Vault and made available to the user in his/her personal account Important The aforementioned calculation its results and assumptions do not constitute an obligation for a team to provide potential holders of tokens with some profit The calculation just demonstrates the circulation of tokens inside SilentNotary system Therefore we do not recommend you to treat the token as an investment The token Smart Contract is used to control the circulation of the tokens A SNTR is issued in line with ERC20 standards which makes it possible to use all the existing infrastructure and maintain the circulation of the tokens Some amount of issued tokens can be converted to the token receipts issued on other platforms for example on ByteBall DAGbased platform Issued token receipts will be changeable to ERC 20 SNTR tokens at the ratio 1 1 After the number of tokens that is necessary for the application are transferred the tokens received by the Smart Contract are deposited and thus withdrawn from circulation In the future the developers consider a possibility of putting the deposited tokens in circulation purely for the purposes of the application\xe2\x80\x99s development or its market

tribes where the rule of force prevailed to the modern complex system of norms which guarantees the rights to all individuals The legal systems continue to evolve but it cannot keep up with the technological progress It is quite inert which is natural since any change in the legal system will cause significant consequences on the entire society Obviously the recently developed technology of data storage in a public blockchain is ideal to record facts And the fact that almost every person today has a smartphone and uses messengers will make this technology accessible to everyone The legal system is already beginning to accept blockchain as a method of trusted data storage and once its reluctance is finally over we will witness a revolution in numerous areas of our life This will expand our possibilities significantly Business practices will change Contracts will be signed in messenger apps Business procedures will become faster By recording all the facts corruption and fraud will be prevented We would create a more stable and safe world We have developed and keep on developing SilentNotary with zealous enthusiasm Yours sincerely The SilentNotary team Reach out to us at
