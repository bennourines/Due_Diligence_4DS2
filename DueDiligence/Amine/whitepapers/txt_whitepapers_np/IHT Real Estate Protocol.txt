Words Asset cloud platform sharing property accelerated circulation of global asset blockchain smart contract big data AI Physical assets exchange 2 \x0cI Who we are i house com is a global real estate blockchain cloud platform Its mission is to integrate global real estate markets with the blockchain mechanism Through joining blockchain and real estate the real estate developer financial institutions and their users can be connected and the transaction of real estate can be made a part of \xe2\x80\x9cdigital credit society\xe2\x80\x9d therefore constituting a pivotal supporting part of the economic development All owners and investors will become beneficiaries of i house com real estate blockchain IHT is a smart contract technology and distributed accounting technology developed for the purpose of splitting real estate under i house com which utilizes blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic advantages such as trustless mechanism antitamper co supervision and traceability Through IHT\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract large real estate can be split and distributed to financial institutions In this way the user will get the opportunity to invest small amounts of money and benefit from real estate and ensures security and low risk of investment IHT1 0 service is positioned as PaaS Protocol as a Service which offers a standardized initialization and publication process for ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) to asset owners acting as a neutral agent for asset owners and financial institutions so that both parties can search and make deals Meanwhile IHT will continue progressing to 2 0BaaS Blockchain as a Service and act as an asset segmentation and management platform for the construction of mobile information applications for financial institutions Finally IHT3 0 will evolve into a financial exchange based on physical assets to improve the liquidity of physical assets From the current situation of commercial development the real estate developers and financial institutions have shown great enthusiasm More and more real estate developers and financial institutions are willing to actively participate in the i house com project and look forward to the i house com blockchain project IHT on line as soon as possible In a greater sense of IHT future blueprint aside from real estate all assets that have trading value will be incorporated into the IHT blockchain platform such as aircraft rental artwork antiques and bonds 3 \x0c\xe2\x98\x86II IHT Ecosystem Design IHT uses its own smart contract and distributed accounting technology to connect the asset side and the financial institution side Large assets can be split and distributed to multiple financial institutions through the IHT smart contract Users through financial institutions can invest in small real estate split by IHT smart contract IHT as the center of the connection of two ends cannot be changed by any individual or organization after the asset is split and bound including the IHT itself Therefore through IHT blockchain ledger it can be ensured that users\xe2\x80\x99 investment will be firmly bonded to the pointed assets so that investment on the platform is more secured and stable 4 \x0cAt the same time IHT uses its own smart contracts to connect commercial assets and member users Large scale commercial asset members can be split and assigned to member users through IHT smart contracts Through the IHT smart contract all relevant information such as sales use transfer deadlines and membership conditions between commercial assets and member users will be recorded on the IHT smart contract which will be irrevocable and traceable III Development Status of Global Real Estate Market According to Savills Global Research Report \xe2\x80\x9cTrends in Global Real Estate Market in 2016\xe2\x80\x9d the total market cap of global real estate is approximately worth USD217 trillion which roughly equals 2 7 times of global GDP 36 times of global gold mining worth (6 trillion) and accounts for 60% of global main assets hence rendering real estate the top saving and investment choice for countries corporations and individuals Residential property accounts for over 75% in global total real asset and is the most important part of the real estate market Since residential property is mostly self occupied properties its ownership is most dispersed and closely linked with the wealth of ordinary people The investment potential of residential property is yet to be fully unlocked due to its poor liquidity The global real estate market and global economy as a whole will be greatly improved if the residential properties\xe2\x80\x99 liquidity were accelerated 5 \x0cFrom the point of distribution of space and value the world\ s real estate is unevenly distributed The western countries account for a higher per capita proportion of the world\ s real estate In North America for example accounts for only 5% of the world\ s population but residential value accounts for 21% of the world\ s total and commercial property value accounted for more than half of the total value of commercial property worldwide Therefore the use of reverse thinking a new type of real estate investment model is very likely to promote the real estate investment liquidity of Asia Africa Latin America Middle East and other regions thereby producing a huge real estate investment market 6 \x0cIn combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate investment at a sweeping rate and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model IHT based on this development inflection point has fragmented the property right via smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs and has pioneered a blockchain + smart contract +REITs business model It will reverse the global circulation of real estate thereby affecting the global economic development \xe2\x98\x86IV IHT Application Scenarios 1 Online Application of IHT Blockchain Real estate transactions in the global investment market especially the bulk of real estate transactions is facing a problem that is how to conduct asset transactions lightly efficiently and transparently In the past only large asset packages were able to achieve the purpose of securitization of real estate assets through the means of REITs IHT draws from traditional real estate investment tools such as REITs where the asset holders can through early audit risk control and prediction of asset package income by the third party rapidly trade the real estate asset\xe2\x80\x99s ownership and income rights Through this process the following advantages can be represented First it makes real estate investment downsizing 7 \x0cdynamic and transparent Second it has very high transaction convenience Third information is transparent Fourth fragmentizes large assets IHT has the following advantages (1) Make real estate investment downsizing dynamic and transparent Traditional real estate transactions are all on a large scale the problem is more serious when encountering large offices shopping centers hotels which require unified management to maintain the highest value The use of IHT platform greatly reduces the investor\ s investment threshold of the subject IHT in this regard fully supports the process of digitization of real estate ownership IHT\ s trading platform and service platform provide the blockchain kernel ledger tools needed by asset holders and investors (2) High transaction convenience IHT by asset digitization uses blockchain to represent this convenient trading process After the listing of the project it will greatly improve product liquidity and cash ability (3) Information transparency All transaction records are detailed through the blockchain and the books can be consulted upon authorization to make the entire transaction chain clear including details of asset operations which can also be placed on the IHT platform to ensure information transparency Through the use of IHT\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract platform all trading matters related to the IHT platform can be easily kept in distributed records stored on the blockchain This ensures transparency and clarity on investment returns resulting in safer and securer assets (4) IHT can fragmentize relatively small property rights and shorten the listing cycle IHT makes housing digital assets easier and simpler Using the blockchain technology of IHT platform the assets or some of the assets can be changed into digital assets quickly The traditional real estate investment tools such as REITs need a large number of listed properties in advance and the annual maintenance cost is also very high All of the above decided the package of assets controlled by these traditional tools must have a relatively high amount limit and it can be implemented IHT offers relatively small terms but also the possibility of asset transactions 2 i house com assets management platform Under the i house com project the assets which have been tokenized by IHT will be hosted by i house com digital assets management platform and be transformed into sharing economy assets 8 \x0cAt present in Australia and Shanghai we have already achieved late stage negotiations on real estate properties which can be tokenized by IHT blockchain In the first quarter of 2018 under i house com digital assets management platform i house com plans to start from Australia and Shanghai and carry on management on the above sharing economy assets which are Tokenized by IHT and gradually extend to other countries such as Japan and Canada V Milestone VI Product Form & Design Principle (under development) 1 Using the IHT wallet (under development) ATO (Asset Tokenize Offering) is the order of the asset party to launch a split It is used to generate asset split and it is recorded on the kernel ledger of IHT All property rights and usufruct rights of the transaction shall be conducted under the asset\xe2\x80\x99s local fiat IHT consumption in the wallet is only an inducement mechanism of ATO 2 How can property developers launch ATO on IHT platform After getting the qualification certification jurisdiction relevant licenses property registration proof of ownership etc on the IHT platform the property developers can obtain the right to issue ATO (subject to the approval of i9 \x0chouse com) When the property developer issues ATO it is necessary to make clear of the specific circumstances of the property (such as real estate address area property right period and other relevant conditions) the sale of real estate whether share repurchase in a certain period of time valid duration of the subscription and annual effective yield 3 How can financial institution underwrite ATO assets on the IHT platform After the financial institution has registered on the IHT underwriting platform it can find the most suitable asset through screening and checking the classification of the asset IHT will be used as an inducement mechanism on underwriting shares of ATO assets The specific quantity of IHT depends on the complexity and terms of each ATO After the completion of underwriting financial institution can generate many sub products from its original shares and release on its own platform and show it to users on the display portal of IHT 4 How can investors subscribe shares of ATO After the financial institution releases sub product on its own platform users can subscribe it through the sale portal or subscribe on IHT platform which will skip to the sales page of financial institution The sub product displayed on IHT platform will be recommended according to user\ s personal interest and investment ability 10 \x0c5 Through the ATO and trading on IHT platform users can (a) transact on the financial institution\xe2\x80\x99s platform (b) Property use right will be recorded in the form of a blockchain token and could be either consumed by the token holder or preserved for store of value Each token will be transferable (subject to terms and conditions at the time of issuance) through our distributed ledger network The specific business process diagram is as follows 11 \x0cVII Technical Support\xef\xbc\x9a Ethereum based system provides Turing complete smart contract framework cored by automated execution of \xe2\x80\x9cnon static functional and quantifiable\xe2\x80\x9d contracts between participants The execution environment responds to input events stores value activates logics to drive state change and output results 12 \x0cto finalize contract intent Similar to a trusted escrow it maintains temporary assets and operates according to the contractual enforcement to ensure participant obligations are satisfied at the successful termination The following diagram shows smart contract in action a piece of code (smart contracts) are deployed in a ledger which can be shared and replicated It can maintain its state drive control flow receive external inputs/events and make state transition according to logic outlined in the contract The account is the underlying unit of the smart contract and the blockchain tracks the status of each account so the state transitions on the blockchain at the end of contract execution reflecting the final value in the corresponding accounts The account is divided into an external account and a contract account The difference is the external account is associated and controlled by human beings while the contract account is composed of internal control encoding The contract account is controlled by humans since it is programmed with a specific address of the external account and human the user who holds the private key to control access to the external account and 13 \x0cindirectly to the contract account IHT asset exchange smart contract based on the above smart contract principles and framework is the core trading module in the IHT asset exchange platform VIII Marketing Plan Key Projects of 2018 Q1 I house com+IHT Launch Event Estimated location Hong Kong Estimated number of participants 500 Projected media dissemination 300 domestic and overseas mainstream media Estimated total population coverage 5 million Routine Plan Block chain Summit Forum 4 times a year 1 activity per quarter mainly in Hongkong Australia and the United States Activities Event guests invite experts in this area mainly Activity theme share the dynamics of blockchain and introduce the current situation and development trend of i house com and IHT Activities partners and interested partners in the real area and financial institutions Propagation and Coverage 14 \x0cThe scene will be

dissemination on 30 mainstream media in China plus public relations dissemination on 150 overseas mainstream media It is expected to cover more than 5 000 000 viewers IX Fund Raising and Application Plan 1 IHT token mechanism IHT is issued by token sale with an upper limited set accounting for 35% of the total tokens created IHT total supply will be set as 1 000 000 000 IHT 35% tokens will be available for sale (already completed as of 1 May 2018) 2 Token risk IHT Token is not for investment Potential purchasers of the IHT Token should make their own judgment based on their own evaluation of the IHT Platform and its functions IHT token has no intention of being an investment platform IHT is the digital currency that are accepted as a medium of exchange in certain products and services offered on the Company\xe2\x80\x99s platform 7 Project risk The same as any project the development and execution of any of the described features on our platform may have the risk of delay or even failure 8 Digital coin risk The IHT token may suffer from little to no secondary market liquidity and severe price volatility during any point of time of its circulation after issuance Please do not purchase amount of IHT tokens with money more than the amount you can afford to lose completely This document or any portion of this document does not constitute an investment advice 15 \x0c9 Regulatory risk The U S regulatory risk relating to IHT Tokens being deemed a security turns on the application of a United States Supreme Court decision in 1946 SEC v W J Howey Co 328 U S 293 (1946) U S Courts have commonly broken the Howey test into three prongs in analyzing putative investment contracts and terms of (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived solely or predominantly from the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of the issuer In order for the instrument to be an investment contract subject to U S securities laws all three factors in the Howey case must be satisfied The analysis is conducted to determine if an investment contract is present and if so then how the federal securities laws apply On July 25 2017 the U S Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Section 21(a) investigative report which provides a framework for understanding which Ethereum based offerings including Internet Coin Offerings (ICOs) are within the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s authority to regulate as securities and which are not The Report applied U S Supreme Court decisions to determine if the DAO Tokens offering was an offering of investment contracts The Report emphasized that the determination of whether a particular transaction involves the offer and sale of a security will depend on the facts and circumstances including the economic realities of the transaction The Reports assessment that the DAO Tokens were securities was based on economic circumstances involving raising capital for future company projects as opposed to IHT\xe2\x80\x99s marketing of existing platforms and services to Asset Owners Financial Institutions and Users Based upon the U S legal counsel\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the Howey case and subsequent Federal cases as well as examining the details of the Report the IHT Tokens are not investment contracts This conclusion is based upon analysis of existing U S securities law and this White Paper The IHT Platform is a product use token for an already developed testable and usable system and service which will yield value and profit to those who use the IHT Token for its properly advertised purpose The sale of the IHT Token is not intended to be purchased by persons who desire to make a profit from the future efforts of the Company and the overall success of its product network or service over time 16 \x0cThe U S Securities and Exchange Commission and the U S Supreme Court have repeatedly emphasized that it is the economic realities rather than the moniker such as \xe2\x80\x9cutility\xe2\x80\x9d token that are the governing considerations The regulatory environment for blockchain and digital coin is still at an early stage of development and continues to be fluid and it is not possible to predict how the SEC may apply existing law to new technology and applications We will do our utmost to comply with the development of all legal and regulatory policies but we cannot foresee how the regulations will affect our project and platform development In United States IHT will strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations including but not limited to real estate finance securities and other related laws and regulations In the presence or occurrence of relevant registration approval filing and other procedures IHT will strictly follow the procedures to perform the relevant procedures At the same time IHT will strictly comply with the current laws and regulations relating to promoters\xe2\x80\x99 restrictions and foreign exchange control In any area where IHT carries out the relevant blockchain business IHT will comply with local laws and regulations including but not limited to registration approval filing and other related procedures X Team Profile Ricky Ng Chairman and Founder Chairman and founder of I house com &I house Token(IHT) the first blockchain real estate cloud platform worldwide Co founder Director of McfeeCC
