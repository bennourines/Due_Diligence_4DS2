displaying locations on the map from chores such as electricity and water repairs houses gardening etc to deliver goods from one place to another Vikky draws on a route map that connects the departure and destination (such as the itinerary) allowing the recipient to easily find a task suitable to their flight Or a carrier could get more goods on the way to their destination Vikky also allows users to filter by industry category of interest or by language of use Just change the language for example to Chinese the Chinese community in the world will see each other regardless of geographic location This also helps communities to be separated and not messing up together Users only need to choose the work nearby which suits themselves apply for it and wait for the response of the employers When both sides have agreed the work will be carried out Workers receive their earnings when work is completed Worker or outsourcer information is valued by the community which enhances the reputation of the employer and the poster contributing to the reduction of false or fraudulent information However only individuals who have traded through Vikky can judge the others this is the way to avoid phony assessment Participants in Vikky are very diverse from ordinary housewives students students engineers mechanics to companies that need to recruit short term workers and even those who travel long distance truck drivers and even Uber Grab drivers Airbnb s owners can also hire a cleaner with Vikky Or guests of Airbnb can also rent bicycles find guides etc through Vikky \x0c3

fulfilling demands from motorcycles cars delivery Vikky also realized to focus only on the delivery array would be far more risky than expanding for shortterm jobs on the same platform Users can filter information by industry category or map to find the nearest most appropriate task available And payment solutions will vary from cash cards to blockchain technology Thus the world will no longer gap in terms of payment rates payment methods 5 THE TECHNOLOGY Vikky will use the blockchain technology on the ERC20 / Ethereum platform to create the VIK Token This means that the VIK Token will be fully integrated with the latest features of the Ethereum blockchain system This is a distributed ledger system with automatic calculation reliable and secure Use VIK Token combined with VIK

of VIK Token to pay When someone applies the employer can review the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 records and select the appropriate candidate When both sides agree on the salary the work will be out Once the work is completed the user will make a VIK token payment to the employee For job seekers Use the Vikky application with a job map feature to find jobs near your location and match your capabilities After applying for a job and being accepted the employee conducts the work When the work is completed and verified by the employer the employee will be paid a fair amount of VIK Token part of which will be retained by the system to cover maintenance cost When the VIK Token number in the VIK Wallet large enough allow users to withdraw to other Crypto Trading Platforms to be
