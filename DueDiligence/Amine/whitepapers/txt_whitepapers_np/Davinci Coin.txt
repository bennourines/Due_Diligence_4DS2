precious metal which has developed an evolutionary new business model its \xe2\x80\x9ccrypto gold concept\xe2\x80\x9d by combining physical pure gold blockchain and a proprietary nano laser engraving technology This combination enables the tokenization of pure gold Gold Global offering investors to possess physical gold with a digital title of ownership of such without the burden of safekeeping and insurance To accomplish this objective Gold Global will issue its digital DaVinci Token a stablecoin Specifically the DaVinci Token is the irreversible digital title of ownership of a DaVinci Gold Coin which is a 24 karat gold coin of one troy ounce (31 1g) minted in Switzerland by a prominent LBMA accredited refinery Once the gold minting process is completed each DaVinci Gold Coin is nano laser engraved with a unique ID number in the form of a QR code Gold Global then registers each DaVinci Gold Coin into the blockchain by scanning the unique ID number insuring its immutable permanent and unique registration code in perpetuity not alterable or changeable To the best knowledge of Gold Global at the time this White Paper is published no other gold coin or bullion benefit from this innovative identification and security feature designed to prevent counterfeiting as well as authenticity and traceability of the DaVinci Gold Coin When a DaVinci Token is issued an identified and registered DaVinci Gold Coin is incontrovertibly attached to it and consequently conjointly registered one to one into the blockchain All DaVinci Gold Coins are held in secure vaults with BRINKS in Zurich and administrated by a qualified independent Custodian on behalf of DaVinci Token holders thus relieving them of the burden of either personally storing and insuring their DaVinci Gold Coins or keeping them in a bank safe which access to can be restricted or frozen 3 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper The DaVinci Token gives gold liquidity and mobility as it may be used as a worldwide mean of payment or transaction by its transfer Peer to Peer DaVinci Tokens can either be stored on a \xe2\x80\x98hot wallet\xe2\x80\x99 which is connected to the internet and can potentially be compromised by hackers or preferably kept securely on a \xe2\x80\x98cold\xe2\x80\x99 ledger wallet which is disconnected from the internet protecting it from unauthorized access cyber hacks and other vulnerabilities that any system connected to internet is exposed to The DaVinci Token is redeemable upon request at any time against its allocated DaVinci Gold Coin rendering the token null and void through a token \xe2\x80\x9cburn\xe2\x80\x9d process As a stablecoin the DaVinci Token aims to disrupt the crypto currency market by offering a way to hedge against the risk of volatility inherent to owning crypto currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethers which are only backed by trust in the network fed by speculative dynamics and valued against fiat currencies or other \xe2\x80\x9cstablecoins\xe2\x80\x9d which are backed by commodities and/or fiat currencies thus exposed to depositary banking risks and subject to intentional inflation and monetary manipulations and regulations The DaVinci Gold Coin and the DaVinci Token as a refuge of value and buying power are immune to potential economical and financial uncertainties and/or crises subject to the gold valuation However gold has a proven track record throughout history as a stable bastion of value thus the DaVinci Gold Coin and/or DaVinci Token should be considered as a way of

INTRODUCTION 1 GOLD GLOBAL Group Background Gold Global Currency Corp S A [\xe2\x80\x9cGold Global\xe2\x80\x9d] [IDE CHE 139 838 606] the holding company based is based in Geneva Switzerland was incorporated in June 2016 by Roger Kinsbourg its founder Gold Global was established for the specific purpose of creating minting and the marketing of 24 karat physical pure gold coins [ISO 417 Currency Code XAU] The first gold coins designed were minted in July 2016 and named the DaVinci Gold Coin (www davincigoldcoin com ) a one [1] Troy ounce of 24 karat [31 10 grams] 999 9% pure gold As Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s founder Roger Kinsbourg positioned himself as an early investor in the Bitcoin market and he immediately became acutely aware of the high volatility and risky nature of investing in and trading crypto currencies Roger Kinsbourg quickly realized that a crypto currency backed by physical pure gold (commonly referred to as a stablecoin) would give crypto currency holders a safe and efficient method of hedging against the volatility their crypto currencies giving them the ability to transfer their crypto asset into pure gold coins in a secure incontrovertible and traceable manner The concept of crypto gold as the DaVinci Token was then born In October 2016 Gold Global entered in to a Partnership Agreement with Cendres & M\xc3\xa9taux (C&M) a prominent Swiss gold refinery assessor and gold coin minter In that same year under the Partnership Agreement C&M minted the first pure gold DaVinci Gold Coin of one ounce bearing their LBMA accredited hallmark Since June 2018 C&M ceased their minting activities Nevertheless Gold Global remains the owner of the coin design and of the minting tools required for the production of the one troy ounce of pure gold DaVinci Gold Coins Switzerland has a worldwide reputation for gold quality recognized around the world with 70% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s production and reprocessed gold refined and hallmarked by the country\xe2\x80\x99s five major gold refineries therefore Gold Global is entering into a new agreement for the minting of its gold coins with one of the Swiss major refineries Gold Global also concluded a Confidential Agreement with a Swiss company which provides the proprietary nano laser technology used to engrave the unique ID 6 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper number in the form of an \xe2\x80\x98Aztec\xe2\x80\x99 QR code on to each Davinci Gold Coin This was critical to develop Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s secure and traceable crypto gold concept From 2016 through to 2018 Gold Global conducted marketing tests of its DaVinci Token with advisors in the crypto currency market blockchain technology gold dealing and trading family offices investment funds private banks and concluded that the demand for a way to invest directly in physical gold was re emerging more recently in 2019 the surge of the gold value and the current financial market global situation in particular for the bonds and equities certain investors are considering investing up to 10% of their assets in physical gold as a storage and refuge of value for potential periods of political economic and monetary uncertainty To accommodate the demands of physical gold ownership by using new technologies and digitalization the DaVinci Token was engineered as a stablecoin with identified directly allocated physical gold in the form of the DaVinci Gold Coin After examining a number of different jurisdictions including Luxembourg Malta and Singapore as potential launch pads for its crypto gold concept and the gold backed digital crypto instrument Gold Global decided to develop and deploy its services from Switzerland respecting strictly the guidelines set up by FINMA the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority Therefore with the guidance of Gold Global lawyers according to the current best practice in Switzerland and FINMA\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation Gold Global obtained a ruling in February 2019 from the FINMA and further obtained its membership in October 2019 of the \xe2\x80\x9cAssociation of French speaking Financial Intermediaries\xe2\x80\x9d ARIF in Geneva as a Financial Intermediary in precious metal Earlier in June 2017 Gold Global Swiss acquired a Luxembourg company and renamed it Gold Global Currency Corp S A (\xe2\x80\x9cGold Global Luxembourg\xe2\x80\x9d) a whollyowned and fully controlled subsidiary in order to have access to certain crypto currency exchange platforms namely Bitstamp and Bitflyer licensed by the Luxembourg financial authority the \xe2\x80\x9cComit\xc3\xa9 de Surveillance du Secteur Financier\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cCSSF\xe2\x80\x9d to be able to trade cryptocurrencies Gold Global Luxembourg also obtained the authorization from the Ministry of Commerce to trade in gold and developed an e commerce site to that effect https //www davincigoldcoin com 7 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper 2 GOLD GLOBAL DaVinci Private Placement and Gold Investment Contract Gold Global has received comprehensive legal advice and counsel and will follow the guidelines and recommendations set forth by the relevant European country\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction in order to ensure that its Private Placement and Gold Investment Contract do not inadvertently contravene any applicable rules or regulations Gold Global will use the proceeds of the Private Placement to cover ongoing operational costs including but not limited to all legal marketing and communication IT infrastructure software hardware and other Capex costs and have a buffer inventory of gold cover short term demands of DaVinci Token or DaVinci Gold Coins The Private Placement will be addressed to qualified investors and to the crypto currency community Provided all relevant KYC and AML procedures are completed Gold Global can issue DaVinci Tokens on a no limit basis to those accredited buyers payable in fiat currencies and major crypto currencies Importantly Gold Global KYC and AML procedures will be conducted by external specialized service providers accredited by Swiss banks able to scrutinize all legal and financial matters such as the origin of the fiat currencies and/or crypto currencies received in accordance with the requirements of the compliance department of Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s bank(s) and the rules from ARIF All closing documents will be drafted and completed by Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s law firm and made available to investors so that they may purchase DaVinci Tokens The DaVinci Token final website will have precise and clear instructions that prospective customers will be required to complete in order to purchase DaVinci Tokens Upon completion of the subscription documents prospective customers will be required to fill out a pre order form indicating how many DaVinci Tokens they desire to purchase in fiat currencies or the approved and accepted crypto currencies All qualified customers will have to own or acquire a compatible personal cryptowallet in order to receive manage transfer any or all of the DaVinci Token securely held therein 8 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper The DaVinci Token is the digital ownership title of a DaVinci Gold Coin of one troy ounce pure gold its price will necessarily and directly be based and depend on the daily market fixing of \xe2\x80\x98one troy ounce gold\xe2\x80\x99 (the \xe2\x80\x9cStandard\xe2\x80\x9d) With regard to investors using accepted crypto currencies as a mean of payment for DaVinci Tokens considering the volatility of crypto currencies only the net value of the proceeds received after their conversion in to fiat currencies will be taken in account and consequently the appropriate number of DaVinci Tokens will be issued In the event of any discrepancies resulting in an unallocated balance a refund will be processed Investors in fiat currencies will be required to execute a bank wire transfer to our licensed service provider (for KYC and AML procedures) for the exact amount of the number of DaVinci Tokens according to the price at the day ordered in their accepted fiat currency subject to the exchange rate at the time the funds are cleared and credited In the event of any discrepancies either the customer will have to make up the difference or the number of DaVinci Tokens will be reduced Conversely in the event of any excess amount being paid in said excess will be reimbursed in the original currency Gold Global received 3 GOLD GLOBAL\xe2\x80\x99S Stablecoin The DaVinci Token The DaVinci Token is a hard asset stablecoin and should not be confused with traditional crypto currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethers which are not backed by any tangible asset A stablecoin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9craison d\ \xc3\xaatre\xe2\x80\x9d is to eliminate the volatility inherent to crypto currencies by using a physical asset to back it In the case of the DaVinci Token the structure is different and more secure than other \xe2\x80\x9casset backed\xe2\x80\x9d instruments (i e where typically a SPV issues securities tokens or a crypto currency backed by certain hard assets of identifiable value but in a pool were no direct allocation or transfer of ownership is provided ) as in substance with the Gold Global crypto gold concept the DaVinci Token holder becomes him/her/itself the direct owner of pure physical gold No investment vehicle financial instruments investment fund or certificates (including structured products or derivative) are offering such DaVinci Token features 9 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper The value of a stablecoin directly depends on the market value of the underlying physical asset backing it Specifically in the case of the DaVinci Token its pricing will depend on the daily fixing of \xe2\x80\x98one troy ounce gold\xe2\x80\x99 with an added premium justified by all the services rendered the liquidity provided and the safety and stability of Switzerland The DaVinci Token can also be used as a mean of payment worldwide without any intermediaries facilitating peer to peer transactions and tradable on secondary markets when it becomes listed on approved international crypto currency exchange platforms Furthermore since all token transactions will be registered into the blockchain traceability and authentication of the ownership is guaranteed This will enable physical gold liquidity and trading as each DaVinci Token represents a DaVinci Gold Coin The DaVinci Token is an innovative way to become owner of physical gold that can be tradable or used as a mean of payment Gold Global believes the future of crypto currencies backed by hard assets independent from any centralized system selfregulated and pegged to the market fixing of such assets DaVinci Gold Coins will be held on behalf of DaVinci Token holders in secure vaults with BRINKS in Zurich under the supervision of an independent qualified Custodian According to a strict procedure under the Custodian control and a service Agreement any DaVinci Token holders will be able to redeem at any time any or all of its DaVinci Tokens against their allocated DaVinci Gold Coins When a DaVinci Token is redeemed it is sent to a verifiable \xe2\x80\x98burn\xe2\x80\x99 address on the blockchain rendering it null and void The redemption procedure will be explicitly described in Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s general terms and conditions As previously stated the price of a DaVinci Token will be based on the market fixing of one troy ounce gold (allocated to each DaVinci Gold Coin) plus a 15% premium possibly reduced for large quantities This premium is dedicated to cover the costs of minting and the nano laser engraving of the unique QR code used to identify each DaVinci Cold Coin and provide an operational margin for Gold Global Furthermore covers the Custodian costs and a ten year free secure vault storage with BRINKS for each DaVinci Gold Coin the company administration and management the monitoring of the blockchain and any other costs associated to a regulated financial service provider are included in the use of this premium 10 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper 4 DaVinci Tokens and the Crypto Currency Market The world\xe2\x80\x99s two major crypto currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum [\xe2\x80\x9cBTC\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cETH\xe2\x80\x9d] have now reached a market capitalization over USD $180 Billion and are convertible into fiat currencies through a number of active crypto currency exchange platforms around the world Bitcoin in particular has become the mainstream cryptocurrency and has been legalized in certain countries like Japan and outlawed in others The total capitalization of all crypto currencies (over one thousand) at the moment has reached around USD $250 billion however their extreme volatility and often absence of liquidity makes them a very speculative risk for investors With this in mind Gold Global has identified a growing demand for a stablecoin backed by gold The DaVinci Token is the answer to this demand It gives subscribers the advantage of physical gold ownership without the burden and risk of personally holding or storing it or the need to physically handle it for its transfer sale gift or exchange Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s extensive market research suggest that a significant number of BTC and ETH investors and/or holders could convert some of their crypto currencies in to a stablecoin such as the DaVinci Token In light of this if only 1% or even \xc2\xbd a % of the capitalization of the two major crypto currencies was turned in to DaVinci Tokens the amount converted would produce a substantial amount of sales 5 GOLD GLOBAL Group Technology and Crypto Gold Know how In order to implement the most trustworthy and transparent operational system and to differentiate the DaVinci Gold Coin from all other gold coins in circulation Gold Global entered in to a Confidential Agreement in order to use a proprietary nanolaser engraving technology used to engrave each DaVinci Gold Coin with a unique identification number in the form of a QR code (Aztec) that is scanned and registered in the blockchain alongside the specific DaVInci Token that it is irreversibly allocated to 11 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper The engraving process By scanning the QR code Gold Global is able to register each DaVinci Gold Coin on the blockchain by employing a digital anchorage and signature procedure Consequently the \xe2\x80\x98hash\xe2\x80\x99 will be allocated to a DaVinci Token when it is issued to a customer as well as registered in the blockchain on a one to one basis the Company\xe2\x80\x99s general data base and the customer\xe2\x80\x99s personal or corporate ledger wallet Gold Global has chosen an anchorage and data signature solution in order to register all transactions in the blockchain This method of registration which is similar to electronic signatures employed in Bitcoin transactions stores a \xe2\x80\x98family\xe2\x80\x99 of information inside giving total guarantee and protection confidentiality and irreversibility of the data registered The architecture is used within the exposed perspective to secure the physical asset Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s I T infrastructure enables the digitalization of physical gold into a token and a public smart contract on the decentralized blockchain This is where Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract comes in to action The DaVinci Token will easily be integrated and listed on crypto currency exchange platforms Consequently DaVinci Token holders will easily be able to transfer their tokens to an authorized address by employing the transfer function of the contract and signing the transaction with the corresponding private key Gold Global as the digital central authority is the initial contract creator and owner (the address which has signed the transaction deploying the smart contract on the network) The smart contract features modifiers \xe2\x80\x9cwhite listing\xe2\x80\x9d authorized addresses to perform certain functions 12 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper 6 Gold and the Advantages of the DaVinci Token The attraction to physical gold no longer needs to be proven Its stability over the long term is undeniable The precious rare metal is a stable bastion of value able to retain its purchasing power against inflation volatility and any other monetary crises restrictions political uncertainties and risks Gold to this day still is regarded around the world as a financial last resort safe haven GOLD PRICE HISTORICAL CHART The demand for gold remains strong with over USD $180 billion bought and sold in 2018 by individuals investment professionals and sovereign nations Gold remains a unique asset class which derives its fundamental worth from its intrinsic value and as such should in principle never become worthless unlike financial instruments and paper money Fiat currencies despite no longer being pegged to the price of gold a number of central banks continue to increase substantially their gold holdings in order to back their domestic fiat currency and as a hedge against potential political and economic 13 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper uncertainty It is worthy of note that the Chinese and Russian central banks are hoarding large quantities of gold so that their respective currencies may become an alternative for international payments against the US dollar Privately owning and holding physical gold be it either in coin or bullion is inconvenient cumbersome and potentially risky for a private investor unless stored safely Furthermore in order to sell gold coins or bullion a visit to a specialist buyer is required Also it is difficult to transfer or negotiate Peer to Peer gold in any form especially cross border Settling a transaction or paying with gold coins bars or ingots aside from being unusual is not practical or traceable and subject to counterfeiting and fraud In recent times gold owners have been subject to significant losses by unknowingly dealing with fraudulent dealers who utilized apparently perfect looking gold ingots which were in fact made up of a tungsten core (which has a density similar to gold) covered with minimal gold By developing the DaVinci Token and leveraging state of the art technologies including the blockchain technology and nano laser engraving all concerns relating to security authenticity traceability proof of existence counterfeiting storage and exchange have been addressed and resolved Former Chairman of the U S Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan stated \xe2\x80\x9cGold still represents the ultimate mean of payment in the world In the worst case the paper money will not be accepted by nobody while Gold will still be it\xe2\x80\x9d [September 2012]

(blockchain) The birth of a DaVinci Token occurs when Gold Global generates a \xe2\x80\x9cUnique Random Alpha Numeric Code\xe2\x80\x9d that is inked on the Company\xe2\x80\x99s books Customers who have acquired DaVinci Tokens are solely responsible for maintaining the keys allowing them to create a new entry on the ledger thus enabling the transfer of ownership to a third party via a dedicated crypto exchange platform To claim the allocated DaVinci Gold Coin the customer must redeem their DaVinci Token with Gold Global Consequently Gold Global communicates with the Swiss 15 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL

operational diagram (only as an example) Once Private Placements are completed in the first quarter of 2020 Gold Global will then launch its marketing campaign Approved KYC and AML qualified investor will be registered and able to acquire with DaVinci Token and will need to already own a segregated personal compatible crypto wallet Soon thereafter depending on the amount of DaVinci Tokens for which they are subscribing the customer will be informed as to what price needs to be paid in either fiat or approved crypto currencies Qualified investors will then open their client account in one of the following ways Crypto currency holders by depositing the full price of the DaVinci Tokens for which they are subscribing with approved crypto currencies into Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s financial service provider\xe2\x80\x99s crypto wallet The service provider will then perform the KYC and AML procedures and if the subscriber is qualified exchange the deposited cryptos into fiat currency The proceeds will then be transferred into Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s bank account When the financial service provider has completed this currency conversion the appropriate number of DaVinci Tokens (calculated by dividing the amount of fiat currency by the price 16 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper of a DaVinci Token) will be deposited into the subscriber\xe2\x80\x99s crypto currency wallet If there is a surplus as a result of this calculation Gold Global will refund the customer Payment in fiat currency the full price of the DaVinci Tokens purchased is paid by via bank wire transfer in any accepted fiat currency to the financial service provider\xe2\x80\x99s bank The service provider will then perform the KYC and AML procedures and if the investor is qualified then transfers the funds to Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s bank account However if the fiat currency received is affected by a negative change in value the appropriate amount of DaVinci Tokens will be issued (pro rata) and deposited into the customer\xe2\x80\x99s ledger wallet Likewise if there is positive change in value resulting in a surplus Gold Global will repay any resulting discrepancy back to the customer 9 GOLD GLOBAL Group DaVinci Token IT Architecture For the DaVinci Gold Coins Gold Global generates a Unique Random ID Number for each minted gold coin This unique ID number is used to guarantee the existence of the allocated physical gold coin as well as its uniqueness and authenticity No two coins can have the same ID and the system prohibits two or more coins from having the exact same Random ID Base Number The nano laser engraved ID number on each DaVinci Gold Coin is scanned and added to a Merkle tree registered through Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s service provider and ultimately anchored to the blockchain Furthermore when a DaVinci Gold Coin is allocated to a DaVinci Token both are irrevocably registered in the blockchain and the DaVinci Token is consequently transferred into the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s personal wallet 17 \x0cGOLD GLOBAL CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper 10 GOLD GLOBAL Services for Conversion of Purchasers\xe2\x80\x99 Preowned Gold into Digital DaVinci Tokens Gold Global will offer to qualified KYC and AML compliant entities the opportunity to convert their pre owned gold bullion into DaVinci Tokens As an example taking the average spot price of gold as of September 2018 a one [1] kilo 24 karat [999 9%] bullion ingot will allow for the issuance of thirty one [31] DaVinci Tokens Obviously all gold spot pricing will fluctuate By tokenizing their gold bullion in to DaVinci Tokens the associated and otherwise static gold is rendered liquid and becomes easier to negotiate and/or trade in a much simpler and secure way whilst being kept in secure vaults administrated by the qualified Custodian 11 Secure Vault Storage of DaVinci Gold Coins Gold Global has entered into a Service Agreement in November 2019 with BRINKS Zurich to access secure vault storage of the identified DaVinci Gold Coins freely stored for ten years on behalf of the respective DaVinci Token owners Otherwise should any owner decides to redeem their DaVinci Token(s) in order to withdraw any or all his DaVinci Gold Coin(s) but still want a safe and secure place to store them in Switzerland (Geneva or Zurich) Gold Global can refer him to specialized companies offering individual secure non bank safety deposit boxes These safetydeposit boxes are only accessible during business hours but can be made accessible at any time for clients by prior arrangement In due course Gold Global also plans to establish similar secure vault storage agreements with other bonded operators in locations including but not limited to Dubai Singapore Hong Kong Australia and Canada Gold Global will arrange a quarterly external audit of its secure vault storage operations with BRINKS including a

CURRENCY CORP S A \xe2\x80\x93 DaVinci Token White Paper 12 DaVinci Token Owners Access To Their Wallets Gold Global\xe2\x80\x99s DaVinci Tokens will employ a smart contract Once a customer has successfully completed the KYC and AML procedures and the relevant funds have been credited to the Company\xe2\x80\x99s bank account the corresponding DaVinci Tokens will then be electronically delivered through the blockchain into the customer\xe2\x80\x99s personal crypto currency wallet (customers will be required to provide Gold Global with their wallet address) A customer can store their

electronic transactions privately without limitations by computer tablet or smartphones By storing their DaVinci Tokens on a ledger wallet customers can protect themselves from potential cyber criminals seeking to steal their tokens The ledger wallet can be thought of as a \xe2\x80\x98mini safe\xe2\x80\x99 combining the security of cryptographic chips and blockchain technology enabling
