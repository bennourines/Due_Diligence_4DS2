GAPS Platform that allows anyone to develop games without initial capital intends to create virtuous circulation of game development using Private Chain based on Ethereum one of the blockchain platforms We wish that good environments can be provided for everyone to easily develop and enjoy games without intervention of mediators by remarkably reducing game development and distribution steps that hinder development of existing game industry \x0cABSTRACT \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f GAPS Platform provides faster block generation speed than existing PoW GAPS Platform (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm by applying Private Chain out of Ethereum based local chains to adopt DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) type of consensus algorithm and maximizes user convenience such as no transaction charge posed to the users \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f The existing Game Development Platforms are such a system that does Destructive innovation of Game Development Environments not focus on the users but the suppliers In general game development is progressed by popular game publishers under contracts with excellent developers of which publication rights are possessed by the publishers to carry out marketing and distribution by proxy However intervention of this mediator makes excellent developers to request excessive cost In other words a lot of games have been discarded without completion due to needs of the developers who want to develop games with low cost Accordingly intervention of mediators at distribution step act as a factor to make value chain of game development not reach to the last step but be stopped at panning step Core IT Technical Elements Planning Game Development Service (Server) (Continuity/Bilateralness) Developm (Game) Distribution <Value Chain of game Industry> \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f In a system that popular game publishers seek for excellent developers and Recovery of Sovereignty for Game Development make contracts sovereignty of game development is under the suppliers As recently various patters of online game publishers to solve this problem have been activated \xe2\x80\x98Self Publisher\xe2\x80\x99 is a main pattern to carry out from game planning through development and service operation to marketing by the game developers in their capabilities However in the case there is no less time and efforts invested into the entire online publishing value chain so the project is sometimes aborted when it is determined that the game development has low probability of success or no profit versus costs is ensured *DPoS is acronym of Delegated Proof of Stake and refers to a consensus algorithm to allow PoS consensus algorithm to select a block producer and specific nodes to create and manage blocks 04 \x0cGAPS PLATFORM Developer\xe2\x80\x99s Direct Service Game Developer Game Publisher (Development Investment IDC Billings CS) Portal SiteISP ServicePC Cafe Game User Online Distribution <Value Chain of Game Industry> \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f GAPS Platform makes compensation with GAP token to ensure voluntary Incentive Payment participation of participants and virtuous circulation of ecosystem It has prepared a complementary structure of \xe2\x80\x98Mining and Compensation so that the more game users play games the more they get incentives For example whenever game users play games game developers are able to receive game royalty and profit shares from the GAPS Platform In addition to the games it supports compensation of item transactions Besides game developers may purchase copyrights of desired games with GAP token together with compensation from the GAPS Platform \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f GAPS Platform has prepared various business models to maintain value Token Value Retention of GAP token constantly Mining and compensation game industry SDK game copyright transaction transaction etc will be priming water to have positive

receives relatively less influence from offline publishing so keys of success include network operation technology online community activation etc \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Even though a game developers have planning/development capabilities Market Entry Barrier they could not have all of various professional capabilities required on industrial value chain such as customer response operation policies legal response charging and payment system marketing promotion etc faced on actual markets so it can be said to have high market entry barrier Accordingly those online game publishers who have more specialized business management marketing operation technology and financial capabilities have appeared As online game market gradually grows roles of the online game publishers change become more active Especially in initial publishing has succeeded ensured fund and customer asset can be invested into the games that Market wants Then the publisher is able to identify correct needs of the market on the products based on accumulated customer data lead exploration development and release of the product in line with the needs and preoccupy future additional income However it is still far off for those developers who have failed initial publishing or poor environments with deficient capital \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Those games that have been indiscriminatingly released upon market Destructive Innovation response have extremely low probability of success among keen competition Without destructive innovation games cannot be guaranteed success and maintaining success after initial success becomes more difficult Such a game developer who has failed once does not easily try again or sometimes suspends business suffering inefficient profit sharing under success Therefore in order to survive in a game development ecosystem there should be destructive innovation over all areas of R&D organization business structure and management strategy \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f In composition of game development ecosystem for Blockchain roles of the Limited Governance developers are critical their participation into governance is limited If the game developer has participated in governance but there is no continuous compensation they cannot keep participation and the ecosystem cannot survive when the entire members of governance do not have a sound sense of purpose 07 \x0cABSTRACT USER SIDE \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f existing casual games become general trend of the global market the game Fast Change of Game Trend trend are changing fast The game trend is changing toward users such as drastic cutting and shortening of parts not requiring long story such as initial line fighting that the users feel boring or middle or final operation sense fighting etc In addition those trends that lay stress on experience of the users such as creative and plenty story lines physical interaction in a game including AR or VR are taking center stage \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f First it is true that game users are properly protected from unilateral Protection of Poor Users account use restriction forcible termination sanction on item transaction no item refund no account restoration payment damage double payment etc taken by the game developers Because the game developers operate the games for the users under their own control Second the game users cannot be given transparent information from the developers such as careful micro payment policy clear price policy etc Accordingly the users are using games that might be terminated any time and making payment under lack of credit Those damages from lost of paid items at once due to sudden suspension of a service or double payment due to bugs posed by the game developers are fully charged to the users \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f The game platform ecosystem is kept by the active users Constant content Absence of Reasonable Compensation for Game Use updates events cross promotions discount etc have all positive effects on retention of users but effects and responses of each action are different from each user and these are deficient Accordingly in order to maximize inflow of the users departing the existing games and new users reasonable compensation should be given to use of games It is not easy to retain heavy users and active users on a keen competition market game platform ecosystem and compensation is positioned as a feature not an option to increase user retention in line with ever changing game trend

compensation within a game cannot be preserved beyond over the respective game economy as a rile That is it is not easy to trade game items or game account and further difficult to trade copyright of games In addition item management includes collision of interest between game operator and the users \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f ransaction* of digital goods within a game may result in fraud or illegal acts Vulnerable to Fraud Hacking or Illegal Acts In addition since the existing game platform is a centralized system the digital good transaction site becomes a subject to intensive hacking Despite of hacking accident fraud or illegal act there is not many ways for trading party to get remedy Moreover in the event of a hacking accident in the game platform itself the developer suffers from a lot of physical damages or sometimes difficulties in business Besides it is not a negligible level for the users to receive loss from game manipulation etc \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f High usage fee of the game platform poses large burden on the game High Price developers On a position of the game developers who have deficient initial capital and are unavoidable to use the platform service profits versus high price may not be significant Because they should assume loss of reduced PR effects due to a lot of competitors within the platform The game users assume considerably high usage charge on trading of items or game account In addition since there are limited number of sites to allow trade of items and less number of payment measures the users frequently experience inconvenience on use \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Revenue from games on Asian market in 2017 was 51 2 billion dollars Limited Scope of Users representing 46% of the world game industry income However Southeast Asian market including India and South American market have restricted profits for the game users due to lack of various and efficient payment measures Approx 2 billion people of the world population have no bank account and suffer from difficulties to use the games *When the buyer and the seller have agreed it is possible to directly pay the reasonable price or trade goods within game sites after depositing in a mediation site (Escrow) 10 \x0cGAPS Platform 03 TION U L SO he s of t r m e l lea rob nto p propose c i r e ep o ks de intends t

Mining & Compensation game services and get immediate compensation from results Since game play itself contributes to \xe2\x80\x98Mining\xe2\x80\x99 on nodes of the GAPS Platform users get compensation with GAP token In order for the users to get compensation they must have GAP token first It is a system that the more the users have GAP token the more they get compensation \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Assets resulted from compensation are supported for very convenient Storage & Movement of Assets storage and movement Wallet system of GAPS Platform dedicated to cryptocurrency maximizes convenience of user payment and asset movement for the game users over the world including new markets in Southeast Asia including India and South America Core technologies of GAPS Platform only provide dedicated payment service so that anyone can easily make payment without a bank account \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Trust relationship between service providers and users is critical GAPS Trust Network Platform forms a trust network so that anyone can make free trade of items game copyrights game accounts etc The game users may expect profits of increased value addition within decentralized blockchain without intervention of a centralized body or a mediator and solve high usage charge issue paid to the magnificent platform operators such as Google or Apple Such expected profits and reduced middle charge result in increased profitability of individual game operators and lead increased cost effectiveness for the individual game users to use games Since the blockchain based game development platform basically makes forgery impossible it is difficult to manipulate results of a game in advance Accordingly it is suitable to build a concrete solid network between game developers and users GAPS Platform Business Model and Blockchain Technology Ecosystem Business Model Item Transaction Game Copyright Trade Real Time Game GAPS Solution <Solution

\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Blockchain basically does not allow arbitrary modification or forgery of data Reduced Risk of Forgery and Hacking Accordingly it is possible to prevent illegal acts such as prior manipulation of games In addition trade data once recorded on the blockchain cannot be deleted to allow transparent design and operation of games solid network can be built with increased credibility among participants and assets can be efficiently traded Accordingly as game developers and users can protect mutual rights create profits and contribute to expected interest including transparent operation and use of games mutual interests can be improved \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Blockchain basically supports P2P trade based on decentralization Therefore Decentralization there is no intervention of mediators required for entire processes including item trade game copyright trade services after game development etc Since it is possible to release a game to the markets after development without distribution step game users are able to freely enjoy games without excessive charge \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Since the blockchain presupposes distributed network and distributed Dispersed Economy hosting it is free from maintenance cost and unexpected accidents of centralized server and network equipment Even though a certain server stops

BLOCKCHAIN EXPANSION \xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f\xe2\x97\x8f Smart Contract of Ethereum is an automated contract in which \xe2\x80\x98Code\xe2\x80\x99 itself Blockchain 2 0 guarantees credit Purpose of Ethereum is to propose an advanced method to automatically perform contracts between equipment under unreliable computer network However it plays a role to interact with a distributed ledger Blockchain and does not contain any actual contract document It simply executes codes upon sending of a transaction to make a contract on digital and terms and conditions are automatically performed according to the conditions Therefore since upgrade is not easy and it allows only processing of 7~14 transactions a second with no decision making function within the platform it may result in
