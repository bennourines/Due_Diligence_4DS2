not have dreams We set goals Our current goal is ICO which will enable us to reach the upper stage of our development and boost the growth of the company If we succeed we will be able to put into life everything we have planned out for years In other words ICO is the door that leads to a better future 59 \x0cWhat is ICO ICO Initial Coin Offering is an event held by Worlccore to raise funds for its further development and accelerated growth The main idea is to raise money for the project by selling a part of the project\xe2\x80\x99s cryptocurrency called tokens to investors and people who believe in the project After ICO is completed the tokens will become available for public trading at a price higher than ICO price with active growth based on statistics and completed steps What is a token It is a smart contract that entitles its owner to receive profit from Worldcore It\xe2\x80\x99s a special file an analogue of a share that you can store sell on exchanges to other traders when there is a surge in token price or simply receive revenue share once a year How will the profits be paid to investors 30% of company profit will be distributed to all token holders Each holder

Nevertheless ICO will help us reach our goal in a much shorter amount of time what is more important for us is that we will do it together Worldcore tokens are one of the best digital assets on the market to date based on a profitable and actively developing business working in one of the fastest growing areas Fintech industry 62 \x0cInterest to investors participating in ICO Tokens are the stocks of the 21st century Millions of exchange brokers worldwide earn millions by trading tokens at digital asset exchanges such as Poloniex Kraken Bitfinex GDAX Bitstamp etc The success of the stock market is largely due to the fact that the stocks reflect the shares in existing companies However today in the ICO market one can find a great number of tokens of nonexistent companies This is the problem 63 63 \x0cUsually people without experience in the cryptocurrency industry cannot understand what ICO is and how can they profit from it Since ICO is quite a new event on the financial market
