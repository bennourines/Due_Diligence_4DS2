Whitepaper This Whitepaper has been updated taking into consideration the developments in cryptocurrency regulation and progress in the implementation of the Edgeless Casino project This new wording of Edgeless Casino Crowdsale Whitepaper entirely restates and replaces the Edgeless Casino Crowdsale Whitepaper published in early 2017 which will automatically become null and void as of publication of this new wording of Edgeless Casino Crowdsale Whitepaper 3 \x0cExecutive Summary The online gambling industry was valued at USD 45 86 billion in 2016 However it has two major problems the price \xe2\x80\x8bof the gamble and \xe2\x80\x8btransparency The price of the individual gamble comes from user unfriendly rules a large house edge of 1% 15% (ref Expn Section nr 1) money deposit/withdrawal fees and 2 3 days withdrawal delays In addition there is no way of knowing what is happening inside the casino\xe2\x80\x99s servers and how the mechanisms are programmed It can be easily rigged Players need to rely on trusting the casino which is most likely not the best option in such a profit driven industry In 2008 Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies solved the gambling price problem Cryptocurrency casinos are cost effective and can offer a 0 01% 2% house edge with instant money transactions without or little fees However the \xe2\x80\x8btransparency problem is still there Casinos can easily rig the game or hide profitability from the investors Using Ethereum smart contracts (ref Expn Section Nr 1 5) we can have a low price per gamble and solve the transparency problem Random numbers and payouts can be ruled by smart contracts which are fully public and implemented on an Ethereum blockchain Now players can see everything transactions sums bets the reasons why transactions are moving and most importantly the mechanism of randomness If the casino tried to rig the odds it would be immediately spotted Our team brings the first \xe2\x80\x8btransparent and selected \xe2\x80\x8bzero edge casino games to the market Decentralised Edgeless Casino At this point in time there are no casinos like this in the world Our casino will offer a 0% edge Blackjack as well as other games like Dice and Sports Betting All games will be based on the Ethereum smart contract and will ensure transparency The business will sustain itself in two ways 1 From the players\xe2\x80\x99 imperfect play Blackjack and Poker are games of skill and luck If players make perfect decisions they will reach a 0% edge on average however a 4 \x0cplayer makes mistakes so it will give a 0 83% edge to the casino and this 0 83% will be earned from the money wagered 2 Sports Betting is about connecting players who are betting against each other and taking the facilitation fee to manage the process The fee depends on the game types the number of participants bonuses and more It is dynamic floating in the range of 0% 10% Approximately 4% is earned from the money wagered Edgeless project \xe2\x97\x8f Edgeless Casino Project unites players that want a fairer and more transparent online gaming industry and want to support its creation \xe2\x97\x8f Edgeless Casino is fully transparent since it is based on Ethereum Smart contracts \xe2\x97\x8b Edgeless Casino players will trust that the casino will not cheat them \xe2\x97\x8b Bankroll of Edgeless Casino will be formed by Edgeless Casino unless the Edgeless Casino decides otherwise \xe2\x97\x8b EDG Token holders can access the Edgeless Casino and play available online games \xe2\x97\x8f Edgeless Casino is the first casino with 0% edge based on the Ethereum blockchain \xe2\x97\x8f Edgeless Casino will have strong competitive advantages (0% edge transparency) to increase its market share in order to become a sustainable business \xe2\x97\x8f Edgeless Casino can provide many gambling games (BlackJack Poker Dice Sports Betting) Let\xe2\x80\x99s decentralise and solve the main online gambling problems Traditional Online Casino Bitcoin Online Casino Edgeless Online Casino (Based on Ethereum Smart Contracts) House Edge 1% 15% 1% 0 1% 0% Free money withdrawals and deposits x Yes Yes No delay to money withdrawals and deposits x Yes Yes 5 \x0cFully transparent random number fairness check x x Yes Transparency guided by Ethereum smart contract x x Yes 1 Price and Transparency Problems of Online Gambling As stated before in 2016 the online gambling industry was valued at USD 48 6 billion and has shown steady growth each year Most of a casino\xe2\x80\x99s profits come from the \xe2\x80\x9chouse edge\xe2\x80\x9d The House Edge is a term used to describe the mathematical advantage that the gambling game (and therefore the commercial gambling venue) has over you as you play This advantage results in an assured percentage returned to the house over the duration of playing time and for you it is an assured percentage loss of what you bet Imagine that you are playing roulette and you bet $100 on the colour red As roulette has a number ZERO coloured in green which is neither red or black the house gets an advantage of 2 7% that is calculated thus 100 (36 +1) = 2 7% So if the house has an edge you ultimately lose every time If you bet $10 your expected loss is $0 27 In one hour you can spin approximately 20 25 times If every time you bet $10 then in that hour you are expected to lose $5 4 $6 75 This loss can be calculated using the expected value (EV) formula EV = (prob win)(gain) (prob lose)(gain) Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you are betting $10 on red which gives you an expected $20 win and $10 is your expected loss Roulette has 18 black fields 18 red fields and 1 green zero When you put all the variables in the equations this is what you get EV = $20(18/37 )+ $0(19/37) = $9 73 + $0 = $9 73 6 \x0cIf you bet $10 on a roulette red at the end of the game then you are expected to have $9 73 And $0 27 is lost due to the house edge This means that for each $10 that you bet you are giving away 27 cents to the house Of course in real life numbers do not hit exactly like that and we may have a bigger range of wins and loses The house edge is different for each game \xe2\x80\x8bHere you can find a list of games and house edges Overall we have two major problems in the online gambling industry the price of the gamble and house transparency As this industry is growing rapidly these problems become ever more relevant 1 1 Rise of the Cryptocurrency Reduce the Gamble Price One of the reasons why online casinos have a deposit fee withdrawal fees and extended withdrawal times are to do with problems related to traditional forms of currency such as USD and EUR To move traditional currency from one account to the other is expensive It has to go through many third parties and regulators which take their bit out of every transaction In 2008 cryptocurrency Bitcoin came to life and started changing a lot of areas of our lives including the online gambling industry By providing instant and low cost currency transactions Bitcoin became a game changer for online casinos Some rooms offer a house edge that is lower than 1% which is more of a fair bet This significantly improves the quality of the gamble as a whole That\xe2\x80\x99s why cryptocurrency based online casinos are on the rise Right now we have more than 100 rooms based on a cryptocurrency which accounts for 10 billion bets and is growing each year In fact 60% of all Bitcoin transactions are gambling related However one major problem has not been solved yet \xe2\x80\x8btransparency\xe2\x80\x8b Even after the cost of the gamble has been reduced significantly we still have many rooms rigging the odds and stealing from customers Famous cases of Bitcoin casinos rigging the odds can be founded \xe2\x80\x8bhere and here So one major problem is left transparency 7 \x0c1 2 Fairness Check\xe2\x80\x99s Problems and Limitations 1 2 1 Random Number Generator 1 2 1 1 Explanation of Fairness Check Online casinos create a random number using a combination of casino and client numbers The casino assigns their own number automatically and the visitor can do it manually or let the casino decide for them The two numbers are blended to provide a random outcome The idea behind it is that the casino can rig their own number but they would not be able to rig the client\xe2\x80\x99s number and therefore the outcome will be random Therefore a casino would not be able to cheat Oversimplified example casino is assigned a number (also known as a seed) visitor assigns the other number (seed) The visitor can set it manually before every game or let the casino decide Both numbers are blended into one number and using a formula (it\xe2\x80\x99s unknown to the player and determined by the casino otherwise the player could predict the final outcome) the random number is generated After the game visitors can use a special key (hash information access code/label/tag) to access the information related to that game and see what seeds were blended and which number was generated as the result 1 2 1 2 Loops in Fairness Check 1) The casino can easily influence the client\xe2\x80\x99s seed by assigning it themselves (that\xe2\x80\x99s the case in most casinos because an average player is not going to type and give a random number before every gamble round even if they have this option) 2) The client entered the seed once and is not changing it The casino can identify it and use that information to adjust their own seed 3) The casino can delay creating their own seed and provide it to the \xe2\x80\x98blender\xe2\x80\x99 once the visitor has sent theirs Then the casino can adjust their own seed to the client\xe2\x80\x99s Even if client sees that the \xe2\x80\x98randomness\xe2\x80\x99 of the casino is on the right track the casino still has the ability to freeze a player s account without reason and steal the deposit since these actions depend on humans\xe2\x80\x99 decisions but not on non changeable fully transparent and decentralised smart contracts There are so many ways of cheating that it is clear that a new generation of online casinos is needed 8 \x0c1 2 2 Bitcoin Casino Can Also Drain Investors Profits A lot of cryptocurrency casinos offer investment opportunities for people They can invest into the casino s bankroll and get a share of a casino\xe2\x80\x99s profits All cryptocurrency transactions are public on the blockchain so it is easy to see the exact profits every day That\xe2\x80\x99s why this investment looks really attractive However there is a way that casinos can drain profits from their wallet and pay less to investors For example a casino shares 50% of its profit to its investors In 2016 they made $1 000 000$ profit and $500 000 should therefore go to the investors However the casino wants to cheat and pay less They can easily drain money from the casino\xe2\x80\x99s wallet into a different wallet which belongs to them and no one would even suspect that it has happened They would do this by 1 Casino owner enters his own online casino with a new account and different wallet 2 Casino edits code in casino server and riggs odds ONLY for that new account 3 Casino owner wins against casino and leaves 4 The casino pays less profit share to its investors because they think casino just had a loss and someone got lucky But they have no idea that the lucky person is the owner of the casino Blockchain can see all transactions and the sums transferred However they cannot see the reasons why transactions are moving or what is happening inside the casino\xe2\x80\x99s server This scheme can be done in low sums and systematically over the year At the end of the year investors would see the total casino\xe2\x80\x99s profit and calculate the EV based on their edge E g casino\xe2\x80\x99s profits are 10% less than expected however no one would suspect that the owner took it And 10% from half a million is $50 000 That is one way that casinos can lower their public profits and steal money as a result 1 3 Edgeless Casino Solution This is why we will be developing Edgeless a next generation casino Edgeless casino will be built on the Ethereum blockchain All of the key operations will be regulated by smart contracts giving users a fully transparent experience 9 \x0cWe will be using the client\xe2\x80\x99s seed and our own seed to generate randomness Users will know our hashed (SHA512) seed before betting and before generating their own client seeds Because of that there is no way for us to alter the results After bet is made client will be able to see our unhashed seed on Ethereum Blockchain and verify the randomness Moreover clients will have two options for getting random seeds The first one is to type it in manually before every game this would eliminate any ability to cheat the clients The second one which will be used by default is to generate different client seeds automatically for every game by using an API integration with random org Smart contracts will be publicly available on the blockchain for everyone to examine and to test its randomness procedure 1 4 Edgeless Based on Ethereum Smart Contracts Full Transparency In 2015 the creation of the Ethereum smart contract is another major game changer for online gambling Right now we can solve the transparency issue once and for all Using a smart contract there is no way that casinos can rig the odds even if they wanted to That means in 2017 2018 we can have \xe2\x80\x9cTHE PERFECT ONLINE CASINO\xe2\x80\x9d which can offer 0% house edge and 100% transparency That\xe2\x80\x99s a next generation gambling product which is the best in a current market and does not exist Yet The real power of smart contracts is that if they are properly implemented on Ethereum Blockchain they will act each and every time how they are supposed to That is truly trust flawless technology that eventually all online casinos will be using Also it is near impossible to censor smart contracts because they are placed in a decentralized infrastructure All Ethereum smart contracts will be publicly available for everyone to see and examine in publicly accessible websites In the same trustworthy way that our casino will be operated if a user bets on a particular game they can be 100% sure that their result will be truly random and that they will get their win transferred directly into their wallet The casino will not be able to suspend the transaction or redirect it to another wallet 10 \x0cGraph Edgeless randomness and fairness mechanism based on Ethereum Player wallet will receive Edgeless token in case of a win and all games will be played with Edgeless token 2 How Edgeless Casino Can be a Profitable Business Offering 0% House Edge 2 1 Player Mistakes and Imperfect Play Most casino games do not require any skill to play or change the odds like roulette dice and slots However there are a few games which combine luck and skill By providing more options blackjack video poker players can influence house edge That means that the 11 \x0chouse edge depends on the skill level of the player Blackjack is the game which has the lowest casino edge (0 6%) if played perfectly The average player however does not play the \xe2\x80\x98perfect game\xe2\x80\x99 and they make mistakes Black Jack provides a variety of decisions to the player and based on that they can increase or decrease their chance of winning On average a player makes mistakes which are equivalent of 1 43% If we offer a 0% house edge game mistakes count for a 0 83% house edge That means on every $100 bet an average player gives 83 cents to the house Take a look at full report and analysis of blackjack house edge and player mistakes \xe2\x80\x8bhere 2 2 Gambler s\xe2\x80\x99 Ruin and Variance Gambler\xe2\x80\x99s ruin adds an extra profit to the casino A gambler with finite wealth playing a fair game (both sides have equal chance of winning 0% house edge) would lose against an opponent with infinite wealth It\xe2\x80\x99s quite simple a larger bankroll can absorb higher levels of variance And small bankrolls can\xe2\x80\x99t That means a small player would bust more even if the casino has a 0% edge Let\xe2\x80\x99s take an example \xe2\x80\x9cAssume that the player makes a deposit of $1000 to an online casino and wants to bet till he reaches $5000 that has been wagered If the player is willing to play through 500 hands then his average bet size would be $5000/500 = $10 The number of betting units would be $1000/$10 = 100 The table shows the risk of ruin is 0 01% for 102 units so would be just over 0 01% for 100 Perhaps this is too conservative so the player considers playing 200 hands The bet size is now $5000/200 = $25 The number of units is $1000/$25 = 40 Interpolating the table shows the risk of ruin would be 1 5% \xe2\x80\x9d 12 \x0cSource \xe2\x80\x8b http //wizardofodds com/games/blackjack/appendix/12/ More info \xe2\x80\x8bhttp //wizardofodds com/games/blackjack/appendix/4/ At this stage we cannot estimate the profits coming from the gambler\xe2\x80\x99s ruin effect It strongly depends on the type of players gambling in the casino and their bankroll management skills 2 3 How will We Reduce an Edge to 0% Casino has a blackjack edge because they have best decision making position the last one That means that players can bust before the house even draws a card To compensate for this edge the house gives additional bonuses to the player such as 1 to 3 payoff in the case of blackjack and the ability to double bet if casino has a bad card That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we will do increase these additional bonuses by reducing house edge to 0% Actually such game models already exist Voyages Casino has one However they charge 10% for money withdraws and there is no way of knowing if they are rigging the odds or not You can play a 0% edge blackjack demo here \xe2\x80\x8bhttps //betvoyager com/games/equal odds/ 13 \x0c2 4 Games Provided by Edgeless Casino Based on results of the Crowdsale these are the following games which Edgeless Casino will offer 0% Edge Blackjack the payout structure will be changed in favour of the player so the house edge would be reduced to ZERO Here you can play a demo of zero edge blackjack https //betvoyager com/games/equal odds/ Dice The game rules result in a 0 05% edge The concept is similar to most bitcoin dice casinos however the payout structure will be fairer If you bet 1BTC on 50% most Bitcoin casinos will offer 1 98x payout We will offer a 1 995x fair bet payout Sports Betting it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a traditional casino gambling game but in order to attract a wider scope of people we want to offer more games In the future we will expand on the games offered by our casino 3 Participatory function of EDG tokens 3 1 The function of EDG tokens Edgeless Casino Project aims at bringing more transparency into the gambling industry and therefore changing it from the roots To reach this aim we want to form a community which would believe and support the idea The EDG Token will be used to play in the Edgeless Casino available games EDG Token will not offer any right to profits dividends or other right to revenue of the Edgeless Casino EDG Token is purely utility token to power Edgeless infrastructure After the launch Edgeless Casino will not sell any EDG tokens or offer exchange services to other cryptocurrencies or FIAT Third party providers could offer such service 14 \x0c4 Edgeless Casino Road map 4 1 Market Potential The more community members and players the Edgeless Casino have the bigger bank roll can be formed and won on the Edgeless Casino The online gambling casino industry is valued at USD 45 86 billion and is expected to grow up to USD 56 billion in 2018 Every year more and more market share of that is going into cryptocurrency gambling solutions The industry has two major problems transparency and price of the online gamble \xe2\x97\x8f At this point online casinos have full power to cheat without being spotted \xe2\x97\x8f At this point players need to pay deposit/ withdrawal fees wait for payouts and gamble on 1% 15% house edge It all can be changed with the Edgeless Ethereum based Casino Comparison table shows the main Edgeless casino based on Ethereum competitive
