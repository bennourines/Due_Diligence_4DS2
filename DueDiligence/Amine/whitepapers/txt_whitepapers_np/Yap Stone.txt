granted to community and it will result in virtuous circle of economy YAP Stone will formulate Shared Economy platform that will distribute profits generated by the community back to the community that have contributed and become Key currency of Smart City with Cryptocurrency with credibility and guarantee 8 \x0cAbstract Birth of YAP STONE Yap is a beautiful island located in the Caroline Islands in the Western Pacific region It has a magnificent scenery with greenish coral reef dolphins and school of fishes The island had been using stone money and the value of the stone was decided according to the size weight and number of people who were sacrificed in the process of transporting the stone Thus the value of the stone was decided according to the history it had The limestone that was too heavy to transport also had value even when it was placed in the middle of the road or was located in the middle of the deep blue sea The ownership of the stone was decided by an oral agreement The ownership of this stone is yours from now This is because people had absolute belief and trust for each other Yap s system of certifying currency through notary service based on credibility is similar to the principle behind Blockchain s technology Yap Stone was born under the idea of community spirit and mutual credibility which are promised to be provided for our customers YAP Chain is a blockchain optimized for Smart City which is an urban operational system for organizations shopping malls and cities that will issue YAP Stone and through the issuance of YAP Token smart contract and DApp based on credibility and communality will be provided Solution of Urbanization Smart City All major cities in the world are faced with a challenge of improving citizen s quality of life According to the World Urbanization Forecast report by UN in 2014 50% of the total global population resides in city and is predicted that 2 5 billion will move to city to reside which will result in rapid global urbanization causing shortage of resources infrastructure energy and traffic congestion etc Such phenomenon will gradually aggravate the problems in city 9 \x0cY 2015 UN World Urbanization Forecast Report (Urbanization Ratio) 82 5% Korea 93 5% Japan 81 6% 82 6% USA UK As a resolution the method of efficiently utilizing technology to the current city infrastructure has gained more attention rather than expanding the city infrastructure Low economic growth rate highly advanced ICT development and increasing level of city development demand require effective solution to urbanization problems By simultaneously coping with 4th industrial revolution many countries around the world are competing to develop Smart City as their new motive for stabilization Between the period of 2016 to 2030 the whole world needs an investment of USD 3 3 trillion annually to maintain the current growth rate Compared to the period between 2000 to 2015 with an invested amount of USD 2 5 trillion required investment for coming years have increased to over 30% Since the downturn of global economic growth starting from the United States financial crisis the slowing infrastructure investment is showing signs of gradual recovery centering around the US and Asia Pacific regions China is planning to strategically secure overseas markets by expanding infrastructure investment in the surrounding countries and the US is also planning to reconstruct the collapsed infrastructure by investing USD 1 5 trillion Along with traditional infrastructure investments diverse types of infrastructure investments have evolved due to arising social expectations from increased level of income and urbanization development Finding ways to resolve the urbanization problems and to restructure a new blockchain ecosystem based on 4th Industrial Revolution related new technology such as blockchain Big Data Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI related infrastructure autonomous car drone and mobile objects virtual reality renewable energy etc results in improved quality of life Moreover 10 \x0ccoping with 4th industrial revolution is essential for future growth motives and for developing and expanding Smart City Blockchain based Shared Economy Platform and Smart City Cryptocurrency based on blockchain network gave its birth with key values of definance and decentralization after experiencing Financial crisis in 2008 Rise of the Internet have reduced the cost of information communication and resulted in IT Revolution Similarly changes caused by blockchain will reduce the financial cost and result in Shared Economy Revolution Credibility and guarantee provided through Decentralized Blockchain Network and the Community enables reduces finanacing and operational costs and intermediary commissions consequently resulting in Shared Economy Revolution that enables profits to be returned to the community In the past there has been endeavors to create Shared Economy through social enterprises such as Union group purchase vouchers Discount days (Black Friday etc) and blockchain will provide general platform to absorb such efforts 11 \x0cCredibility provided through Blockchain and the Community the community members can enjoy financing tool that allow community members to obtain speedy financing compared to the existing financing methods Community members can secure competitiveness via its obtained markets and financing and the profits generated from such activities will be returned to the community members The Smart City based on Share Economy Value will prevent leakage of profits generated within the Smart City and will return all profits back to the Smart City Community members In addition YAP Stone that aims to become the key currency of the Smart City can collaborate with other Smart Cities that are connected to YAP Stone and broanden the scale of the market volume and share even bigger scaled Smart City and the community members can produce and supply highly competitive products/services and the profits generated from its economic activities can be returned to the community members who have exerted their efforts 12 \x0c1 Market Status 1) Smart City Trend Global urbanization in 2014 was 54% and is anticipated to increase to 66% in 2050 Furthermore mega city s growing population of over 10 million is straining resources and infrastructure and the consequent carbon emissions are fueling global warming and environmental crisis Increase in income level will seek for more convenient and higher quality of life and all age groups using internet and mobile phones will have a higher level of expectation for Smart city with smart information Smart City Sectors 2020 10 21% Gov &Education 20 93% Security 15 26% Energy

16\xeb\x85\x84 20\xeb\x85\x84 13 \x0c2) Smart City Execution Status and Opportunities by Country Along with technology advancement many of the major cities in the world are working on Smart City project China alone is investing 500 billion CNY in over 300 cities for developing Smart City and in India where population is growing 10 million a year developing Smart City is the utmost priority business India s Prime Minister Modi s announcement to invest KRW 1 trillion for developing over 100 Smart cities nationwide is an example Representative Smart cities like Singapore and Barcelona provide diverse solutions focusing on data centric platform via collaboration between private and government sectors Singapore has announced its national vision of constructing Smart Nation by 2025 with the government on the lead and forming private partnerships to attract investment On the other hand Barcelona is developing Barcelona city OS platform that implements 24 Smart solutions around various locations in the city by fostering 22@Barcelona as an ICT enterprise cluster and builds partnerships with numerous global companies Europe is also seriously focusing on the Smart City development and Italy has announced that they will invest Euro 37 million Middle East and Africa have also announced to allocate 80% of their infrastructure budget to development of Smart City Recently based on the city conditions Smart cities with diverse contents and strategies such as City Platform (Data Herb) Living Lab Pilot City etc are being developed In order to resolve the current city problems global giants\xe2\x80\x93 IBM Cisco Google etc are preempting and leading the global market of AI Big Data autonomous car and other advanced technologies On the other hand there exist negative views about the Smart City business led by the government due to indiscrete business development as well as privacy invasion and issues of personal rights Therefore with Smart City business as a core future industry it is necessary to validate related legal aspects and encourage active participation of private sectors So that from the initial stages of business planning multi dimensional business models can develop and cooperation with experts can supervise the business in order to prevent fundamental problems that may arise As a result YAP Chain has planned YAP Chain project to build Smart City on top of YAP Chain s exclusive blockchain ecosystem 14 \x0cOnce the YAP Chain is established it will enable the Smart City to develop more smartly and will contribute as a driving force for the 4th Industrial Revolution 15 \x0c2 YAP Chain Introduction YAP Chain is an exclusive and independent blockchain ecosystem that has never existed and will become the core motive for Smart City It is a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that makes Smart City as a single unified computer that enables users to make smart payment contract MOU voting etc without the involvement of a 3rd party thereby allowing users to enjoy a convenient and secure city life Smart City is built on mutual interaction of human technical infrastructural and organizational resources 16 \x0cIn the perspective of YAP Chain for the composition factors of Smart City the technological structure will change the lifestyle of residence within the city Thus technology will be utmost important to make the city smarter YAP Chain is composed of YAP Stone Smart Contract) and Yap Token \xc2\x83 YAP Stone saves information Smart City resource generated by YAP Chain \xc2\x83 When users approach respective industry Smart Contract digitalizes the contract based on terms and conditions and makes agreement through connected YAP Token asset completes the contract and execution and implementation is carried out From technical aspect Smart City developed through YAP Chain is considered as infrastructure and service as part of the blockchain technology In the perspective of YAP Chain Smart City provides resources necessary for city life based on real time recognition system via Smart Contract while advanced analytics help people to make intellectual decisions on solutions and optimize one s underutilized assets Smart City developed through YAP Chain enables residents to live a happier healthier smarter and a cleaner life while the company can provide sustainable competitive and transparent capital based on innovative interface YAP Chain is confident to say that it can resolve the fundamental problems that Smart City holds 17 \x0cSmart City developed through YAP Chain provides diverse strategic value added services and eliminates failures or conflict of interest through YAP Chain s core value of blockchain technology YAP Chain is an independent platform and issues YAP Stone via independent protocol connected to mainnet and YAP Chain smart contract produces customized YAP Token to various industries It can be supplied to the following industries \xc2\x83 YAP Stone as a global currency in global Smart Cities \xc2\x83 ID card and various authentication sectors \xc2\x83 Domestic and International Remittance sectors \xc2\x83 On/Offline Payment Sectors \xc2\x83 Point payment/mileage sectors \xc2\x83 Chatbot (AI) sectors \xc2\x83 Security IoT Smart Home and Communication sectors \xc2\x83 YAP Token for other necessary purposes in Smart City YAP Chain expects to consistently contribute in the growth of 4th Industry Revolution s core business sector \xe2\x80\x93 Smart City industry 18 \x0c3 YAP Chain Composition YAP Chain is aiming to develop an independent blockchain ecosystem focusing on Smart City YAP Chain is composed of YAP Stone SMART Contract and YAP Token 1) YAP Stone Objective & Purpose YAP Stone is a composing unit of YAP Chain and is an independent ecosystem that does not belong to an existing platform thus enabling core activities and transactions Like other cryptocurrencies YAP Stone can be relocated replaced and used for trading YAP Stone will be listed in numerous ICO Exchanges and the owners can freely trade the coins Supply of YAP Stone will be limited It will be used as a global currency in Smart Cities developed through YAP Chain YAP Stone is completely integrated within YAP Chain and can be exchanged with YAP Token produced in Smart Contract 19 \x0cYAP Token produced for diverse sectors provided by Smart City is exclusively exchanged through YAP Stone Therefore it is anticipated that YAP Stone s demand will increase proportionally to the number of active users Technology Implementation Blockchain technology prevents forgery since it is a distributed database and enables users to use them in distributed network as a shared asset and ledger YAP Chain is embraces Turing Complete programming language a fundamental and crucial element of blockchain Using this programming language anyone can draft contracts that include Arbitrary State Transition functions and implement afore mentioned system as well as to help make applications that were never envisioned with ease YAP Stone s basic format can be coded in about 2 lines and currency and evaluation system can be coded within 20 lines Smart Contract which is a type of encrypted box that can save specific value and satisfy special conditions can be produced on top of this platform as well This is possible as it provides functions much more powerful than Scripting provided by Bitcoin and it includes concepts such as Turing Completeness Blockchain Awareness and States 20 \x0c2) Smart Contract Objective & Purpose Smart Contract is developed on the basis of YAP Stone which is a powerful motive for Smart City that enables residents or visitors to approach diverse sectors without any 3 rd party or intermediary involved to digitalized various contracts under conditions via distributed ledger technology Through YAP Token which is connected to an individual s asset once mutual consensus is made the contract is executed It functions as a multi signature account and can be used when more than a certain number of participants agree upon the budget and management of the contract \xc2\x83 It can manage agreement between user s transactions and contracts For instance it can manage content of a contract or transaction information of an individual s purchase of an insurance product from another individual \xc2\x83 It can provide utility to contents of other contracts \xc2\x83 It can save domain registration information or membership records Technology Implementation Smart Contract developed by YAP Chain is blockchain platform that overcomes the limitation of Bitcoin s Scripting system by enabling diverse saving state and allows loop YAP Stone includes function in a compiled code format and synchronizes to blockchain At this point it inputs function for information included in the transaction and executes coded function and the result is separately recorded which completes the Smart Contract Therefore besides the YAP Stone which is an independent coin it allows saving of other digital objects thereby diverse currency can be produced and transacted on top of YAP Chain network In the case of AYP Stone s Smart Contract Supporting blockchain it is composed of transaction DB storage that changes the status of the Smart Contract and a Smart Contract DB that stores latest state of the Smart Contract Smart Contract is an application that can change the status and the status of Smart Contract is variables that are used in the application The input value to change is included in the transaction 21 \x0c22 \x0c3) YAP Token Objective & Purpose YAP Token is produced for various industry sectors from a platform for Decentralized Application (DApp) YAP Token is based on YAP Chain platform and is necessary for using DApp services At this point commission fee for transaction between tokens is paid as YAP Stone Developers who use DApp to provide new DApp services can share YAP Token and the service provider can either directly sell the token or trade within the exchange Those who own YAP Token will be able to exchange them with YAP Stone at a certain percentage Technology Implementation YAP Token System can be use in diverse industry of the Smart City From online and offline payment method non forgeable ID card and to other types of token system disconnected from standard value (e g point system for incentives coupons) applications that allow different types of transaction systems on network are available YAP Token System can be developed incredibly easy from the YAP Chain The fundamental of YAP Token System is that a database can execute only one type of operation YAP Token System has a feature that Bitcoin s currency does not have Transaction fee can be paid with the same currency that was used in the transaction The following procedures are necessary in order to complete a transaction To execute a contract user must maintain a balance of at least the amount of YAP Stone to be paid to the sender During contract execution the commission fee received as YAP Token can immediately change to YAP Stone at the YAP Chain Exchange System and top up the YAP Stone balance Although users must activate wallet through YAP Stone value earned from respective contracts can be exchanged to YAP stone thereby enabling the use of topped up YAP Stone The commission fee paid in the process of contract execution can be paid from either the user or the service provider according to the service policy 23 \x0c4 Core Service for Growth The main objective of YAP Chain is to develop Smart City connected to YAP Stone worldwide YAP Chain provides distributed platform that enables individuals in the Smart City to easily use and exchange encrypted asset and currency to purchase goods services and currencies Initial Business Stage is Vertical Unified Process Leading changes in paradigm by combining Yap Chain based technology and variety of services to replace services necessary for everyday life Long Term Business is Horizontal Unified Process Vertical unified process will be grafted with contents and city policies to connect the whole city into a unified chain enabling residents to enjoy their city life YAP Chain aims to approach more people by overcoming the limitations of the current Smart City 24 \x0c1) Phase 1 Smart Economy YAP company will replace and develop existing payment related services with a blockchain base and will execute payment related services using the YAP Token in the Smart City This will enable commission free payment service resulting in contribution of profit to the local society and reactivation of the local economy Furthermore it can exchange services through interconnection with other Smart Cities that will create added values \xe2\x91\xa0 Local Currency (Peg Coin) Local Currency can be issued via YAP Chain Token Issuing System to respective Smart Cities Local Currency can reflect the inflation of the region accelerate consumption within the regions and restore the added value to the region Through the YAP Wallet exchange function currencies used in different Smart Cities can be exchanged with YAP Stone which will promote and accelerate interaction with other Smart Cities Since the YAP Stone will control the exchange rate according to its fluctuation in value value volatility is minimized and it will become a compatible cryptocurrency for payment Additionally through ICO listing based on its local currency fund for the relevant local Smart City development can be raised to secure and extend financial resources 25 \x0cThe Local Currency is issued via a YAP TOKEN The YAP TOKEN provides a variety of specifications for this In order for YAP Stone to play the role of Local Currency it must obtain the exchange value General tokens have too much price fluctuation and it is difficult to obtain the exchange value and if the price change is minimal it cannot attract investment YAP Stone have overcome the above problems by composing exchange rate system that adjusts exchange rate with Stable token based on price change Just like existing currencies that obtained credibility based on Gold Standards YAP Chain is planning to open exchange market that can obtain credibility via fixed price of specialized local or community products similar to Gold Standards Local currency is basis for YAP Stone markets to attract community users The initial step is to issue local currencies via negotaitions with local governments globally and issuing college coins centered on college towns \xe2\x80\xbb College coin is local currency that returns payment commissions back to colleges and students that arises from stores/restaurants within the 4km radius of the respective colleges The profits generated from College coins will be used for scholarships copying costs and for volunteer activities \xe2\x80\xbb Local currency refers to the issuing of the coin unlimited to physical space and provision of the same service through interaction between similar service networks 26 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa1 Point Integrated Coin Point Integrated Coin combines points from various point systems of numerous companies into a unified YAP Token that can be used and transacted Similar to Local Currency the value votality is reduced to offer a transferrable point coin Depending on the its current value exchange rates can change thereby creating a point coin exchange market Applying the same principle as above a coin derived from a different blockchain technology can give rise to its exchange market 27 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa2 Online and Offline Payment Through YAP Chain consumers and service providers can interact directly without any intermediaries and settle payment without any commission Through innovation of logistics online and offline integrated payments are available An ATM for exchanging YAP Stone with conventional currency is potentially under development \xe2\x91\xa3 Smart Concierge (Reservation Order) Location based service reservation and order services are developed through indoor navigation GPS YAP Beacons etc 28 \x0cReservation and order services via Messenger Chatbot are possible and appropriate information and benefits can be enjoyed at any time and any place 2) Phase 2 Smart Governance & People The ID card customized for Smart City enables authentication of Smart City residents and foreigner s engagement in local economic activities life etc Smart City communication system allows Smart City residents to participate in turns for major decision makings and to deliver added values generated from the region 29 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa0 ID Card It controls entry of its residents to the Smart City and it supports the participation of economic activities from outsiders(foreigners) \xe2\x91\xa1 Communication YAP Chain makes communication within the Smart City possible so that residents can participate in major decision makings and receive public announcement Contents reward system based on Steemit rewards residents who have produced information and reviews of the local region and search function without SPAMS is built on a trusted system \xe2\x91\xa2 Insurance Medical There is no insurance salesperson because it is based on smart contract and it is possible to develop insurance product that benefits the contractor as a priority \xe2\x91\xa3 Security (Blocky) Smart City s information security will be developed through Blocky Blockchain System \xe2\x91\xa4 Others Smart Contract Authentication Smart Education Employment Support 30 \x0c3) Phase 3 (Partner Participation) Smart Living & Mobility Through participation of top tier companies in respective industries it supports Smart Living & Mobility 4) Phase 4 Smart Environment It supports Smart Environment through participation of top tier companies in the industry 31 \x0c5) Smart City Partners Smart City partners of YAP Chain will contribute in providing technology infrastructure network etc or develop existing services to connect with YAP Stone or YAP Chain platform Respective partners can implement ICO or issue its coins through YAP Token YAP Company and its partners will participate in the Smart City business consortium All top tier world class companies will participate in the diverse fields of Smart Logistics Sharing house Smart Mobility Healthcare Smart home Mixed Reality Smart Sensor Environment Monitor and Energy preservation/recycling 32 \x0c6) Vision While Bitcoin opened up a new generation of blockchain Ethereum provided vision to its ecosystem Recently numerous 3rd generation coins that has increased its transaction rate and lowered its fee than that of Ethereum are being issued YAP stone did not simply overcome the limitations of Ethereum like the other alternative coins Instead of just targeting speed and cost it will be optimized to be used freely in the actual region and related Smart Contracts and DApps will be provided YAP Stone will obtain widely and easily used user case based on local areas As a result YAP Stone will obtain actual community user s database and actualize Share Economy leverlage by making token economy within the region In addition the fundamental philosophy of YAP Chain is to return the profits generated from leverage to the community In order to achieve the above goals YAP Stone will redefine the Blockchain wording and vocabulary to easier and more understable words and develop the UX to be more user friendly and convenient Additionally YAP Stone will maximize the leverage by optimizing compatibility and connectivity soasto easily connect with other blackchain based communities or to merge them As mentioned above YAP Chain will apply its broad experience and sophisticated knowledge to various industry sectors to develop a new Smart City that is incomparable to the previous one In order to maintain the success of the YAP Chain platform it is essential for the YAP Stone to continue increase in value in a sustainable manner Smart City based on YAP Chain must consistently expand and be developed Success of the YAP Chain project will increase the population of those using YAP Stone in the Smart Cities and since users have to obtain YAP stone the increasing YAP Stone demand will proportionally increase the population using YAP Stone within the Smart Cities Increase in YAP Stone value will generate higher profit to everyone using the coin YAP Stone is completely integrated to YAP Chain and YAP Token which is to be used in diverse industries can be exchanged with YAP Stone only 33 \x0cDue to such usage right users must obtain YAP Stone in the Smart City constructed on YAP Chain resulting in active circulation of YAP Stone within Smart City YAP Stone will adapt to the market changes by flexibly applying exchange rate within the Smart City YAP Chain s main objective is to enlist YAP Stone in all cryptocurrency exchanges which will allow coin owners to use and exchange YAP Stone anywhere and anytime without any restrictions By retaining the status of its exchange and usage value YAP Stone will become a key currency in Smart Cities 34 \x0c5 Ethereum based YAP Chain Technology Implementation YAP Chain is a side chain developed to improve the limitations of Ethereum In status quo there are numerous 3rd generation blockchain technologies for transaction processing system (TPS) speed improvement and scalability reduction of transaction commission fee multi thread parallel processing etc Therefore YAP Chain will be adopting validated and improved technologies to continue developing optimized Smart platform system YAP Chain is further planning to develop its own core blockchain system The coming section will look into YAP Chain s core base Ethereum blockchain 1) Why Ethereum By adding smart contract function to blockchain concept Ethereum enables development of diverse DApp programs and provides new cryptocurrency ICO platform functioning as one of major global currency YAP Stone is a Smart City platform based on Ethereum and supports smart contract s developing language \xe2\x80\x93 Solidity and supports platform for Smart City DApp development Ethereum has released several versions of Frontier Homestead Metropolis and is on the verge of launching Serenity Casper function has been released for transferring from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) and is ready to apply to mainnet Sharding function plasma and plasma cash functions will be applied later on resulting in the capacity to apply TPS and DApp in real life Globally 83% of the companies that are planning to list in the ICO uses Etherium s ERC20 In order to strengthen the compatibility with these companies connectivity with Etherium s Solifity is very important There remains effort to overcome the limitations of current blockchain and various technology development are in progress YAP Stone is also participating in this arena to develop technologies and contribute to the innovation of blockchain As a consequence YAP Stone is also planning to advance along with Ethereum s function improvement and YAP Stone developers are also investing efforts to develop internally built functions 35 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa0 Ethereum Concept Vitalik Buterin fell deeply into blockchain in end of 2013 and drafted a white paper that integrated a new blockchain concept He sent this document to several of his friends discussed about the concept with 30 engineers and in January 2014 with key team members including Gavin Wood announced Ethereum According to definition Ethereum aims to be a DApp platform to be not only a distributed internet but also a distributed app store From this view of cryptocurrency it may seem similar to that of Bitcoin but in reality it has a totally different objective Bitcoin has secured as a successful and stable cryptocurrency whereas Ether of Ethereum is a multi purpose platform as a component of smart contract application program The most critical difference between the two project is that Ethereum s internal code is Turing Complete In other words if Ethereum is given computing power and time it is possible to develop any kind of application program This characteristic makes diverse development of DApp application program possible on top of Ethereum platform \xe2\x91\xa1 Ethereum Functioning Principle As mentioned above Ethereum and Bitcoin are both blockchain based cryptocurrencies but Ethereum functions beyond blockchain Every node in Ethereum network must share its transaction information user s balance smart contract code and its status storage location and latest information All of Ethereum s states comprise of several million transactions These transactions are grouped into blocks and previous blocks are connected to the recent ones Before ledger is added to the transaction it must go through validation check before reaching mining \xe2\x91\xa2 Ethereum Usability Developers can produce application programs on top of Ethereum platform and distribute them and all centralized services can be decentralized by using Ethereum platform DApp developed on top of Ethereum platform can completely change the relationship between the company and its potential customers because blockchain technology and DApp can be applied to not only 36 \x0cindustries that practice conventional way of contract but also to diverse industry sectors such as web services insurance distribution trading etc Ethereum can be used for building digital decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) which can be operated transparently without a leader or central organization DAO will be owned by token purchasers but the quantity purchased does not represent shares or ownership However it gives voting rights to those who have purchased token \xe2\x91\xa3 Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s Strengths Ethereum platform utilizes all forms of blockchain technology characteristics and it is not intervened by a 3rd party In other words all blockchain networks are based on consensual principles in which they are not controlled by DApps and DAOs Since all nodes in the system must agree to all changes thereby eliminating possibilities of fraud and corruption and preventing network forgery decentralized crypto security protects Ethereum network from hacking and fraudulent actions \xe2\x91\xa4 Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s Weaknesses Although smart contract s objective is to prevent network failures errors can occur from a coder s mistake and it can lead to misuse In April 30th 2016 The DAO was attacked and over 36 million Ethers were stolen The hackers took advantage of bugs from smart contract to steal Ethers This caused a severe damage to Ethereum s credibility and a new version of Ethereum was released with addition of hard fork Due to an internal conflict the organization was divided into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic which are both in existence Furthermore Ethereum can handle roughly 20 or more transactions per second (TPS) much too slow for real life usage The speed of VISA Card is 45 000 TPS and EOS a recently popular cryptocurrency claims to have a speed of 1 000 to 8 000 TPS To overcome such problem since Ethereum developers have been putting much effort to produce a better version which technology will be recognized by the market remains to be seen However due to the ecosystem developed through several years of verified system Ethereum is considered as a more stable platform than EOS 37 \x0cIn addition Ethereum transaction including Ether remittance is operated on top of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and gas fee must be paid In the case of ICO or when there are lots of transactions at once the gas fee rises to a considerable extent On the contrary EOS uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm and does not require commission fee This part needs to be explored further to come up with a better solution \xe2\x91\xa5 DApp Developed based on Ethereum Ethereum is a platform that can develop distributed applications without technical knowledge on blockchain Ethereum platform can come as a shock to conventional centralized businesses such as insurance finance and real estate because the platform can unbundle the existing structure \xc2\x83 Gnosis Market predicting platform where users can vote for weather and election results \xc2\x83 Weifund Crowd funding platform for Smart Contract \xc2\x83 Uport Platform where users collect authentication material log in without Password and digital sign a contract to create one

first virtual nation including blockchain governing body insurance fror embassy and refugees education ID diplomatic program etc 38 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa6 EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) EVM is a runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum Smart contract is coded through language Solidity and is produced by Application Binary Interface (ABI) code via Solidity compiler to be executed on top of EVM In order to use EVM gas fee needs to be paid and this is tied to Ether price Transaction fee is calculated as Gas Limit x Gas Price To run the program one must own certain amount of Ether 39 \x0c2) YAP Chain Ethereum Based Smart City Blockchain Development Platform YAP Chain is an Ethereum based independent Blockchain ecosystem Unlike existing Ethereum YAP Stone of YAP Chain is fixed to total issuance of 1 billion coins and is 100% pre mined coins In this platform block is created every 12 seconds mining method of Proof of Work (PoW) is used and hash algorithm used is Ethash Since all of the coins are pre mined no compensation of YAP Stone is given even if it is mined Although YAP Chain supports ERC20/223 a standard for Ethereum token YAP Chain will build an independent public blockchain Diverse Smart City application programs will be developed on top of YAP Chain and payment platform for everyday life will be developed as well In addition YAP Chain will develop independent platform for development of Smart City DApp and support its application \xe2\x91\xa0 YAP Stone Consensus Algorithm and Developer Environment Consensus Algorithm After ICO YAP Stone s basic Consensus Algorithm will be implemented as PoS (Proof of Stake) based on development schedule This method is named as Casper by Ehterium Foundation and Developer Community and running PoC (Proof of Concept) and recent test results show that the performance has improved to 13 410 tx/sec from existing 7 tx/sec by applying Shasper (Sharding + Casper) When it is applied to layer 2 chain the performance will improve several hundred/thousand times YAP Chain s YAP Stone will be upgraded to Shasper version from existing PoW and will be upgraded to Exclusive Consensus Algorithm of POTG (Proof of Trustworthy Group) that will be optimized for the Smart City POTG Node is currently operated by over 20 public entities (C20 City of 20) that has certain level of community population POTG Consensus Algorithm redeems weaknesses of EOS and DPOS that fails to obtain credibility for Representative Nodes Consensus Algorithm of C20 will be validated and monitored separately by Open Type Node Read Request procedures will be processed via Open Type Node and structured and designed to maximize the efficiency level of C20 POTG file system applies IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) decentralized file system and C20 will be composed via separate procedures Before obtaining sharding technology for large scale users Side Chain and Node that interacts with relevant region and DApp will be utilized to immediately service with adequate level of speed improvement 40 \x0cDeveloper Environment Planning to provide all tehcnologies and services via Broadband Network \xe2\x91\xa1 Necessary Technology Raiden Network The most serious problem faced by Ethereum and other blockchain cryptocurrencies is Transaction speed (TPS) To solve this YAP Chain will graft Raiden Network Once YAP Chain applies Raiden Network it will enable faster transaction authentication reduced commission fee and micro payment which will allow IoT s Machine to Machine (IM2M) trade 41 \x0cAssuming that A and B are making transaction via Raiden Network a separate channel connecting A & B will open As the transaction is stored in blockchain it produces gas However A & B can trade unlimitedly and no gas is needed as the transaction is executed in an off chain environment where transaction is not recorded in blockchain If A & B closes the channel and make an actual transfer above transaction will be recorded in the blockchain and gas fee will occur Above example is only between A & B but if B & C channel and C & A Channel also gets interlinked the frequency of closing the channel can be minimized and it will have a larger ripple effect Raiden Network is a similar project to Lightning Network which is used by Bitcoin and Litecoin It minimizes recording on blockchain by opening and closing the transaction channel via offchain reducing the commission fee \xc2\x83 No need to wait for block transaction so authentication process is faster \xc2\x83 Commission fee only paid when opening or closing the channel Intermediary transaction requires no commission fee Plasma YAP CHAIN Software Team is actively investigating the possibility of adopting Plasma technology While Raiden is an off chain technology that utilizes the opening and closing of a channel Plasma is a Childchain technology that minimizes blockchain bloating DApp is currently recording all of its data in YAP blockchain (Main chain) This causes problems not only to processing speed but also block size and increase in gas consumption due to data volume Plasma generates an independent chain and synchronizes it with YAP Chain\xe2\x80\x99s main blockchain with minimum data volume and the following outcomes are expected \xc2\x83 Reduces YAP Chain s Block size \xc2\x83 Drives DApp with faster speed \xc2\x83 Minimizes gas consumption 42 \x0cEffectiveness of Plasma s lower chain can be validated through Main blockchain of YAP Chain After combining Raiden and Plasma YAP Chain will transfer into PoS (Proof of Stake) Casper 43 \x0cSharding YAP Chain is also considering to adopt Sharding Technology When the size of the database becomes too large database is partitioned for efficient management Sharding uses a conventional scaling method called Database Sharding This technology effectively divides database into pieces and stores each of them in different servers Ethereum is also using Sharding technology to productively carry out transactions and to increase the number of TPS as well Sharding divides the data managed by YAP Chain Node to speed up the work Through Sharding Technology it optimizes the number of TPS and is a necessary component along with Raiden and Plasma technology \xc2\x83 Efficient management of DApp data through Plasma \xc2\x83 Reduction of gas fee and increase in transaction speed via Raiden Network \xc2\x83 Optimization of TPS via Sharding \xc2\x83 Use of DApp at a realistic speed for low commission rate 44 \x0c\xe2\x91\xa2 YAP Chain Feature Yap node (Full node)
