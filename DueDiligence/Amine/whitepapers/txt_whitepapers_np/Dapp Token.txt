\x0cIntroduction The Market for Decentralized Apps A decentralized application (decentralized app or distributed application) also known as a dapp is an application that runs on a computer P2P network (rather than a single computer or server) A dapp s code is open source or the core part of the data interaction is done by open source smart contracts deployed on the blockchain It usually comes with incentives powered by tokens and is not controlled by a single entity Thanks to the nature of the blockchain a decentralized application\xe2\x80\x99s data is open transparent and cannot be tampered with Around the end of 2017 decentralized applications had begun to be adopted by the market with the emergence of \xe2\x80\x8bnon fungible tokens\xe2\x80\x8b These tokens make the creation and trading of scarce and unique digital assets possible as demonstrated by \xe2\x80\x8bCryptoKitties\xe2\x80\x8b As developers explored the possibilities offered by smart contracts and decentralized applications more than 2 000 decentralized applications were developed on Ethereum EOS TRON and Steem by the first quarter of 2019 In 2018 1 423 dapps resulted in a total transaction volume of over $6 5 billion \xe2\x80\x8b w \xe2\x80\x8b ith each dapp generating an average transaction volume of over $4 5 million Comparatively in the first year of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s App Store 65 000 mobile apps were created These generated around $4 2 billion revenue in total averaging only $65 000 per app Decentralized applications are still in the early stages of development but they have initially proven their value and have created a large and fast growing new economy Since 2018 many large teams and publicly listed companies have started to invest in researching and developing decentralized applications especially in the fields of gaming and social networking Mass creation and adoption of decentralized applications is coming Decentralized Apps Use Cases The revolutionary dapps described below show the practical potential of decentralized technology beyond cryptocurrencies Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) IDEX\xe2\x80\x8b is a real time high throughput semi decentralized exchange based on Ethereum smart contracts IDEX consists of smart contracts trading engines and trading arbitrators The trading engine and trading arbitrators ensure that transactions can be matched quickly The user\xe2\x80\x99s private key 3 \x0cmust be used to authorize all transactions Smart contracts guarantee the security of both the user s property and the transaction process itself Crypto Collectibles / Gaming Assets CryptoKitties\xe2\x80\x8b are digital collectible cats built on the Ethereum blockchain They can be bought and sold using Ether and bred to create new cats Each CryptoKitty owns its own unique immutable genes and visual appearance CryptoKitties is a practical use case for digital scarcity and digital collectibles It pioneered the use of ERC 721 a protocol which is the standard for transactions and ownership of non fungible assets on the blockchain In this case the transparency and proof of data ownership on the blockchain ensured each kitty\xe2\x80\x99s ownership and scarcity Decentralized Social Media Steemit\xe2\x80\x8b is an incentivized blockchain based social media platform It combines traditional social media with a community that rewards contributors of valuable content with cryptocurrencies There is no overall authority on Steemit everyone has ownership of their published content and the value is determined by the entire social network Currently Steemit users reject the centralized content filtering policies of platforms like Facebook and Twitter Decentralized social media enables freedom of speech in the truest sense Decentralized Betting / Lottery Etheroll\xe2\x80\x8b is a smart contract based gambling platform which is proven to be fair The randomness of each roll can be verified and secured by encryption Dapp com\xe2\x80\x99s Mission and Vision Blockchain adoption is accelerating at pace and public awareness is increasing Factor in the misuse of big data and personal data breaches and we have a world that is ready for technology that puts users in control At the same time government agencies and enterprises in many countries and regions have begun investing a lot of resources in bringing traditional industries onto the blockchain The possibilities that dapps offer to change the world we live in are endless and exciting Within the context of this massive shift \xe2\x80\x8bDapp com\xe2\x80\x8b aims to be the go to destination for dapps We provide tools and trusted information for developers and users who want to explore the potential of blockchain and decentralized technology We are building an ecosystem formed by various product lines which removes the obstacles to dapp adoption Dapp com empower users to discover use and analyze decentralized apps in the easiest way possible 4 \x0cProblems 1 Difficult to Access According to open market data at least 50 public blockchains currently focus on different usage scenarios and feature different scalability performan\xe2\x80\x8bce w\xe2\x80\x8bhich are rapidly incubating dapps and expanding their ecosystem This has resulted in more than 50 display and distribution channels for dapps in the market which causes a terrible user experience and wastes resources In addition due to each blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s fragmented ecosystem different user groups do not understand and do not have the source to obtain information for other blockchains The promotion of decentralized apps has also been highly affected by different policies and restrictions applied to blockchains by various mainstream channels Users can only obtain incomplete information through scattered channels 2 Poor User Experience According to our \xe2\x80\x8bQ1 2019 Dapp Market Report\xe2\x80\x8b less than 2% of the Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s 1 15 million users had used dapps The key reason is that dapps have offered a very poor user experience to date users need to install wallet tools import wallets register their wallets (including remembering information including mnemonics private keys etc ) and obtain native tokens for that specific blockchain (e g ETH gas fees are needed to use Ethereum based dapps) Such a complex process requires different tools and skill sets for each blockchain which means that users who use multiple dapps from different blockchains will need to go through the learning process again and again This has been a serious barrier to the mass adoption of decentralized applications 3 A Fragmented and Non Homogenous Market Because developing and releasing decentralized applications does not require any authorization there have been a large number of scam and poor quality applications in the market causing many users to suffer losses Fortunately every decentralized app\xe2\x80\x99s actions and transactions are recorded on the chain which allows us to check the real user situation through the on chain data store However this does require a lot of work collecting processing and visualization the data And the data that may involve fraud and suspect trading has to be filtered To achieve a mature market we need to help users to discover high quality applications through trusted objective data and valuable user generated content Introducing Dapp com Dapp com is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest dapp distribution platform Dapp com lists over 2 200 dapps that are built on seven major blockchains \xe2\x80\x8b Ethereum EOS TRON Steem TomoChain IOST and Blockstack 5 \x0cOur platform showcases dapps based on trusted dapp data analytics community reviews and user comments We are the first global platform to launch IOST TomoChain and Blockstack dapps exclusively We work closely with over 50 of the best decentralized apps in the world including CryptoKitties Gods Unchained Bancor Kyber Network OpenSea and more as well as publicly listed companies such as Animoca Brands Dapp com also has the largest decentralized app community in the world We have 150 000+ monthly unique visits from all over the world over 100 000 registered users and over 100 000 followers across our social media channels Our community and users have generated over 5 000 unique reviews and valuable comments for dapps The quarterly Dapp Market Reports released by Dapp com have been read by over 350 000 readers and covered and reported on by top tech and financial media such as TechCrunch Yahoo TNW Cointelegraph and more \xe2\x80\x8bAs the top search result for \xe2\x80\x98dapp\xe2\x80\x99 and related keywords on Google Dapp com is the obvious starting point for users and tech companies to explore experience and analyze decentralized apps Project Masterplan Dapp com is building a data driven blockchain application ecosystem that allows users to discover and use all decentralized apps without barriers With a decentralized Multi chain Identity Network (MIN) and our Dapp Store users don\xe2\x80\x99t have to install any wallets or own digital assets in order to use dapps By collecting data on user behavior and transaction activities on the blockchain and applying custom algorithms we will provide users with trusted insights into the dapp market Dapp com\xe2\x80\x99s vision will be realized by developing the following core products and tools Dapp Store Wallet The Dapp com Store Wallet is a tool that leads users to the decentralized world by removing barriers it allows users to use any dapps without having to install any tools Wallet accounts from different blockchains are set up and managed by the master Dapp com account for every user Users will only need to transfer tokens to the Dapp Store Wallet to start using all dapps immediately The Dapp Store Wallet will also support on chain token swap and cross chain token exchange in the near future Our desktop and mobile products will allow users to use dapps anywhere anytime The Dapp Store Wallet is also very developer friendly Only one line of code needs to be replaced for a dapp to support the Dapp Store Wallet and it is compatible with every existing wallet on the market 6 \x0cMulti Blockchain Identity Network (MIN) Dapp com is committed to being the gateway to the decentralized world The Multi chain Identity Network will play a key role in removing the barriers to using dapps for everyone by creating and managing wallets from multiple blockchains with just one click We are able to map a single set mnemonic phrase to different private keys from different wallets by integrating the functions of private key generation wallet creation and faucets into one button utilizing BIP39 protocol Users will be able to manage multiple customized wallet accounts without any cost using one single account This will create free and instant access to decentralized apps for our users Market Intelligence Every day our data center processes huge amounts of data from seven blockchains simultaneously and in real time and showcase the results to our users Dapp com will provide a full analysis of the whole market for everyone to visualize the crypto world in multiple dimensions Dapp Analytics Our Dapp Analytics Tool will empower developers to understand and measure the performance of their decentralized apps by providing unique data insights including customer behavior and trends that can\xe2\x80\x99t be found anywhere else Developers can leverage this dapp data from across the whole blockchain space to understand user acquisition activation and retention These functions will be associated with their Dapp com developer account without any technical integration Cross Chain Dapp SDK Currently if developers want to build dapps on different blockchains they have to learn and use different toolkits for each Usually from the planning stage developers will have to choose one blockchain which puts huge limitations on the scalability of the app in the future We will change this giving developers the easy ability to extend their deployed dapps to multiple blockchains or migrate them to certain Dapp com supported blockchains based on their business needs The Cross Chain Dapp SDK is a multi blockchain development toolkit that enables cross blockchain dapp development We offer tools to enable dapp accessibility on all kinds of browsers For already built dapps developers can integrate the SDK without changing any of their original business 7 \x0clogic code The wallet account system uses the AES symmetric encryption algorithm to ensure the privacy and security of account information The payment management function will allow developers to customize token contracts for payment and provide specific APIs that make it easy for developers to use any tokens in their dapps At the same time we will evaluate the opportunity for cross chain asset deployment and exchanges according to market needs and consider whether Dapp com will fulfill this demand by utilizing the Cosmos SDK Business Model Being one of the first movers to enter the market Dapp com\xe2\x80\x99s primary revenue and profit mainly come from the marketing and distribution of dapps We are at an early stage of this business and still exploring various business models such as data services and a project launchpad which are strong opportunities as our platform and the industry grow Dapp com\xe2\x80\x99s revenue streams are as follows Revenue Descriptions Dapp Promotion Advertising and marketing services for dapps Dapp Distribution Distribution fees / referral fees for every new user that is referred to a dapp from Dapp com Our fees are linked to these users\xe2\x80\x99 lifetime spend in this product and vary according to project type LaunchPad Dapp com will provide a LaunchPad services for the release of new projects We will raise funds for high quality dapp projects and charge a certain fee based on the sale Data Services Revenue from providing customized data and consultancy services to other businesses including VCs projects academic institutes etc Other Revenue Revenue generated from Dapp com\xe2\x80\x99s resources 8 \x0cToken Generation
