 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 Unmanned cargo robots in the air on the ground and at the sea can dramatically reduce cost of logistics 
 worldwide and increase efficiency for industrial users and end customers 
 
 While PwC have estimated addressable market size for airborne drones alone to be $127 bn 1 the 
 current industry limitations including lack of stable credit costly insurance and near prohibitive 
 regulations in some countries do not allow it to realize its full potential Currently this industry exists in 
 form of feasibility studies carried out by large corporations or startups 
 
 1 https //www pwc pl/en/publikacje/2016/clarity from above html 
 
 Universal operating platform for the cargo robots does not exist 
 
 SKYFchain Operating Platform (hereinafter SKYFchain OP) is the first B2R (business to robots) 
 blockchain based operating platform applicable globally in all sectors of a developing cargo robotics 
 industry It will be initially developed and tested by using the first industrial cargo airborne robot SKYF 
 drone which will also give SKYFchain instant access to its client base for development of unmanned 
 business processes Later all other unmanned cargo systems in the air on the ground and at the sea 
 will be connected to SKYFchain 
 
 The first feedback from our customers in oil and gas industry confirms that if they switch from helicopters 
 to cargo drones they can supply their on shore rigs with 5 to 10 times less cost 
 
 SKYFchain as a blockchain with built in smart contracts will provide trusted source of data and 
 reasonable control over unmanned assets for clients logistics operators insurance and leasing 
 companies banks and authorities worldwide 
 
 It will unveil new profitable business opportunities for all industry participants transportation system 
 with lower risk for the society and increased overall affordability of goods and services due to 
 substantial cost cutting in the global supply chain 
 
 430 424 614 392 SKYFT tokens have been generated to facilitate all internal transactions in 
 SKYFchain 
 
 We expect that value of SKYFT may increase over time because of two main drivers 
 
 1 More and more companies clients financial institutions will be connected to SKYFchain which 
 will drive the growth of transactions in SKYFchain and demand on SKYFT 
 2 For every SKYFchain transaction whether its getting loan to buy unmanned vehicle client 
 payment or something else SKYFchain will charge some commission leading to purchasing 
 SKYFT on crypto exchanges 
 
 
 
 We understand that your backing of SKYFchain may be associated with risk and we have taken several 
 measures to mitigate those risks 
 
 SKYFchain legal entity Skyfdrones Services OU is registered in Estonia which has one of 
 most favorable regulations in the world for blockchain related companies 
 
 Hundreds of SKYF drones will use SKYFchain as an operating platform SKYFchain developers 
 will have direct access to all SKYF drone clients to test and polish SKYFchain system before 
 inviting other producers of drones to use the system 
 SKYFchain is a spin off of SKYF drone development project which in addition to granting 
 SKYFchain access to clients shall use 20% of revenues from sales of SKYF drones to purchase 
 the SKYFT tokens from the market We estimate that this may amount to $50M during the next 
 3 5 years And the SKYF drone is designed with full range of IP protection measures including 
 patens and know how This shall protect SKYFchain uniqueness for the time of its initial 
 development 
 SKYFchain has very experienced and trusted team of engineers and business leaders with 
 proven results they have attracted $5M of VC money into the SKYF drone project 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1 SKYFchain OP business model 
 
 Logistics business processes today are designed with a human being in mind either as a customer or 
 a controller etc Autopilots for cargo robots AI and the developing field of IOT hints that one day robots 
 may work without being directly controlled by an individual 
 
 This would bring enormous savings since currently around 50% of costs in logistics is in labor 
 
 The field in cargo robotics will require investments and investments need insurance risk management 
 and control Thus unmanned cargo robots may become an asset which would require new types of 
 regulations and business processes We are planning to develop them in the SKYFchain Operating 
 Platform 
 
 
 
 Source SKYFchain OP 
 
 
 
 The main purpose of the SKYFchain OP is to integrate information for all market participants and 
 organize the execution of smart contracts for transactions Transactions may vary in value and 
 frequency The platform will collect commissions from each transaction All transactions will be paid in 
 USD or other fiat currency but executed in system using the SKYFT tokens 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 image2 png 
 
 
 SKYFT token will be the internal currency of the platform Only 430 424 614 392 tokens have been 
 issued in form of Ethereum ERC20 tokens This is fixed amount for all system 
 
 We are going to test the platform using SKYF drones then we shall educate drone producers and 
 integrate other drones into the system When sea borne and ground borne cargo robots come into the 
 market we shall integrate them as well by organizing workshops with respective associations of 
 producers 
 
 As the number of cargo robots connected to system grows so does the number of transactions More 
 tokens will be needed to execute the smart contracts and the SKYFT exchange rate may increase We 
 expect that the clients would usually pay us in fiat and crypto currencies and purchase our tokens from 
 the crypto exchanges in case of need This would create liquidity needed for the platform operations

 SKYFchain OP will be created using three unique resources 
 
 1 The exclusivity of servicing operations of SKYF drone the worlds first heavy and industrial grade 
 cargo drone It is a fundamentally new drone vehicle with a hybrid gasoline fueled engine that 
 outperforms existing drone solutions It is capable of vertical take off and landing and has an ultra high 
 useful load of up to 400 kg/880lb and an exceptional flying range of up to 350km/220 miles The SKYF 
 drone suits multiple market segments including logistics agriculture and firefighting to name a few It 
 already has clients which would allow SKYFchain to develop new business processes of unmanned 
 logistics Those clients will also bring in transactions to execute on SKYFchain SKYF drone IP and 
 know how fully protected 
 
 
 
 From the start of SKYFchain 
 
 the SKYF drone autopilot will require authorization in the SKYFchain to lift off 
 
 
 
 2 20% of the revenue from sales of the first 1000 SKYF drones will be reserved by a license 
 agreement with the SKYF drone producers to purchase back SKYFT tokens from the market 
 We expect this to take place during the first three to five years after launch of SKYFchain (this revenue 
 is equivalent to $50 60mln) Tokens bought under this condition will be put into a Community 
 Development Fund and used to reward partners and developers of the SKYFchain 
 
 3 Mission planning verification and operations support of SKYF drones (and later other drones) will be 
 run through SKYFchain a unique private blockchain 
 
 SKYFchain super node holders will receive 50% of transaction fees 
 SKYF drones will be marketed together with a franchise of a drone logistics operator and a 
 license for the third party drone producers of drones and spare parts By 2021 more than 1100 
 SKYF drones projected to be operating worldwide and other drone manufacturers and owners 
 will also be able to join the SKYFchain Operating Platform therefore increasing the number of 
 transactions in the system 
 
 
 
 
 The upside for a token buyer is our plan to open the SKYFchain OP after the testing period for all 
 other developers and manufacturers of air borne sea borne and ground borne cargo robots The SKYF 
 drone will become just one of the many participants of the platform 
 
 
 
 
 
 Well open the SKYFchain to other drone manufacturers after the testing period 
 
 
 
 
 
 SKYFchain OP will invite experts from the logistics industry from all over the world to become part of 
 the development community The Community Development Fund (CDF) will hold 10% of tokens issued 
 to reward them 
 
 
 SKYFchain OP project team includes leading aviation industry experts blockchain specialists and 
 international business professionals 
 
 The SKYF drone initial testing market will be the developing countries agricultural and logistics sectors 
 a multi billion dollar market on its own From year 2021 onwards itll start expansion to the US and 
 European markets 
 
 Test flights of the SKYF drone are already under way and have been successful Please take a look at 
 a flight test video on our website http //skyfchain io/ 
 
 
 
 
 Several big clients have signed up for test flights or pilot implementations of SKYF drones in their 
 business operations Our most prominent partners are 
 
 Syngenta AG (annual revenue $12 8bn) a global Swiss agribusiness that produces 
 agrochemicals and seeds 
 Avgust Crop Protection (annual revenue $263 3mln) the largest crop protection chemicals 
 producer and service provider in CIS 
 Pony Express (annual revenue $86 7mln) the number one multi modal logistics operator and 
 delivery company in the CIS territories 
 
 
 The second step in developing sales of SKYF drone will be to create a franchise model in AsiaPac in 
 associate with a local partner Hence we are not looking at the US market as a priority because of its 
 intense regulations Nonetheless we have noted that the demand in other markets is huge for the next 
 5 10 years 
 
 
 
 Increasing sales of SKYF drones will benefit the SKYFchain 
 
 The demand for SKYFT tokens is expected to multiply with each new connected drone an autonomous 
 truck or ship Increasing global reach of SKYFchain will lead to an exponential increase in the number 
 of cargo robots and other stakeholders in the system

 Benefits of the unmanned trucks 
 
 
 
 Proponents of automated trucks are talking about several useful features They say that such trucks 
 will be more efficient because they would not waste fuel by accelerating and braking as frequently as 
 trucks driven manually by a human driver Similarly developers have plans to use truck platooning to 
 save on fuel Other benefits may include increased safety and less stress for drivers during long haul 
 monotonous drives

 Autonomous shipping is being proactively explored by the maritime industry Discussions within the 
 industry have identified both direct cost reducing benefits and other indirect benefits Direct benefits are 
 often listed at the vessel level 
 
 Better use of space in ship design 
 Better use of the crew and their skills 
 Better use of fuel 
 
 
 Indirect benefits occur at company and network levels along the shipping sector Remote and 
 autonomous shipping allows for improved optimization of operations and processes For example 
 optimizing processes or operations based on real time data enables economies of scale at fleet and 
 company levels as well as reduces the likelihood of human errors contributing to both safety and 
 service quality In the shipping sector autonomous shipping will recast the roles and reorganize the 
 division of work 
 
 
 
 The operation of remote and autonomous ships will need to be at least as safe as existing vessels if 
 they are to secure regulatory approval the support of ship owners operators sea farers and wider 
 public acceptance

 The region in which an autonomous vessel should operate and whether it should be remote controlled 
 or autonomous will have a significant impact on the rules applied to it We plan to operate along the 
 same logic at SKYFchain during mission planning approval and verification

 Embedding smart ship equipment into an existing vessel is the first step on the Rolls Royce roadmap 
 to a fully autonomous and intelligent ship The company envisages a remotely operated local vessel 
 being in operation by 2020 By 2025 the company hopes to have a remotely operated autonomous 
 vessel on international waters 
 
 
 
 Five years later the company hopes that autonomous ocean going vessels will be a common sight on 
 the ocean As time goes on such ships will be made even more intelligent and capable of autonomous 
 operations

 4 Problems in the drone market and unmanned logistics 
 
 4 1 Lack of transparency 
 
 Universal operating systems for the drone market still do not exist There is no system where customers 
 can check the technical condition of drones and their safety itineraries This is one of the reasons why 
 public authorities limit drone flight range 
 
 
 
 This problem is not only present in the aviation industry All the cargo robotics markets do not have 
 reliable certified operational platforms 
 
 
 
 The organizational problems of the unmanned drone industry include costly insurance and near 
 prohibitive regulations in some countries 
 
 
 
 The insurance problem stems from the fact that there are many stakeholders in the process of the drone 
 operations the drone manufacturer the drone operator company the drone pilot the drone service 
 company the customer etc Additionally it is not always clear who is liable in different cases of a 
 disaster If we can store all the relevant data on a block chain and provide it to an insurance company 
 they can then assess the risks quicker based on facts Hence the insurance policy cost could decrease 
 and the insurance payment would be provided quicker because the liable party will be known

 Flights by drones called drone operations are governed by manned and unmanned aviation laws that 
 determine the ground rules for operating drones in airspace Most countries regulations distinguish 
 between recreational and commercial flights however a fully developed regulatory framework takes 
 into account the drones weight flight area time of day and altitude Mostly the areas where flying 
 drones is prohibited are very similar worldwide Permission is always required to fly near and over 
 airports military infrastructure key public infrastructure (e g government offices) densely populated 
 areas or other restricted areas Some countries require drone registration prior to use 
 
 
 
 Generally recreational flights performed by the smallest drones do not need permission from aviation 
 authorities or a license However in the US for example recreational drones weighing more than 250 
 grams but less than 25 kilograms have to be registered before their first flight 
 
 
 
 Commercial flights in most countries have to be performed by certified pilots There are more specific 
 restrictions regarding their use especially in populated areas In majority countries drone operators 
 have to obtain licenses as well as special permission to perform commercial flights They may also be 
 
 
 required to appoint a pilot a commander responsible for flight safety and an observer especially during 
 BVLOS (Beyond visual line of sight) flights 
 
 
 
 Solution is the SKYFchain OP 
 
 SKYFchain OP is a transparent and trusted operating platform that offers financing and gives insurance 
 companies direct control over their assets which has sparked the growth of this industry 
 
 4 2 Technical problems of air borne unmanned logistics short flight range of 
 existing drones 
 
 Have you ever wondered why there are dozens of toy drones in the market yet the airports still have 
 large manned helicopters Unfortunately the multi copters size scalability problem does not have a 
 solution yet at the moment The higher the take off mass the larger the propeller has to be which in 
 turn increases the momentum This is how the aircraft rapidly reaches the controlable threshold 
 
 
 
 Good rotor dynamics require an electric engine However the increase in scale of the drone comes 
 with a second problem accumulator batteries become ineffective The internal combustion engine can 
 solve this issue However its implementation in drones remains problematic because of its high weight 
 On the other hand the hybrid engines cost is usually too high 
 
 
 
 Solution SKYF drone with a gasoline engine 
 
 The SKYF drone new aerodynamic design solves the problem of multi copter scalability The SKYF 
 drone is the world s first unmanned air cargo platform (unmanned aerial carrier the drone) with vertical 
 take off and landing (VTOL) based on patented aerodynamics which allow for the development of 
 unmanned aerial vehicles with different modifications that can carry out a wide variety of challenging 
 tasks 
 
 
 
 The SKYF drone is easy to operate and less expensive when compared to other existing solutions and 
 it allows for scaling in order to increase payload and flight range as well as to configure other 
 characteristics 
 
 
 
 Moreover we provide licensed operational documentation software and key electronic components 
 
 We believe that the emergence of universal high performance VTOL drones can lead to unpredictable 
 expansion in application areas especially in the market segment of 100 150 kg payload

 Model SKYF P2 1 
 
 The SKYF Unmanned Aerial Carrier was designed and built at ARDN Technology Limited (UK) whose 
 R&D HQ is now located in Kazan Russia Areas of the systems applications include crop spraying 
 and long distance delivery of goods The SKYF device is a vertical take off and landing device drone 
 with two 2 8 m main rotors that synchronously rotate towards each other The main rotors which 
 generate lift to ensure the drone is air borne are driven by a gasoline engine The engine transmits 
 torque through the gearbox and the belt drive to the main rotors 
 
 
 
 The vehicles housing has a truss structure assembled from a square aluminum profile through riveting 
 The vehicle s horizontal movement is achieved through tilting using eight controlling electric motors on 
 different modes located on the spark shafts on four outrigger rods The yaw rotation of the SKYF is 
 achieved by turning the control plates under the main rotors in opposite directions An electric generator 
 connected to a gasoline engine and buffer batteries are mounted on a vehicle to ensure the operation 
 of the electrical equipment 
 
 
 
 The movement of the vehicle including take off mission and landing do not require human 
 participation The movement occurs according to a trajectory and altitude predetermined by a flight 
 mission with the use of satellite navigation systems and an on board system to determine the altitude 
 above the ground The auto pilot control system has algorithms that ensure the vehicles safe operation 
 and action in case of malfunction or in various abnormal situations 
 
 
 
 A parachute system is installed on the vehicle for flights above 40 meters (for SKYF transport versions)

 SKYF drone modifications 
 
 SKYF CARGO 
 
 The average payload is 150 kg with a maximum flight range of 350 km This SKYF drone version is the 
 best solution for oil & gas logistics and for delivery in hard to reach areas These services are in great 
 demand in Russia Africa Canada Asia Australia South America CIS countries and the mountainous 
 regions in Europe SKYF drones can deliver goods (food spare parts measuring equipment 
 emergency supply) from the logistics centers to designated residential areas 
 
 SKYF MARINE 
 
 This modification has reinforced construction by adding corrosion protection This SKYF drone can work 
 during emergencies in most regions of the world due to its increased reliability It will be able to deliver 
 food rescue equipment and medicine to natural disaster locations as well as evacuate the injured and 
 distressed at sea Furthermore this vehicle could serve in marine logistics centers and intensive 
 shipping regions to deliver medium sized cargo (spare parts mail etc ) to ships at sea or on the move 
 which will significantly reduce their service time and fuel consumption 
 
 
 5 SKYFchain Operating Platform technical details and economics 
 
 5 1 Blockchain concept for the SKYFchain OP 
 
 SKYFchain architecture is based on two building blocks 
 
 1 SKYFchain blockchain itself private permissioned blockchain customized for the most effective 
 usage in the industry 
 2 Ethereum ERC 20 SKYFT tokens based perimeter of public blockchain for processing and 
 settling SKYFT tokens transactions and communicating them back and forth with SKYFchain 
 
 
 Private (permissioned) blockchain is required to simplify the development and support and give an 
 opportunity to choose solution most appropriate for each particular task Moreover we want to be 
 independent of the performance of public networks (e g scalability issues with Ethereum) and not wait 
 for transactions to be committed in public network At the moment we are considering three different 
 approaches for the SKYFchain creating our own Ethereum fork SKYF specific custom platform built 
 on top of either Exonum libraries or instance of R3 Corda blockchain 
 
 All tokens issued at public Ethereum network at the ICO stage are 
 ERC 20 compatible and can be bought and sold on stock exchange 
 So we keep them in the public Ethereum network At the same time 
 these same tokens are going to be utilized as a cryptonomic fuel for 
 the permissioned SKYFchain so it is essential to synchronize 
 balances between public Ethereum network and the SKYFchain 
 
 SKYFT tokens synchronization 
 
 SKYFT tokens are the currency for all operations in the SKYFchain All contracts are processed in 
 SKYFT tokens Although tokens are issued at public Ethereum network they are also fully used at 
 SKYFchain There are several options for synchronization Using public Ethereum network transactions 
 is the obvious way but it locks SKYFchain performance due to different speed of transactions Moreover 
 additional public Ethereum network operations costs can ruin main advantages Creating additional 
 internal tokens as an alternative approach is going to dramatically increase complexity of the system 
 because it depends on resource consuming synchronization process between internal and external 
 balances 
 
 The problem of storage and token balances reconciliation between 
 SKYFchain and public Ethereum networks is solved by using payment 
 channels and keeping balances in Ethereum public network There 
 are already several implementations of payment channels And with 
 Plasma project evolution sharding parallel transaction execution and 
 most of all the scalability problem are going to be addressed 
 
 
 Payment channels are part of a special middleware over blockchain database They form a payment 
 network and allow two or more parties to make funds transfers from one to another In our case we 
 create payment channel from public Ethereum network to the SKYFchain 
 
 
 
 Source SKYFchain OP 
 
 Payment channels work in the following way First a connection between the SKYFchain and public 
 Ethereum network is established by execution of a special transaction in public Ethereum network This 
 transaction reserves certain amount of SKYFT tokens for this connection payment channel When 
 SKYFT tokens are required for any operation at SKYFchain then they are used from the payment 
 channel funds 
 
 Operations on payment channels are extremely fast since there is no need waiting for a commit of 
 transaction on blockchain A receipt signed by two parties is used for confirmation and payment 
 validation At any time either party can close the payment channel and spread reserved tokens based 
 on received receipts 
 
 So we get an architecture where the SKYFchain is separated from public Ethereum network and all 
 transactions could be processed at their own speed without any additional delays And at the same 
 time there is only one source of truth about balances public Ethereum network 
 
 SKYFchain architecture 
 
 Building private (permissioned) blockchain is required in order to fully 
 support all industry operations at reasonable fee and speed Selection 
 of an appropriate consensus protocol is one of the key points for this 
 The most popular (and proven to be more or less effective) are Proof 
 of Work (POW) like in Ethereum public network Proof of Authority 
 (POA) like in system of authorized nodes in the Ripple network Proof 
 of Stake (POS) like in Decred public network and different variations 
 We will start with Proof of Authority consensus 
 
 In the beginning of our private blockchain there will be an administrator which will set the rules 
 (governance) which may be written in the form of legal contract Such administrator will invite other 
 participants In case of rules violation their node may be suspended and certificates annulled 
 
 
 
 
 It is essential to clearly state private network governance policy So 
 we are planning to offer governance roles in our blockchain to 
 professional industry participants Leasing and Insurance companies 
 Logistics Providers and their clients State Authorities and market 
 analysts manufacturers and service providers Thus in the beginning 
 the network will be centralized but as new participants join the system 
 it will become more and more decentralized 
 
 We plan to extend the blockchain to 300 nodes during first three years of operations While reserving 
 20 30 nodes as to ensure stability of the system Other nodes would belong to ICO investors and to 
 other market participants Thus our platform will be ~90% decentralized till the third year and even 
 more so after the third year 
 
 Although the SKYFchain will be based on the universal platform we are going to use it for a particular 
 industry So blockchain transactions would be optimized for operations of different roles This will 
 simplify admission of new participants and their initial adaptation 
 
 In blockchain database each block holds batches of valid transactions that are encoded into a Merkle 
 tree Each block has a hash to the previous one so no one could alter the chain in any way later Merkle 
 tree is a tree of hashes and it is optimized for size and speed to check if a particular data was included 
 in a set of objects 
 
 SKYFchain is a permissioned blockchain because only members 
 have access to it Transactions log in SKYFchain is public and 
 accessible for all participants It is required for validation of the 
 blockchain On the other hand any participant can decide to hide 
 commercially sensitive data and post only hash of that data in 
 transaction while still maintaining its accuracy and completeness 
 Merkle tree structure allows seamless integration of such transactions 
 into blockchain This is a so called anchoring Later such partner 
 (network participant) could provide data and confirm validity with hash in blockchain Anchoring also 
 allows to optimize the size of stored data 
 
 Anchoring and local decentralized transactions could be used to provide confidentiality when it is 
 required for a certain contract In case of disagreement administrator and legal parties can be brought 
 in to validate contract and operations check governance and make a ruling

 5 4 The economics of the SKYFchain OP 
 
 Users may pay in fiat or crypto currency accepted by the system Thus inside the system the 
 transactions must be paid in SKYFT tokens which may be bought automatically and invisibly for the 
 user to execute transactions 
 
 We expect SKYFchain to have two main types of transactions 
 
 Operational transactions of around 0 1 USD per transaction (e g one data fixation by a drone 
 done several times per day) 
 Fintech transactions This would be of a much bigger value up as a fraction of cost of one 
 drone financed through the system (SKYF price ca 250 000 USD) but more rare

 Annex 4 Details on drone market segments and SKYF drone applications 
 
 Infrastructure segment $45bn 
 
 In report Clarity from above PwC estimates the addressable market of drone powered solutions in 
 infrastructure at $45 2bn Drones are able to provide the data required at each phase of the construction 
 process During the pre construction phase drones can significantly improve the speed and quality of 
 the design process by providing better field data Data collected by drones can also be used to create 
 Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) which ensure better contract valuation During the construction phase 
 drones are perfect for quick surveys of sites and for the precise gathering of data for progress reports 
 In the last phase of the construction process drones can be used to assess environmental impacts of 
 the final work and for reporting purposes 
 
 Drones can be used in infrastructure companies for stock taking and inventory management 
 Performing inventory assessments with drones allows companies to cut costs and accelerate the entire 
 process while providing more detailed information about the assets It also increases workplace safety 
 as rotary wing drones can fly into places that are difficult to reach without risking human lives 
 
 We can expect to see drones not only diagnosing problems in crumbling infrastructure such as cracks 
 on tarmac roads bridges and building facades but also repairing them In the future 3D printing 
 technology will be combined with drone technologies to maintain and repair infrastructure 
 
 Monitoring and repair are not the only drone applications being developed within the infrastructure 
 industry Start ups are testing drone technology in performing hazardous tasks at certain heights such 
 as painting and window cleaning Ultimately they will be able to perform most of the jobs at certain 
 heights replacing humans and reducing the risk of death and injury as well as increasing efficiency

 Agriculture segment $32bn 
 
 Agricultural production has drastically increased in recent years and studies predict that aggregate 
 agricultural consumption will increase by 69% from 2010 to 2050 This increase will be mostly stimulated 
 by population growth from 7 billion to 9 billion by 2050 PwC estimates that the addressable market of 
 drone powered solutions in the agricultural industry at $32 4bn 
 
 
 
 Today drone technology offers a large variety of crop monitoring possibilities at lower costs when 
 compared to traditional satellite imagery Furthermore drones can be integrated in every stage of the 
 crop lifecycle from soil analysis to seed planting to choosing the right moment for harvesting 
 
 
 
 Drones are able to produce precise 3D maps for early soil analysis which can be used to plan for seed 
 planting patterns Various start ups have been able to create drone planting systems that not only 
 achieve an uptake rate of 75% but also decrease planting costs by 85% Additionally once the crop is 
 growing they allow for the calculation of the vegetation index which showcases the heat signature and 
 allows for crop planting 
 
 
 
 Once the later stage of a crop life cycle is reached the farmers main objective turns to keeping the 
 plants alive and healthy which requires constant field monitoring Drone monitoring possibilities are 
 constantly being enhanced providing the opportunity to reduce risk in the industry Crop spraying is 
 another area where drone can be applied in the agricultural Drones can scan the ground while 
 maintaining the right distance from the crops and spraying the correct amount of liquid modulating 
 spraying in real time for even coverage 
 
 
 
 SKYF drones can conduct high resolution imagery for crop disease detection and spraying of 
 pesticides and desiccants for soya corn sunflower sugar beet rice etc We also have a high demand 
 to deploy SKYF drones in orchards and vineyards so as to protect against frost and cherry drying 
 
 
 
 SKYF drones can provide aerial application of chemicals pesticides and fertilizers for pest control 
 Moreover our vehicles are suitable for fast planting of seedlings in biodegradable capsules for the 
 restoration of large forest areas after deforestation fires etc Finally SKYF drones equipped with 
 meteorological radars can be used in precipitation management during summer and winter 
 (accumulation of snow in fields decrease of snow in cities) and fire prevention and extinguishing

 Transport segment $13bn 
 
 Drones are certain to become an integral part of the transport industry very soon offering a method of 
 delivery of both services and transport The industry will turn to drones because of speed accessibility 
 and low operating costs which are much better when compared to other forms of transport that require 
 human labour The addressable market for drone powered solutions in the transport industry is $13bn 
 according to PwC estimates 
 
 
 
 Within e commerce time of delivery is paramount when choosing a carrier Drones enable fast delivery 
 to a specific predefined point without much human action required Established corporations garage 
 based start ups and all kinds of companies in between are looking into optimal ways of using drones 
 for transport In the goods delivery sector another concept is gaining popularity delivery of spare parts 
 Maersk which operates a large fleet of tankers currently uses barges to deliver spare parts to its 
 workers As this process is expensive the company has been looking into other options and has also 
 conducted drone delivery tests The positive results revealed that Maersk will be able to save $3k to 
 $9k per ship annually when using drone technology 
 
 
 
 Another application for drones is in medical logistics Delivering medical supplies to remote rural areas 
 is the most likely application of drones in the transport sector because the need is high and the risk is 
 low Another potential medical application of drones is as flying defibrillators A drone can be summoned 
 by a patient with heart attack symptoms the device can fly to the location of the patient travelling at 
 speeds of 100 km/h locate and identify him or her and then perform automatic defibrillation 
 
 
 
 One of the most promising uses of drones in transport may be in food delivery Providing products such 
 as frozen food ready to eat dishes or even daily groceries from large chains may be the next big thing 
 in the food and restaurant industries At first drones will be used to deliver such products to remote 
 difficult to access places that depend on external food supplies such as oil rigs research stations and 
 
 
 isolated islands Once proper regulations have been established drones may perform the same tasks 
 in residential areas decreasing delivery times and increasing the efficiency of the entire transport chain

 Mining $4bn 
 
 The mining industry has untapped potential in drone usage The commercial applications of drones in 
 the mining industry are not so obvious at first glance however they can replace humans in dangerous 
 and monotonous jobs Moreover they are more cost effective and versatile when compared to 
 helicopters they are also faster easier to navigate and cause less pollution when compared to other 
 mining vehicles In open cast mining PwC identifies four main areas of drone applications planning 
 extraction support environmental protection and reporting To assess the addressable market of drone 
 powered solutions in this industry PwC looked at particular cost categories and estimated the value at 
 $4 3bn 
 
 
 
 Open cast mines usually cover several square kilometres on varying surface levels which translates 
 into long routes for land vehicles and crew Drones can be used to quickly map the area optimize 
 hauling routes and provide control information Drone applications during mining exploration range from 
 providing data that enables resource calculation through mapping a mining area to management 
 Drones can be equipped with special features to supply spare parts or take soil samples for deposit 
 analysis Drones are able to detect soil erosion track changes in vegetation and search for defects in 
 mining infrastructure that may endanger the environment more easily and definitely faster than people 
 on foot or manned aircraft can Drones can also be used to monitor the production process in open pit 
 mines and for early detection of deviations and threats By creating a digital model of an open pit mine 
 and the current state of work progress and detecting changes in the structure of the mine (landslides 
 damages to infrastructure) mine owners can increase safety and decrease costs of controlling 
 processes 
 
 
 
 Security segment $10bn 
 
 Areas need to be monitored constantly for security purposes Drones can quickly cover large and 
 difficult to reach areas reducing staff numbers and costs They also do not require much space for their 
 operators As drones are controlled from small pilot stations operators can gather in one place as with 
 traditional video monitoring PwC estimates the addressable market of drone powered solutions in 
 security industry at $10 5bn 
 
 
 
 Drones have a competitive edge over stationary cameras as intruders cannot easily step out of sight 
 and they can cover areas that are normally out of reach Drones have expanded their function beyond 
 
 
 basic monitoring and can also ensure the safety of key sites or infrastructure such as ports and airports 
 In addition to monitoring and rapid reaction drones can provide detailed pictures and documentation of 
 premises enabling effective data analysis identification of risks and security planning 
 
 
 
 In the future we envision that the data gathered by drones will be instantly processed in the cloud 
 providing complete scene recognition and supplementing human supervision Thanks to machine 
 learning software motion sensing and biometrics based behavior analysis as well as facial recognition 
 drones will not only recognize unauthorized entry into a site but also identify precisely who the intruder 
 is
