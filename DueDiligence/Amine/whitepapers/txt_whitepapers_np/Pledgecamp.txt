I\xe2\x80\x99ve participated in crowdfunding across a number of different sites I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some good experiences but I\xe2\x80\x99ve also had a lot of experiences where I\xe2\x80\x99ve been burned with a product that was never fulfilled Especially in this new economy there is a lot of trust that goes into interactions with strangers It will be more and more essential that we develop mechanisms where money is held in escrow or is phased out depending on certain milestones being reached That is why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so excited about smart contracts and some of the developments in crypto and blockchain I think we have finally entered a world where people across the globe from one another can engage in really thoughtful smart entrepreneurial projects together It\xe2\x80\x99s time to make crowdfunding available across the globe to take the intermediaries out who still get paid even if a project doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen and incentivize everyone to be aligned for a vision of entrepreneurship I consider myself a patron of entrepreneurship I wake up every morning and I think \xe2\x80\x9chow can I support more entrepreneurs \xe2\x80\x9d More importantly how can I scale my support of entrepreneurs When I can support a project like Pledgecamp that is going to give millions of entrepreneurs a new opportunity to raise funding in a new way for me that is the vision Being

Sachs Research The Future of Finance (2015) Modern crowdfunding emerged after the 2008 financial crisis when many entrepreneurs found it impossible to raise funds from traditional banks and institutions [2] Online platforms allowed entrepreneurs to raise directly from communities of supporters without needing special connections to professional investors A free market now determined which projects received funding instead of the private dealings of elite venture capitalists Definition Crowdfunding (also known as rewards based crowdfunding) involves the delivery of goods or services in exchange for a contribution of funds Online crowdfunding platforms connect projects with backers in exchange for a percentage typically 5% [3] It is worth noting that rewards based crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or Pledgecamp do not generally permit the crowdfunding of equity or token offerings although this may be included in the future Pledgecamp roadmap Market

1 Global Crowdfunding Transaction Value[4] 25 30 1 \x0cCrowdfunding is shown to be effective at filling funding gaps validating product ideas and returning significant value for communities Organizations created through crowdfunding have generated billions in revenue employed thousands and attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in follow up venture capital [5][6] Figure 2 Notable Crowdfunding Companies [7][8][9] Socio Economic Impact Steve Case billionaire founder of AOL and philanthropist describes the potential of crowdfunding in this quote \xe2\x80\x9cCrowdfunding offers the potential for a radical evolution of our largely institutional framework for allocating capital through foundations funds and banks to a more individually driven and direct investment framework \xe2\x80\x9d[10] In other words crowdfunding shifts financial control away from exclusionary oligopolies and closer towards democratic communities Crowdfunding\xe2\x80\x99s continued economic success would be a win for equality and society The average current distance between a VC and lead investment is only 70 miles and just 2% of VC dollars go to female founded companies On the other hand crowdfunding brings funding to non coastal regions traditionally disregarded by VCs and is much more inclusive for women who are in fact 13% more likely than men to achieve their crowdfunding goals [11][12][13][14] 2 \x0cFigure 3 The Democratizing Effect of Crowdfunding [15][16][17] The World Bank estimates that 344 million households in the developing world could contribute an additional $96 billion per year to crowdfunding led by China East Asia Central Europe Latin America/the Caribbean and the MENA region [18] According to their report this number would represent 1 8 times the volume of venture capital investments This speaks to a global shift in attitudes towards inclusiveness and decentralization in fundraising and a huge future opportunity for crowdfunding The question arises is the current model of crowdfunding prepared to capture this massive potential 3 \x0cSection One A Brief Introduction to Crowdfunding Definition Market Size Socio Economic Impact Section Two

FAQ SE CTIO N TWO Crowdfunding Has a Trust Problem Issues surrounding transparency accountability and centralization \xe2\x80\x9cKickstarter isn\xe2\x80\x99t liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the Services We don\xe2\x80\x99t become involved in disputes between users\xe2\x80\xa6 We don\xe2\x80\x99t oversee the performance or punctuality of projects \xe2\x80\x9d[19] Kickstarter Terms of Use (2018) Current crowdfunding platforms lack security features that protect backer funds and keep project creators accountable Consequently the projects on these platforms exhibit extremely high rates of failure Here we consider Kickstarter the crowdfunding platform with the most brand recognition In a study of crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter Wharton School professor Ethan R Mollick discovered that as many as 85% delay delivery while 14% fail to deliver what was promised [20][21] Company Total Raised Results Coolest Cooler $13M USD Only 1/3 of products delivered requested additional backer funding Ouya Gaming Console $8 5M USD 3+ Months delayed delivery shipped to Amazon before backers Superscreen $2 5M USD Cancelled abrubtly after 10 Month Delay No refunds issued Zano Drone $3 5M USD Filed bankruptcy failed to deliver altogether Skully Helmet $2 4M USD Filed bankruptcy failed to deliver altogether legal allegations Figure 4 Table of Kickstarter Failures [22][23][24][25][26] The impact of this problem on user confidence is seen in the numbers In total over US $500 million dollars1 have gone to failed projects on Kickstarter alone and less than one third of their 15 7 million users have supported a second project [27] 1 This figure is derived from the $3 65 billion \xe2\x80\x9cSuccessful Dollars\xe2\x80\x9d on Kickstarter as of January 31 2019 multiplied by the cited 14% failure rate defined by a project not delivering what was promised or nothing at all Appendix 4 \x0cFor crowdfunding to reach its full potential as described above we must address the following three core problems 1 A Lack of Accountability Once creators successfully raise funds in a crowdfunding campaign they spend funds however they see fit If promised deadlines come and go without results backers can do little but wait and hope Platforms are complicit in this high rate of failure by not holding creators accountable to their promises This is because doing so puts the burden of responsibility on the platforms as dispute arbitrators or escrow agents incurring mediation responsibilities and overhead costs Instead pledges are labelled as \xe2\x80\x9cdonations \xe2\x80\x9d making it nearly impossible for backers to recoup their losses through legal means [28] Creators are able to deplete the entirety of funds whether it is due to poor management or lack of preparation and simply move on It is no surprise that when creators are able to overpromise and underdeliver without consequences the result is frequent delays and failures This leads to disappointment and damaged trust in the ecosystem 2 A Lack of Transparency Crowdfunding campaigns end after a defined amount of time which incentivizes creators to prioritize marketing and raise as much money while time is available A slick marketing video and description page are effective at raising funds so road mapping and company disclosures take second priority Backers are often left to analyze highly marketed campaigns without substantive information from the creators This leads to information asymmetry between creators and backers which prevents backers from protecting themselves Because Kickstarter privately verifies a creator\xe2\x80\x99s personal information backers may see this as validation of the truth of a campaign\xe2\x80\x99s marketing claims by allowing the project to list However Kickstarter makes no such endorsements with their listing process [29] Incentivizing creators to provide more pertinent disclosures around identity and business operations would lower the risk for backers to invest and increase confidence in the model 5 \x0c3 Centralization Centralization places additional constraints on crowdfunding\xe2\x80\x99s ability to scale Currently Kickstarter creators must reside in one of 22 countries equivalent to only 11% of countries in the world [30] Challenges around handling multiple currencies and a centralized screening process for listing incurs massive overhead and logistics to achieve at a global scale In addition centralization means that the parties in control are able to implement whatever restrictions and exclusionary policies they wish\xe2\x80\x94a problem with institutional investing that crowdfunding emerged to address in the first place For example Kickstarter requires creators to hold a bank account and major credit or debit card even though 38% of adults worldwide remain excluded from the financial system [31] In addition the platform has chosen to ban fundraising for energy drinks in addition to other fully legal products A practical concern of this centralization is that a business model dependent on listing fees creates a financial incentive to list as many campaigns as possible regardless of quality As Finance professors Cumming and Hornuf point out in The Economics of Crowdfunding such profits \xe2\x80\x9cdepend not on the ultimate success of the venture but on the success of the fundraising campaign \xe2\x80\x9d[32] Centralization prioritizes the financial incentives of those in control which do not best serve the participants 6 \x0cSection One A Brief Introduction to

Illustrative Example Reward Scheme For Mods Section Six Token Economy Pledge Coin (PLG) Camp Share (CS) Token Distribution Overview Token Allocation SE CTIO N TH REE The Solution Is Pledgecamp A timely union of blockchain and crowdfunding \xe2\x80\x9cIf platforms intend to operate in the market over a considerable period of time they should in line with Rochet and Tirole (2003) have good incentives to serve the interest of all market participants including the investors \xe2\x80\x9d[33] Cumming and Hornuf The Economics of Crowdfunding In order for an ecosystem to succeed in the long term parties must be incentivized towards shared goals In crowdfunding creators and platforms should be equally invested as backers in the successful delivery of products Pledgecamp fixes long standing problems in crowdfunding by introducing accountability and transparency with smart contracts and by aligning user interests through an inclusive and rewarding token economy Crowdfunding at its core is decentralized and democratic but as noted in Section Two the current implementation has been centralized and limiting The distributed nature of blockchain is a logical fit with crowdfunding and allows us to bring these much needed features to crowdfunding now Backer Insurance Backer Insurance is a security feature unique to Pledgecamp that enforces accountability by empowering backers to monitor the usage of their contributions A smart contract holds a percentage of campaign funds in escrow which is released to creators as project milestones are met Milestones are defined before funds are raised so that the expectations between creators and backers are clear from the beginning Section Seven Campaign Funds Mission and Vision Team Strategic Partners Advisors Sponsors Roadmap Competitors Backer Insurance Business Overview FAQ Appendix Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Creators Milestone 3 Figure 5 Backer Insurance Flow 7 \x0cBackers verify these milestones through democratic vote It is important to note that backers do not have voting rights which dictate management decisions of the creator The vote is specifically a distributed method of verification and mediation Backer Insurance Backers Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone 3 Vote Vote Vote Refund Creators Rewards Figure 6 Backer Insurance Funds Blockchain and smart contracts are necessary to make Backer Insurance possible Instead of requiring teams of lawyers creating smart contracts is essentially free judgment is automated and enforcement is guaranteed There is no centralized party that assumes custodianship of funds or inherits mediation liability for user disputes Responsibility lies with the very backers whose funds are at stake How it Works Before launching a new campaign creators provide a detailed roadmap with milestones and determine how much Backer Insurance is appropriate for their project The more Backer Insurance a creator offers the lower the listing fee they must pay Pledgecamp Listing Fee Backer Insurance amounts are inversely propotional to the listing fee required 50% 0% 40% 1% 30% 2% 20% 3% 10% 4% 0% 5% Figure 7 Relationship Between Backer Insurance and Listing Fees Once a campaign is successfully funded the Backer Insurance is automatically held in a smart contract encoded with the agreed upon milestones and voting days As a voting date approaches creators are able to demonstrate evidence of progress and justify their use of funds 8 \x0cThe campaign will continue to completion unless backers decide to cancel the campaign with a majority vote of \xe2\x80\x9cno confidence \xe2\x80\x9d In this case backers receive a partial refund according to the Backer Insurance amount and will no longer receive a product from the creator The voting system allows creators the chance to present themselves and continue their projects even despite delays It is up to the backers to evaluate the creator\xe2\x80\x99s progress and trustworthiness in deciding to continue the project A transparent and communicative creator may be able to instill confidence in backers and overcome delays In this way Backer Insurance creates a powerful incentive for creators to set realistic deadlines and remain transparent and accountable throughout the life of the project\xe2\x80\x94a desirable result even when setbacks sometimes occur Illustrative Example The following is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes only Carol is developing a robot capable of folding pants She pledges 40% of funds to Backer Insurance and promises to build a prototype in six months Fundraising is successful and after six months Carol shares a video of the prototype folding pants as promised Thanks to this proof backers are confident that she can deliver the final product and agree to release the remaining Backer Insurance funds to Carol Carol uses this final injection of funds to deliver the finished robots as promised Backers are happy and Carol is able to start her new business An alternate example The first milestone arrives and Carol cannot prove any money was spent on the prototype and backers discover that her main manufacturing partner dropped her for not receiving payment Over 51% of backers vote that she did not fulfill her obligations and decide to recover the Backer Insurance Because Carol provided 40% Backer Insurance all backers receive 40% of their original contributions In this worst case scenario backers experience a loss but at least have control over the outcome and can recoup partial refunds 9 \x0cCampaign Deposits Before starting a new campaign on Pledgecamp creators must place a refundable security deposit prior to listing This Campaign Deposit creates a financial penalty for spam on the network and incentivizes creators to be more transparent while promoting their projects Campaign Deposits are fully refunded provided the creator performs enough \xe2\x80\x9ctransparency tasks\xe2\x80\x9d including but not limited to uploading business registration documents identification proof of contracts intellectual property registrations code repositories personal references or even answering questions on live video Each action refunds a fixed amount of the deposit until it is fully refunded For example a creator may choose the five disclosures most applicable to their project and reclaim their deposit with those Although the blockchain is unable to automatically verify that these disclosures are genuine or valuable making them public allows the crowd to scrutinize and evaluate them Backers may use this increased information to ask further questions and make educated decisions Partial or full refunds of Campaign Deposits are returned once the funding period is over If a creator declines to perform these tasks any unrefunded Campaign Deposit will be forfeited when the campaign is launched Creators will be left to explain to backers why they preferred to lose their deposits rather than be more transparent Decentralization Ultimately the purpose of Pledgecamp is to align incentivizes to create an open and distributed model of innovation In crowdfunding the most valuable resource is the crowd itself with all of the skills knowledge and connections contained within Pledgecamp strives to enable what we call the \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Crowd\xe2\x80\x9d an empowered user base that contributes more than just monetary value to the ecosystem Content Creation Social Media Promotion Survey Creation Localization/Translation YouTube videos blog posts infographic creation

retweets posting to FB IG etc Translating marketing material or product material or product manuals into additional languages for greater reach Figure 8 Contributions by the Smart Crowd 10 \x0cA gig economy powered by automated token payments allows creators to easily recruit temporary workers on an as needed basis to help their projects succeed This empowers users to monetize their passions and skills creating an environment where any user can be an entrepreneur and earn secondary income These simple tasks also called \xe2\x80\x9cbounties \xe2\x80\x9d can range from sharing a campaign on social media writing reviews or providing research data to performing creative tasks or translation services for creators Using a cryptocurrency allows this to be largely automated scalable trackable and global In addition a decentralized listing system allows the network to scale without the constraints of central screening Any potential creator may list a campaign after placing a Campaign Deposit This deposit reduces spam on the network while quality control is maintained by a system of decentralized moderators Moderators are users who curate and govern the system by removing scam projects abusive behavior and illegal activity Moderators are powerfully incentivized to cooperate and perform their duty because compensation is tied directly to their performance and health of the platform To complete its decentralized ecosystem Pledgecamp introduces two additional marketplaces the Market Network and the Knowledge Center With a smart application of blockchain in Pledgecamp we

is one step in the overall journey for a creator Successful innovation depends on access to the right partners and information The Market Network and Knowledge Center are built upon this premise Current platforms fall short in providing these extra resources to creators In many cases these first time entrepreneurs do not have extensive professional networks or ability to judge who the right partners are for them On Pledgecamp any entrepreneur will be able to search for trustworthy help in a secure and decentralized way With token incentives participants in these marketplaces can interact in an open and decentralized way Market Network The Market Network is a decentralized marketplace for services where creators can hire professionals to work on their projects Using the Market Network provides significant advantages to both creators and vendors concerning trust and payments Because each project is unique the specific fit between service provider and client is very important and the focus is on building long term relationships around a complex project This requires a marketplace that exhibit features of a social network\xe2\x80\x94hence \xe2\x80\x9cMarket Network \xe2\x80\x9d[35] On Pledgecamp creators can see reviews of vendors that are immutable on the blockchain and open to all for review Seeing a past roster of clients and a history of success or failure will give creators a reliable way to find the trusted help they need Smart contracts make drafting and enforcing vendor agreements essentially free and paying with a cryptocurrency like Pledge Coin means cross border transfers and transactions fees are a non issues Another advantage is that payment contracts on the blockchain are transparent Vendors will have confidence that they will be paid as promised 12 \x0cwhen funds are collected and backers will see that funds are spent as promised The increased transparency can give confidence to a prospective backers and make them more likely to trust and support the creator Creators Vendors Find and compare necessary vendors for sucess Guarantee payment build reputation for future business Backers Figure 9 Market Network Benefits In summary creators who use the Market Network can demonstrate to backers that they have the partnerships in place to execute Backers can pledge with confidence knowing that smart contracts will enforce payments to these partners as promised And vendors will know that a good job performance will be preserved on the blockchain forever and determine their future business Thus incentives are aligned towards achieving cooperation and results together Knowledge Center This Knowledge Center will catalogue the expertise of the crowd specifically as it pertains to entrepreneurship product development and crowdfunding Access to information is often the difference between success and failure and currently there is not a clear market leader offering a forum and database for crowdfunding knowledge This section will consist primarily of a forum for questions and answers and a searchable database Information can range from general crowdfunding queries to specific project level questions Members of the Smart Crowd will have the opportunity to answer and build their reputations or even be rewarded with tokens if offered The Knowledge Center will be a community driven effort and there is a strong incentive for vendors in the Market Network to contribute Vendors who participate will demonstrate their expertise with a steady flow of informative content and answers to user questions Upvotes and best answers chosen by the community will contribute to a vendor\xe2\x80\x99s increased reputation and status on the platform Knowledge Center PLEDGECAMP How do I Create a pro Create a project on pledgecamp Create

Overview Token Allocation Section Seven Business Overview Mission and Vision Team Strategic Partners Advisors Sponsors Roadmap Competitors Moderators perform key functions that maintain the health of the system by removing listings and user behaviors that violate the Terms of Service Moderators earn the right to perform this work by demonstrating a stake in the platform ensuring that their personal interests are in line with other users and the platform as a whole In this way Moderators are motivated to achieve consensus on the truth and resist corruption Moderators receive the listing fees generated by the platform as compensation for their role As the platform grows more successful through their actions the listing fees should similarly grow in proportion In this way Moderator compensation is tied to the health and success of the platform FAQ Appendix 14 \x0cModeration Process Procedure for Moderator Governance 1 2 3 4 Figure 12 Procedure for Moderator Governance The first responsibility for spotting harmful behavior lies with the crowd Any user who suspects instances of fraud abuse or other illegal activity may flag the alleged violation Violations are defined by the Pledgecamp Terms of Service and are set by the community When the number or rate of flags becomes statistically significant the issue will be settled by a jury of Moderators A jury of 12 Moderators will randomly be assigned to decide the issue within 24 hours Their identities will remain secret in order to prevent collusion A consensus of at least 7 jurors is required to trigger a corrective action If necessary additional Moderators will be assigned until a minimum of 7 votes is recorded User Pool 12 Randomly Chosen (Moderators) Blind Vote Minimum 7 (or more) required for consensus Figure 13 Moderator Process Once consensus is achieved the identities of the Moderators and their decisions will be made public to expose any potentially suspicious behavior Moderators who are suspected of abusing their positions may themselves be flagged and put before other Moderators for a determination of whether wrongdoing has taken place In addition Moderators who fail to vote when summoned will lose their status after three strikes and their compensation will 15 \x0cbe forfeited to the remaining Moderators The implementation of the Moderator system is based on the game theory concept of Schelling Points (see Appendix 1 0) and trial procedures used throughout the world The system may be optimized with platform launch data with consensus from Moderators Illustrative Example The following is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes only Bobby discovers a newly launched Pledgecamp campaign promising to build equipment that manufactures illegal drugs This is a clear violation of the Terms of Service and harmful for the platform\xe2\x80\x99s image Bobby flags the campaign and presents his concerns to other users who also flag the campaign 8 Moderators agree that the campaign should be removed 1 disagrees and 3 fail to vote With sufficient consensus achieved campaign funds are automatically refunded the Campaign Deposit is forfeited to the Platform Reserve and the campaign is closed from collecting any additional funds An alternate example In a separate case Bobby discovers a campaign that he and others suspect of making fraudulent claims After the vote only 4 Moderators feel there is sufficient evidence above suspicion of fraud thereby allowing the campaign to continue Still potential backers are able to see that 4 independent Moderators agreed that there was reason for concern Bobby is free to voice concerns in the comments that the creator can subsequently address creating a transparent atmosphere where backers can make informed decisions Reward Scheme for Moderators Moderators perform a critical role for the ongoing health of the platform particularly as a replacement for centralized control and governance As such compensation should be commensurate with the importance of their role Listing fees are a logical choice for compensation because they represent real economic gain created under their governance and will grow along with

collected by the platform in a current month This is multiplied by the Moderator\xe2\x80\x99s stake of Pledge Coins (CSuser) divided by the total amount of staked Pledge Coins (CStotal) In simple terms a Moderator who hypothetically holds 5% of all Pledge Coins staked on the platform will receive 5% of the listing fees each month Averages of Pledge Coins stakes within each period as well as a vesting period are enforced to discourage a user from suddenly increasing their Pledge Coins stakes before the calculation is made Periodic compensation is enforced because Moderators are needed to remain \xe2\x80\x9con duty\xe2\x80\x9d and perform their role responsibly over a period of time Isolated payments for each vote make it challenging if not impossible to hold a Moderator accountable to their actions over time In addition it is not practical to put a price tag on each individual vote Instead periodic compensation for Moderators who may be called upon to act at any time within a period will satisfy this needed role over periods of time 17 \x0cSection One A Brief Introduction to Crowdfunding Definition Market Size Socio Economic Impact Section Two Crowdfunding Has a Trust

Pledgecamp Token Economy achieves its major objectives through the use of Pledge Coins and Camp Shares Pledge Coin enables access and powers the bulk of interactions in the ecosystem while Camp Share allows participation in the Moderator work system and proves a user\xe2\x80\x99s alignment with the interests of the platform The end result of this economy is to reward those who add value to the network while aligning the incentives of all parties Each party acting in their own interest is incentivized to act in the interest of the group When incentives of all users are properly aligned

Platform Fund 20% Public Distribution Figure 17 Token Allocation Initial Moderator Bonus 5% 5% of the initial Token Allocation or 500 000 000 PLG will fund the Initial Moderator Bonus This fund addresses the concern that in the early stages of the platform there may be insufficient listing fees generated to properly incentivize Moderators to perform their duties although they are no less important To ensure that their vital duties are performed as needed this Initial Moderator Bonus will supplement their regular compensation of listing fees according to the following formula until the fund is depleted permanently in 36 months 20 \x0cInitial Creator Fund 5% 5% of the initial Token Allocation or 500 000 000 PLG will fund the Initial Creator Bonus This initiative to recruit initial

bonus amount must be spent on services in the Market Network to ensure that funds are used directly on their projects This will also attract early vendors who can receive these funds Any campaign suspended by Moderators is not eligible for this bonus In addition portfolio companies of eligible startup incubators and accelerators will be awarded up to 50 000 PLG per company that lists on Pledgecamp This incentive is to encourage companies to run their projects on our nascent platform If the Initial Creator Fund is not depleted after 36 months the remainder will be allocated to the

affect these market leaders are described in great detail in Section Two Some specific differences are highlighted below Figure 18 Competitor Matrix 28 \x0cFAQ What is Pledgecamp Pledgecamp is a decentralized platform that aims to solve longstanding issues of trust and misaligned user incentives in crowdfunding What makes Pledgecamp different Pledgecamp provides security for backers in the form of Backer Insurance and transparency requirements for creators Blockchain allows users to mediate disputes and guarantee financial enforcement without requiring a third party mediator or custodian A decentralized marketplace further allows participants to be compensated for their contributions to the network and to allow all people to join regardless of geography or demographics A native token ensures that incentives are aligned good behavior is rewarded and that users benefit when their actions lead to the health and growth of the network Why Blockchain Blockchain allows strangers across the world to engage in complicated financial transactions within a programmable framework of trust Without it key benefits offered by Pledgecamp\xe2\x80\x99s new features would be impossible Crowdfunding is decentralized funding and innovation that aligns perfectly with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology and it is an industry with key problems in the area of trust Pledgecamp utilizes blockchain technology to be the first to offer Backer Insurance an escrow wallet framework that allows users to self regulate without requiring intermediaries A native token also incentivizes engagement with the platform and aligns all users to act in the interests of the group as a whole These improvements will be essential to fix crowdfunding as we move together towards a vision of global innovation What is Backer Insurance Backer Insurance is an escrow wallet powered by a smart contract which enables backers to protect campaign funds from misuse by creators It provides a financial incentive for creators to be betterprepared before launching their campaigns and more realistic when setting initial expectations Should creators fail to deliver on their promises backers will have the option to recover the Backer Insurance amount instead of granting it to the creator to finish the project Is Backer Insurance safe from Sybil attack Rational actors will find there is little financial incentive in trying to manipulate the Backer Insurance vote First Backer Insurance is a portion of campaign funds that are withheld from the total amount A scammer will find a greater incentive to run a scam on another platform (such as Indiegogo) where no 29 \x0cfunds would be withheld from the total and could instead scam for the entire amount Second the campaign deposit system requires creators to make meaningful disclosures or else forfeit a financial stake These disclosures will help make it apparent to a potential backer if this is a serious project and creator or just a scam with no substance Should the project to be found a scam and removed the deposit will be forfeit Because of the deposit and required disclosures along with Backer Insurance a scammer would find it more difficult and financially riskier with lower payout to run a scam on Pledgecamp Because the nature of crowdfunding and innovation of crowdfunding involves risks no system of rules can guarantee against loss or failure but providing adequate transparency requirements and good incentives makes attacks or a black swan event unlikely Backers also do not have an incentive to attack and wrongly refund Backer Insurance because doing so would necessarily result in a financial loss (it is a partial amount of the whole funds) It is more of a last resort that provides compensation that backers would not receive on any other platform and as a security mechanism that provides incentives for creators to behave better What benefits do creators receive Although many of the security features seem designed for backers they will ultimately benefit a responsible creator as well For example campaign deposits and Backer Insurance are fully refundable and received by the creator if they simply keep their promises and provide transparency about their intentions to backers In return creators will pay significantly less listing fees or even no listing fees which can save much needed capital for an entrepreneur In addition access to the gig economy marketplace features and knowledge center on the platform provides much needed access to resources and guidance that can be sometimes more important than straight cash for those building their businesses For pros and first timers alike Pledgecamp will provide the support and opportunity needed to everyone not just the well connected elite And finally a quality creator recognizes that a happy backer leads to a happy creator If backers have confidence in the system they will be more willing to provide the capital that creators are seeking As stated in the White Paper less than one third of Kickstarter users return to back a second campaign\xe2\x80\x94this equates to potentially millions of dollars left on the table due to low confidence that we aim to recover for creators with our new mechanisms of trust What is PLG used for PLG or Pledge Coins are used for backing campaigns placing deposits holding value in Backer Insurance exchanging services between network participants and for staking in order to earn specialized roles and earning opportunities How does currency valuation affect platform features Because stability is a characteristic of maturity that the cryptocurrency markets have not achieved yet several safeguards will be put in place to ensure short term fluctuations do not threaten the normal operation of the platform 30 \x0cWhen pledging campaigns PLG may be committed but not collected until the moment funding concludes PLG will be pegged to USD to ensure creators are collecting enough to complete their projects in the face of fluctuations Should fluctuations of occur the amount of PLG will be automatically adjusted to account for the difference in the peg to USD If a user committed a certain amount and is found to have insufficient PLG to cover the difference in value the user will have the opportunity to acquire more PLG to continue their pledge or cancel it Once Backer Insurance is committed to the blockchain the platform will maintain its USD value at the point it is distributed to users Excess PLG will be committed to the Platform Reserve while a deficit will require taking PLG from the Platform Reserve Thus in the short term these mechanisms will help ensure that price commitments are honored despite movement in the USD PLG exchange rate In the long run these mechanisms will be less needed as cryptocurrency markets reach greater stability How is PLG distributed PLG will be pre mined and distributed according to the Token Allocation plan Users within certain jurisdictions may be restricted from acquiring PLG at the discretion of the Company This document does not comprise a solicitation of sale or investment Any information regarding a

significance in game theory Introduced by Nobel Prize winning economist Thomas Schelling in his book The Strategy of Conflict (1960) Schelling describes a \xe2\x80\x9cfocal point for each person\xe2\x80\x99s expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do \xe2\x80\x9d37 In layman\xe2\x80\x99s terms this Schelling Point is a solution that people will tend to use when faced with the problem of coordination without advanced communication An example of this on the Pledgecamp platform may look like this Five users (blind to each others\xe2\x80\x99 identities to prevent collusion) are elected as moderators and offered a reward payout by the system for correctly removing campaigns that promise to deliver illegal drugs A campaign flagged by users clearly promises illegal drugs in violation of community rules Each of the five moderators is faced with a choice vote to remove this campaign or vote to approve it as a false positive Each moderator knows that if their vote is in majority agreement with the other moderators then they will receive the reward generated If they are in the minority of the vote they will lose their moderator status and receive no reward Thus each moderator understands that the other mystery moderators are motivated to achieve consensus together in order to receive a reward In the absence of any collusion or coordination the logical solution for all parties will be to vote for the correct answer Even if a few moderators act irrationally the overall outcome of the vote will likely not be affected and instead they will only lose their moderator status and forfeit any potential reward for their contribution to the network Thus Schelling Points show how aligning the individual interests of users can simultaneously benefit the entire network and achieve consensus in the absence of a centralized authority 1 1 Becoming a Moderator To become a moderator a minimum quantity PLG must be staked to receive Camp Shares (CS) which make you eligible to become a moderator This sum shall be 100 000 PLG at the outset though adjustable based on real world data to ensure there are enough participating Moderators to sustain the system Because Pledgecamp is built using a blockchain the system can perform double blind audits where Moderators do not know the actions other Moderators are taking but these are all publicly recorded so a Reputation Score can be built into its framework Moderators are compensated proportionally to their amount of PLG stake If a Moderator chooses the same outcome that over 51% of Moderators choose that moderator will earn one point towards its Reputation Score In the case that a Moderator votes in the minority it will lose three Pledge Points This is to incentive voting in a truthful manner because in a blind vote voting truthfully will most likely correlate with the majority (see \xe2\x80\x9cSchelling Points\xe2\x80\x9d described above) 32 \x0cThis means any user can gain or lose Moderator status as an account may have a negative number of points The total number of Pledge Points a Moderator has is what yields a Reputation Score on Pledgecamp Every Pledgecamp user has only one Ethereum address so each Ethereum address will have its own Reputation Score As users must KYC to become a Moderator certain personally identifying details will be referenceable within the ecosystem As such users are unable to create duplicate accounts to become a Creator and also moderate on the approval of their own campaign or settle their own disputes The pool of Moderators will be put into a percentile framework based on the number of Pledge Points they have creating a healthy level of competition inside of the Moderator network Any bad actors in the Moderator pool that vote contrary to the majority in an attempt to create unjust outcomes will be penalized resulting in a lower Reputation Score The Reputation Score is calculated using the following formula Reputation Score = Values Below Moderator Rank x 100 / Total Number of Moderators For example assume there is a total of five Moderators on Pledgecamp These Moderators have the following number of Pledge Points they have earned 24 29 38 52 61 To determine the Reputation Score of the Moderator with 52 Pledge Points of the total sample size of five moderators there are three moderators below their rank In the formula it looks like Reputation Score = 3 x 100 = 60 points _________ \t\t 5 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please note that five Moderators is for the ease of an illustrative example as Pledgecamp aims to have many thousands of Moderators on its platform The lower a Moderator\xe2\x80\x99s Reputation Score the less weight their vote will hold As other Moderators are acting in good faith on the platform they will be gaining Pledge Points while bad actors are losing them creating a faster deceleration for the impact bad actors can have on Pledgecamp\xe2\x80\x99s user governance model If a Moderator fails to fulfill their duty to vote their Reputation Score will also drop due to a lower number of Pledge Points in the percentile category Should a Moderator\xe2\x80\x99s Reputation Score dip to an unacceptable number the user will be suspended as a Moderator and not receive compensation for that period However their Reputation Score shall reset for the next period as the only \xe2\x80\x9csecond chance\xe2\x80\x9d they will receive Should their Reputation Score drop to an unacceptable level again they will no longer be allowed to remain as a Moderator nor receive any compensation 1 2 Ease of Use for Non Crypto Users Ease of use is a priority for the Pledgecamp platform design and the objective is to appeal to the mass market and not a solely crypto focused one To that end there may be a need to accommodate users who are unfamiliar with blockchain and do not want to deal with crypto wallets or exchanges to 33 \x0cuse the product As much as possible to aid user adoption the platform will still protect these users with blockchain powered functionality but streamline the experience to the point where backing a project on Pledgecamp may be similar if not easier than backing on Kickstarter or Indiegogo Backer Insurance will necessarily remain a blockchain feature controlled by smart contracts and backer vote but the portion of campaign funds that are received by the creator at the conclusion of the campaign may \xe2\x80\x9cpass through\xe2\x80\x9d Pledgecamp and not require any conversion into cryptocurrency This amount can be pledged in fiat via credit card or other traditional method and passed through to the creator who will likely need fiat for many business operations A simplified diagram of such a proposed system may look like the following Figure 19 Currency Flow Diagram Managed accounts are wallets that users can use on the platform to store and transfer their PLG or CS that are managed by the platform Users may use private ERC20 wallets at any time as well As familiarity with cryptocurrency increases over time the inclusion of fiat elements will become less and less important As it stands now this functionality and limited incorporation of fiat will not detract from the decentralized nature of listing procedures and Backer Insurance as a security mechanism It also does not affect the sum of listing fees in any way that compensates only CS holders for their work The objective of this possible payment flow is to increase user adoption and project listings which will benefit everyone in the network 34 \x0cCitations [1] Goldman Sachs \xe2\x80\x9cThe Future of Finance\xe2\x80\x9d Mar 13 2015 p 12 https //www planet fintech com/file/167061
