flying the fear of looking at the future the fear of technology Recent statistics show that the use of Blockchain technology concerns very few people amongst the world\xe2\x80\x99s population there is a general feeling of mistrust towards it Contrary to this tendency xCrypt created its project based on its distinctive characteristic Xenomania from Greek meaning an extreme passion for foreign entities the unexplored which are yet to reach most of the people xCrypt is the first innovative crypto ecosystem with its heart in its exchange hybrid compliant with securities and ready for the future of erc721\xe2\x80\x99s The platform is designed to be simple comfortable and innovative We believe that in the near future many changes in the cryptocurrencies field and the trading field will occur and consequently how this new world is conceived will change This is the reason why after carefully developing its concept after its host country\xe2\x80\x99s admission xCrypt decided that its priorities are those of listing security tokens providing an appropriate and strategic marketplace for erc721 tokens and carrying out innovative dynamics in relationship with the ICO With these priorities in mind xCrypt can reward its community with a zero fee exchange relating it to the other members through the social media platform and monthly compensating its holders via airdrops through a ranking system By introducing the XCT token users can benefit from the xCrypt ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s services which rewards its exchange users and holders with an innovative method through airdrops Blockchain technology has changed the world of investment forever and for the better ICOs have proven to be secure and successful means of financing companies and projects By purchasing a membership on the xCrypt platform members will benefit from exclusive services The membership is split into multiple tiers with allocation depending on the amount of XCT (XCT\xe2\x80\x99s ERC 20 access token) purchased 7 \x0cXCRYPT x 1 MARKET INTRODUCTION 8 8 \x0cXCRYPT x 1 MARKET INTRODUCTION The present exchange market is in our opinion too small but xCrypt wants to exploit it to the maximum also attracting new entrants A traditional exchange only lists several cryptocurrencies and ERC20 altcoins not taking every possibility the market has to offer Currently Cryptocurrencies are capitalized at around 270 billion dollars of value but we\xe2\x80\x99re especially astounded by the expected continued growth In alignment with the future XCrypt decided to build a future proof platform ready to catch the market\xe2\x80\x99s latest developments The figure below displays XCrypt\xe2\x80\x99s added values and the differences between xCrypt and a traditional exchange 9 \x0cXCRYPT x 2 THE CURRENT EXCHANGE OVERVIEW 10 10 XCRYPT WHITE PAPER \x0cXCRYPT x 2 THE CURRENT EXCHANGE OVERVIEW 1 Liquidity 2 Certainty and centralized nature 3 CEX or Hybrid 4 Loyalty management 5 Clearing and settlement 6 Difficulties of Real time Trading 7 Certainty and Centralised nature 2 1 LIQUIDITY Inherent to all rising markets there is also a lack of liquidity in crypto markets which makes it difficult for cryptocurrencies to be presented at the right price Recent years have shown an increased overall liquidity by the growth in the exchange use but compared to Forex there is still a long way to go In Bitcoin markets for example lack of liquidity is partly due to the fact that many BTC holders are sitting tight as the value rises and are thus unwilling to exchange their Bitcoins The choice of holding crypto and waiting for their assets to reach a certain profit level subsequently flood the market which accounts for the volatility and massive price swings that we see on crypto markets Additionally the absolute number of bitcoin traders vastly lower than forex traders also causes lower liquidity This lack of liquidity carries two main problems for crypto exchange users namely There are large spreads on the thin markets due to both low number of bids and asks for the assets and additional demand and supply inefficiencies Secondly the large price swings on these thin markets accounts for price slippage with trades not executed at the price proposed As mentioned above crypto exchanges have a centralized nature prone to failure and a target for hackers Mt Gox the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading exchange of its time experienced the most publicised and largest hack to date with unrecovered Bitcoins totalling 650 000 Mt Gox later filed for bankruptcy Another notable hack occurred at one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most popular exchanges Bitfinex In the second largest crypto hack witnessed 120 000 BTC was stolen Since blockchain data is immutable it is more susceptible to theft by hacks This immutable nature means all transactions are final so issues related to lost funds cannot be resolved by legal action In addition to a non existing legal recourse for stolen or lost funds 11 \x0cXCRYPT x technologically crypto assets cannot be recovered or frozen without forking to reject the transactions something that requires consensus 2 2 CEX/HYBRID In today\xe2\x80\x99s world those looking to participate in the cryptocurrency boom can turn to centralized exchanges (CEX) and more recently decentralized exchanges (DEX) The problem Neither of these have succeeded to provide full functionality that allows individuals and institutions to efficiently participate in the market CEX Speed & Liquidity with Digital Vulnerability Before cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers centralized exchanges have long been the standard Those like NASDAQ NYSE and others allow trading of stocks and similar assets and have provided low latency (quick processing of orders) liquidity and tools like marginal and high frequency trading This attracted significant participation from individual and institutional investors the latter contributing to even more liquidity In the crypto world however CEX seems a bit contradictory to the decentralized essence of the new ledger technology All the buy and sell orders are routed to a third party where users place their private keys in the hands of these exchanges These third parties are vulnerable to government influence and hacking attacks Two of the largest exchanges in China for example froze all Bitcoin withdrawals for a month after China\xe2\x80\x99s central bank attempted to intervene Others have forced exchanges to collect data on their users causing concerns for the privacy that cryptocurrency users cherish CEX\xe2\x80\x99s concentrate large amounts of cryptocurrency which makes them attractive and vulnerable to hacking attacks These attacks have already costed users millions of dollars in digital assets notably the attacks on Mt Gox Bitfinex and Coincheck among the others HYBRID The Spirit of Crypto at a Cost Many think the solution to these problems can be fixed by Hybrid Exchanges This form of exchange allows users to keep much of the privacy by retaining absolute control of their private keys Since they mostly rely on software it is difficult to subject them to the same government regulation that requires CEX to collect personal information Additionally since Hybrid\xe2\x80\x99s do not hold their users\xe2\x80\x99 assets they are not as vulnerable to hacking providing more security than their CEX counterparts However Hybrid\xe2\x80\x99s do not hold currency nor do they have a central ledger containing all buy and sell orders This prevents them from offering the instruments latency or liquidity that would motivate institutional investors to enter the market 12 \x0cXCRYPT x 2 3 CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT Another issue with crypto exchanges is how transactions are cleared and settled via their platforms As cryptocurrencies exist within an unregulated space clearing and settlement cannot occur through traditional regulated channels making clearing and settlement risks abnormally high Moreover exchanges aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to act as anything other than a third party that only arranges trades between buyers and sellers This means that they are not a direct counterparty to every transaction that takes place and so are not bearing much responsibility for what takes place on their platforms However it must be said that they do act as a counterparty where they can correctly make margin calls in time to recoup funds from the wrong sides of contracts 2 4 LOYALTY ISSUE AND LITTLE ADDED VALUE IN THE CURRENT MARKET With the abundance of exchanges in this complex market making users loyal is key The users are too often obtained based on the competitive advantage of bringing the fees down to zero However market and economy laws teach us that a client acquisition can\xe2\x80\x99t be based on price since it would bring the economy to a perfect situation in a medium period of time while the profits would be none on the long run We believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s no exchange which is attractive for its added values besides the fee price and the liquidities Their success balances on a thin line prone to be broken by its users whenever a better competitor shows up 2 5 DIFFICULTIES OF REAL TIME TRADING Due to rate limited trading APIs non real time transaction confirmation and delayed order book updates traders are unable to trade in real time 2 6 MARKET MAKER XCRYPT team will release simple SDKs and open source tools to enable the creation of dynamic orderbooks via APIs Several hackathons will be planned to engage the community in creating API bots utilizing the state of the art ETERBASE API interface XCRYPT already close partnership with Efficient Frontier (www efrontier io) 13 \x0cXCRYPT x 3 THE ADDED VALUE OF MARKET LEADERS 14 14 \x0cXCRYPT x 3 THE ADDED VALUE OF MARKET LEADERS In order to understand the added value of current market leaders we\xe2\x80\x99ve analyzed Binance and its features in depth the number one exchange by trade volume These are the main advantages of Binance opposed to its competitors 1 Huge list of alt coins One of the main reasons that why Binance exchange is that popular is because they list so many different cryptocurrencies 2 There are now more than 1500 individual cryptocurrencies 3 There are more than 100 different cryptocurrencies available at Binance 15 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 Another excellent feature of the exchange is that when trading crypto to crypto Binance fees are one of the lowest in the industry Deposits are always free but withdrawals do cost money However most exchanges operate in the same way Withdrawal fees are different for each cryptocurrency and change depending on their value 5 ICO launch pad Binance is well known for listing new cryptocurrencies as their ICO is finished This shows that many crypto companies view Binance as their favorite exchange Binance on the other hand has obtained a strict admittance policy regarding the quality of cryptocurrencies 6 Security Binance takes security very seriously and customers are asked to set up a two factor authentication (2FA) when they register an account 2FA is an extra level of security that sends a special code to your mobile phone every time you want to log in trade or withdraw funds The website also uses the CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS) to protect accounts which is an industry standard for major exchanges To further secure updates on the platform Binance outsources security checks This recently backfired when Binance mistakingly outsourced a check on their current security protocol which ultimately led to a hack of 7 000 BTC Luckily as of yet this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t affected any of the giant number of users\xe2\x80\x99 accounts 7 High Volume Trading As Binance has become one of the most popular exchanges on which buying trade and selling cryptocurrencies there are lots of trades happening all the time This is an important factor you have a higher chance of selling your cryptocurrency immediately if and when you need to For example if you wanted to buy a cryptocurrency but it has a low trading volume then it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to buy because there aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many sellers However if lots of people are looking to sell that coin it will be easy to buy Summing up the users choose Binance because they think it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient due to its low fees its wide range of cryptocurrencies and its point based game We believe this advantage is rather weak Whenever a stronger competitor would join the market Binance can lose its user community and a migration toward the new player might take place 16 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 XCRYPT ECOSYSTEM 17 17 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 XCRYPT ECOSYSTEM Andronie Loren Founder and CEO 18 XCRYPT is the

Therefore we choose Malta as our host country as soon as the licences are finalized For now we\xe2\x80\x99ve temporarily chosen Estonia as host country Depending on changes affecting National regulations we reserve the rights to change our hosts to conserve an optimal ecosystem for xCrypt 4 4 1 MALTA THE ICO JURISDICTION \xe2\x80\x93 REGULATION Malta is the first country in the world to introduce a clear regulatory framework around ICOs tokens and cryptocurrencies This will ensure that as a founder you will be able to get certainty on the treatment of your token Malta as a jurisdiction does not regulate Utility tokens A Utility token does not give token holders any rights or obligations As long as your token is a Utility token you will be free to run an ICO through Malta Plans are in place to set up a new regulator to supervise such ICOs in Malta This will ensure thwarting of fraudulent ICOs The main objective of such a regulator is simply to further promote Malta as a fair and transparent ICO jurisdiction 27 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 4 2 MALTA AS THE ICO JURISDICTION \xe2\x80\x93 REPUTATION When selecting your ICO jurisdiction one should not underestimate your reputational risk An ICO does not radiate trust when it\xe2\x80\x99s launched from some remote offshore Jurisdiction Malta is ideal as a jurisdiction as it is a European Union (EU) country This tackles the problem that banks and other institutions refuse to work with ICO companies located in offshore jurisdictions A choice of the latter would therefore impede efficient operation regardless of the success of the ICO itself 4 4 3 MALTA AS THE ICO JURISDICTION \xe2\x80\x93 GENERAL PRO CRYPTO / BLOCKCHAIN SENTIMENT A country\xe2\x80\x99s leader openly showing support and Admiration for Crypto has been a rare event However Malta\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has recently been very clear about the matter stating that cryptocurrency will become the \xe2\x80\x9cfuture money\xe2\x80\x9d Prime minister Muscat asked his audience \xe2\x80\x9cHave any of you ever thought about what gives paper money its value when it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately just a piece of paper It does only because society attributes value to it Now some people who in my opinion are geniuses are arguing that value can similarly be attributed to virtual currencies \xe2\x80\x9d July 4 2018 marks a historic day for Malta as the Maltese Parliament has officially passed 3 bills establishing the first regulatory framework for blockchain cryptocurrency and DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) This makes Malta the first country in the world to provide an official set of regulations for operators in the blockchain cryptocurrency and DLT space \xe2\x80\x9cI think that blockchain technology DLT and cryptocurrency is where innovation is happening right now and we are very glad that Malta can offer the first jurisdiction in the world to regulate this sector We are excited about what this will lead to in the future \xe2\x80\x9d Joseph Muscat Malta\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister said Just last week the Maltese Parliament voted unanimously to approve 3 cryptocurrency and blockchain bills which were designed to make Malta one of the most desirable locations to set up shop in the blockchain space As these bills have now been passed into laws Malta is sure to become a pioneer in economic innovation In turn this will strengthen the country\xe2\x80\x99s economy with the creation of a new economic niche Moreover Malta\xe2\x80\x99s Junior Minister for Financial Services Digital Economy and Innovation Silvio Schembri noted that the passing of the new laws mark an important milestone in which companies will be provided with the necessary tools to operate in a regulated environment When we started looking into what was needed for the blockchain industry to flourish we understood early on that the serious operators wanted legal certainty As of now operators are functioning in jurisdictions of legal uncertainty Operators fear that one day a government in that particular legislation will tell them they aren\xe2\x80\x99t within the law even though there are currently very few laws in place This is creating legal uncertainty and we wanted to change this Schembri stated Malta The World\xe2\x80\x99s First Blockchain Island 28 \x0cXCRYPT x Due to its innovation in the blockchain and DLT space Malta has earned the reputation for being known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe world\xe2\x80\x99s first blockchain island \xe2\x80\x9d And now that the Maltese Parliament has approved the laws intended to set up the first regulatory framework for DLT more blockchain and cryptocurrency operators are sure to look towards Malta as a safe and welcoming environment \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re providing the necessary tools so that companies in this sector can operate \xe2\x80\x9d said Schembri 4 4 4 ESTONIA XCrypt has chosen Estonia as its initial host country Legally setting up a company is a rapid process in Estonia as most public services and jurisdictions are digitalized Estonia is well known to have a fast paced digital society through decades of governmental support In combination with its positive view on blockchain related technology this was the most logical country of choice to initially reside in Our acquired licences allow us to provide services regarding the change turnover transfer and holding of cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets for clients all over the world xCrypt is entitles to both providing virtual currency wallet service and providing services of exchanging virtual currencies to fiat 4 4 5 INITIAL EXCHANGE OFFERINGS AND LAUNCHPAD In order to make the XCRYPT EXCHANGE attractive for new projects we will initiate a Launchpad for Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) As its name suggests IEOs are conducted on the platform of a digital asset exchange Contrary to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) an IEO is administered by an exchange on behalf of the project that seeks to raise funds with its newly issued tokens As the token sale is conducted on our XCRYPT EXCHANGE the token issuers must pay a listing fee along with a percentage of the tokens sold during the IEO XCRYPT EXCHANGE will take a percentage of the tokens sold by the project This way there will be an incentive to help with the marketing operations of the token issuer As per these mechanics XCRYPT EXCHANGE is planning to create partnerships with several projects that are interested in selling tokens directly for FIAT or want to utilize our additional services 29 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 4 6 KYC / AML POLICY The Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (CTF) policies are designed to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing by meeting the European AML legislation standards including the need to have adequate systems and controls in place to eliminate or at least mitigate the risk of the firm being potentially used to facilitate illegal financial activities Internal AML Policy will set out the minimum standards which must always be complied The cornerstone of the AML policy will be an appointment of an independent Counter Terrorism Financing and Money Laundering Officer (CTFMLO) with strong experience in security compliance and counter terrorism who will have the responsibility of overseeing compliance with relevant legislation regulations rules and maintaining a Risk Based Approach (RBA) towards monitoring and managing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks to XCRYPT Secondly we will require an enhanced and strict risk based customer screening process due diligence identification verification and know your customer (KYC) procedures including in depth due diligence and with continuous monitoring for those customers who present higher risk xCryptCapital O\xc3\x9c is strictly prohibited from transacting with individuals companies and countries that are on prescribed sanctions lists the company will therefore screen against United Nations European Union UK Treasury and U S Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists in all jurisdictions in which we will or might operate 30 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 5 XCRYPT FUTURE PROOF 4 5 1 UTILITY TOKEN Utility tokens also called user tokens or app coins represent future access to a company\xe2\x80\x99s product or service The defining characteristic of utility tokens is that they are not designed as investments If properly structured this feature exempts utility tokens from federal laws governing securities By creating utility tokens a startup can sell \xe2\x80\x9cdigital coupons\xe2\x80\x9d for the service it is developing similar to how electronics retailers accept pre orders for video games prior to release Filecoin for instance raised $257 million by selling tokens that will provide users access to its decentralized cloud storage platform Because the term \xe2\x80\x9cICO\xe2\x80\x9d is a derivative of \xe2\x80\x9cinitial public offering\xe2\x80\x9d (IPO) utility token creators usually refer to these crowdsales as token generation events (TGE\xc2\xb4s) or token distribution events (TDE\xc2\xb4s) to avoid the appearance that they are engaging in a securities offering 4 5 2 SECURITY TOKEN If a crypto token derives its value from an external tradable asset it is classified as a security token and becomes subject to federal securities regulations Failure to abide by these regulations could result in costly penalties and could threaten to derail a project However if a startup meets all its regulatory obligations the security token classification creates the potential for a wide variety of applications the most promising of which is the ability to issue tokens that represent shares of company stock 4 5 2 1 WHAT ARE STO\xe2\x80\x99s In the latter half of 2018 and in 2019 we are therefore going to see a huge rise in STO\xc2\xb4s They may eventually outduel ICO\xc2\xb4s the reason being more secure for potential investors and thereby less susceptible to fraud As soon as blockchain startups can have more credible ICO\xc2\xb4s the name of these offerings become irrelevant This also opens up the floodgates for companies and new projects in virtually any field to tap into how ICO\xc2\xb4s work backed by tangible assets In a world where ICO\xc2\xb4s are becoming increasingly necessary according to the founder of Binance it may be justifiable that some of those will be implemented as STO\xc2\xb4s Security tokens combine the characteristics of utility tokens and venture capital Theu act as a natural bridge between traditional finance like venture capital and Blockchain and benefit both equally Utility tokens akin to loyalty rewards points given by credit cards have dominated ICOs However in some cases owners cannot the tokens\xc2\xb4 use beyond the issuer\xe2\x80\x99s platform As for venture capital most private assets are relatively illiquid which means 31 \x0cXCRYPT x investors face difficulties converting them into cash Security tokens solve both fundamental problems Security tokens digitally represent ownership in any asset such as a piece of a tech startup or a venture capital fund and can provide investors with various rights to that company or fund Furthermore Security tokens provide liquidity to investors access to compliance features to issuers and a framework for oversight to regulators Cryptocurrencies and ICOs must compromise with the existing framework of how securities work thus STOs could be the new ICOs in the years to come Security ICOs will likely become a real competitor to traditional IPOs as the costs for an ICO remain cheaper Investors will increasingly realize the advantages of digital tokens over traditional shares 32 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 5 3 CRYPTO ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS HINT AND SECURITY TOKEN TSUNAMI 33 \x0cXCRYPT x As the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies improves the broader infrastructure to help connect issuers and investors is starting to take shape In the chart above we list industry developments and emerging projects designed to boost the prominence of the security token market The people behind these projects clearly believe that security tokens could soon attract the interest of businesses and retail investors Furthermore the market forces that drove the evolution of the digital currencies democratization globalization transparency and liquidity \xe2\x80\x93 could prompt a flurry of private tech firms to raise money through security token ICOs Innovative startups and opportunistic institutional crypto investors will position themselves such to benefit from the growing secular trend of security tokens Security token offerings STO\xc2\xb4s are therefore the new kid on the crypto block If ICOs in spite of a lack of regulation still fueled startups with a massive $5 6 billion what\xe2\x80\x99s next Many believe it\xe2\x80\x99s STOs As mentioned before with ICOs tokens or coins are offered by companies for purchase as a form of crowdfunding STOs on the other hand offer an upgrade over just the possibility to purchase tokens during the offering to subsequently trade sell or hold Since security tokens are actual financial securities your tokens are backed by something tangible like the assets profits or revenue of the company 4 6 XCRYPT ERC721 MARKET PLACE We strive for a strong differentiation from other platform including the promising erc721 tokens within our marketplace XCrypt marketplace is a decentralized marketplace for crypto assets including collectibles gaming items and other digital goods that are backed by a blockchain like Ethereum On xCrypt you can buy or sell any of these items through smart contracts meaning that no central authority ever holds custody of your items If you\xe2\x80\x99re on a desktop computer you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to install metamask in your browser in order to use xCrypt marketplace You\xe2\x80\x99ll also need to fund your account with Ether in order to purchase an item on xCrypt Many have heard of the new game on the Ethereum blockchain called CryptoKitties Recently this game made several headlines within the cryptocurrency community because of its extremely unique idea and impact it has made on the Ethereum network CryptoKitties is a game in which players can buy sell trade and breed digital cats They can be thought of as \xe2\x80\x9cbreedable Beanie Babies\xe2\x80\x9d in such that each cat is unique in some way This uniqueness makes the CryptoKitties extremely collectible as someone could take interest in the characteristics of several kittens and wish to own many of them But collectibles aren\xe2\x80\x99t limited to digital felines Humans have always had a history of collecting things it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new From physical coins to Pok\xc3\xa9mon cards people love collecting It\xe2\x80\x99s a hobby that forms as a result of a unique interest in scarce items Similar to how the value of a 34 \x0cXCRYPT x commodity is related to its scarcity the value of a collectible item to a collector is connected to its rareness among other items What\xe2\x80\x99s Next Since the birth of CryptoKitties there are now over 100 CryptoKitty variants Blockchain users can now buy sell and trade a myriad of self created digital collectibles from cats to dogs to cartoons While the proliferation of copycats (pun intended) does not show any signs of slowing down there are many other possible uses for ERC 721 Tokens Below we discuss a few of those use cases 4 6 1 GAMING Many companies followed CryptoKitties into the blockchain game technology New basic games are popping up around other digital collectibles such as trading cards which allow the movement of physical collectibles into the virtual space These games and other CryptoKitty adaptations prove ERC 721\xe2\x80\x99s utility in basic gameplay But now there is room to see if the ERC 721 standard can be utilized on more sophisticated gaming platforms Some smaller gaming companies recently started to create more comprehensive games and universes with ERC 721 however the big gaming companies have yet to include this technology on their platforms Nonetheless we can see the potential opportunity to grow new gaming universes and expand or extend existing franchises utilizing ERC 721 Tokens 4 6 2 AUTHENTICATION One of the touted promises of blockchain technology is the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s ability to ensure product authenticity With ERC 721 Tokens in conjunction with a blockchain users can help prove non fungible product authenticity For example if an art gallery owner encoded an ERC 721 Token into each gallery painting the token could track everything from the painting\xe2\x80\x99s original artist to its current owner As a result the token allowed artists to easily copyright their works Simultaneously it ensured buyers the authenticity of their products ERC 721 is thus useful to both individuals who want to protect their intellectual property and to individuals concerned about product authenticity 4 6 3 SOCIAL NETWORKS ERC 721 Tokens allow for the creation of unique avatars but at present there is no way for these avatars to interact aside from breeding Including a social interaction layer could dramatically increase the usability of the avatars and help enhance the growth of the ecosystem in which the avatars reside 35 \x0cXCRYPT x 4 6 4 MOVING FORWARD We are at the forefront of not only a CryptoKitty revolution but also a ERC 721 revolution Yes ERC 721 offers application developers the ability to create fun cute games But like other uses of blockchain technology ERC 721 offers an opportunity to find solutions to complex real world problems As we push forward into the ERC 721 space we must be cognizant of the endless possible use cases for this new token standard We believe the future is bright for ERC 721 Tokens and we look forward to helping companies thrive utilizing this token standard 4 7 XCT TOKEN ECONOMICS 1 XCT Token is a Utility Token Standard ERC20 2 Its platform has several functionalities for both the user and the partner 3 XCT

SYSTEM We created a method for giving benefits to our XCT HOLDERS improving the whole ecosystem in general bringing revenues to our exchange and adding value to our community and token holders ERC20 ICOs usually have 3 problems 1 During the fundraising in the ICO phase investors are often difficult to find and access to actual investors pools is arduous 2 The visibility in the exchange before the listing starts Tokens often lose value once they\xe2\x80\x99re listed due to lack of communication about the intrinsic added value to investors 3 Too often the token holders don\xe2\x80\x99t have actual advantages in owning them Our solution We have successfully experimented an equation which created a point based rank connected to an airdrop method to incentivize the token holders to keep tokens on the exchange This valorizes a reservation system which brings value to our partner ICO X = (A + B + C) * Z X= Position in the general rank following a partner ICO\xe2\x80\x99s token airdrop distribution 5 groups of XCT holders have been identified (The value of this parameter is going to be expressed with A in the equation) We identified 3 account types (The value of this parameter is going to be expressed with B in the equation) 39 \x0cXCRYPT x 1 Prime 3 tokens 2 Gold 2 tokens 3 Silver 1 token We created a modality to shape the RC (reservation contract) before the listing phase of a given partner ICO This contract rewards the exchange users with a growth in the xCrypt rank and gives a classic ICO bonus which is listed on our exchange after (The value of this parameter is going to be expressed with C in the equation) The BTC value traded during the month is very important (The value of this parameter is denoted by Z in the equation) 4 9 1 AIDROP RANKING SYSTEM WORKFLOW 40
