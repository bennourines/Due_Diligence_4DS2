b Mero Currency (MRO) The First Low Burn Rate Deflationary Token Whitepaper v1 1 \x0cIntroduction Mero Currency (MRO) is a community driven decentralized and deflationary crypto token operating on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC 20 standard token) which can be used as a currency a store of value or an investment \xe2\x80\x93 or all three thereof The most salient feature of Mero Currency (MRO) is its optimum burn rate of 0 001% after every transaction on the actual blockchain (centralized exchanges are exempt from this criteria since they run a snapshot of the blockchain instead of accessing it in real time) The feature is hard coded into the contract can\xe2\x80\x99t therefore be modified and automatically sends tokens out of circulation and thus existence persistently increasing the value of the token caused by the continuous reduction in supply The token runs on the extremely secure state of the art Ethereum blockchain which is an established leader in the stable assets and has never been compromised being protected by millions of computers and other computing assets around the world Mero Currency (MRO) has a total supply of 21 000 000 (21 million) and is divisible up to 18 zeroes after decimal point (18 decimal) ensuring great stability and long term use of the asset Mero Currency (MRO) has an open source and verifiable code The transfer fee is low and transfer confirmations happen in less than a minute The token is compatible with all online and offline wallets supporting ERC 20 tokens however it is specifically integrated with Coinomi wallet The token is tradable in multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges The majority of the token would be put into circulation by airdrops and exchange sell orders under specific conditions \x0cDistribution Mechanism To ensure even distribution and true decentralization majority of the available supply (21 000 000 or 21 million) of the Mero Currency ~80% (16 800 000 or 16 8 million) will be distributed through airdrops the rest of the ~20% (4 200 000 or 4 2 million) will be retained by the team for its members and for the promotion/marketing of the currency as well as for listing on exchanges Initially the airdrop will be available to everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to enroll and interact with the Telegram bot or the Google airdrop form complete a few simple tasks to ensure that airdrop occurs fairly and without any unfair advantage to any party Also the token would be airdropped to holders of other deflationary currencies (BOMB ETHPLODE etc) Mero Currency (MRO) would also be distributed through competitions and giveaways to interested cryptocurrency enthusiasts Since this is an open source community driven project we hope for and desire maximum participation and interest from the wider crypto community Further to raise money for exchange listings and airdrop fees costs the team may sell some MRO tokens on the exchanges from time to time Any decision in that regard would be taken in consideration of the best interests of the project and its long term health The token isn\xe2\x80\x99t mineable or stake able all of the supply was instantly created through a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain and only reduction in supply would occur from now The token burn statistics can be viewed directly on the website in real time \x0cStorage Wallet Being an ERC 20 standard token running on Ethereum blockchain Mero Currency (MRO) tokens can be stored on any compatible Ethereum wallet however the team has officially partnered with Coinomi wallet because of their extensive support to new ambitious projects and great features of the platform Coinomi is a multi coin multi asset wallet that supports over hundreds of different crypto assets on different blockchains The wallet is available on Windows Android iOS MacOS and Linux it has been translated to 25 languages and offers FIAT representations in 168 languages with more being added from time to time Since its inception no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked or compromised in any other way The interface is streamlined and user friendly supporting both light and dark modes Coinomi wallets have been created with an emphasis on outstanding security and anonymity further it uses a dynamic fees system to give you the most optimal transaction fee rates every time otherwise you can always manually set fees Funds are cryptographically secured transactional data and IP addresses are hidden from prying eyes so nobody can link you to the funds There\xe2\x80\x99s no KYC built in so you can access your funds without disclosing your identity The wallet uses Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (BIP 44) logic so that wallets are secure and accessible with one passphrase that you can backup and use to retrieve funds Coinomi wallets come with an inbuilt exchange service provided by Changelly and ShapeShift so you can shift between different assets instantly and privately Also the Binance Decentralized

Coinomi has an excellent FAQ and detailed help section otherwise the friendly customer support is available 24/7 to swiftly address any issue that one might run into \x0cInflation and Circulating Supply Inflation is defined as the \xe2\x80\x9creduction in the purchasing power\xe2\x80\x9d of the currency or \xe2\x80\x9cthe increase in the prices of goods and services\xe2\x80\x9d Generally all FIAT currency depreciates over time and loses value constantly In the traditional financial system the FIAT supply is controlled by the Central Bank which can increase or decrease the supply and similarly manipulate the supply rate also All this usually results in the money declining in worth over a period of time In the absence of an increase in real economic output or growth the higher money supply always causes the prices of goods and services to rise Therefore the same amount of money wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to purchase as much with it than it could some time ago and the same money would purchase even less than it can now in the future Mathematically it is defined by the monetary theory of inflation P=MV/Q Whereas P = Price Level of a Currency M = Monetary Base V = Transactional Velocity or Number of Transactions Q = Quantity of the Resource Assuming the monetary base \xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x9d (the overall underlying value of the crypto asset including those for tokens that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in circulation by virtue of being bound by commitments exchange held reserved for miscellaneous etc use) transactional velocity \xe2\x80\x9cV\xe2\x80\x9d (number of daily transactions or the speed with which tokens change hands) remains same But the quantity of the resource \xe2\x80\x9cQ\xe2\x80\x9d (tokens in circulation) actually decrease as opposed to increasing over time or even remaining same \x0cFixed Total Supply and Inflation Crypto Assets An overwhelming majority of all crypto assets of all kinds are fixed supply assets It means that the total supply of the asset remains same regardless of the coins in circulation Crypto assets derive their value by virtue of their use cases technological state maturity and speculations about their future progress or utility It means that if those parameters change for the worse the price keeps on decreasing also as existing tokens lose value Similarly if those parameters change for the better the assets gain value as a result Unlike traditional FIAT or monetary assets almost all crypto tokens and assets barring few are decentralized that is they aren\xe2\x80\x99t controlled by any central party A fixed total supply signifies neutrality to inflation the assets lose and gain value through other means or by other parameters than the issuance of new shares or tokens Since the logic design and functioning of all crypto assets are written and secured by complex mathematics and cryptographic code it is impossible to issue new shares or tokens (unless there is a provision in the original code or contract) The only way to do it is to do a hard fork and basically issues a new asset with different parameters \x0cReducing Total Supply and Deflation Crypto Assets So if fixed supply crypto assets are inflation neutral that is their value doesn\xe2\x80\x99t increase or decrease by virtue of total or circulating supply only How do you design an asset which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lose its value deflates instead and actually appreciates over time with normal transfer rates and monetary base It\xe2\x80\x99s easy actually you hard code the property of sending a certain amount of tokens to be permanently burned and thus go out of existence forever after every transaction as provided in the original code What you do is specify a certain percent of every transaction\xe2\x80\x99s value to be sent to an irretrievable address afterwards to be permanently inaccessible to anyone therefore causing a reduction in supply Since the address doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any private key associated with it neither it is even possible to generate a key for such address There\xe2\x80\x99s no way to access the tokens anymore for anybody The tokens sent to such address are effectively out of circulation Deflationary tokens are a new advancement in the cryptocurrency arena they have variable burn rates ranging from 1% to as high as 20% Just like other crypto assets they operate on various blockchains and have significantly different code However all of them have a certain burn rate and thus supply reduces after every transfer their total supply also is variable depending on the design and its intended use case Initial deflationary tokens were designed as a financial experiments to study and understand the behavior properties and value of such currencies Because a deflationary currency hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been created before it was necessary to tinker with the parameters before something optimum and practical could be found Mero Currency (MRO) developers actually studied the other assets of similar type and found the burn rates in conjunction with the total supply for most of them too impractical for day to day usage as a currency or a stable asset for wealth parking or a hedge against depreciating assets Most assets are actually starting with very low number of tokens (1M or 2M) and burning fast (1% 2% 5%) which will shorten their lifespan by a considerable margin and render them not of much use for traders and investors looking for something with stability and long lasting life while still appreciating time \x0cComparison between different deflationary Crypto Assets We set out to create an optimum burn deflationary currency with balanced parameters So how do we compare with the competition Below you would find a tabular representation of different deflationary assets complete with their names/ticker codes/total supply/burn rate data Mathematically we would try to determine the number of years remaining before the total supply of each of these assets would be reduced to only 10 000 (10K) from continuous burn Of course higher number of years for any asset would signal a longer lifespan relatively less volatility and stable value On the other hand lower number of years signal a shorter lifespan high volatility and unstable value So how many years can the most popular deflationary assets last if we are running 100 transactions of 1000 tokens each every day for one year before they are reduced to only 10K shares in circulation Mero Currency (MRO) is a result of extensive research in tokenomics financial case studies and effect of deflation over time and careful evaluation of other competitors As a result we have designed a currency which can additionally be used a store of value hedging instrument and as an investment also The mathematical evaluation conclusively proves that compared to all its competitors Mero Currency (MRO) is the most stable long lasting deflationary currency amongst all \x0cThe Way Forward \xe2\x80\x93 Donation Module Crypto assets and blockchain based technologies have come a long way but we feel that the donation widgets area hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen much development So with the aim of increasing use cases for Mero Currency (MRO) and promoting crypto adoption we are developing an open source \xe2\x80\x9cdonation module\xe2\x80\x9d which anyone can add to their websites blog etc with the addition of few lines of code The module will allow anyone to receive donations as an individual or business without any fees or the interference of any third party It will be free private and censorship resistant Mero Currency (MRO) team realizes that this is a niche market which hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been explored or penetrated properly yet We hope to make it feature rich seamlessly deployable and user friendly so mass adoption can occur without the need of much technical knowledge or following complex lengthy procedures The module is in final stages of development and will be released soon to the Mero Community Also we are in talks with other crypto projects to integrate the module on their platform \x0cHyper Deflation \xe2\x80\x93 Super Black Hole ($HOLE) As you begin to get close you\xe2\x80\x99d feel something strange a force pulling on your body If your feet were closer to the event horizon than your head was you\xe2\x80\x99d feel a stretching from head to toe while your sides would get compressed Only a black hole is much much stronger and its tidal forces would stretch and compress you extremely severely the closer you got They would work to pull you into a long thin strand they would effectively turn you into a noodle This is the description of what would happen if you got closer to a black hole from a scientific article Sounds extreme and intense right Yes we thought the same which is why we got the inspiration for our project from a scientific fact Mero Currency (MRO) developers launched a fun project and financial experiment in hyper deflation called Black Hole (HOLE) with an extreme \xe2\x80\x9chighly inflammable\xe2\x80\x9d unique 20% percent burn rate on every transaction We understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s not for the faint hearted but there are adrenaline junkies out there who would try to deal with the extreme scarcity and instability of the token attempt to navigate to safety trying to determine what happens once you get closer to the black hole or in our case what happens when extremely few tokens remains in a very short period of time Apart from being a fun project to work and tinker with it would also provide the data scientists and researchers with the first ever case study of hyper deflationary assets resulting in valuable economic data and the information on how do assets whose supply severely reduces
