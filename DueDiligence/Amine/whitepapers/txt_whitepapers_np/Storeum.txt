Disclaimer White Paper | 1 \x0cExecutive Summary Why What How In finance there is a natural supply and demand that occurs within ecommerce However overtime the supply curve has been growing at an unprecedented rate This is what we commonly reference as inflation The reason STO was created is to have a cryptocurrency used for transactions that is free from tax and fees that can be utilized anywhere in the world without any restrictions Fiat currency is the primary form by which nearly 99% of the population uses to complete transactions or induce trade STO can be used as a primary form of payment not only on the Storeum Marketplace but also integrated to various vendor and supplier websites eCommerce platforms and soon in store to accept STO as a form of payment We believe overtime STO will begin to stabilize being used for millions of transactions on a daily basis Also in this regard STO will become a symbol of value As STO begins to gain adoption within ecommerce we believe the limited supply in nature will provide a reverse effect to our current inflation model Overview STO has several products that are being developed to bring cryptocurrency to ecommerce The primary product of development has been the STO token which is used to facilitate transactions for products goods and services Another product that has been developed is the Storeum Marketplace this is a decentralized platform where users can buy or sell products using STO tokens and other cryptocurrancies like btc and eth Problem One of the biggest and most predominant issues within ecommerce and finance is consumers can\xc3\xadt buy anything for a penny or even a dollar in most cases Many years ago Fiat currency was more valuable and had a limited amount to go around As the years progress we see many individuals not only selling but also buying goods or services while having a difficult time saving (Fiat) money This is solely caused by our current inflation model White Paper | 2 \x0cSolution Our intention is not to replace Fiat currency however we aim to provide a unique approach to creating an ecosystem unattached to the current inflationary model As we all know Fiat

Ebay Amazon WeChat Etsy Taobao and the like In 2016 marketplaces accounted for 44% of the world\xc3\xads $2 44 trillion spent online in 2016 Cryptocurrency wallets are primarily concentrated on mobile

\x0cThese four pivotal forces combine in the global ecommerce marketplace where people can \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Easily become owners of cryptocurrency by selling goods and services Easily spend their cryptocurrency wealth by purchasing real world goods and services The global Storeum Marketplace powered by Ethereum blockchain and the exchange traded STO cryptocurrency enables these endeavors with peer to peer smart contracts for buying and selling goods \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Sellers are interested to receive cryptocurrency for their wares Utility of settlement + Investment vehicle = mass adoption of digital currency Buyers are realizing the cryptocurrency investment gains and purchasing power yet are spared the pain and risks of switching between crypto and fiat currency Smart contracts ensure that transactions are seamless secure enforceable transparent and decentralized The smart contract technology allows the STO Marketplace to ensure safety executability intractability and verifiability of a transaction successfully facilitating peerto peer transactions As regulation concerning acceptance of digital currencies in a B2C arena evolves the marketplace will add business sellers and buyers to its roster The smart contracts will obliviate many existing intermediaries the leeches of value chains The delivery economy facilitates explosive growth in the form of direct manufacturer to consumer transactions allowing for much more attractive pricing for both buyer and seller Make toorder manufacturing becomes a much more relevant business model Some transactions may in the future require additional KYC/AML procedures for execution of smart contracts for certain types of deals involving third party providers (i e delivery companies couriers notaries ) The storeum platform envisions seamless engagement of these parties We pay special attention to ensuring the legitimacy of goods and services sold on the Storeum marketplace We are developing an advanced AI technology to help pre screen seller postings for any potential infringements of reason morality safety and due care White Paper | 6 \x0cProblem Statement And Issues Presently tens of millions of people legitimately own cryptocurrencies Hundreds of millions around the world are aware of cryptocurrencies and would like to obtain them Many view crypto as a means of investment with stunning returns and others seek benefits of seamless digital transactions and new business opportunities afforded by blockchain technology Mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is inevitable and imminent The cause and credit is owed to many trail blazing entrepreneurs and visionaries including the source of our inspiration and object of deepest respect Telegram The moment of mass adoption will definitely come sooner rather than later Consumers need a simple fast and safe means of obtaining digital currency Capitalization of cryptocurrencies fluctuates around $140 billion Yet the governments banks and international payment systems around the world drag their feet in establishing clear rules of regulating crypto transactions to enable law abiding citizens buying and selling physical goods using their digital assets A large portion of $140 billion is ripe for spending conversion into physical assets The goal of our company is to empower consumers around the world to participate in crypto and to enjoy the purchasing power of their crypto investments by creating a Storeum digital marketplace where they can freely and securely buy and sell goods for cryptocurrency Issues Although the e commerce is growing rapidly getting started with selling your goods and services online is a daunting task The business owner has to use his /her resources ineffectively to spend time on the online shop management and to conduct advertising campaigns without assistance What\xe2\x80\x99s worse of small scale producers getting into a global market requires considerable investments at the early stage and further monthly expenses for the maintenance of the online shop operations Besides the manufacture faces bureaucratic difficulties and transaction fees when conducting international payments Few small scale productions can meet that kind of financial demand and be ready to face the risks related to international sales and entering the new markets Small scale producer Issues The main issues addressed by business owners when getting into the international market are as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of twenty four hour multilingual customer support White Paper | 7 \x0cSelling your goods internationally means being able to keep the buyer seller feedback line open at all times in order to be able to assist customers in different time zones and the lack of live customer support makes communication much less effective \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of localization Small scale producers are not able to present the translation of product descriptions and features taking into consideration the specificity of various countries which renders the launch to the international market impossible \xe2\x80\xa2 High fees at the existing platforms and various charges of payment systems The existing platforms withhold a considerable part of the cost let alone payment system and conversion charges transaction fees and taxes \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of customer\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in an unknown seller The customer prefers verified sellers who offer goods of confirmed quality while the unknown sellers with no reputation have to compete with them \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of proper online sales pitch for items Each purchase especially the one made online is based on many parameters The lack of the product description parameters good quality photos video overviews and customer reviews negatively impact sales \xe2\x80\xa2 Impossibility of automatization In addition to the all of the above issues the small scale manufacture owner is not ready technologically to make the online store completely automatic \xe2\x80\xa2 Competition with global corporations International corporations have a wide range of tools for marketing high quality goods across the globe at their disposal which small scale productions do not have access to making it impossible for them to go global \xe2\x80\xa2 Cash deficiency Businesses receive money from sales only after a certain delay and increasing sales without factoring this into the equation will sooner or later prove to be an impossible task \xe2\x80\xa2 Online shop customer issues On the other hand the list of issues related to the buyer\xc3\xads experience with small scale producers is also quite long \xe2\x80\xa2 Goods search A great deal of unique goods made by small scale producers have no adequate descriptions or photos which hampers the search of the desired product Besides many good quality items of small scale production cannot be ordered online at all White Paper | 8 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of proper online sales pitch Because of the lack of skillful presentation materials the customer cannot get a full overview of a product and as a result declines the purchase \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of reliable reviews Without any way to confirm the authenticity of reviews posted on custom made sites of online stores customers are unable to form a true to life impression about the product \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of guarantees Many online stores offer goods on an upfront fee basis but not all customers are ready to risk sending money to an unfamiliar online shop which can turn out to be a short lived website White Paper | 9 \x0cBlockchain Solutions What Are Smart Contracts Smart contracts are one of the key features of the Ethereum blockchain although they are not limited to that platform Smart contracts act as self fulfilling contracts That is their code contains all the rules and information needed to complete the contract without outside interference The famous analog equivalent is a vending machine A user inputs the correct number sequence along with change into a vending machine and the machine automatically checks that the correct information has been inputted before releasing the desired item In the same way blockchain smart contracts can be digitally created between a buyer and a seller and only executed when the built in rules of the contract are satisfied This eliminates much of the hassle of using a mediating agency like a physical store or an online retailer\xc3\xads back end system to conduct trades Disputes between buyers and sellers are either handled automatically via the smart contract\xc3\xads failure or referred to Storeum mediation team for resolution Storeum uses an ultra secure Ethereum smart contract escrow solution to ensure the safety and security of both parties when transacting The STO Solution for both buyers and sellers The STO Platform offers a practical solution to the problems outlined above as well as the potential to become the practical heart of e commerce and cryptocurrency combined It strives to reward shopping with cryptocurrency by exposing the common person to the STO token The key focus of STO

Solutions for sellers \xe2\x80\xa2 Low entry We offer an efficient simple and low cost set of tools with a clear interface loyal client base all to make your goods available internationally \xe2\x80\xa2 The possibility of entering the international market of consumables Small scale manufactures may undergo significant structural changes in consequence of growing amount of orders and margin Higher workload of the basic infrastructure will increase their profitability and allow to expand the production and develop the company They will also get a competitive advantage in those

often than not readers put their trust in reviews test drives reviewer articles and opinions of those who already owned and tried the item they want to buy Solutions for buyers \xe2\x80\xa2 Guaranteed quality We assume the responsibility of ensuring high quality service and guarantee that the seller will send the buyer the exact item as described and outlined in the product description \xe2\x80\xa2 Safe and secure smart contract deals When a transaction has been made the seller can be sure that the buyer will receive their item(s) when and only when the it arrives at the destination At the very moment that the seller sends the package the buyer receives a tracking code which will allow them to track their order real time The smart contract ensures that the money goes to the seller\xc3\xads account only after the item has reached its destination Failing that the buyer will be eligible for a refund within 20 days* \xe2\x80\xa2 Honest reviews The smart contract records the interaction between the buyer and the seller ensuring all reviews come from people who actually bought the item \xe2\x80\xa2 Buying what you need from anywhere in the world Our platform will host millions of unique tailor made items created by smallscale manufacturers that you will not be able to buy in any large scale online store Any item can be bought for cryptocurrency or STO tokens with minimal fees while realworld currencies still remain relevant and valid White Paper | 11 \x0cMarket Opportunity Overview By definition Commerce normally refers to the macroeconomic purchase and sale of goods and services by large organizations at scale The sale or purchase of a single item by a consumer is defined as a transaction while commerce refers to all transactions related to the purchase and sale of that item in an economy Most commerce is conducted internationally and represents the buying and selling of goods between nations The STO token can be used for both eCommerce platforms and in Traditional Brick & Mortar Commerce Our primary focus will be on the advancement of both eCommerce and Traditional Commerce There is a huge demand for both vendors and consumers to save on each transaction that is conducted in store or online About 90% of all transaction costs are passed onto the vendor with the consumer unaware of the extra cost running an online or in store business These transaction fees are relatively small at 1 3 5% per transaction However running an in store business or eCommerce site that is producing more than 100k a month can run a yearly cost of about $10 000 $42 000 just to accept payment for services or products sold online or in store This extra expense could be used to grow the company or organization faster hire more workers pay for rent marketing & advertising etc As we further break down earnings year after year based on inflation the company should expect a 10% yearly growth to stay in business Otherwise the business could be at risk of running out of capital Take a moment to review the differences between Traditional Commerce & eCommerce below According to eMarketer global eCommerce retail sales will grow at a robust CAGR of 19% from US$1 3 trillion in 2014 to US$4 5 trillion in 2021 showing a threefold increase in online revenue White Paper | 12 \x0cThis growth is being driven by a considerable rise in online sales over total global retail businessto consumer (B2C) sales increasing from 7 4% in 2015 to 15 5% in 2021 International online marketplaces like Alibaba Amazon eBay and Rakuten accounted for 50% of global online retail sales in 2017 this share is forecasted to grow to about two thirds by 2022\xcf\x80 Internet Retailer reported that in 2017 the top 75 marketplaces accounted for more than 90% of global marketplace sales with 35 out of these 75 being launched between 2010 2015 Consumer behaviour is driving this trend 64% of the respondents in a global Amazon and Pymnts com survey stated that they begin product searches at marketplaces citing product variety and price as motivators Retail eCommerce growth is also driven by a growing number of niche or more narrowly focused vertical Differences Between Traditional Commerce & eCommerce White Paper | 13 \x0cAs we can see from the diagram above there are some huge benefits to running an eCommerce business opposed to having an in store or Traditional Commerce business On the other hand eCommerce businesses are not free from day to day struggles and still require some finesse to acquire customers or to get what is called the \xc3\xacflywheel\xc3\xae to start naturally There are plenty of extremely successful eCommerce platforms we can learn from For example Amazon eBay Catch MyDeal Etsy Alibaba GraysOnline Tmall JD com are industry leaders All of these eCommerce platforms and Marketplaces have several things in common however the most important thing that each of these organizations share is they are all consumer obsessed This obsession drives their development further and provides a continued advancement of services Above we can see the worldwide eCommerce revenue on average per shopper online marketplaces like Airbnb Uber Etsy and Wish This growth driver is more prominent in Asia and Europe where language and cultural nuances play a major role in consumer buying behaviour and ability to penetrate the market Online business to business (B2B) distribution is driving global eCommerce to even greater heights In 2017 global B2B sales hit US$7 7 trillion in revenue4 dwarfing B2C sales with a 234 8% difference in market size The gap in market size remains high at 208% in 2020F as Frost & Sullivan projected that B2B eCommerce will hit $12 trillion in sales worldwide by 2020 White Paper | 14
