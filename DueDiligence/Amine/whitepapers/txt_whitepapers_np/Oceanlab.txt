b WHI TEPAPER WRI TTENANDPREPAREDBY FABRI CEDI STEFANO \x0cThank you for taking the time to read our whitepaper We hope that the information presented here will allow you to understand our potential as a team as an investment tool and last but not least as a powerful addition which will greatly benefit us all as well as the Waves\xe2\x80\x99 ecosystem Enjoy our first prototype https //gravit ws The problem A blockchain is not a transfer of value between A and B anymore it can do things which are a lot more complex From the already available token creations(CAT) to the future smart contracts the Waves platform is building the strongest link between the blockchain and real world applications companies and individuals There\xe2\x80\x99s now more exploitable data available inside the blockchain than ever and also a lot of related external data as most of the tokens and transactions are connected to actual projects This amount of data however is very hard to read and even harder to analyze The solution Oceanlab will act as the missing link between transactions and people you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to read the blockchain as if you were reading a newspaper accessing information related to trading new uses of the blockchain new technologies projects without browsing through an enormous amount of data Information is one of the most precious asset from this era and our aim is to master it to be able to provide it to anyone the way it is needed We\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of creating the technology able to gather and process an enormous ever growing amount of data and we plan to make the tools to make that technology available to everyone But also\xe2\x80\xa6 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking deeply into Waves ever growing capabilities to invent new features and application fields for the Waves blockchain our lab is already working on several projects unavailable to any other existing platform and some of our tests are already succeeding Blockchain mass adoption is a slow process and our lab will contribute to it by acting as a technical incubator for european projects imagining new use cases and helping the best ideas become a reality 1 \x0cWho is behind Oceanlab We\xe2\x80\x99re basically a team of two @dibatch is a designer with work experience in gaming websites design and I\xe2\x80\x99m @sphearis a developer who worked mainly in IT as a dev for the Belgian government (education) and as a regional IT manager for one of the biggest transportation company But we\xe2\x80\x99re also surrounded by a team of professionals in trading business management community management and designers who help regularly our projects to become even better than we imagined with an incredible motivation and dedication 2 \x0cWhat is Oceanlab We both fell in love with Waves and blockchain development the platform was awesome simply the one we were looking for (having followed crypto for nearly 2 years) We started by creating a few community oriented projects around the Waves blockchain as well as a set of tools to interact easily with the platform We created the faucet engine which is making thousands of transactions every day an automatically updated token database and a few community/full nodes tools We are now willing to unleash the potential of Waves by creating the most awesome set of tools and innovative uses of the blockchain that Waves deserve There are a lot of great ideas in our notebook but these aren\xe2\x80\x99t just ideas or empty promises we know the logic behind every one of them and we\xe2\x80\x99re able to develop them We have the required technical knowledge (clearly defined development and technical execution plans) the efficiency (the faucet engine for Waves and tokens was made in less than one week starting from scratch and creating the first version of our Dot Net library at the same time) and we have the will to make Waves our next career move we\xe2\x80\x99re also ambitious and determined We\xe2\x80\x99re ready to do whatever it takes to make one of the biggest moves in Blockchain history Our prototype Gravit Gravit is an engine we created allowing us to develop easily and efficiently new websites and features (including some innovative uses unavailable to other blockchains) this engine is used in our first flagship product https //Gravit ws Gravit ws is actually like a blockchain explorer combined with a search engine and a community website Every aspect of it is using some kind of gravit engine features such as in depth information gathering stats generation anonymous and safe user submitted content blockchain authentification and interaction\xe2\x80\xa6 Advanced trading analysis is also planned with the inclusion of the Dex as well as other exchanges data and marketcap You can interact add content asset informations comments or even chat simply by sending tokens with commands to the Gravitbot as attachment You can also create polls and get votes registered into the blockchain All these features provide to users blockchain secured and permanent information as well as a form of identification while remaining anonymous 3 \x0cWhy Gravis is important Gravit will be at first the best community building website around Waves and the most reliable source of information on the blockchain its features will make other blockchain projects notice and realize the vast potential of the Waves platform Having sufficient resources to create Gravit and other related projects at this point will allow Oceanlab to become a key player for the Waves platform and the community will benefit a lot from it as most of our projects will have an open/community version free for personal or asset creator use What are the first gravit ws features \xe2\x80\xa2 Blockchain explorer/search engine for

Creation of an open blockchain makerspace where new devices will be designed and ideas put into application The Lab will evolve with research and development in automation AI and machine learning linking the blockchain to real life (smart) applications We\xe2\x80\x99ll also start working on our second big project an innovative application of the blockchain for everyone It will be used by communities companies and in every household We don\xe2\x80\x99t release any information about this project right now but we know it will be a game changer for Waves mass adoption of cryptos in general and the use of the blockchain 8 \x0cWhat will be the funds used for We actually both have a day job and we have to work in our free time to develop all these motivating projects It can be hard sometimes even if we really love what we do Especially when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a family behind you as supportive as everyone can be The funds will allow us to be able to spend more time and focus on our projects while being less dependent on our daily income Our personal investment will know a transition phase at first but as soon as the company begins generating revenues we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to dedicate ourselves completely to our projects and research At least 3 of the services we\xe2\x80\x99ll deploy in our first year of operation will generate revenues The funds will also be used to upgrade our current infrastructure (network servers \xe2\x80\xa6) This will greatly improve speed reliability and will make our engine able to evolve at the same rate as the Waves blockchain We have a good work experience in some of the most complex industries and/or public services I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked as a consultant for small companies and we know how to manage our money to make the most of any resource we have that\xe2\x80\x99s already what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing now we\xe2\x80\x99re getting results with almost nothing in our hands We will use the funds with precaution There will be monthly usage limits based on what our infrastructure needs to remain effective our salary and those of future employees as well as sponsoring events and participate in conferences where we can promote our products The funds will also serve as a reserve allowing us to pay for new hardware or services required by our contractors to start developing their projects Our work will switch between contracts and community services building/experiments/innovations around the blockchain We know people are worried about ICO cash outs we don\xe2\x80\x99t plan to do any of that we analyzed our needs correctly for the first few years of operation and evolution and we already planned to work on a very limited budget for at least one year There won\xe2\x80\x99t be any bad surprise on the markets (not from us anyway) We raise money not for ourselves but for our projects we\xe2\x80\x99ll still win a lot in the end by proving who we are 9 \x0cOceanlab\xe2\x80\x99s ICO structure We\xe2\x80\x99ve been following many ICOs from the beginning to the end taking notes about their strategies and analyzing the aspects which helped them succeed or fail The following proposed structure (which could be subject to change) is based on our conclusions and the ones of our advisors We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a fixed amount of 50 000 000 tokens \xe2\x80\xa2 2 500 000 tokens will be kept by us for our internal operations (5%) these won\xe2\x80\x99t be used for \xe2\x80\xa2 500 000 will be used for bounties and events (1%) \xe2\x80\xa2 250 000 (0 5%) will be airdropped to WavesCommunity Tokens holders as a gesture of \xe2\x80\xa2 250 000 (0 5%) will be airdropped to MRT holders as a gesture of appreciation for their \xe2\x80\xa2 The remaining 46 500 000(93%) will be sold in our ICO at least two years and will be released only if needed with a monthly limit of 100 000 per month appreciation for their support as Waves community members support to the Waves network 10 \x0cThe ICO will be planned this way You\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to invest in Oceanlab with any verified token on the Waves platform having a market valuation (You\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to invest in Ripto Bux Euro Ethereum or Waves Community Tokens for example) by sending them to a Waves wallet address which will be revealed when the ICO starts There will be a first day bonus (24hours) of 15% a second day bonus of 10% and a third day bonus of 5% From Day 4 a permanent 5% bonus will be added to people who invest in our project with Waves Price is not fixed and will depend on the amount invested we\xe2\x80\x99ll distribute according to ratio and bonus on the last day 11 \x0cWe have set several funding targets for our ICO Even if the \xe2\x80\x9cBaby Squid\xe2\x80\x9d level already allows us
