to grow faster than that of any large economy in the world over the next decade It is at the cusp of explosive growth in technologies such as mobile internet digital payments cloud computing and IoT driven by large number of internet users As per Ericsson mobility report India\xe2\x80\x99s mobile data traffic is expected to increase by 11 times by 2023 1 34 billion 1 billion citizens with digital Population identity (Aadhaar) 462 million Internet users 800 million (second largest in the world after China) Digital Natives Big Data Boom The Indian economy is witnessing a sea of transformational changes in technology and its adoption The Government is investing heavily in visionary projects to digitize data and make technology a critical part of the Indian economy In addition data generated at an individual level is at an inflection point India with its burgeoning population of more than a billion Internet users in excess of 400 million and Smartphone user base of around 300 million is generating massive data8 4G Data wave created with the entrance of low cost telecom carriers enabled the low income Indian population to join the digital bandwagon allowing a larger chunk of data to be captured giving a better understanding of customers to businesses and government programs Another major driving force is the government\xe2\x80\x99s push towards digitization with initiatives like Digital India that aims to transform the country into a digitally empowered society and the National Optical Fiber Network (NOFN) initiative that aims to connect villages with optical fiber and provide high speed internet connectivity With the entire country planned to be digitally connected the essential foundations are being laid for phenomenal data generation and consumption over the next decade With a median age of 27 years India is already among the top five when it comes to active social media and mobile consumers in the world Big data generated by these fundamental drivers ensure that blockchain powered data protection would establish a booming market estimated around $5 billion9 annually providing abundant opportunities to all the stakeholders operating in the ecosystem \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 7 \x0cBackground What is happening with Big Data According to conservative estimates India\xe2\x80\x99s big data generation is increasing exponentially and is expected to reach 3 Zebibytes per year by 20201 Most of this data is collected and stored by institutions that hold clients\xe2\x80\x99 assets centrally such as banks telecoms insurance companies hospitals governments and more However in recent years public media has repeatedly covered controversial incidents related to privacy and security questioning the current model in which centralized organizations collect and control massive amounts of personal data This model exposes sensitive data to several risks such as Data Leaks Data leaks happen when private data is exposed to public inadvertently \xe2\x80\xa2 Reliance Jio (2017) \xe2\x80\x93 120 million customer data leaked10 \xe2\x80\xa2 Aadhaar (2017) 210 Government websites made confidential information public11 Data Tampering Data of high value assets like land records are prone to tampering As land prices continue to rise scamsters obtain fraudulent documents usually either through touts that operate near government offices or by directly bribing the clerks that prepare these documents As the records are not immutable such changes cannot be traced with conclusive evidence or certainty Another problem with high value information is that majority of Identity and Address proof documents do not have any security marks With fraudsters using highprecision printers and computers to prepare fake replicas determining the documents\ authenticity by naked eye or physical verification is virtually impossible \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 8 \x0cAt the same time the Indian judicial system has some serious inefficiencies burdened by a thirty million case backlog 70% of which pertain to disputes regarding land or property12 Common methods to commit fraud arise from \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Fake Documents Double Mortgages GPA (General Power of Attorney) Selling Government or Encroached Lands Dubious Agreements Data Hacks Another risk of having data stored at one central location is data hacking by malicious hackers from outside the organization Some prominent examples in the recent past \xe2\x80\xa2 Zomato data breach is the sixth biggest in 201713 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Equifax (2017) \xe2\x80\x93 $4 Billion loss in market cap14 Yahoo (2017) $350 million slashed from valuation in deal with Verizon Identities are getting richer so are data thieves At a fundamental level our identities still include our name address credit history work history and a collection of numbers on our driver\xe2\x80\x99s license Aadhaar card (Govt Issued ID) PAN card (Income Tax ID) Passport and Employee or Student ID etc These elements are core to our ability to prove who we are However our identities are getting richer and complex with significant technological innovations such as mobile phones cloud connected applications and proliferation of devices being connected that touch our everyday lives in novel and innovative ways The above infographic shows how data thieves misuse identities Identity thefts cost2 consumers more than $16 billion Identity theft is crime of the new millennium Identity theft is the stealing and use of someone\xe2\x80\x99s personal information primarily for monetary gain Contrary to popular belief the primary cause of identity theft is not that more people are online since these crimes are not limited to online transactions or online banking Rather it is caused by individuals being careless of sensitive information that they share online or offline such as personal details bank or credit card statements telephone bills and not guarding sensitive private information with the care that it deserves \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 9 \x0cIt is estimated that 19 people fall victim to identity theft every minute Identity theft is the largest fraud contributor in India15 Let\xe2\x80\x99s check out few instances 1 Mr X approached a service provider and was asked to submit his photo ID address proof and PAN card as KYC (Know Your Customer) documents Mr X gave his driver\xe2\x80\x99s licence and PAN card in original This is something all of us do in normal course The company representative took out multiple photocopies of each of the documents but submitted only one set to the company retaining the rest The representative started using the remaining photocopies for personal use such as buying a SIM card etc Mr X soon found himself in a big mess as the SIM card was used for illegal activities and the police held him accountable 2 Ms Y gave a copy of her phone bill and PAN card as KYC documents to a travel agent for processing visa application After a few months she applied for a loan And her loan application was rejected on the plea that she was a credit card defaulter She later learnt that the documents were used to obtain credit cards Several transactions were made but the amount was never repaid So her name appeared on the defaulter\xe2\x80\x99s list in the banking records As we can see in both the above cases people entered into simple transactions with known service providers and submitted KYC documents like we normally do However their personal information in plain text was misused and they ended up in a sticky situation Identity theft can have grave sometimes devastating repercussions on its victims ranging from financial loss and damaged credit ratings to the loss of reputation Qualification Frauds In an increasingly competitive job market more candidates tend to embellish or fabricate qualifications or experiences on their resume in the hope of securing a highly contested position Nearly 10% Indians Lie on Their Resumes to Get Jobs 50% of them Submit Fake Documents16 According to a study by Society for Human Resource Management the cost of a bad hire to an organisation could be up to five times the bad hire\ s annual salary There can also be dire consequences such as reputational damage and financial concerns Besides wrong hires could be a potential risk to the company as they get access to confidential data that they can misuse Data Misuse Another looming threat to centrally stored data of consumers is misuse of their sensitive information by organizations who have access to it \xe2\x80\xa2 Airtel Payments Bank License Suspended Airtel Barred from Conducting Aadhaar Based E KYC17 \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 10 \x0cWhat is being done about it And is it working What are Businesses Doing With data breaches on the rise enterprises must constantly develop new strategies and security architecture to safeguard their data assets Failure to stay in front of data threats will inevitably result in further breaches financial losses and tarnished reputations Unfortunately there is no comprehensive enterprise solution to protect customers data from a breach Organizations typically use traditional solutions such as latest anti virus software improved peripherals network and application level security etc However most of these solutions fall short and are unable to provide guaranteed protection against a data breach and subsequent distribution of high value data What are Governments Doing Consumers are often forced to share increasing amount of personal data to complete a transaction and once the data is shared they have little or no control over use of their sensitive information Banning large scale data collection is unlikely to be a realistic option to solve the privacy problem Whether we like it or not the age of big data has already arrived We should find the best way of protecting our privacy while allowing legitimate usage of big data which can make our lives much safer efficient and more productive The present regulatory environment on protection of data is far from ideal In fact some countries do not have rules at all In other cases the various pieces of legislation introduced are incompatible with each other Increased reliance on cloud computing solutions also raise questions about what jurisdictions apply in specific cases Such lack of clarity creates uncertainty for consumers and businesses limits the scope for exchange of information and stifles growth GDPR enforceable from May 2018 Non compliance will cost \xe2\x82\xac20 Million+ In a first the European Parliament adopted the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in April 2016 It carries provisions that require businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states Non compliance could cost companies steep penalties of up to \xe2\x82\xac20 million or 4 percent of global annual turnover whichever is higher India has set up expert committee to draft Data Protection Bill Government of India has set up a committee of experts to study various aspects of data protection and to suggest a data protection bill for India including data sovereignty \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 11 \x0cWill this Help Security Solutions or Data Protection Rules alone cannot solve the problem as they still are created and enforced by humans and are prone to be broken Blockchain technology and distributed ledgers can provide the solution Blockchain has already demonstrated trusted auditable computing in the financial space using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger Blockchain offers a compelling solution to the problem of combining accessibility with privacy and security records can be held securely using end to end encryption and yet openly authenticated Blockchain can enforce privacy and confidentiality rights expected by consumers and regulators while guarding highly sensitive/classified information What is Needed The aggregation of customer data in a single place opens the door for data thieves to make off with all elements of a person\xe2\x80\x99s data in one go This is bound to happen because 100% security is an impossibility It only requires one security lapse in a data aggregating company like Equifax for the data of hundreds of millions of individuals to be stolen in one go This is akin to collecting up all your valuables in one \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d and using a weak lock to secure it The thief\xe2\x80\x99s job is easy now He does not even need to search the whole house It gets even worse for data the valuables are somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s and they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know about it Need of the hour is a holistic solution which uses Technology to enforce the rules without human intervention and provide \xe2\x80\xa2 Protection from malicious insiders tampering with data \xe2\x80\xa2 Security from hackers trying to steal sensitive information \xe2\x80\xa2 Mechanism to get consent of individual for every use of their data None of the systems in the world today can provide a holistic solution of protection of data against tampering by insiders and motivated hackers from outside and provide a robust mechanism of getting consent for every single use of consumer\xe2\x80\x99s data Zebi team has identified this unmet need and designed a blockchain based solution to tap into this multibillion dollar market Zebi\ s Blockchain powered Big Data solution is unique addressing all of the above challenges and helps to keep data hacker proof and tamper proof It utilizes a distributed ledger on the

information which is prone to misuse \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 12 \x0cZebi Blockchain Solution for Big Data Introduction Records have evolved over time initially we had manual paper based records which were difficult to protect synchronize and verify because of the manual efforts required Computers brought automation but digital records are so easy to copy/manipulate and hence still vulnerable to manipulation Blockchain technology promises the perfect blend of high availability yet 100% tamperproof especially in case of high value data As we have seen so far the critical aspects when dealing with high value or sensitive data are Immutability Trusted Verification Consent Security and Privacy Zebi Blockchain solution will address these aspects while enabling legitimate

should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with Zebi the Zebi Blockchain Solution the ZebiCoin and the Zebi Token Sale (each as referred to in the Whitepaper) all information set out in this Whitepaper and the Purchase Agreement prior to any purchase of ZCO If any of such risks and uncertainties develops into actual events the inherent utility of the Zebi Blockchain Solution and the ZCO could be materially and adversely affected Below are some illustrative risks associated with this Zebi Token Sale This list is not meant to be exhaustive as the market and regulatory environment are quickly evolving Zebi Blockchain Solution Utility Risks Security Risk If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to data of our clients or their employees is otherwise obtained our solution may not be perceived as being secure clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution adversely affecting the utility of the Zebi Blockchain solution Our solution involves the collection storage and transmission of clients\xe2\x80\x99 and their employees\xe2\x80\x99 confidential and proprietary information including personal or identifying information as well as financial and payroll data Unauthorized access or security breaches could result in the loss of information and utility litigation indemnity obligations and other liability Blockchain based DaaS Market If the Blockchain based DaaS market develops more slowly than we expect or declines our utility may slow or stall and the Zebi Blockchain Solution could be adversely affected The Blockchain based DaaS market is not as mature as the market for on premise enterprise software and it is uncertain whether Blockchain based DaaS will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance Blockchain based solution volatility Real or perceived errors failures or disruptions in the Zebi products and solutions could adversely affect our customers\xe2\x80\x99 satisfaction with our solutions and/or our industry reputation and The Zebi Blockchain solution utility could be harmed The Zebi products and solutions are very complex and have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors The Zebi products and solutions are often used in connection with large scale computing environments with different operating systems system management software equipment and networking configurations which may cause errors or failures of products or other aspects of the computing environment into which our products are deployed \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd

otherwise refund their holders for whatever reason ZCO\xe2\x80\x99s value upon resale is not and will not be guaranteed including their inherent value Aside from that a resale may be limited by laws and regulations that differ from the laws and regulations applicable to the ZCO holder The resale market for ZCO may not be active Blockchain and Software Processing of Smart Contracts In the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains block production can occur at arbitrary times so there is a risk of untimely performance of smart contracts The holder should be aware of this and consider its probability The Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains may not process a transaction at the exact moment the buyer expects it and the buyer might not receive ZCO on the same day that it completes the necessary action Network Overload The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are subject to congestion when transactions can be lost or delayed Individuals and groups can deliberately congest entire networks trying to gain an advantage Functionality The Zebi Blockchain Solution may become obsolete or lose relevance due to the fast pace of innovations Security Lost Private Keys ZCO may be stored in a digital wallet or other storage requiring a digital key (or combination of keys) The loss of keys associated with a digital wallet or storage will result in the loss of access to their balances Additionally a third party may get access to the private keys from the holder\xe2\x80\x99s wallet or storage and consequently access to the ZCO Tokens they contain Zebi is not liable for the losses that this may entail Zebi Infrastructure Security Hackers or other bad actors may try to intervene in a smart contract or otherwise interfere with aspects of how Zebi functions These may include malware attacks denial of service attacks and other digital disruptions Connection of Open Cryptographic Keys In the event that the ZCO holder does not provide access to connect open cryptographic keys to their account it may cause a third party to incorrectly recognize the holder\xe2\x80\x99s ZCO balance in the Ethereum blockchain while initial balances of a new Zebi blockchain are formed \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 32 \x0cCryptocurrency Wallet Incompatibility A wallet or cryptocurrency storage system used by the holder must be technically compatible with ZCO Failure to use a compatible technology may result in the ZCO holder not gaining access to their ZCO Zebi Development Third Party Dependency In the event that Zebi works with multiple third parties Zebi exerts no control over the actions of the third parties themselves The utility of the Zebi Blockchain solution may be severely hampered if there is a failure on the part of the third parties in performing the tasks agreed upon There is no guarantee that these third parties will do their job properly Development Team Dependency This project exists as the result of effort by the Zebi team who are responsible for maintaining the competitiveness of the ecosystem overall To lose members of the management team (or to fail to attract and retain additional staff) could have a significant adverse impact on Zebi and the Zebi Blockchain solution The competition for staff with relevant experience is high due to the small number of qualified specialists This shortage of personnel seriously affects the ability to attract additional qualified management which may have a significant negative impact on the Zebi Blockchain solution Interest in the Zebi Blockchain solution The success of the Zebi Blockchain solution depends on the continued interest and participation of third parties Their interest cannot be guaranteed Third Party Projects The Zebi Blockchain solution can prompt creation of alternative projects promoted by nonaffiliated third parties Zebi\xe2\x80\x99s Activities Conflict of Interest Zebi\xe2\x80\x99s units may be involved in transactions with affiliated entities Conflicts of interest may arise within Zebi or between Zebi and affiliated parties Transactions with related parties may fail to comply with the arm\xe2\x80\x99s length principle Emerging Markets Zebi (or its units) can operate in the emerging markets countries subject to high risks including significant legal economic and political risks Government Immature Regulatory Framework Developments in regulations around the world may alter the nature of our utility or restrict the use of blockchain assets or the operation of a blockchain network upon which we rely in a \xc2\xa9 Zebi Data Pte Ltd Page | 33 \x0cmanner that adversely affects the Zebi Blockchain solution\xe2\x80\x99s utility As blockchain networks and blockchain assets have grown in popularity and in market size federal state and international agencies have begun to take an interest in and in some cases regulate their use and operation In the case of virtual currencies regulators have created new frameworks or have published guidance as to how existing regulatory frameworks apply to virtual currencies Regulators globally including but not limited to Canada China Australia Brazil India Singapore and South Korea have issued some form of guidance regarding their position on initial coin offerings and token sales Our utility and the use of ZCO could be adversely affected by depending on whether and how a given regulatory agency decides to exert authority over

maintaining or expanding the Zebi Blockchain solution Failure to comply with the applicable laws or orders resulting from the inspections can lead to significant penalties ranging from fines to administrative or criminal prosecution of Zebi\xe2\x80\x99s officials Actions of Public Authorities Sometimes public authorities show a high degree of freedom Under the influence of commercial or
