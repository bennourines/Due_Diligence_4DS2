world today feels like it s becoming more disjointed and uncertain than ever Financial shocks and geopolitical crises become ever more frequent while simultaneously new technology such as the blockchain allows us to peer into a more prosperous and transparent future With all these changes at play we feel that people organizations and governments deserve a currency that hedges against this uncertainty A currency that will have a reliable value in times of crisis and instability This is our vision behind creating Gold Bits Coin It is one that is shared by an increasing number of economists and \xef\xac\x81nancial experts who see the global bene\xef\xac\x81ts of a major currency GBC has many utility features such as paying for goods and services on online shopping platforms and from merchants GBC believes that the acceptance of crypto would only happen if it is possible to use crypto in the real world on a daily basis to purchase goods or services that you require GBC wants to be the \xef\xac\x81rst step in the right direction for the crypto world GBC wants to be the Modern Day Gold of this industry One of the most exciting aspects of Gold Bits Coin is its potential usability as legal tender We believe that cryptocurrencies and governments can not only co exist together but can serve to empower and make the other better and more e\xef\xac\x83cient The implications of this are profound the implementation of GBC as a recognised national currency would provide governments with increased international capital in\xef\xac\x82ows and help eliminate the losses incurred by counterfeit currency 2 What are the Bene\xef\xac\x81ts \xe2\x80\xa2 Governmental Advantages As aforementioned the structure and stability of Gold Bits Coin lends itself towards potential adoption as legal tender for governments Government adoption of digital currencies is something that is becoming more likely as the technology matures and reaches the mainstream5 From a governmental perspective this prospect has two clear advantages Source (https //goldsilver com/blog/if stock market crashes what happens to gold and silver/) 1 See Saidi & Scacciavillani (https //www difc ae/\xef\xac\x81les/9414/5500/9470/DIFC_Economic_Note13 pdf ) 2 See Kenneth Rogo\xef\xac\x80 (http //www nber org/chapters/c13431 pdf) 3 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Increased in\xef\xac\x82ow of international capital Digital currencies allow for transaction costs to be reduced particularly if the currency is accepted in a wide range of places outside of a country s territory In tourist destinations the ease of using digital currencies is likely to encourage tourists to spend more on average This has been the experience in Thailand where bitcoin payments by tourists have become increasingly popular in response to concern about credit card fraud in the country6 The increased acceptance of digital currencies will help boost the economy of the country in question helping create jobs and increase the overall standard of living \xe2\x80\xa2 Reduction of currency counterfeiting One of the major problems with physical currency is that it opens up the possibility of counterfeiting By adopting a digital currency a government could near eliminate this problem and protect the integrity of its currency7 With these advantages in mind it is important to highlight the reasons why Gold Bits Coin is better suited for governments than other digital currencies These advantages can be summarised as followed \xe2\x80\xa2 Gold Bits Coin is open to working with governments on the control of the currency Many cryptocurrencies strongly oppose any government regulation or potential control over them This has led to concern that unregulated digital currencies might decrease state control over tax revenues8 GBC however believes that digital currencies and government need not be adversaries Instead these two parties have shared interests and can work together For a cryptocurrency government backing will allow for mainstream adoption and approval of the currency \xe2\x80\xa2 Gold Bits Coin already has an established value and proven demand As of April 2018 GBC has thousands of token holders and a price of $0 50 USD This is proof that consumers see value in the token This makes it easier for a government to adopt and work alongside than the creation of a new digital currency that is highly likely to come with challenges particularly in the initial release A poorly planned release of a new digital currency may a\xef\xac\x80ect public perception and trust in the coin potentially creating lasting damage to its potential to be adopted by the mainstream This would not be the case with the adoption of Gold Bits Coin 6 https //news bitcoin com/bitcoin

to change it to spending = pro\xef\xac\x81t Make Payment for Online Shopping Make payments using credit card Mr A has $10 in credit card buys a Chocolate for $2 Amount left $8 Make payments using GBC Mr A has $10 in GBC price rose to $12 while sitting Mr A buys the chocolate for $2 Amount left $10 GBC Platform Wallet 6 0 Investments Inside the GBC platform and wallet there will be a section for projects Projects that fit the criteria set out are able to be voted for This will enable the sustainability of GBC and ensure the coin is a leader in the future 5 \x0cPayments 6 1 GBC will be developing a protocol to shift the current ERC 20 token network to a hybrid/native version of the token Ultimately the GBC community will have the \xef\xac\x81nal decision about this potential shift The advantage of this shift is that the cost of transactions on the GBC blockchain would be signi\xef\xac\x81cantly reduced Moving forward GBC expects that the token will be accepted by merchants and e commerce stores allowing token holders to use this on a daily basis Value Generation and Roles in the Network 6 2 Our vision is that the Gold Bits Coin community is active and regularly participates in decisions Accordingly members will be classi\xef\xac\x81ed into tiers according to their activity and work completed by them This will help generate di\xef\xac\x80erent levels of returns and reward members who are more active and contribute more The GBC Foundation will release a detailed list of all the di\xef\xac\x80erent roles in the network and the responsibilities and requirements for each These responsibilities will be unique to the tier status of members as will be explained below in the vesting section An example of this may look like the below Copper 1 User agrees to put 80% of their GBC tokens in lock up for 3 months 2 User receives a 10% upweight in voting for projects 3 User receives copper status perks things like 5% discount at partner commerce sites 4 User receives access to VIP events with Copper perks 5 User votes on a proposal at least once every 3 months that they stay on Copper status 6 User will receive gifts from the foundation at the copper tier An example of this may look like the below GBC had approached Crypto Launch pad for auditing and approval of our token structure and our token economics Crypto Launch pad is a prestigious and recognized crypto auditing \xef\xac\x81rm Crypto Launch pad had given us approval after carefully reviewing our project This ensures our token holders maximum trust and security 6 \x0cSilver 1 User has completed Copper status meeting all the conditions for the 3 months 2 User agrees to put 80% of their GBC tokens in lock up for 1 year (the 3 months of the prior Copper level are counted in this) 3 User receives a 50% upweight in voting for projects 4 User receives Silver status perks things like 10% discount at partner commerce sites 5 User receives access to VIP events with Silver perks 6 User votes on a proposal at least twice every 3 months that they stay on Silver status 7 User will receive gifts from the foundation at the Silver tier Gold 1 User has completed Silver status meeting all the conditions for the 1 year 2 User agrees to put 80% of their GBC tokens in lock up for 3 years (1 year of already counts ) Silver/Copper 3 User receives a 100% up weight in voting for projects 4 User receives VIP Gold status perks things like 20% discount at partner commerce sites 5 User receives access to VIP Gold only events as well as VIP events with Gold perks 6 User votes on a proposal at least 3 times every 3 months that they stay on Gold status 7 User will receive gifts from the foundation at the Gold tier Utility (Discounts to retailers) As discussed in the vesting section members in the network will receive discounts to merchants and e commerce stores if they pay via GBC The incentive structure for merchants is straightforward as they do not pay the percentage costs they would typically pay to payment providers such as Visa or Mastercard As a result they can pass their discount onto customers paying via GBC Additionally if many people pay via GBC and merchants adopt and store GBC this could result in the value of the coin increasing rather than the value of the stored coin depreciating which is a bene\xef\xac\x81t for merchants over time and will likely create a positive cycle of increased value 7 \x0cUtility (Others) The GBC Foundation as an incentive to refer and bring more people into the GBC Community will be creating a Reward System for GBC Users to promote the uptake of the GBC Token and increase overall liquidity The way it would work is when a GBC User refers a person to come and buy GBC as token of our gratitude we would be rewarding that GBC user with rewards such as GBC tokens Access to GBC VIP Events Discount Coupons on Partnering E commerce Platforms Gifts and More Security One of the utmost priorities of GBC is security In order to ensure the platform is secure GBC\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure and smart contract code have been reviewed by some of the top security auditors and bug bounty hunters in the world During the process extensive penetration testing was performed which revealed a number of critical vulnerabilities in the GBC web application API as well as the Smart contract The vulnerabilities included open API calls that allowed an attacker to access user accounts and reveal their internal data The vulnerabilities in the smart contract included Integer over\xef\xac\x82ows which allowed wallet balance manipulation These tests proved fruitful and the \xef\xac\x81xing these errors allowed us to build greater con\xef\xac\x81dence in our infrastructure and security GBC at this point is a highly secure platform with the highest level of security testing having been completed GBC\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure is compliant of the AIC triad which de\xef\xac\x81nes the basis of security Overall we have strict procedures and guidelines to which we have built GBC upon Legal A Gold Bits Coin is a utility token by de\xef\xac\x81nition used to clear payments just like any digital asset currency There are no restrictions to sell GBC to residents of any country unless the law of the country prohibits citizens of that country to buy digital assets of any kind By purchasing Gold Bits Coin you agree that you are in compliance with your local laws on purchasing nonsovereign currency and digital assets You are also liable for ensuring you abide by your local tax and compliance obligations on the gains
