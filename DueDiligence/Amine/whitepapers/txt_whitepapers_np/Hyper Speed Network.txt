distributed data storage P2P transmission consensus mechanisms encryption algorithms and other technologies Its technical features include decentralization whole network information recording low cost high efficiency security and reliability Since the genesis block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3 2009 Bitcoin has been running continuously With 10 years of uninterrupted safe operation Bitcoin has proved the feasibility of the blockchain technology behind it On January 23 2014 Vitalik Buterin the 19 year old founder of Ethereum published Ethereum white paper In 2015 The Economist published an article titled The promise of the blockchain \xe2\x80\x94 The trust machine and introduced the blockchain technology globally In 2017\xe2\x80\x942018 the concept of blockchain broke out Companies and entrepreneurs began to step into blockchain increasingly and blockchain projects showed blowout growth Large enterprises have also begun to enter the area On August 10 2018 Shenzhen China issued the first blockchain electronic invoice the underlying technology for which was provided by Tencent FiT blockchain team On October 10 2018 IBM announced that IBM Food Trust became commercially

of the blockchain industry with the emergence of industry leaders market division refinement and gradual improvement of laws and regulations the blockchain industry landscape will basically take shape in the next three years The role of blockchain in promoting various fields of social economy will emerge rapidly and it will have a wide and profound impact on human life worldwide 3 \x0c2 2 Blockchain Empowers 5G 5G is the basic infrastructure of the future network Blockchain is a new framework for business development Integration of blockchain and 5G is a key research topic for blockchain designers 1 Interconnection of everything brought about by 5G uncovers trillion market opportunities for blockchain At present 99 99% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s trillions of commodities are not connected to blockchain networks One of the reasons is terminal immaturity Many blockchain industry applications relying on IoT terminals cannot be commercialized These include cloud VR/AR Smart Security IoV Smart City Smart Manufacturing UAV Software Defined Wide Area Network + Network Additional Storage (SD WAN + NAS) wireless Mesh products and edge computing modules 5G technology can bring wider coverage more stable licensed frequency bands and more unified standards to the IoT thus providing strong support for IoT based blockchain applications Therefore with the development of high speed 5G communication the IoT big data and AI blockchain will provide stable tracking traceability and distributed P2P transactions for trillions of goods worldwide 2 Blockchain provides data protection for 5G application scenarios 5G era puts forward higher requirements for data protection With the emergence of 5G network speed will be improved greatly and the amount of data will also surge In addition more computing and storage will be performed by smart terminals and edge computing nodes Blockchain technology aims to break the current trust endorsed transactions relying on central institutions and provide technical support for transaction decentralization and information privacy protection history tamper protection and traceability by means of cryptography It is naturally suitable for scenarios with strict data protection requirements 3 Blockchain enables the real P2P value exchange under 5G 4 \x0c5G focuses on distributed scenarios such as IoV remote video surveillance and Smart City Blockchain can be implemented under a framework with distributed deployment There is no need for a centralized agency to confirm the authority since decentralized nodes on blockchain confirm and distribute information This enables P2P value exchange without the need for centralized transfer and commission which greatly improves the efficiency of terminal transactions and reduces transaction cost Such business models as 5G bandwidth leasing new energy meter trading etc are very suitable to realize P2P transactions and value exchange on blockchain 2 3 5G Challenges for Blockchain 5G is based on fiber optic networks is 10 times faster than the current 4G and provides lower latency and larger bandwidth 5G oriented application scenarios usually have technical requirements for high performance and low latency concurrent storage cooperative network and concurrent computing Management of such a complex ecosystem requires improved computing and storage However the blockchain trilemma has become a key bottleneck for its technological development At present consensus transaction processing and data throughput of blockchain cannot meet the needs of complex application scenarios In addition with the continuous emergence of blockchain platforms and more on chain terminals coexistence of multiple blockchain platforms is inevitable Cross chain demand is more urgent in the 5G era 5 \x0c\xe2\x85\xa2 3 HSN\xe2\x80\x99s Solution HSN is the world\xe2\x80\x99s first public chain project focusing on 5G application scenarios In response to the above challenges HSN has put forward the following technical requirements and designed a perfect Blockchain + 5G solution 3 1 Technical Requirements 1 Support of concurrent access of mass devices In order to support big data uploading on terminal devices and edge computing in complex applications HSN needs to be able to process concurrent data generated by mass user devices 2 Support of mass data storage With the increase of transmission bandwidth in 5G networks big data and UHD video applications are able to store data on blockchain HSN needs high storage capacity to meet the complex 5G data access requirements 3 Super high performance In order to realize on chain storage and computing in the 5G era HSN needs to provide ultra high performance including network access data storage sequential computing concurrent computing etc 4 Extremely competitive operating cost With the development of cloud computing cloud storage and blockchain conventional cloud computing companies such as AWS Alibaba Cloud and Azure as well as thirdgeneration blockchain application public chains represented by EOS are continuously reducing the use and operating costs for developers and enterprises HSN needs to design an adaptive operating system on the level of technical framework and economic 6 \x0cmodel allowing users to access the network free of charge allowing developers to release applications free of charge and creating an effective profit model for developers and enterprises 5 Support of new software development processes Agile Development and DevOps Diversification of 5G application requirements and blockchain infrastructure upgrading brings mainstream use of complex scenario applications completely independent of central servers Therefore DApps based on smart contracts should serve the fast iteration of user requirements and the developers\xe2\x80\x99 demand for modern software development operation and maintenance processes such as the popular Agile Development and DevOps 7 \x0c3 2 Overall Architecture To meet the above technical requirements HSN adopts the following architecture DApps DApps | DAI | DDevices Application Level Blockchain | Miner Incentives | Smart Matching HSN Key Management | Computing Management | Storage Management | Smart Contracts | Edge Computing Account Management | RAM Management | Network Management | Super Deduplication | CDN Platform Level Incentive Level PBFT DPoS + PoT (Proof of Telecommunication) Resource Level Traffic Resources | Computing Resources | RAM Resources | Storage Resources Object Level 5G Network | Miner Nodes | HSN Technical Architecture 8 Miner Nodes \x0cHSN provides an integrated distributed accounting system with seamless 5G access which includes a complete distributed deployment architecture smart contract system security system and layered consensus mechanism The system can meet the needs of high throughput and high performance complex decentralized 5G application scenarios and promote the 5G blockchain business ecosystem HSN adopts Miner (PBFT DPoS consensus mechanism) and Edge Node layered consensus mechanism which not only guarantees safe operation of the whole HSN ecosystem but also promotes the flourishing ecology of edge computing and IoT terminals At the same time HSN has encapsulated and abstracted the underlying complex technology system and heterogeneous system realized distributed privacy protection multi dimensional identity authentication and also supports cross chain and side chain interactive mapping HSN innovatively proposes an automatic device authentication technology based on blockchain On the basis of session and feature recognition it realizes automatic device binding request and device authentication via smart contracts and challenge response communication and also supports user level identity binding It protects terminal device information from tampering and provides the most basic terminal equipment authentication for interconnection of all things and edge computing applications In order to meet the demand for high concurrency and network storage in the 5G environment HSN chose IPFS as storage infrastructure IPFS network provides support for dynamic precise and distributed network storage and can better meet the requirements of 5G content distribution network (CDN) Large HSN files are divided into small encrypted blocks which can be downloaded from multiple servers at the same time In the object and file layers most data objects exist in Merkle DAG structure and double hashing is used for deduplication thus flexible support of content addressing and storage deduplication is realized On this basis HSN network provides a series of application frameworks such as distributed data exchange protocol and distributed process management protocol etc Using general API SDK and various functional components of applications HSN network can realize convenient development and deployment and support agile development of Internet products The highly encapsulated HSN distributed accounting architecture and fast storage structure supporting a large number of concurrent processes allows HSN to meet the needs of complex 5G application scenarios 9 \x0c3 3 Deployment Architecture The HSN overall deployment architecture is shown in the figure below 5G network is the infrastructure Miner Nodes are responsible for executing smart contracts and production of blocks Edge Nodes are responsible for distributed computing and storage platforms involving smart terminals they provide big computing and mass storage Distributed ledger is responsible for core processing on and off the blockchain Edge Node Edge Node Phone Smart Fridge Smart Dash Camera Miner Node Tablet Edge Node Smart Light Bulb Edge Node 10 Smart Energy Meter \x0c\xe2\x85\xa3 4 HSN Core Technology 4 1 Miner Nodes HSN optimizes the Miner Node mechanism to better manage tasks of core network and system functions These include running multiple services on a side chain support of 5G module group expansion tracking and measuring of equipment normal running time and arrangement of miner payout schedule Unlike EOS HSN Miner Nodes not only perform smart contracts and produce blocks but also provide storage services for big data of the whole network As the main nodes of IPFS like distributed storage network they ensure the efficient reliable and trusted blockchain network services within the whole HSN network Besides that HSN Miner Nodes also have a device module which can access smart terminals and adapt to video network and other access modes Miner Nodes use PBFT DPoS consensus mechanism responsible for block generation and storage of key data They perform smart contracts and computational tasks of low complexity EDGE NETWORK BP\ S NETWORK BP\ S NETWORK EDGE NETWORK 11 \x0c4 2 Edge Nodes The demand for big computing will bring a heavy load on Miner Nodes After a stress test of the Miner Node mode HSN team found that it is not suitable for complex longterm computing in the interconnected environment Therefore HSN needs Edge Nodes to perform computationally intensive tasks Apart from that in some high response IoT applications cloud response delay leads to low overall efficiency HSN innovatively introduces the Edge Node concept As a vital supplement to Miner Nodes Edge Node mechanism takes over the intensive computing services It helps reduce the response delay and bandwidth cost and helps meet the needs of various smart scenarios under the decentralized architecture model As Edge Nodes are the source of big computing and mass storage resources in the HSN network in the future all terminal devices with certain computing or storage capacity can be Edge Nodes By securing Edge Nodes with Miner Nodes HSN ensures that Edge Nodes can provide efficient reliable and credible blockchain network services for big data storage and ultra high speed smart contract edge computing Time consuming computing is performed by combining the idle computing power and storage capacity of numerous Edge Nodes into a distributed computing and storage platform Edge node usage scenarios include AI applications image processing gene sequencing etc After loading the intensive computing tasks off the cloud to the Edge power consumption of the whole system is reduced by over 40% and time of data integration migration and other operations can be cut by over 90% Edge Nodes use the following algorithm to upload data to blockchain (HSN uses an improved version of Kademlia algorithm for data

joining HSN Edge Node E 1 applies for ID from an HSN Miner Node The nearest Miner Node H 1 selects a free node under from the ID pool and assigns it to the Edge Node (node ID is kept throughout the whole life cycle) 2\xef\xbc\x89After Edge Node E 1 receives id 1 node identifier is calculated Nid 1 = sha3 512 (id1) 3\xef\xbc\x89When E 1 eceives \xe6\x8d\xae Data 1 data storage requirements from a terminal Data 1 is segmented according to its size Assuming node length is L the resulting length after segmentation is expressed as L = \xe2\x88\x91 ni \xc2\xb7 bi \xef\xbc\x88where bi is extracted

\xef\xbc\x9b j 4\xef\xbc\x89According to the HSN token amount paid by user matrix M is selected and redundant data is generated according to M a When user chooses the normal security mode the system generates redundant data in 10% ratio mi = \xe2\x94\x8c ni * 10% \xe2\x94\x90\xef\xbc\x8c(i=0 1) b When user chooses the medium security mode the system generates redundant data in 20% ratio mi =

exists the relevant HSN tokens are deducted and the next piece is processed Otherwise processing under step a starts a Distance between the storage pending node E 1 i and the current node E 1 is 0 \

Bj\ instruction is sent to E 1 i then the next j is processed 0 d If E 1 i node does not survive (the non survivor node is reported to the Miner Node 0 to deduct the relevant HSN reward) the first survivor node is selected for storage in the corresponding k bucket set {E 1 i E 1 i E 1 i } \xef\xbc\x88here it denotes the distance 1 2 k between the storage pending node and the Edge Node 2 i \xe2\x89\xa4 it < 2 i +1 t=1 2 k the maximum value of k is 32 if the value is not found the data will be discarded) 4 3 Layered Consensus Mechanism Consensus mechanism is the technical core of each public chain According to CAP principle consensus mechanism cannot guarantee consistency availability and partition tolerance at the same time We also need to ensure that all honest nodes are consistent and avoid forks For HSN the existence of Edge Nodes makes the consensus algorithm more complex To this end HSN adopts a layered consensus mechanism \xc2\xb7 Miner Nodes are generated by voting produce blocks in turn and are rewarded via via PBFT DPoS mechanism \xc2\xb7 Edge Nodes use Proof of Telecommunication (PoT) Each node is rewarded according according to the communication services it provides Note the communication services are not just storage capacity network traffic or computing power etc but an aggregate of all communication related services \xc2\xb7 In order to ensure the quality of service of Edge Nodes Edge Nodes have to be secured by Miner Nodes through voting and collateralization 4 4 File Encryption & Deduplication In traditional storage networks like cloud disks CDN and even IPFS plaintext file deduplication technology is quite mature It only needs to compare hashes of two files to determine whether the content is the same But in encrypted storage applications the above method failed When two identical files are encrypted with different public keys the generated ciphertext is different There is no way for easy deduplication basing on the ciphertext hash Besides that data storage sharding complicates deduplication even more 15 \x0cciphertext hash Besides that data storage sharding complicates deduplication even more HSN uses asymmetric encryption and Zero knowledge Proof to develop a set of file encryption and deduplication technologies Based on the zero knowledge verification and secondary hashing the functions of secret key and file separation full ownership authentication and secret key transfer without third party are realized It solves the problem of Convergent Encryption (CE) when useless encryption of duplicate data increases computational overhead with the increase of data deduplication ratio Even if different users store the same file on the HSN network at the same time the whole network only needs to keep one encrypted copy of the content while content and privacy leak protection is in place Therefore storage efficiency of the whole network improves 4 4 1 Data Encryption & Deduplication Algorithm a When storing data User A segments the storage pending DataA from big to small (256 M 256 K) (i e files larger than 256 M are divided into 256 M blocks files smaller than 256 M are divided into 256 K files smaller than 256 K are aligned by adding 0) It is assumed that segmentation results are B 1 B 2 B 3 Bn respectively(i e DataA = \xe2\x88\x91 Bi ) Each block hash hi = hash(Bi) is calculated separately b If hi exists in the related table items of the mapping table the corresponding HSN tokens of user A are deducted and at the same time the relationship between hi in the mapping table and NodeE

preprocesses the stored data by dividing a data file into several shards and storing them on different nodes Each node only needs to deal with a small part of the incoming transactions Through parallel processing it can complete a lot of verification work together with other nodes on the network In the HSN network blocking technology is used on multiple levels 1) in the Miner Node network sharding improves TPS and smart contract execution speed 2) in the Edge Node network the computing and storage capacity of the whole network is improved by sharding of the respective resource intensive tasks 4 6 Side Chain Technology Side chain technology can provide transaction efficiency Basing on the HSN parent chain new functions such as privacy protection are also available When users use new services they do not affect the parent chain \xe2\x80\x94 this meets the application needs of different industries in the future 5G era By means of side chain anchoring circulation on more blockchains is achieved Developers can develop different side chains connected to HSN as per business needs Side chain technology further expands the application scope and innovation space of blockchain It allows HSN to support a variety of asset types and create side chain smart contracts to develop DApps 18 \x0c4 7 Key Advantages To sum up HSN has the following key advantages \xc2\xb7
