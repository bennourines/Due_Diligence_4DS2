\x0cINTRODUCTION This white paper describes the structure functionality and features of Crypto One Stop Solution (COSS) a cryptocurrency exchange platform launched by a Singapore company C O S S Pte Ltd in April 2017 At the time of writing the COSS platform is in beta and its primary function is to serve as a cryptocurrency exchange However the conceptual model of COSS is not just confined to a cryptocurrency exchange It also includes the implementation of multiple merchant tools aimed at the massive adoption of cryptocurrencies in the future We will describe these instruments in the chapters devoted to the company\ s roadmap and development throughout 2018 Through its services and merchant tools COSS (a k a COSS IO) intends to improve the overall cryptocurrency user experience COSS aims to build a foundation for a community of cryptocurrency users companies startups traders customers and merchants into a viable market or an ecosystem that will expand with the implementation of new features on COSS IO All of the components mentioned above in combination will provide a stable ground for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency With insufficient user and merchant adoption of cryptocurrencies low transaction volumes and consequently low market prices not enough viable solutions have been provided to make cryptocurrencies user friendly The path from creating a digital wallet to making actual payments in cryptocurrencies is still inconvenient cumbersome and technically challenging When addressed mindfully these barriers can be overcome by using a one stop solution approach A one stop solution implies a single venue or platform designed speci\xef\xac\x81cally to educate users about the variety of tokens on the market help individuals make informed choices and provide multiple possibilities for digital currency use all in the same place All cryptocurrencies listed on COSS are subject to examination by us The primary focus of the COSS platform at this time is to improve the overall cryptocurrency user experience through its services and features and above all its cryptocurrency exchange COSS approaches usability issues related to virtual currencies in an innovative way inspired by disruptive technologies and trends such as blockchain smart contracts DAOs token sales and so on The platform gathers the most popular services and products associated with cryptocurrency into a single outlet COSS allows users to deposit withdraw buy sell and spend cryptocurrency safely and to take advantage of the additional services that are and will be continuously implemented on COSS IO to keep up with the fast paced fintech industry \x0cCOSS PLATFORM OVERVIEW WHAT IS COSS COSS or Crypto One Stop Solution is a platform which encompasses all features of a digital economic system based on cryptocurrency The COSS platform is made up of core elements such as an e wallet a cryptocurrency exchange and a native token Additionally it provides related features and services such as market cap rankings token listings and merchant tools (namely a payment gateway or point of sale) a merchant list and an early version of a cryptocurrency friendly marketplace COSS aims to facilitate the mass adoption of cryptocurrency GOALS The principal purpose of COSS is to o\xef\xac\x80er multiple services associated with the use of cryptocurrency within a single state of the art cryptocurrency platform and exchange The number of potential features possible to implement on COSS is in\xef\xac\x81nite and will continue growing as the platform evolves COSS aims to offer its users a seamless experience when accessing the available cryptocurrency services and products within a single interface COMPONENTS COSS aims to develop solutions to the global needs of the cryptocurrency industry in general and with particular attention to the demands of individual users who intend to manage their assets online The platform focuses on providing individuals with guidelines for a smooth start in the cryptocurrency world The full COSS system comprises multiple interconnected applications that are available to COSS account owners divided into two main types of users regular users and admins (company staff) \x0cThe principal COSS applications are FEATURES The COSS platform currently includes the following features \x0cEXCHANGE The COSS platform has an integrated exchange allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their COSS wallets The exchange back end manages trading pairs dynamically New tokens and trading pairs are continuously added in accordance with the community\ s preferences and with the collaboration of token developers Dynamic fees are set for each cryptocurrency Users can mark specific pairs as favorites For each trading pair the exchange displays the following information the type of currency the daily transaction volume of the chosen cryptocurrency and price increase/decrease over the last 24 hours The COSS exchange runs on a separate independent custom developed trading engine This trading engine communicates with the web server through an internal API The trading order is accomplished automatically based on the available requests on the exchange in real time Every exchange occurs between two parties the maker who places his or her order on the order book before the trade and the taker an individual who places a matching order or accepts the maker\ s order The COSS Exchange o\xef\xac\x80ers both limit and market orders Limit orders are executed automatically only when prices match if prices do not match the limit order may never execute Market orders are executed instantly The chart below summarizes the di\xef\xac\x80erences between limit and market orders Orders can also be partially \xef\xac\x81lled which means that the order amount can be divided into parts and sold to di\xef\xac\x80erent people (e g a sale order of 100 Bitcoin can be split and partially purchased by several buyers willing to buy 25 Bitcoin each) \x0cWALLET Every user on COSS automatically has access to an e wallet which supports multiple cryptocurrencies and FIAT Wallet management functions include viewing balances in each currency making deposits and withdrawals Balances which are currently reserved in limit order on the exchange are also displayed in the wallet although they cannot be withdrawn unless the user cancel their orders \x0cWALLET TYPES COSS stores funds in 3 di\xef\xac\x80erent types of portfolios hot warm and cold wallets Savings owned by COSS account holders are kept in cold wallets while funds that are actively used for transactions are stored in warm wallets adding an extra layer of protection against loss of funds Hot wallets are used mainly for deposits and for temporary storage Hot wallet Hot wallets are stored on the platform in order to be used for deposits These wallets hold funds only for a limited amount of time until the deposit transactions are con\xef\xac\x81rmed Once the blockchain transactions are con\xef\xac\x81rmed the funds are placed into the warm wallets Warm wallet Warm wallets locate on a separate server protected by an enhanced security mechanism \xe2\x80\xa2 All the communication ports except for the blockchain synchronization ones are blocked \xe2\x80\xa2 No user has access to the server directly \xe2\x80\xa2 The wallet\ s password is encrypted etc \xe2\x80\xa2 Only a limited amount of funds can be stored in the warm wallet Cold wallet Cold wallets are stored on air gapped PCs in secure locations These computers have no internet connection and the transactions from the cold wallets are processed manually by our \xef\xac\x81nancial managers The most considerable part of the users\ funds is kept in the cold wallets \x0cKYC/AML For enhanced platform security all COSS account holders are required to complete a Know Your Customer(KYC)/Anti Money Laundering(AML) process Account holders can check their verification

pending approval 5 TECHNOLOGY COSS\xe2\x80\x99 technical department will list the token or ICO dependent on the technical team\xe2\x80\x99s availability and client timelines COSS TOKEN COSS was a 100% self funded project that did not receive any external investments before its April 2017 beta launch It remained privately funded during its first months in operation until the COSS token presale for early investors took place in July 2017 This step was essential for the future development of the project its expansion and the implementation of the new functions and features A presale was followed by a monthlong token swap (ICO) for the COSS token providing opportunities to people who share the COSS vision and believe in the project\ s potential The name of the cryptocurrency as well as its ticker is COSS The COSS token generates an entire cryptocurrency portfolio to its holders derived from cryptocurrency transaction fees within the COSS platform This process is called the COSS TOKEN BASED FEE SPLIT ALLOCATION (FSA) in which transaction fees are split in half by the COSS DAO and distributed equally between COSS and COSS token holders Through this process 50% of all transaction fees generated by the platform are shared among COSS token holders \x0cThe COSS token generates FSA in all cryptocurrencies traded on the platform The amount of the split allocation received by the user is defined by a smart contract based on the amount of COSS tokens held The fee split is allocated to COSS token holders\ dashboard on a weekly basis Users can choose to distribute to their personal wallets at will or allow it to accumulate on the exchange Funds are generated by exchange transaction fees The platform generates the fee split from the following sources \x0cCOSS DAO A DAO is a computer program run by a peer to peer network in which the governance and decision making are prescribed by the code or the pre programmed set of smart contracts DAOs operate autonomously without human involvement meaning that the code can provide direct real time control of the DAO and the funds stored on it Due to its decentralized governance DAOs have no central point of failure representing a new generation of organizations and businesses that will evolve into Decentralized Autonomous Corporations or Companies (DAC) COSS DAO enables token holders to receive FSA from the COSS system on a weekly basis due to a smart contract governing the process \x0cARCHITECTURE The technologies underlying the COSS system comply with the latest software development requirements With a combination of the best frameworks at hand COSS aligns with the most recent technology standards To manage client communications we use the NGINX application to create the web proxy server The advantages of NGINX such as managing multiple connections compatibility with a diverse range of protocols and advanced load balancing underlie our choice to use the application The web proxy server communicates with front end applications based on Angular2 VueJS and NodeJS The communication is carried out via the HTTP2 protocol and WebSockets The Service Layer manages the SSO (Single Sign On) 2FA (2 Factor Authentication) the messaging system (email service) user pro\xef\xac\x81les merchant pro\xef\xac\x81les wallets and the exchange This layer communicates with a back o\xef\xac\x83ce web application (through HTTP2 and WebSockets) the wallets (through Remote Procedure Calls) and the exchange engine (via TCP and a Message Bus) The exchange engine powered by Node js is a fast single threaded application The back o\xef\xac\x83ce management applications are built using the Bootstrap framework and Node js as they correspond to the latest technology standards and are widely adopted The communication layer between Geth and the front end application is implemented using Node js which uses an event driven non blocking I/O model allowing it to manage communications between the users and the COSS system The Node js application communicates with Geth through IPC (Inter process Communication) memory/pipebased communication between processes on the same machine The Node js application shares the same server with Geth \x0cDEVELOPMENT At COSS we aim to implement new features regularly while we pursue both our longand short term goals for massive cryptocurrency adoption and the overall improvement of the exchange and its functions Our goal for 2018 is to finish building a state of the art cryptocurrency exchange implement FIAT functionality and become fully compliant applicable Singapore government regulations Once the above is achieved we will be focusing on the Payment Gateway/POS system implementation that will take us a step closer to the goal of bringing crypto to the masses That will go hand in hand with reviewing the current Merchant list reopening the merchant application process and building a viable digital marketplace equipped with effective cryptocurrency friendly e commerce tools \x0cFUTURE PROJECTIONS In a fast evolving industry such as fintech early adoption of innovation is essential That is the main focus of COSS Our short term strategy (2018 roadmap) in sum lists the following steps \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f upgrading the existing exchange enhancing the security of the system expanding the team being 100% compliant with government regulations continuously featuring tokens that will add value to the ecosystem expanding our network and customer base introducing FIAT deposits withdrawals and trading Cryptocurrencies have all of the prerequisites to becoming a viable extension for FIAT money over the internet allowing millions of customers including merchants startups businesses charities as well as unbanked individuals to gain access to the most technologically advanced payment methods For this reason we at COSS focus on the entire eco system around cryptocurrencies a borderless digital economic system suitable for cryptocurrency users In the long term the eco system aims to eliminate the challenges faced by the online payment industry via \xe2\x97\x8f offering competitive payment solutions to technology oriented businesses and startups in fintech and related industries \xe2\x97\x8f providing all cryptocurrency related needs in one place \xe2\x97\x8f laying the foundation for a cryptocurrency fueled marketplace The list of potential industries which can bene\xef\xac\x81t from using COSS is in\xef\xac\x81nite Just like the internet which is impossible to shut down the COSS platform represents a \xe2\x80\x98living\xe2\x80\x99 project or \xe2\x80\x98a smart contract with no expiration date\xe2\x80\x99 that can endure many technological and social changes driven and inspired by disruptive innovations \x0c
