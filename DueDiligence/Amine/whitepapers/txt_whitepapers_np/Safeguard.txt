 Preventing Workplace Accidents through Blockchain and AI
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 2 of 31
 Safeguard is an established organization operating at the forefront of safety innovation With
 a strong team and a working product since 2015 Safeguard is now raising €10 000 000 worth
 of NEO to achieve it’s biggest milestone yet developing an open source AI powered accident
 prediction and prevention platform that can make any workspace significantly safer 
 Every day thousands of people are faced with work related injuries and safety threats with
 an estimated 10 fatal accidents per day in the US alone Apart from peoples’ livelihoods and
 health being at stake the costs of workplace injuries are also immense with the EU spending
 an estimated €476 000 000 000 each year despite European working conditions being deemed
 relatively safe In most cases injuries are easily preventable had the safety risk been foreseen
 and intentionally avoided 
 Safeguard’s current crisis communication platform provides a measurable solution to this problem 
 enabling small and large organizations to manage their safety practices at a data driven 
 operational level Some of our current clients include 
 Executive summary
 Looking forward the Blockchain based Safeguard Protocol and its associated ecosystem will act
 as a safety tech platform which others can use and contribute to Hereby organizations and
 developers are empowered to co develop particular use cases and specifications on top of the
 platform’s core functionalities To achieve this the current (licensed) Safeguard Platform is going
 to be converted into an entirely open source ecosystem The Safeguard Token (SGT) forms a
 pivotal part of this ecosystem enabling users with access to the Protocol whilst facilitating the
 incentivization of code contributors 
 The Safeguard Foundation a not for profit organization will oversee the Safeguard Protocol 
 The Foundation serves the purpose of making accident prevention software universally available 
 enabling as many people as possible to benefit from safer work and living spaces The
 Safeguard Foundation is therefore also responsible for growing Safeguard’s use cases beyond
 work safety Ultimately this enables the platform to better facilitate safety in public spaces 
 recreational facilities municipalities and entire communities 
 Safeguard Tokens (SGT) will be sold and distributed through a pre and crowdsale process of
 which the details are laid out in this white paper Safeguard’s market rollout software development
 and financial trajectories are also outlined in this white paper

 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 4 of 31
 Every year all over the world there are more than 370 million non fatal work related injuries
 and illnesses whilst in the USA alone there are an estimated 10 fatal accidents per day Similarly 
 1 in 15 employees in the Netherlands still suffer from workplace injuries each year Not only
 do these injuries and accidents have a vast impact on livelihoods and wellbeing they also weigh
 down heavily on economic productivity and output by an estimated 3 94% of GDP costing the
 EU an estimated €476 000 000 000 each year 
 We aim to radically mitigate this by designing tomorrow’s safety systems today Specifically 
 we’re building a decentralised platform that will be able to predict accidents and injuries preemptively
 and in real time By means of this system we aim to reduce workplace accidents for
 our users by 20% before 2022 
 By means of the Safeguard Protocol a first of its kind open source protocol network for the
 world of safety A decentralised not for profit platform built entirely on the Blockchain the
 Safeguard Protocol aims to facilitate the co development of a universal safety application that
 both organizations and individuals can make use of and build upon 
 In looking at data and AI in the context of safety the potential exists of utilising information
 about a physical environment and predicting the potentially dangerous situations that can unfold
 within the environment With adequate data input (through internet of things technology)
 and predictive modelling practices potentially dangerous situations in any physical environment
 can be flagged enabling future prevention of accidents injuries fatalities or general safety
 threats 
 Building on three years worth of research business and product development on Safeguard 
 and with large existing customer base consisting of organizations such KPN BAM and Ingram
 Micro we’re taking what we’ve built and making it open source In such we’re providing organizations
 and businesses with previously licensed software that can make their working spaces
 considerably safer

 How are we going to do this 
 Why are we doing this 
 Because we believe that in a rapidly shifting world the power over safety systems should be in
 everyone’s hands thereby enabling everybody to benefit from technology that is both accessible
 and affordable In line with the principles of decentralisation transparency and community 
 we’re globalising safety 
 By taking part in the Safeguard Token sale and joining our ecosystem you’ll be supporting the
 development of an unprecedented ecosystem dedicated entirely to making the world a safer
 place 
 This white paper sets out to demonstrate what Safeguard is and how we can facilitate safer
 working environments for everyone 
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 5 of 31
 Whether it be through equipment malfunctioning on site fires or purely through a lapse in
 someone’s concentration we’re all exposed to safety risks and hazards every day of our lives 
 often without even realising it 
 2 Challenges faced in the
 Safety Industry
 Hence with the goal of reducing these risks we took a deep
 look into the role of technology in the context of organizational 
 work related safety We quickly learned that most organizations
 were still making use of simple but often inefficient and outdated
 technology from pagers and handheld radios to white boards
 and manual attendance signs In an era of automation big data
 and optimal efficiency we realised that organizational safety
 could be dramatically improved 
 Furthermore operational management applications often experience
 a high churn rate of users and therefore a low customer retention
 rate The Safeguard app overcomes this challenge in that
 it is able to run on a fully automated basis ensuring that safety
 protocols are met whilst gathering vital data for the client without
 the app needing to be opened or enabled With zero implementation
 costs and a user interface designed to match any level of
 technological capability we’ve got distinct competitive edges that
 have put us ahead in relation to our competitors 
 Having solved many of the above issues with the current Safeguard crisis communication platform 
 we now aim to address the following 
 2 1 Practicality and Ease of Use
 The case often arises where a small business organization or event manager required a temporary
 safety solution like Safeguard’s crisis communication app for a specific use case Once off
 private security and safety services are expensive and safety management applications often
 require long term subscriptions In attempting to avoid these organizations and event managers
 end up with outdated less practical safety mechanisms like pagers and radios 
 The Safeguard Protocol provides a solution to this challenge enabling organizations to connect
 to the Protocol and easily design whatever solution they need without high costs or barriers
 to entry For example the Safeguard platform can be utilised for a period of three days for the
 purpose of an event enabling better safety oversight for event managers without the cost of a
 full scope security and safety service hiring contract The software is available to anyone thereby
 eliminating the need for complex contracts 
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 6 of 31
 2 2 Reactive versus Proactive Safety Management
 As it stands safety management solutions are reactive by design Specifically they are developed
 with a strong focus on responding to accidents and emergencies after they have occurred 
 thereby driving the practices of damage control and crisis mitigation Although this is a crucial
 component of safety management the focus therein does not lie with preventing accidents but
 rather with responding to them 
 The Safeguard Protocol and its AI powered accident prediction platform is pre emptive in terms
 of its design attempting to prevent accidents before they occur With the current data centric
 nature of technical infrastructure the opportunity has arisen for a fundamental shift to occur
 from reactive to proactive preemptive safety systems Safeguard will be at the forefront of this
 shift 
 2 3 High Utility Costs
 Setting up contracts for safety services can be complex challenging and time consuming 
 requiring negotiations on elements of price degree of support uptime as well as other factors 
 With the Safeguard Protocol users can utilise the Safeguard solution themselves and only pay
 (in SGT) for the extent of the software that they use (measured in time and number of users) 
 Implementation set up and support are optional add ons that can be included in their use of
 the Safeguard Protocol 
 2 4 Privacy versus Safety
 In line with new regulations and privacy laws such as Europe’s GDPR framework many businesses
 are left with the challenge of balancing a high standard of safety on the one hand and
 privacy on the other For example if a worker’s presence is registered by name he or she has
 the right to be forgotten Although this is a step forward in promoting the general right to
 privacy it brings about its own organizational and management challenges As will be illustrated
 in this white paper our Protocol’s encryption system will uphold the principle of data privacy
 whilst ensuring the quality of a cutting edge safety system 
 2 5 Centralisation and Monopolies
 As it stands the international safety market is dominated by large multinational corporations
 that sell safety and security services at a global scale Due to their advantage of cost scale
 efficiency and their historical influence within the industry it is difficult for smaller market players
 and startups to enter this sector Often becoming a partner or supplier to such established
 organizations is also extremely difficult as the process of business ‘lobbying’ is often required 
 The Safeguard protocol provides an alternative to this As will be shown in this white paper our
 community driven inherently decentralised Safety tech platform incorporates a new standard
 of accessibility into the world of safety 
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 7 of 31
 Safeguard is an established company startup redefining occupational safety in Europe having
 proved their concept with The Amphia Hospital in the Netherlands as their first client in 2015 
 Through the real time tracking of safety personnel and our emergency response app we have
 been chipping away at traditional non optimal response times for emergency situations Hereby 
 we have been saving organizations vital hours minutes and seconds when they’re most
 needed 
 Additionally we’ve been working with some of Europe’s largest multinationals to enable data 
 driven solutions for occupational safety management From telecommunications leader KPN 
 to property and construction pioneers like the BAM Group and government bodies like RDW 
 our safety solution continues to be adopted by businesses Recognised as a driver of innovation
 in the domain of safety Safeguard has also received government backing in the form of subsidies
 and endorsements In terms of market potential our capacity for scale is extensive 
 Safeguard’s team and operational home is based in the Netherlands With 10 core team members
 and a team of trusted advisors we’re a group marked by the trait of diversity both in skill
 sets and knowledge We have proven experience in the fields of software engineering business
 development growth marketing and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and
 blockchain Hence our team is optimally suited to the ambitious endeavour of making the world
 an all round safer place Furthermore we are supported by experienced advisors in the fields
 of marketing and PR legal finance safety regulations smart contract development and cyber
 security 
 Every great company starts with a vision and ours is to operationalise a data driven approach
 to making workplaces safer for everyone We strongly believe that through the combination of
 decentralisation and artificial intelligence we can foresee and solve the safety challenges that
 people face everyday We thrive on simplicity Through our agile working system and fast paced
 product development workflows we’re moving organizational safety in its entirety away from
 traditional and outdated safety practices to optimal data driven solutions that uphold the value
 of people’s everyday wellbeing 
 As it stands The Safeguard app offers a solution for safety management and crisis communication 
 and has therefore been adopted by various large organizations in Western Europe 
 Specifically we help organizations solve various challenges by means of 
 • Automatic attendance registration based on Wi Fi and geofencing 
 • The possibility to create predefined groups and scenarios ensuring that the right people are
 always alerted during an emergency situation 
 • A reporting function a data hub covering all the aspects of an organization’s safety like the
 exact attendance hours of safety officers This facilitates the closing of organizational “gaps”
 and enables better personnel management shift schedules and ultimately cost saving 
 • The Safeguard Alert function all employees are alerted at once by means of a push notification
 or an SMS 
 • Emergency assistance checklists through which staff and safety personnel are empowered
 with precise information of what to do during an emergency or crisis 
 • A conference call function enabling groups of staff and stakeholders to communicate effectively
 and clearly when managing critical situations

 The world is moving towards ‘smart buildings’ ‘smart homes’ and ‘smart working environments’ 
 Through machine learning and Internet of Things technology different safety tools can intelligently
 communicate with one another From smoke alarms to radios switches sensors and
 other devices the possibilities are virtually endless 
 Safeguard is applying this technology to build pattern recognition and machine learning software
 that deeply understands the root causes of safety breaches and emergency incidents 
 eventually predicting them in real time 
 4 Envisioning a Safer Future
 With the objective of building one foundational
 platform for the entire safety sector we’re co developing
 our envisioned AI system with a range of
 partners and data input providers (Oracles) Based
 on the large quantity of required data for this
 system to effectively fulfill its task the community 
 driven approach to its development will also
 play a pivotal role in bolstering the speed and scale
 of the project Within this development ecosystem 
 the Safeguard Token (SGT) will be used to
 incentivize others to contribute to the Safeguard
 Protocol providing additional input variables to our
 AI platform thereby continuously expanding and
 improving it 
 Regulated by The Safeguard Foundation the Safeguard Protocol offers a decentralised alternative
 to the current Safeguard (crisis communication) platform Operating entirely on a Blockchain
 and employing mechanisms of data encryption and smart contracts this protocol enables
 users to anonymously use the Safeguard Protocol whilst also enabling them to customise it to
 their own specific needs 
 As a driving principle we’re aware of the potential to ‘decentralise’ and thereby democratize the
 world of safety tech putting the power in the hands of everyday consumers and businesses 
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 10 of 31
 With the scalability that Blockchain technology offers in line with its potential for others to
 contribute to and co create with a foundational infrastructure will be built to act as a ‘highway’
 upon which safety tech becomes both universalised and accessible 
 The Safeguard Protocol’s decentralised nature implies that there is no single party who has control
 over the platform in its entirety Rather due to it being open source anyone can contribute
 to the entire ecosystem enabling to add value to the existing platform by developing their own
 Oracles The community will then review the Oracle and if it passes validation the creators of
 the Oracle will be rewarded in SGT whenever the Oracle gets a request Incentivization is therefore
 a fundamental part of the ecosystem’s model fostering a strong community of developers
 that will benefit when contributing to the Safeguard Protocol source code 
 Another key advantage of the Safeguard Protocol is that any organization can utilise it without
 needing to formally purchase licensing from a centralised company This process usually entails
 contractual agreements and other time delaying factors Rather such users can access the Protocol
 and use it in whichever way needed Crucially this means that there are no fixed costs for
 payment structures in place when wanting to use the platform Rather a pay per usage model
 will be in place (for businesses and organizations) managed entirely on the Blockchain and conducted
 in the form of SGT 
 5 The Safeguard Protocol
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 11 of 31
 The Safeguard Foundation is a not for profit organization based in the Netherlands acting as
 the main contributor to the Safeguard Protocol ecosystem Based on the fundamental principle
 of making safety tech accessible to as many as people around the world as possible the Safeguard
 Foundation is entrusted with the mission and tasks of 
 • Open sourcing the current Safeguard Platform 
 • Building the Safeguard protocol in line with a stakeholder and community centric approach 
 • Actively developing its own open source AI models which will also be used as Oracles 
 • Facilitating and advising on the co development of the Safeguard Protocol thereby 
 • engaging with and growing the network of Safeguard’s Oracles 
 • Govern and grow the Safeguard Protocol ecosystem acting as a regulatory figure in determining
 which AI techniques developed by the community are worth adding to the pool of
 Oracle sources 
 • Rewarding community developers with SGT for their contributions to the Protocol platform 
 Through the Safeguard Foundation and its potential to roll the Safeguard Protocol out at a
 global scale the potential exists to extend Safeguard’s accident prevention solution beyond
 the domain of workplace safety In that anyone can contribute to the Safeguard protocol the
 potential exists for users to develop new use cases that are adapted to specific to living spaces 
 municipalities recreational facilities and sports clubs as well as entire neighborhoods and
 communities 
 6 The Safeguard Foundation
 Users
 Figure 3 Overview of the Safeguard Protocol ecosystem 
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 12 of 31
 To achieve our envisioned outcomes we’re building an ecosystem of partnerships and integrations
 with different companies and technology service providers These partnerships are essential 
 especially for the purposes of data and knowledge generation 
 The data input services these companies provide will be called Oracles and will be directly
 linked to the Safeguard Protocol Blockchain platform The Safeguard Foundation will also be developing
 its own open source AI models which can be used as Oracles to build our blockchain
 solution 
 Partnerships have been and will continue to be formed with a broad range of companies which
 are specialized in domains such as AI Big Data and Internet of Things technology To date partnerships
 have already been formed with industry leading data sharing protocols as well as with
 organizations such as Scylla IoTspot Pneuman and Knowingo+

 In a rapidly changing world tangible products and software systems are capable of integrating
 with one another This means that through the linking of safety hardware with intelligent
 software it becomes possible to continuously monitor the safety levels and statistics within a
 given environment More importantly such a combination would enable the prediction of future
 safety levels and scenarios and the effective management of such levels 
 By means of Safeguard Oracles different data sets and predictive modeling algorithms can be
 incorporated into the Safeguard Protocol enabling a broad range of Artificial Intelligence solutions
 that users can request answers from

 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 13 of 31
 An example of a predictive modelling use case would be 
 At a construction site a AI prediction model would be able to source data from different pieces
 of industrial equipment (such as motion sensors on a crane) and cross reference such data
 with live data relating to the weather GPS location and time of day This would occur by means
 of API integrations and partnerships Assuming extreme weather conditions and through the
 intelligent analysis of such data our system would (in real time) be able to flag the working conditions
 as critically dangerous and potentially disastrous Thus managers and stakeholders are
 empowered to evaluate the situation at hand and make an executive data driven decision on
 the feasibility of continued work 
 Other examples of where a dangerous situation can be predicted preemptively or in real time
 are in the cases of 
 • Chemical spills or accidents
 • Broken or jammed elevators
 • Fires
 • Water overflows or leakages
 • Security breaches
 • Power failures
 • A shortage in staff
 • Poor air quality
 It is important to note that each scenario will be predicted by means of a different unique AI
 model but in line with the same development structure as described above 
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 14 of 31
 8 What about the original
 Separate from its primary use case as outlined above Safeguard Protocol’s open source software
 can be sold in its original ‘licensed’ (centralised) format Based on the principle that developers
 in our community can contribute to and build on the Safeguard Protocol they will also
 be able to sell their variation of the Safeguard platform in a licensed package format to other
 parties This is in line with the acknowledgment that many organizations are not yet ready to
 embrace the principle of decentralisation whilst still wanting to benefit from the Safeguard
 Protocol and ecosystem 
 This will be a commission based license where companies selling Safeguard will have to pay
 a fee (in fiat currency) to the Safeguard Foundation which in turn will be used to improve and
 maintain the ecosystem These ‘centralised’ clients will also be able to make use of the ecosystem’s
 Oracles for a fee 
 Because the Safeguard Foundation is not for profit any excess profits will be reserved for the
 cause of universalising Safety tech and best practices whether it be in the form of disaster aid
 donations or first aid training campaigns 
 Safeguard Platform 
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 15 of 31
 Advances in both network infrastructure and sensor hardware allow for generation of massive
 data streams a process that was previously impossible As it stands many organizations are
 looking to optimize business processes through data whilst also seeking mechanisms for monetizing
 their data streams For example the user experience flow and ‘clickstream’ of a business’s
 website provides thousands of per user generated events that depict customer journeys and
 user behaviours in extensive detail This data stream can then be used to optimize the customer
 journey 
 So far many companies have succeeded in using data to their benefit Although important first
 steps have been made in the movement toward data driven decision making various advances
 can still be made It is at this point where the role of Artificial Intelligence becomes relevant in
 that AI enables masses of data to be interpreted and utilised in a short and efficient manner 
 thereby eliminating the need for manual interventions and inefficiencies The advantages of an
 AI system are generally as follows 
 • More precise interpretations and decisions a computer system has the ability to analyse
 more data in a short time frame leading to a more informed and therefore more precise
 decision 
 • More objective and consistent interpretations and decisions a computer system is able to
 optimize business objectives without distractions or getting tired 
 • Allows for real time data driven decisions where manual interpretations take reasonable
 time a computer system can often derive the same conclusions in sub second 
 • Cheaper than manual labor as salary cost is for most companies the highest cost driver 
 automatization is always preferred 
 The road to the benefits above can be very tedious The following steps should be considered 
 • Data retrieval and storage setting up an infrastructure can be costly and need specific
 knowledge and skills from employees 
 • Data cleaning sensor equipment is never unfailing and therefore any noise should be removed
 for better evaluation of the data Moreover the manual decision making can introduce
 biases that stand in the way of getting to an optimal solution 
 • Feature engineering in order to compare situations with one and other we need to tell a
 system what the basic building blocks of the situations are Simply speaking we need to
 aggregate the data per situation for evaluation 
 • Modelling the core of every AI is a model generated by data itself It creates a mapping
 between features input and desired solution Many techniques are available for this but
 selecting the right one for a specific case is certainly not trivial 
 • Utilisation of model output a service layer is needed in order integrate the decisions of the
 AI into the business process 
 • Evaluation as the world is changing constantly so will the system Some metrics need to be
 defined and monitored in order to know which data sources/techniques can improve it 
 Often businesses are aware of the data that they generate each day but are unaware of the
 steps that can be taken to truly utilise such data to their advantage Through Safeguard’s AI
 system businesses will easily and efficiently be able to reap the benefits of their data

 Data will be stored in S3 Amazon Web Service’s storage system as it offers the best trade off
 between speed and cost It will contain cleaned categorised and pseudonymised data 
 The Model Generation Service (MGS) will pull data from the Database and push its model to
 the Model Evaluator Service as explained in detail below 
 The ‘Real time environment’ is the collective name for all the different integrations we have
 established with our partners They push events to the Safeguard Integrations API which will
 use Kafka for it’s real time data pipeline It will act as an adapter for every different integration 
 thereby making integrations with our API as convenient as possible

 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 17 of 31
 Figure 5 The Model Generation Service (MGS) in detail
 An Online Aggregator Service (OAS) then receives these events and requests a prediction from
 the MES Furthermore the OAS will periodically push data to the Database to be used for
 modeling by the MGS When the OAS receives a prediction from the MES it will forward it to
 our current Safeguard Notification Platform to notify employees about possible dangers in their
 working environment 
 The Model Evaluator Service (MES) evaluates the incoming datastream against the model received
 from the MGS The outcome thereof will be a specific prediction which will be returned
 to the Online Aggregator Service 
 Our entire stack will be based on AWS We will use Spark for data processing and Docker to
 implement our micro service architecture 
 The MGS will start by reading the data from the Database It will then analyse this data filtering
 out any non representative and unneeded information in the process This analysis is needed to
 remove outliers so we can construct a more precise model 
 After the filtering process as outlined above comes the ‘Feature Construction’ stage This process
 builds intermediate features from the original descriptors in a dataset that can be used by
 a Machine Learning algorithm to generate a model We will use encoders like ‘One hot encoder’
 to turn all categorials into real vectors 
 The Machine Learning algorithm can be different for every use case we’re going to predict 
 based on the requirements of that use case For example predicting fires requires a different
 model than predicting equipment induced injuries We will utilise prediction techniques like
 decision trees logistic regressions and deep learning 
 Eventually the models will be pushed to the Model Evaluation Service where they will be saved
 for future use in order to calculate predictions

 10 The Token Model
 The Safeguard Token (SGT) is a NEP 5 based token with various functionalities and is a key
 component of the Safeguard ecosystem NEO enables the automation of digital asset management
 by means of smart contracts More importantly and within a larger context NEO serves
 the purpose of facilitating a societal wide shift toward a “smart economy” built entirely on a
 distributed network thereby allowing SGT to develop and grow in a scalable secure and efficient
 way 
 Our token model is built in such a way that it facilitates the establishment of a micro economy 
 This means that as the number of users within our ecosystem grows our prediction capability
 grows too The overall usability of the Safeguard app and platform will thereby strengthen
 continuously Crucially as the system grows in functionality due to its increasingly optimised
 prediction capability members are further incentivized to contribute to the Protocol and make
 use of SGT 
 Note The Safeguard Tokens are utility tokens that members can use within the ecosystem 
 thereby enabling them to derive value from services provided by the Safeguard platform The
 tokens are not intended for speculation and do not represent company shares or any claim in
 the company’s decision making process Safeguard Tokens are not securities and are thus not
 associated with future revenue streams or values other than those derived from platform usage

 of such transactions include 
 • Creating a checklist
 • Adding a user
 • Sending an alarm
 • Registering presence
 Whitepaper v1 4 2 Page 20 of 31
 Safeguard will establish a pre and crowdsale round of Token Sales in order to provide and
 reward early users of the Safeguard platform with SGT which they can utilise within the Safeguard
 Protocol ecosystem In this section an extensive breakdown of the token sale is provided 
 elucidating the time frame in which certain milestones will unfold and how Safeguard
 intends to use the funds raised during the token sale 
 11 Execution of the Token Sale
 We are raising a total amount of €10 000 000 in NEO through our Token Sale This amount
 includes both the presale and crowd sale rounds Participants in the presale round are selected
 partners private investors and venture capitalists that play an important role in the general
 development of our product and services Such presale participants are obliged to buy in with
 a minimum amount of NEO that will be communicated prior to the presale round Additionally 
 participants in the presale round will receive a 20% bonus 
 The public Token crowdsale will be accessible and simple to buy into enforcing the lowest possible
 minimum buy in The actual rates expressed in NEO will be communicated on the Safeguard
 Token website and Telegram Community 
 Despite our commitment to raising the intended €10 000 000 in NEO a soft cap of
 €2 500 000 in NEO will be imposed 
 The Token Sales will only accept NEO and all unsold tokens left over from the token sale process
 will not be minted

 A maximum amount of 113 400 000 SGT will be minted Because a token cap will be implemented
 from the onset this amount can and will never be increased The token distribution will
 be as follows 
 • No more than 75 297 600 SGT will be minted for the Token Sale in our presale and crowdsale
 rounds combined Therefore 66 4% of the total SGT supply is allocated to participants

 In the token presale an investment of €750 000 will be raised in order to cover the operational
 costs of promoting developing and running the Safeguard crowdsale For whitelisted presale
 investors a minimum investment amount or “buy in” fee of €1 000 in NEO will be in place The
 kick off date for the whitelisting for the presale is scheduled for the 3rd of April 2018 and it
 will run for a two week period or until the cap is reached 
 Additionally a portion of funds will be allocated to the setting up and launching of the second
 stage of the token sale namely the public crowdsale This crowdsale will be accessible to
 everyone and will commence in July 2018 Together the presale and crowdsale will entail the
 selling of 66 4% of all the Safeguard tokens Following the presale of Safeguard Tokens specific
 information concerning the crowd sale such as where and how it can be bought will be made
 publicly available 
 The crowdsale funding will enable a runway for the growth of Safeguard over a long term period
 of 3 to 5 years Starting with the growth of our development team and the improvement of
 Safeguard’s backend architecture we’ll also use the money for developing the Safeguard ecosystem
 and forming new partnerships with relevant organizations and companies Besides our
 need to cover business and development costs reserve funds will also be required to account
 for operational risk intermediation

 An important consideration to take note of is that unlike many other token sale projects Safeguard
 has an existing working product revenue stream and sales cycle Furthermore our outbound
 selling potential and strategy is spread out between a vast number of industry verticals 
 including government healthcare education and the industrial sector According to the European
 Occupational Health and Safety body (OSHA) approximately 10% of all employees in the EU
 and US are emergency responders thereby illustrating the vast nature of our target market and
 potential for growth 
 With this in mind our first roadmap objective is to ensure a smooth conversion from our current
 ‘centralised’ safety management platform into a ‘decentralised’ open source system We
 will work closely with our existing clients in this respect ensuring a transition that is beneficial
 for both current and future Safeguard users 
 Between creating new relationships with potential Safeguard partners and building our Safeguard
 client user base our European business development team will ensure further expansion
 within the European market in the last quarter of 2018 and going into 2019 Simultaneously 
 2019 will see Safeguard executing a market penetration and roll out in the Asian market where
 we have identified a distinct lack of tech driven safety solutions The following year (2020) will
 consist of Safeguard’s expansion into the North American market 
 Most importantly as these milestones and achievements unfold our development team will
 work on further building our decentralised safety solution permitting us to fluidly connect with
 different forms of AI and IoT solutions whilst simultaneously improving the scalability of our
 platform Furthermore this team will be responsible for establishing and experimenting with our
 accident prediction model 
 In terms of our hiring objectives the development team will be grown significantly in both the
 short and long term with a specific emphasis on blockchain developers and Data scientists In
 this respect we have confirmed a partnership with Develandoo a tech talent placement firm in
 order to ensure the fast and efficient upscaling of our development team
