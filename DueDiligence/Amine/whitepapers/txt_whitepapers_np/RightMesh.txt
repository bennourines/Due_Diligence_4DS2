Page |\xe2\x80\x8b 5 \x0cMarch 28 V 5 1 Clarifications of corporate structure DH Abstract At RightMesh AG we have created new technology platform and protocol for connecting users in an ad hoc wireless mesh network and in so doing we are creating new connectivity options and improved outcomes to billions of unconnected users around the world\xe2\x80\x94all while providing a pathway to a new Internet for all The fight for Net Neutrality is real A decentralized mobile mesh networking platform powered by blockchain technology and tokenization can put the power of connectivity back into the hands of the people Core to the platform is an Ethereum account and identity layer that uniquely identifies every mesh node In an off the grid mesh world when linking multiple hotspots and networks together traditional identity methods (IP addresses) will not work adequately The network\xe2\x80\x99s approach to mesh participation and activation solves this problem We believe that when you combine blockchain based technologies token incentivization and wireless mesh networks\xe2\x80\x94you unleash the potential of both technical and economic network effects while making a lasting difference on the world around you We call this the RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 project With RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 the devices people already carry around everyday form the infrastructure This is a software based solution running as a background process on a device that will achieve distributed decentralization that will only continue to strengthen with network density The key principle is that the RightMesh network is self forming self healing and self regulating using whatever it has at its disposal It runs on devices most of the world already uses and can easily afford No additional hardware or infrastructure is required and no longer will people be beholden to ISPs As both a platform and a network RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 enables developers to retrofit existing mobile applications or build new decentralized mesh applications RightMesh AG also intends to introduce a RightMesh utility token or RMESH (alternatively Mesh Token and/or Mesh Coin) that participants in the ecosystem will use to facilitate the purchase and sale of goods and services One example of such a transaction would be an application that empowers a RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 user to sell excess Internet capacity giving those who do not have access to this utility the ability to connect to other meshes (today) or consume general Internet traffic (soon) There will soon be more than 6 billion smartphones1 on the planet and 20 billion IoT devices by 20202 a lot of which will have underutilized connectivity storage and processing capabilities This is the sharing economy flattened by a P2P decentralized revolution And just as companies have shared their homes (Airbnb) and automobiles (Uber and Lyft) RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 will empower users to take control of their device and extract its intrinsic already invested value but without relying on middlemen Another example might be a user who creates a digital good (i e music video apps magic swords or photos) and transmits this to another user for an exchange of RMESH tokens We live in a world that is becoming increasingly digitized and thus the concept of work and value creation has 1 2 IHS Markit Global Smartphone Install Report 2017 January 2017 (Source

while helping emerging economies access content and information that improves their life outcomes Why RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b Why Right Now Connecting the World is the Right Thing to Do As the McKinsey Global Institute pointed out there is a strong correlation between access to the Internet and one\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to wealth creation making possible

3 goods and services for everyone \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x8b Furthermore as Manuel Castells distinguished author and oft cited Professor for Communication Technology and Society at University of Southern California stated \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bThe Internet is the decisive technology of the Information Age as the electrical engine was the vector of technological transformation of the

formats\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d calling out a 2011 study published by Martin Hilbert in Science noting that \xe2\x80\x8b95 percent of all information existing in the planet is digitized and most of it is accessible on the Internet and other 5 computer networks Given the above it should have surprised no one when in June of 2016 the United Nations issued a declaration on the importance of connectivity and that access to the Internet and online freedom is a human right The UN Resolution called on nations to apply \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive human rights based approach when providing and expanding access to the Internet and for the Internet to be open 6 accessible and nurtured \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d Providing global connectivity and access is simply the

barrier to Internet adoption\xe2\x80\xa6 The Internet\xe2\x80\x99s truly revolutionary potential will be unleashed only when the remaining 56 percent are also connected This will create millions of new jobs develop vast new markets and lift millions out of poverty \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x8b The PwC study noted that data prices needed to fall by around 90% below 2016 prices on average to be universally affordable (defined as 500MB costing less than 5% of the monthly 9 income) However PwC concludes universal affordability is \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bchallenging\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d given that margins on data are already negative in many developing countries And that \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9creducing data prices while increasing capacity to deal with ever increasing data demand requires modernized technologies and a rethinking of content distribution \xe2\x80\x9d It is not that this less connected half of the population does not have the potential for access In

costs New smartphones\xe2\x80\x94complete with cameras Wi Fi Bluetooth and an abundance of sensors\xe2\x80\x94provide the possibility for connectivity assuming data costs are reasonable and networks

ubiquitous connectivity extremely low latency and very high speed data transfer Unfortunately forecasts are calling for only 150M subscriptions to 5G networks by the year 2021 and most of these will be in 12 well developed economies Furthermore the GSMA reported that there will be more than 1 billion 13 people in the year 2020 that will still rely on 2G connectivity Piling onto this pessimistic news is the fact that demand for data is increasing With the introduction of new larger screen smartphones and data consuming tablets there is a continuing increase in usage in terms of gigabytes per month per user in all the top tiers of mobile users Global mobile data traffic grew 63 percent in 2016 reaching 7 2 exabytes per month at the end of 14 2016 up from 4 4 exabytes per month at the end of 2015 Unfortunately the laws of physics stipulate that the available spectrum is finite Given all these factors telecom companies globally are faced with investing significantly in new infrastructure while existing revenue streams are eroding just to maintain the status quo This includes upgrading to new networks physical infrastructure deployments as well as purchasing the required

companies various world governments also play the role of the central authority figure (the \xe2\x80\x9cMiddleman\xe2\x80\x9d) governing who can see what on the Internet and who can communicate with whom As evidenced by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and reported by The New York Times a centralized approach to the global networks may mean that someone may always be watching citing a relationship between the US National Security Agency (NSA) and AT&T 21 Furthermore central authorities can always shut networks down fearing threat to an incumbent way of life Many apps stop short at the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Firewall of China\xe2\x80\x9d During times of civil unrest governments appear too eager to dampen communication methods The governments of Egypt Libya and Syria imposed full Internet shutdowns during the Arab Spring in an attempt to quell protests WhatsApp was blocked in Brazil four times in 2016 amid public outcry Twitter was blocked by many countries in the past and continues to be blocked in North Korea China and Iran Viber was shut down in Bangladesh and Zello was blocked in Venezuela both during times of public protests against the ruling governments Before one jumps to the conclusion this is only a problem for emerging markets every natural or manmade disaster (hurricanes floods earthquakes school shootings or others) results in similar network

websites apps and user data users have no means to physically connect with other peers without the infrastructure supplied by ISPs and controlled by the middlemen previously mentioned (notably corporations and governments) While we have gained the ability to control who may possess our data and create apps that operate without centralized infrastructure to manipulate this data in a

working as a single network is sometimes called a mesh cloud Access to this mesh cloud is dependent on the radio nodes working in harmony with each other to create a radio network A mesh network is

following example the RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 project team is currently building an application with the RightMes\xe2\x84\xa2 protocol called DoctorEasy The application came out of a need identified during a Bangladesh Hackathon with the team in December 2017 The application is attempting to solve the problem experienced by tens of millions of Bangladeshi every year In Bangladesh you presently have one doctor that serves about 10 000 people Most community doctors operate out of local Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Chambers located among the neigbourhood in which their patients live The average doctor sees about 100 patients per day To visit a doctor the typical patient has to queue up an average of 3 to 4 hours prior to seeing the physician frequently waiting in crowded un airconditioned germ infested waiting rooms Should patients leave they lose their place in line In this inefficient system they are unable to care for their families grab food/tea or remain at work Within the application we are creating a person can digitally \xe2\x80\x9cline up\xe2\x80\x9d and get alerted across the mesh when it is their turn to see the doctor The patient can get a copy of this application from their doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office Given the close geo proximity that the patients will have to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office and to each other we believe that after just a few weeks the neighbourhood surrounding the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Chambers will have enough density to support the mesh to blanket the community However where network effects come into play is that subsequent applications can leverage the density established by this first application to allow mesh connectivity across the same neigbourhoods Thus a potential messaging app can use the density created by Doctor Easy to increase the likelihood of connectivity between peers Case Study Flare Another product being developed that will use the RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 SDK is Flare\xe2\x80\x94 a mesh enabled application that will act as an \xe2\x80\x9cemergency communications kit\xe2\x80\x9d when all other forms of communication fail Flare is in its final prototype testing phase and is scheduled for public release Q2 2018 The mesh enabled Flare app is intended to serve as a staple in any emergency preparedness kit Just as people stock up on bottled water people can download the Flare app as a backup for communication in case of disruption to phone and Internet service Key features under development include \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Peer to peer text photo audio and location messages Send

to enhance Flare\xe2\x80\x99s utility to help rescue efforts With the autonomous connectivity of the mesh network the drone could fly over affected areas and instantly detect autonomous blast messages

could then return to a base or Internet connected zone to relay the information to rescue workers There is more than one reason for the RightMesh team to develop Flare (other than the obvious humanitarian reasons) It is no secret that mesh networks require density RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 powered Flare will be the first app that will create density by redefining app \xe2\x80\x98users\xe2\x80\x99 in the mesh Traditionally consumer apps measure success and growth in daily active users (DAU) or monthly active users (MAU) With RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 what matters is active \xe2\x80\x98nodes\xe2\x80\x99 meaning devices that have installed our library (and have not uninstalled it) by downloading and initializing a mesh enabled app So a \xe2\x80\x98user\xe2\x80\x99 in our new definition may not actually be actively using the app however with our library installed they can still be an active node by contributing passively as a routing node and can still be reactivated in times of true network disruption These are the \xe2\x80\x98users\xe2\x80\x99 we need to create the density required We in fact hope that people will never use Flare \xe2\x80\x94 meaning we hope they never experience a catastrophe that requires it But our intention is that they also will never uninstall it It will remain on their devices \xe2\x80\x98just in case\xe2\x80\x99 The secondary purpose for the app then is to create \xe2\x80\x98users\xe2\x80\x99 (defined now as \xe2\x80\x98nodes\xe2\x80\x99) to build density Flare will be free and accessible to all Android users as a critical emergency preparedness tool and as a way to build density When it is published Flare will be shared to the community as open source on our \xe2\x80\x8bGitHub\xe2\x80\x8b repository It is our hope that the community will continue to improve upon it localize it into other languages and build variations that adopt the same principles thus bringing this public service tool to the world and helping to spread RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 network density worldwide It is our eventual hope that device manufacturers and launchers will choose to install Flare as a pre installed app We will be pursuing partnerships in this area and we will announce this to the community should any materialize Within our architecture users of the above Doctor Easy application can create community density and with this users of Flare would be able to leverage that density for its own purposes Sharing this common core between applications is unique to RightMesh Additional information on the

applications itself (including messaging app distribution app updating content sharing emergency services and Internet sharing) providing a software development kit to developers allows us to integrate with existing applications (and thus spread the mesh much faster) We also believe one of the barriers to connectivity adoption is the lack of 27 relevant content and applications in the

RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 Apps team will be released as Open Source and published on GitHub Thus a user can take our Flare emergency application by way of example and modify it to work in a different

attempts had required a physical investment in specialized hardware physical routers and switches that were locked in place rather than travelling with the user With RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 density is no longer a constraint RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 uses the growing density of users with smartphones as well as the ever increasing number of IoT sensors to provide 28 the infrastructure wherever users

makes all other infrastructure and hardware technologies complementary to creating a stronger mesh 29 This allows the mesh infrastructure to move and operate where people naturally congregate Note the current distance between nodes is dependent on the technology hardware spectrum being used and environment For reference we anticipate being able to connect nodes when the participants are 80m to 100m

phrase There are many types of mesh networking implementations that exist today At a high level mesh networking solutions could broadly be classified into two categories hardware based and software based solutions It is also beneficial to understand how mesh networking solutions differentiate from \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional networking\xe2\x80\x9d solutions which can also be either hardware based or software based We define \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional networking\xe2\x80\x9d as a connection between two endpoints with at most one wireless hop on each end often covering vast distances through expensive wiring fibre optic cables and using servers in some far away land Mesh networking requires none of that and minimizes the physical distance between the two end points It achieves this by wirelessly connecting across multiple nodes or devices Traditional infrastructure mesh networks minimize the distance to the Internet so we can continue to use our existing methodology Mobile mesh networks find the most appropriate connection(s) between two peers whether that is through other devices infrastructure or some combination of both Figure 7 The competitive landscape for RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b is a software based mesh networking protocol that does not require hardware infrastructure investments The large majority of companies today fall under the hardware based traditional networking quadrant which is dominated by the many players that connect the online world today including network equipment providers telecommunication companies and Internet giants Not surprisingly this is also where the most investment is being made today There are a few dominant technologies that fall under the software based traditional networking space such as Bluetooth and AirDrop Several file transfer applications such as SHAREit which rely on peer to peer Wi Fi connections between two nodes have proven to be immensely

distance As for mesh networking hardware mesh networking solutions have gained a lot of recent attention most notably for Wi Fi routers (e g Meraki Eero Ammbr) that act as \xe2\x80\x9cfixed nodes\xe2\x80\x9d and mobile phone accompaniments (e g goTenna) The software based mobile mesh networking space to which RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 belongs is much more sparse in comparison This is not due to the fact that it has not been thought of seriously In fact many companies have attempted to build mobile mesh networks but with only limited success We firmly believe that in order for mesh networking to be truly impactful it needs to reach mass markets and for that it needs to run on existing devices and OS platforms\xe2\x80\x94without rooting the smartphone Executing a successful token generation event providing the RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 SDK for free to the world\xe2\x80\x99s development community and creating intrinsic incentives for end user adoption will all help the platform and network achieve its potential RightMesh AG also believes that there is a possibility for many projects to co exist and collaborate in this area as different projects could be looking at different technologies (hardware or software different wireless links) while serving different markets (e g broadband WiFi is different from mobile data) And so projects like Althea Ammbr Orchid and goTenna are potentially collaborative projects as they are looking at different technologies To this end RightMesh AGhas launched the Universal Connectivity Alliance (UCA) in conjunction with BlockMesh and Althea This alliance seeks to accelerate the deployment of connectivity to the nearly 4 billion people who do not have internet access today by encouraging collaboration between members investigating interoperability opportunities and conducting academic research RightMesh Security Rightmesh\xe2\x84\xa2 supports end to end encryption using the Open Whisper/Signal library (whispersystems org) The Signal protocol has been implemented by WhatsApp which is said to encrypt the conversations of \xe2\x80\x9cmore than a billion people\xe2\x80\x9d Google\xe2\x80\x99s messaging app called \xe2\x80\x8bAllo\xe2\x80\x8b which features an optional incognito mode also uses the Signal protocol for its end to end encryption For within RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 the Signal library has been modified so that it no longer involves the server portion since that would require Internet access RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 offers two levels of security one where the key is directly exchanged in a single hop (this is the more secure option) the second where the key exchange occurs through the mesh over multiple hops however this method is less secure The team is working on ways to improve this process (e g sending the key across multiple paths split up so that the attacker would need to compromise many devices at the same time) The RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 team is also working on ways to improve the user friendliness of a secure key exchange such as with a 2 dimensional barcode or near field communication (NFC) RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 does not store any keys on any server so any key exchange that occurs

individual mega projects that must be executed with careful planning and consideration We are aware however that unexpected surprises are par for the course in software development and unexpected surprises could pop up that may or may not require us to alter the path we tread For this reason the roadmap should be looked at as a living and breathing document that will be updated as move forward in our implementation plans We believe a roadmap is much more than just posting a few key milestones with approximate quarterly dates An informative roadmap is one that not only lists the key milestones but also explains the strategic direction of the project that will help achieve the vision Our approach is to move towards our goal in six stages\xe2\x80\x94ideation initiation evolution

RightMesh Roadmap 1 Ideation [2015 / 12 months] Goal Understand the problem understand the users and understand the markets The start towards building a mobile mesh networking platform actually goes back to mid 2014 when the Bangladesh based development team of RightMesh AG\xe2\x80\x99s parent company Left created a mobile app prototype (in their own free time) that allowed peer to peer messaging and file sharing amongst themselves without requiring an internet connection What was even more fascinating was the fact that they had built this prototype to address their own problem of slow and unpredictable connectivity They were creating a better and more efficient way of connecting with each other And that was the beginning of this journey Rationalizing that there would be areas similar to Bangladesh that require a better way to connect Left took the first step of developing and launching \xe2\x80\x8ba mobile application called YO \xe2\x80\x8b that allowed direct content sharing between friends and which grew to 1M+ downloads in countries such as Bangladesh Colombia Guatemala India M\xc3\xa9xico and Cuba While YO is different from RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 and did not use our current mesh networking technology it provided tremendous insights into smartphone user behavior in different markets and into the different ways users connect today \xc2\xa92018 \xe2\x80\x93

RightMesh In the year of testing and iterating YO Left went to various markets to talk to people about the app \xe2\x80\x94 end users businesses and institutions \xe2\x80\x94 and interestingly everyone had their own idea of how they could use the application to solve a unique problem they had The team slowly began to understand that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really the application but the underlying technology which allowed users to communicate directly that was extremely valuable The \xe2\x80\x9caha \xe2\x80\x9d moment came soon after in October 2015 when the team realized it needed to build a platform \xe2\x80\x94 a platform that developers could use to integrate mesh networking technology into their own apps in a simple way We also realized that building a platform and a new networking protocol was not easy and that we needed the best technical skills in the world to design a platform like this Fortunately soon after that realization the management team of Left met \xe2\x80\x8bDr Jason Ernst\xe2\x80\x8b a Ph D in Wireless Mesh and Heterogeneous Wireless Networks from the University of Guelph who was incidentally just wrapping up his own venture and looking for his next challenge After a few discussions and a visit to the Left office it did not take much time for Jason to pack his bags and \xc2\xa92018 \xe2\x80\x93 RightMesh AG Version 5 0 FINAL Page

first year of initiation that the \xe2\x80\x8bcore foundation of the mesh networking protocol was designed and built\xe2\x80\x8b The core networking libraries that allowed discovery of nodes and routed messages between nodes were created using Wi Fi as the underlying network link between devices Initial demo apps were created to test the stack and an internal alpha release of the library was released to our apps team in Bangladesh to start creating their own apps It was in August of that same year 2016 that Left started getting immersed in the blockchain and in Ethereum specifically The first entry into Ethereum was actually to solve the problem of determining unique node identities in the mesh network however that eventually led the team down that path of exploring how the blockchain could be used as a platform to provide trust in the network and how tokens could be used as economic incentives for participation And we haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked back since 3 Evolution

experimental apps and test The RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 team is currently in the midst of the evolution stage as we work towards completing the platform features and getting it ready for a public beta release in Q2 2018 At the beginning of this phase Left added some key individuals to the team notably \xe2\x80\x8bDr David (Zehua) Wang\xe2\x80\x8b Chief Micropayments Scientist for the RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 project David has made significant improvements to the routing algorithms of the mesh networking stack and heads up the development of the RMESH token protocol and our port of

the RightMesh\xe2\x84\xa2 project Dr Loiseau joined the company via an acquihire when RightMesh AG acquired the intellectual property for stealth startup PiperChain an off the grid social network for disconnected communities RightMesh AG gained an Advisor from the acquisition (Micha Benoliel formerly of Open Garden and FireChat) and Left gained Dr Loiseau an internationally renowned expert in mesh networks and delay tolerant networking to work on the RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b project Over the past year the platform has grown from a set of libraries to a full fledged developer SDK including a developer portal and associated APIs The SDK was launched into private beta in late 2017 and our apps team has been building initial experimental apps such as \xe2\x80\x8bFlare

token protocols Find token utility fit in developing markets After releasing the public beta version of the SDK the next essential steps will involve necessary refinement of the networking and token protocols post field testing and finding token utility fit for \xc2\xa92018 \xe2\x80\x93 RightMesh AG Version 5 0 FINAL Page |\xe2\x80\x8b 28 \x0cthe platform The intent will be to focus on a few key markets or constrained regions to determine stability and fit on localized mesh apps before growing to further regions As Bangladesh and Canada are home markets to Left which is the parent company of RightMesh AG they are natural markets to start with Some of the main projects that will be part of this stage include Platform Upgrades \xe2\x80\x8bThis entails the deployment and testing of more RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b networks in the field and gathering data and analytics to monitor network performance and token usage Data gathered will be published to the community along with a series of proposals for enhancements and protocol upgrades that will be determined based on community feedback and consensus As refinements are made to both the networking protocol and the token protocol the software should also improve in stability reliability and in its function to scale Token Utility Fit \xe2\x80\x8b Equally important to the technical stability of the platform is ensuring token utility fit\xe2\x80\x8b Similar to product market fit token utility fit ensures the purpose of the RMESH token and the associated token economic models are effective to incentivize and reward participants in the ecosystem \xe2\x80\x94 RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b nodes end users superpeers developers content providers and others \xe2\x80\x94 while encouraging network growth As with the networking protocol token economics will also involve testing gathering data and refinement of the model again based on community consensus Growing the Developer Community \xe2\x80\x8bAdvancement to developer tools and growing the developer ecosystem through community events such as hackathons and meetups will be key to platform adoption The more developers who are brought onto the platform the more localized RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b apps that are made available which in turn will encourage more users to join the network Partnership Development \xe2\x80\x8b While the platform develops and matures it will also be critically important to form strategic partnerships with entities and organizations that can benefit from RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b technology and in turn contribute to the growth and adoption of the network such as \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Apps brands and agencies wanting to reach extend their reach or enter into previously unreachable markets Non profits and NGOs with specific use cases for underserved parts of society Charitable institutions offering mesh enabled smartphones for the unconnected Decentralized and blockchain projects whose success depends on being able to digitally reach previously unconnected users 4 Growth \xe2\x80\x94 [2019\xe2\x80\x932023 / ETA 24\xe2\x80\x9348 months] Goal Global growth of RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b nodes and community networks Once the platform is technically stable to scale and token utility fit has been achieved the next step will be to focus on growth of RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b networks across devices regions and users Growth of the network and ecosystem can be looked at from a few dimensions Evolving New RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b Functions \xe2\x80\x8bThe first RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b networks will be most suited to lightweight communications such as text alerts and low bandwidth applications However with the protocol more stable and with the collaboration of other peer to peer protocols such as IPFS new types of data functions can be built into the network that will allow for richer communication \xc2\xa92018 \xe2\x80\x93 RightMesh AG Version 5 0 FINAL Page |\xe2\x80\x8b 29 \x0cAnother new function is projected to be general purpose internet sharing \xe2\x80\x94 the ability for a user in the mesh network to perform any internet function and not just within the constraints of an app Extending RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b to IoT and Other Devices \xe2\x80\x8bWhile R&D work on porting RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b to other languages devices and platforms will have started in the previous phase this phase will entail taking these developments to the field to test multi device interoperability in RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM networks Growth of Regional Mesh Networks \xe2\x80\x8b In the growth phase mesh networks will begin to form more quickly and be more prevalent at certain \xe2\x80\x98hotspots\xe2\x80\x99 (i e locations of high density) where localized apps will thrive Expanding developer ecosystems to new communities and regions will accelerate the growth of mesh networks in greenfield locations Backward Integration with Decentralized ISPs \xe2\x80\x8bWhile RightMesh AG is initially focused on building mesh networks for the last mile the journey to attain complete decentralization will not be complete unless the source of external networks into RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b is from a decentralized network This could involve RightMesh AG collaborating with like minded projects such as Althea Ammbr Orchid or goTenna to form an interoperability standard publishing an RFC or IETF draft around interoperability or extending the project to introduce superpeers as service providers OEM Partnerships \xe2\x80\x8b We believe integration of the RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b stack at the OEM and smartphone layer will be a vital element towards widespread adoption and growth of the network Partnership efforts will begin early on towards meeting this goal and the hope is that by this time we will have enough analytical data to show adoption of regional RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b networks to be attractive to OEMs 5 Revolution [2024 and beyond] Goal The existence of vast and available decentralized mobile mesh networks \xe2\x80\x94 across all markets and across all devices This stage represents the fulfillment of our vision \xe2\x80\x94 to have an ecosystem of mobile mesh networks thriving across developing and developed regions and across a variety of devices From Smartphones to IoT we believe in a world connected These mesh networks could then be interconnected through the RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b superpeers to form a global mesh network Devices will have autonomous capabilities to perform different functions in the mesh whether that is to relay information through the network negotiate with other devices for collaborative work offer processing power or storage capacity into the network or fetch media or files from IPFS or the decentralized web These devices could include smartphones IoT devices sensors connected vehicles and more In all of these scenarios the token based transactions between devices and entities that represent an exchange of value on the network will automatically be facilitated by the underlying protocols while being completely transparent to the end users It just happens It is this phase that is the most fascinating to us at RightMesh AG because while we are builders we are also dreamers and we love to dream big about future possibilities that seem impossible in today\xe2\x80\x99s world We realize achieving this dream will take years \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps 6 years or more \xe2\x80\x94 But achieving this dream requires incremental and well executed steps that will lead us to the next step Slow and steady will win the race \xc2\xa92018 \xe2\x80\x93 RightMesh AG Version 5 0 FINAL Page |\xe2\x80\x8b 30 \x0cThe RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b Ecosystem Today\xe2\x80\x99s market for mobile applications is imbalanced End users need to pay connectivity fees to telecommunication companies and network providers which could either be expensive or inadequate due to a lack of proper infrastructure With the exception of a few very popular applications most service developers face huge challenges in getting users to discover their apps amid the millions of other applications that exist on app stores controlled by heavyweights Developers who get traction must rely on ad revenue models to cover their costs as a result they tend to focus more on those models instead of the actual services they provide As a result users are subsequently spammed continuously with advertisements to access so called \xe2\x80\x9cfree services\xe2\x80\x9d In this market it is the telecommunication companies network providers and massive internet companies that reap most of the benefits with little benefit for service providers and end users In contrast all participants in the RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b ecosystem have important roles to play to the benefit all participants and in turn each are rewarded for their contribution and the impact they have The ecosystem is largely comprised of network nodes the devices that form the infrastructure the service providers the entities who supply services and content to be used over the network and the end users who utilize the service over a RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b network Figure 11 The RightMesh ecosystem RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b Network Nodes In the RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b

provide critical and valuable functionality/infrastructure to the rest of the devices in the mesh The user can determine (via a configuration panel within any RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b enabled application) whether they would like to sell their Internet participate as a intermediary node or just remain as a client The four key roles within a network are defined below Key Network Nodes (Superpeer Proxy Devices) These key network nodes (\xe2\x80\x9cSuperpeers\xe2\x80\x9d) would be run by RightMesh AG itself app publishers and content creators or others in the community who have fast and reliable connectivity Superpeer proxy devices run either on AWS Google Azure or by community partners with good hardware and fast Internet connections These devices act as proxies and translation units between Internet traffic and RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b data requests They run both RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b and full Ethereum nodes and execute transactions on behalf of RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b devices within the network (until phones advance and become more capable of doing so completely themselves) RightMesh AG will be open sourcing the software that runs the Superpeer network and will encourage others to set up and manage community nodes Superpeers will be rewarded with tokens for all RMESH token transactions that they execute and they will have an opportunity to set pricing for data flow through the Superpeer network Internet Sharing and Seller Nodes (Data Sharing Devices) Data Sharing Devices also known as \xe2\x80\x9cSeller Nodes\xe2\x80\x9d which provide Internet access to the rest of the mesh are the most valuable and should be incentivized the most for providing service into the network This value should be market driven Any device within the network can become an Internet Sharing Node (ISN) A user can configure each device with a minimum price for what the user wants to charge for access It is likely that a user would want to set the minimum to at least what it costs for their own data access It may be possible in the future for RightMesh AG to collaborate with upstream networks in order to have reduced or zero rated traffic Data Requestor and Buying Nodes (Client Devices) Client devices also known as \xe2\x80\x9cBuying Nodes\xe2\x80\x9d including though not limited to smartphones provide no infrastructure functionality They are simply participants in the network consuming or receiving data Within RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b enabled apps client devices can configure according to how much they are willing to spend per MB with limits set for how much should be consumed Fiat pricing information could be presented in this location A client device may also be a local storage endpoint on which data is stored or it may be a content creator creating consumable content and sensor data for use by others within the network or external to the mesh For example a client device could be a Filecoin or Storj storage device In short anything that the client device does to create value can be contributed back into the mesh and consumed by other mesh users A client device does not need data sharing functionality to communicate across the mesh to other local client devices For example a mesh enabled game that allows users on a commuter train to interact and play with

Intermediary Nodes (Infrastructure Devices) Infrastructure devices also known as \xe2\x80\x9cIntermediary Nodes\xe2\x80\x9d are nodes which are not sharing the Internet directly but are still forwarding packets on behalf of others For clarification these would be intermediary nodes between a client device that requested the data and the data sharing device providing the Internet access

willing to pay for apps it is the current network speed and the cost of the data that is slowing adoption In many countries including Bangladesh India and Cuba people pay a small amount of money each month to receive apps and content transferred directly onto a device\xe2\x80\x99s external SD card or portable hard drive This is because it can often be more expensive to download the app using the Internet than the perceived value Using RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b as an app distribution platform allows these existing app sellers to resell free apps actively or passively wherever they go Furthermore by downloading an app everyone who continues to participate can also earn tokens by passing the app onto another user and so on and so on and so on Now rather than just paying for a free app with expensive data consumption turns into entrepreneurism App Developers who plan on distributing apps to the next 4 billion users through the RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM platform may wish to contribute tokens during the initial token distribution to ensure adequate supply Distributed Advertising Networks Currently many free to play games and apps make their money when people view advertisements (such as videos) to unlock virtual goods The mobile games market generated $40 6 billion in worldwide revenue in 2016 a sum equivalent to all global box office sales during the same period This represented a 18% growth rate over the year before much of it coming from advertising 39 revenue Mobile games now account for half of the entire global digital games market Companies that wish to have their ads shown to offline consumers would purchase RMESH tokens The tokens would be exchanged every time an ad unit is consumed on a device This process would be transparent since the records of the consumption could be stored using the distributed ledger system The ad would further be able to remain on the device so that devices which are completely offline may also be reached Client Devices which store and transmit the ad can be paid in RMESH tokens for their distribution services This creates another way for mesh users to earn 40 tokens while connecting advertisers to the fastest growing consuming class The unlocking of the virtual good uses very little data but consuming video ads consumes quite a lot This makes it expensive for people who cannot afford Internet access but are willing to pay with their attention With this distributed advertising network RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b can reach billions of consumers not presently (or not always) connected

developer could deploy a mesh application in just a few lines of code (that is reconfigure an existing application to support mesh network connectivity) We believe that focusing on the developer will allow us to jumpstart our Mesh Network Loop defined in the following figure Figure 12 The RightMesh\xe2\x80\x8bTM\xe2\x80\x8b Network Effects Loop starts with Developers building mesh applications The primary network loop is as follows 1 Developers are given the SDK for free and encouraged to build or retrofit apps 2 More apps means more users are attracted into the ecosystem 3 More app users means there are more opportunities for participants/nodes to earn tokens for selling their connectivity or resources to other mesh nodes 4 As the number of Internet Selling Nodes (ISN) increase the availability of Internet/data increases meaning more and larger mesh networks are formed 5 As more mesh networks are formed users receive better coverage and network quality of the network as well as better opportunities for users to make money either as an infrastructure node or by selling digital goods \xc2\xa92018 \xe2\x80\x93 RightMesh AG Version 5 0 FINAL Page |\xe2\x80\x8b 41 \x0c6 As the mesh network grows its density the user experience improves for all participants and as a result increases user engagement for each app 7 As the app engagement increases data/internet consumption on the mesh increases 8 More data/internet consumption will lead to decreased data rates on the mesh Lower data rates will attract more users A secondary network loop also exists 9 More mesh networks (and more mesh users) means more opportunities available for marketers or providers to share digital content (apps/ads etc ) to more app users 10 This results in more spending by marketers/providers who buy tokens from the general market to reach previously unconnected users Kickstarting a Token Economy The initial token economy will be kickstarted by selling RMESH utility tokens to app developers publishers advertisers and other enterprise clients After all it will be these organizations who receive early utility from the platform as they achieve their business goals and reach into new markets To illustrate consider this second network loop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 At the center a publisher (inclusive of app creators advertisers service providers etc ) participates in the initial Token Generating Event The publisher will pay a mesh user for their resources namely their storage and connectivity a The mesh user sets the price for which they are willing to sell resources b If the publisher sees value at the price being set the transaction occurs The mesh user earns revenue as per their agreed upon contract As mesh users earn revenue for participation in the network more mesh users will be attracted to join the network the more money there is to be made With more mesh users participating it creates more distribution reach for publishers and a stronger mesh network More mesh users increases the number of participants using the mesh networks More publishers are attracted to a growing network of previously unconnected users Publishers buy more tokens to reach these users And the cycle would continue transferring value from publishers and app distributors into the hands of the mesh users who are facilitating distribution And in effect western dollars flow into emerging markets (giving everyone value for this utility) and onto a platform in which the recipients receive new value and can have tokens for use within the economy The RightMesh Team RightMesh AG
