 Executive summary
 Inefficiencies in e commerce are staggering Even though the industry itself is full of promise 
 the technology behind it is not Namely the way we identify ourselves online as well as
 transfer our data and money is outdated and thus ripe for improvement Without it we’re
 stuck with never ending registrations redundant verifications delays limited utility of crypto
 payments constant infringements of data protection legislation as well as the generally
 worrisome state of cyber security 
 With all this in mind Safein offers a single sign on digital wallet enabling users to quickly 
 safely and conveniently conduct their activities online through a one stop shop for all online
 authentications and payments With our platform digital customers can easily demonstrate
 their true identities with no lengthy registrations or verifications maintain instant
 access to various online shops and payments as well as control the extent of personal data
 shared with service providers Moreover Safein allows its users to go beyond fragmented
 identity system born in the last millennium and exercise proper control of their profiles in
 a secure and modern manner 
 Our platform is uniquely beneficial for both users and merchants First users will undoubtedly
 appreciate the end of repeat registrations KYCs and password recoveries replaced
 by instant access granted by our multi factor authentication solution Furthermore not
 having redundant accounts provides greater security and data protection both of which
 are valuable to any consumer Finally the ability to easily conduct payments in any chosen
 medium has long been desired by the market Safein will also satisfy this need to allow a
 fully seamless payment experience for all its users and merchants 
 Merchants also benefit with our platform as Safein significantly reduces merchant costs
 for user onboarding and verification Furthermore Safein reduces transaction fees and
 can remove the problem of having to manage lost passwords for the customer support 
 Merchants also get easy access to crypto payments at one of the lowest commission fees
 in the market with a completely free identity verification tool Moreover merchants who
 possess Safein tokens in their wallet will be able to process payments with no commission 
 Our platform will also help them increase trust and user conversion rates as well as protect
 them from accidental breaches of increasingly complex data protection regulations and
 processes

 Admittedly building a universal gateway for e commerce requires scale and wide product
 adoption by the target audiences Accordingly our growth strategy is primarily focused on
 rapid scaling of our user base and initially introducing the platform to the communities our
 team has best access to gaming and crypto assets In order to achieve these goals we
 will employ similar incentivization tactics as used by PayPal or Airbnb and reward the first
 adopters of our platform with Safein tokens Across 3 market verticals we will enter total
 number of merchants and user wallets by end of 36th month in operation are estimated to
 reach 3 600 and 1 7 million respectively Cumulative monthly growth rate in value of transactions
 is estimated to be 18 20% and net commission revenue will grow in line Operational
 breakeven is expected to be achieved in approx 20 months after launch of revenue generating
 activities 
 Work on our vision is already in progress and users will soon be able to try out a fully functional
 MVP on our website and sites of our partnering websites Beyond further development
 of the platform itself our team is currently working hard on expanding the company’s
 network of partners names of which will be announced in due course The process of
 obtaining an electronic money license in the EU is also in progress 
 The Safein ICO starts on 20th of March 2018 At this time 10% of the Safein tokens will be
 issued with the remaining pool will be used for user and merchant incentivization remuneration
 and further development of the platform

 Background Problems
 in e commerce
 Rapid growth of e commerce remains unstoppable However the industry itself is still ripe
 for improvements as growing concerns mount over data protection cybersecurity money
 laundering and monopolization of numerous sectors Moreover shopping online is not
 only troublesome it’s also redundantly complicated Think for example of all the repeat
 registrations verifications and password recoveries trailing the daily online customer experience 
 We believe that outdated technology is to blame for almost all of these problems Accordingly 
 we think it’s about time to fix this by embracing a modern way of managing your online
 identity and the shopping experience 
 One could argue that the internet was designed around the groundbreaking discovery of
 public database – the website – thus making it the very core of Web 1 0 but subsequently
 leaving user engagement somewhat secondary However as the internet evolved and grew
 in popularity personalized online user interaction standards emerged as standard for the
 protocol Hence keeping track of “who’s who” became crucial for the online community 
 Unfortunately the internet was created without an identity layer thus online merchants 
 forums and other stakeholders had to develop this layer from scratch Instead of joining
 forces for this endeavor each website decided to solve this problem internally which
 consequently gave rise to the well known horror of “signing up” and creating different accounts
 for every single website we visit 
 It’s worth noting that in its infancy “signing up” wasn’t really that bad First there were only
 so many websites that asked us to register and setting up your user account brought the
 joy of creation to many However this perception swiftly changed once our modern lives
 became dependent on the internet and shopping online turned mainstream Naturally with
 ever growing Web 2 0 interactions still relying on stagnant user onboarding procedures 
 we had to “sign up” and “sign in” more and more Subsequently irritation with providing

 the same data already submitted numerous
 times before grew to the point where
 at least 22% of current online shoppers
 simply choose to abandon their carts if
 completing the purchase required creation
 of a new user account1 
 Anti Money Laundering (AML) and general Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures did not
 take long to become ubiquitous In turn this made customer onboarding even more problematic
 as using financial or other regulated services online in most cases required submitting
 personal documents for manual review and waiting for them to be verified Since we
 live in the age where time is perceived as precious commodity this delay between account
 creation and verification (sometime lasting more than a month2) naturally persuades many
 potential customers to stick with the regulated service provider (e g inferior bank) they
 already work with or forego buying something online altogether All this just to avoid the
 hassle of printing signing scanning and submitting their passports or utility bills once again 
 And it’s no better from the merchant perspective Market research
 shows that onboarding new users can cost an online
 service provider up to 20 USD per new customer3 with a total
 annual bill for identity assurance exceeding 3 5 billion EUR in
 the UK alone4 Worse another fortune is required to properly
 collect manage and store the personal data collected 
 Small armies of KYC specialists need to be available in each
 company so that legal requirements are not breached and exorbitant
 fines—like the one received by Paddy Power for failure
 to verify just 3 customers—can be avoided5 Moreover no
 matter how good KYC departments usually fail to deliver their
 service within 24 hours Naturally this deters potential customers
 who need your services promptly (e g access to financial
 markets) or not at all (think of buying stocks on the last hours
 before quarterly results for example)

 Finally multiple accounts and different passwords are
 not easy to manage for either users or merchants This is
 perfectly illustrated by the fact that 30 40% of support
 center call volume is related to something as stupid as
 password and account recovery6 
 This is the magnitude of user time and merchant resources
 that could easily be saved for better purposes with
 an advanced Identity 2 07 solution Additionally widespread
 adoption of Identity 2 0 could also diminish the
 above mentioned obstacles to fair competition enable
 greater consumer mobility maximize product utility and
 supercharge the total growth of e commerce Lastly we
 live in the age where generations Y and Z tend to reject
 walls on the internet and jump between the growing number
 of platforms with no sentimental attachment In this
 new reality the old way does not work anymore 
 In this environment merchants became eager to mine more
 and more data on their site users thus giving rise to a society
 where 76% of all online users claim that information
 requested of them during the registration procedure is
 intrusive and unnecessary9 
 The need for online merchants to identify their customers through “login” functionality rose
 from shortcomings of the internet itself and was quite justifiable at the dawn of e commerce 
 However as the World Wide Web evolved this feature remained unchanged Two
 factors are to blame for this shortcoming First moving from site centered Identity 1 0 to
 user centered Identity 2 0 required significant investment by site owners and broad consensus
 of the online community neither of which is easy to attain Second businesses
 discovered over time that user registration wasn’t just draining their resources it was also
 giving them precious piles of data on users’ geography demography contacts and preferences
 for further sales Naturally it didn’t take long for businesses to discover that such
 databases could easily be packaged and sold to the highest bidder enabling the digital advertising
 industry that’s currently worth more than 220 billion USD8 a year

 And that’s completely understandable as most of us try to avoid unwelcome data mining
 or spamming operations Excessive and intrusive questioning also impacts commerce Many
 survey respondents list privacy and security issues among the key factors of shopping cart
 abandonment12 Moreover we normally treasure our right to privacy as a basic human right13
 that we expect to be protected Governments do try to do this and data protection is no
 longer at the sidelines of political agendas (think GDPR14 for example) But forcing e commerce
 incumbents to stop collecting and storing valuable data they don’t really need is
 no easy feat and legal enforcement is struggling to overcome the “Agree with everything”
 checkbox we ticked during the last registration Accordingly instead of waiting for the world
 to fix itself Identity 2 0 could step up and lead the way 
 A new era of online identity recognition could not only mean increased trust in e commerce
 through greater protection and control of our personal data It could also enable the online
 shopper to do something our physical selves take for granted – i e remain anonymous at
 the counter This does not mean that we imagine a world with no age or country restrictions
 – these checks are there for a reason and shouldn’t be removed without proper debate 
 However just like a vendor not even looking at you when you buy something simple and
 only inspecting your ID when you ask for some liquor or medicine at a physical store online
 merchants do not need to know your name age gender or email They just need to
 know that you qualify for the purchase you came for All this can be done without separate
 accounts spam emails and tiresome verifications We just need to embrace the change
 that’s long overdue 
 Furthermore since extensive profiling was not really welcomed by the community almost
 60% of internet dwellers started retaliating with increasing numbers of fake email addresses
 and other false data being submitted during registration10 To date this problem has gotten
 so big that on average 10% of any online community user database is likely to be false11 
 9
 This fear is not without merit In 2016 we saw 1 1 billion
 identities exposed in data breaches17 and 2017
 hasn’t been any better–Equifax alone exposed 143
 million accounts in the first half of the year18 And
 we should not forget that this is super sensitive personal
 data that’s likely to remain accessible to fraudsters
 indefinitely Naturally this is frightening 
 In light of all these problems it is no wonder that over 69% of consumers look for websites
 displaying trust symbols provided by Bizrate Customer Certified TRUSTe and others19 
 Properly posting these symbols on your website is neither easy nor cheap Accordingly 
 they’re usually not present on new and exciting websites such as startups struggling to raise
 capital deliver goods and further develop products Such merchants need to prioritize cyber
 security and data protection but the costs tend to prevent this 
 Established merchants however do have the resources to improve security but they fall
 victim to fraudsters with talent and determination to steal the valuable treasure chests of
 merchant data Fewer and fewer merchants have the resources and capability to withstand
 the constant cyberattack and that results in fewer and fewer trusted merchants online 
 Over time consumers opt for these few trusted merchants but using just a few sites for everything
 is far from ideal Competition 101 tells us that rising barriers for entry and effective
 discrimination of startups inevitably leads to fewer choices slower innovation oligopolies
 and ultimately higher prices None of this is good for the consumer 
 Distortions to competition e commerce and privacy brought about by the rise of cybercrime
 are too great to ignore Something needs to be done Therefore we believe that
 Identity 2 0 could be a huge step in the right direction 
 The rise of online shopping digital marketing and loyalty schemes resulted in merchants
 storing more and more consumer data that is of value to cyber criminals Not surprisingly 
 breaches involving loss of client data from hacking or online leakage doubled in one year
 from 2015/16 to 2016/1715 Accordingly we’re currently at a place where 60% of consumers
 believe online merchants aren’t doing enough to protect their personal information 34%
 of respondents even go as far as to avoid buying online altogether16

 Obviously having your business online does not shield you from most of the requirements
 imposed on brick & mortar merchants Regulations intended for consumer or data protection
 as well as tax collection work for the cyber and real worlds almost identically However 
 not all commerce is the same and some of it is subject to extra scrutiny We speak here of
 licensed businesses such as pharmacies financial brokers beverage stores casinos etc 
 These are the businesses that if run badly could hurt the society we live in Hence they
 are required to adhere to higher standards in order to protect both consumers and communities 
 Probably the most popular way to protect the young is ban them from using some goods or
 services until their adulthood at the age of 16 18 or 21 However whereas in the real world
 establishing your age isn’t that hard and being asked for ID in some bar at the age of 40 is
 almost unheard of buying liquor online is a completely different story Online merchants
 are unable to actually see their customers and judge their age on appearance Accordingly 
 they need to solve this problem in some other way And the way chosen by most is online
 ID verification 
 This verification is quite unsecure costly and—for the user irritating – especially when you
 have to do this repeatedly Moreover with numerous different IDs across the globe populations
 with no IDs and stolen IDs bought for a few dollars one should wonder how capable
 are the merchants of really establishing true identity and age of their shoppers And how
 much do the customer support armies employed for this task cost them 
 Even if your true identity online can be discerned this is usually not enough Although internet
 has no borders domiciles of its users do Accordingly applicable laws differ for users
 from the Netherlands and India To put it simply whereas something is legal for a Dutch of
 23 the same thing can still be banned for an Indian of 70 The same can be said about taxes
 – VAT in Denmark is 25 percent whereas in Malta it’s only 18 Online merchants need to
 know and account this properly but we believe that few merchants do With the wide use
 of VPNs online users tend to “cherry pick” the jurisdictions that suit them best or have the
 lowest taxes Of course consumers will always take the path of least resistance and that’s
 understandable – because it’s really the merchant that’s going to be blamed fined and
 prosecuted if something goes wrong Nobody should want this

 Whereas the inefficiencies of “signing up” and “signing in” are widely debated we believe
 that this debate is still missing one core issue the outdated way we pay for the goods or
 services acquired online Traditionally there’s actually more than one “signing in” in the online
 process of buying First you sign in to the store itself and then you do it again to access
 your payment provider Naturally this means two accounts and two passwords Surely that
 redundancy could be optimized 
 While the above scenario is already far from ideal we believe that the most common alternative
 is not actually better We mean here regulated merchants like currency exchanges 
 betting houses etc all of which usually require users to deposit funds upfront to get the
 services they came for This is flawed in the way that it makes customers wait from 3 to 72
 hours before being served (by which time we might lose our interest altogether) with less
 established businesses it can be many times worse 
 Many of us at least once felt this fear of transferring a balance to some new exchange or
 online casino where we weren’t actually sure that the transferred amount would be added
 to our balance This is quite common the market is rich with stories of fraudulent websites
 and disappearing accounts Even if your balance gets added to your account you cannot
 yet be sure that you’ll be able to withdraw it later 
 Due to the above problems we believe that a significant part of e commerce is lost on the
 part of new entrants Commerce needs trust and while it’s easy to establish it with simply
 opening your wallet in the physical world online shopping is different Accordingly forgoing
 the old fashioned ways and conducting all payments from a single account could greatly
 benefit e commerce development and competition alike 
 Finally with regard to the use of a cryptocurrency and blockchain systems we feel the
 technology is strongly applicable but needs enhanced stability to better serve ecommerce 
 The Bitcoin idea was born almost 10 years ago The whole cryptocurrency market is worth
 well over $500bn and crypto payments are still not widely used The general reasons for
 that is volatility of cryptocurrency rates which frightens merchants and limits blockchain
 technology The world needs a one stop payment solution for both traditional payment
 methods and cryptocurrencies with ability to instantly convert payments to the currency
 that merchant feels safe with

 Data shows that modern internet users have a
 strong preference for single sign on solutions
 like Facebook identity or Google accounts In
 fact some 88% of all online customers use
 these gateways from time to time to sign into
 websites they visit20 On the other hand neither
 Facebook nor Google can grant an account
 that’s verified or capable of payments which
 significantly limits user convenience and growth 
 Accordingly there’s a huge market that’s ripe for
 the taking 
 In view of all this as well as the cyber world problems mentioned in previous sections the
 Safein team has set out to create a single sign on and payment solution that can be used
 universally on all websites By doing so we will eradicate the traditional way of creating accounts
 on numerous websites we shop on and we will enable the world to adopt Identity
 2 0 This profound leap in technology can easily eliminate the inefficiencies of never ending
 KYC procedures and finally grant the community a default customer gateway for all e commerce
 activities 
 Equally important is our ambition to finally enable our customers to properly secure the
 personal data used for e commerce and shop anonymously wherever possible We strongly
 believe that instant access to payment for services with no delays for KYCs or deposit
 transfers will undoubtedly lead to greater competition increased conversion rates and
 booming e commerce In tandem merchants will benefit from a significant cut in their cost
 of regulatory compliance data protection KYC and user onboarding cyber security as well
 as reduction in need for significant portion of customer support handling trivial matters like
 password recovery 
 Here’s how we will achieve our goals

 Safein will allow users to store their identity as well as crypto and fiat currencies in accounts
 opened on our platform Safein will go into various business areas where combination of
 possessing all of the above gives benefit to its users online and offline The main priority of
 Safein is to eliminate redundant registrations and KYC procedures 
 At the same time Safein will standardize crypto payments on all e commerce websites 
 Currently there is no single large scale Payment Service Provider (PSP) which accepts both 
 fiat and crypto payments Safein shall resolve this by allowing its users to pay for their goods
 directly using their Safein wallet regardless of the currency held in the account (cryptocurrency
 or fiat money) Transactions will be automatically converted to the currency required
 by the merchant Conversions will be executed at the best available rate in the market with
 only 0 5% markup on top by Safein This is a unique solution in the market which will allow
 crypto payments to reach global scale eliminating current crypto payment disadvantages
 for merchants high network fees the need to convert to fiat manually and huge conversion
 rate fluctuations

 Safein is planning to be a fully licenced EU electronic money institution with the ability to
 receive and process payments in full compliance with the law Users will be able to hold
 their crypto and fiat currency in a single wallet as well as convert them from one to another 
 Major crypto currencies including Bitcoin Ethereum ERC20 tokens and other popular
 cryptocurrencies will be supported Currency exchange functionality for crypto and fiat 
 will be standard for all currencies with 0 5% markup from the best available rate in the
 market Having an EU electronic money institution (EMI) licence will allow Safein to connect
 to the SEPA network and give IBAN codes to all of our users Having that available Safein
 will be one step closer to becoming a standard instrument for daily use Additionally Safein
 plans to have payment cards linked to users’ accounts so users will be able to use their
 Safein accounts daily both online and offline 
 Standard Safein e commerce commission for merchants will be 1% Merchants who possess
 Safein tokens will be able to receive part of their payments free of any commission 
 and users who pay with Safein tokens will receive 0 25% cashback on every purchase More
 on these Safein token benefits can be found in the “Token model” Section

 Safein provides a unique solution for both users and merchants Users will be able to login
 into websites directly with no registrations The Safein account will at the same time provide
 merchants with the information necessary for client acceptance and service provision 
 For example if a user is signing in to a forum the forum usually only needs to know user’s
 display name or some unique identifier enabling it to separate the user from others In this
 case Safein would not disclose data like user’s full name address etc Instead it will only
 provide the forum with the required username On the other hand should the same user
 be buying a physical book additionally the merchant would be provided with user’s full
 name and address for shipping Despite this the user will have full control of his data at all
 times always seeing what information is being requested by the merchant and giving a clear
 consent to such transfer up front 
 Before integrating Safein a merchant will have
 to choose what user data is essential and
 must be acquired and what data is optional
 and could be omitted Our team will monitor
 this process and advise merchants on whether
 their choices on data to be collected complies
 with applicable data protection regimes 
 Moreover the user will be able to choose
 whether to pass or decline passing optional
 data to the merchant Safein will try to grow a
 generation of users who value their personal
 data and do not share it with everybody by
 default The same applies to merchants as we
 will try to do what we can without losing our
 competitive advantages to limit merchant requests
 for data and convince them to accept
 anonymous users where possible

 Primary focus of many online merchants is business expansion Given limited resources
 available to most companies (especially the smaller ones) businesses tend to focus on
 core functions areas like proper user data collection and management don’t get enough
 attention This is where Safein steps in 
 In particular it’s no secret that even though many online shops conduct their business
 globally most of them are not experts in different rules of data protection in every market 
 Many don’t even know all the details of the laws applicable in their own jurisdiction We
 believe that this is one of the core reasons for excess data mining and general non compliance
 with data protection legislation online 
 With all this in mind Safein’s architecture is built in a way that solves most of these problems
 automatically First as required by recent developments in the EU21 our users will
 always be presented with a full and clear information on what personal data is being passed
 on to relevant websites No such transfer shall take place without clear consent of the
 user Moreover once the user agrees to give her specific data to a merchant on the first
 login the merchant will be able to access this data on our platform anytime before this
 relationship is terminated by the user Accordingly such merchant will have little reasons to
 store this information on his own server and thus be able to significantly decrease his and
 his user’s exposure to hacking operations and data theft (as well as save some expenditure
 related to counter measures to such threats) 
 We argue that such measures will not only help merchants comply with the EU General
 Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) coming into force as of 25th of May 2018 and also be
 beneficial for customer trust in general As compliance with GDPR becomes increasingly
 important Safein will dedicate significant resources to educating the merchants on applicable
 requirements and guiding them when deciding on which customer data should and
 should not be collected by specific merchants In short we’ll strive to pass only the “need
 to know” information to merchants and maintain our users anonymity where possible 
 Furthermore the platform will also solve the problem of personal data updates with different
 service providers as all relevant merchants will receive information on updated addresses 
 surnames etc automatically as soon as such changes are submitted to our platform 
 Finally the Safein platform will enable our users to truly exercise their rights of personal
 data management and terminate any previous sharing of data with specific merchant 
 2 5 U S E R D ATA P ROT E C T I O N
 17
 Even more importantly we will also let our users to properly exercise Art 17 of GDPR (“the
 right to be forgotten”) in the EU and request any merchant to delete specific user data from
 their archives immediately upon receipt of a relevant notice All this shall be done without
 leaving the boundaries of our platform as the user will simply be required to click a couple
 of buttons and let our platform take care of further communication with the merchant on
 behalf of the user 
 We believe that all the above features will be greatly beneficial for both users and merchants
 and should be appreciated by educated and law abiding online community in general 
 Moreover as Safein will closely monitor its partnering websites and share no information
 with entities of uncertain reputation our services should also help in growing trust in
 e commerce thereby increasing the conversion rates 
 Security must be a primary focus while managing your identity
 and wallet online Safein will have a multi factor authentication
 mechanism implemented from the very beginning While integrating
 Safein each merchant will be able to choose a minimum security
 level that he requires from its users For example merchants
 can ask that all logins to the merchant’s website and all payments
 must be confirmed by user on his mobile device i e (i) a push
 notification shows up (ii) user must identify himself via pin code
 or fingerprint on his mobile Safein app and (iii) approve login or
 purchase User (in his panel) can also enhance general security
 levels for each website individually For example even if a specific
 website does not require mobile device confirmation for website
 login a user can always enhance his security level by enabling that
 requirement himself 
 With Safein users will not only be able to fully control their logins
 and actions but track and manage them as well Users will be able
 to see their full activity history including logins and payments 
 track their used devices manage current active login sessions and
 cancel them at any time Users will also be able to easily check
 which website has access to certain data Most of the functionality
 related to identity management is already available in the MVP

 Safein team is currently in talks with the world’s leading automated ID verification service
 provider to provide exceptionally accurate results using its AI powered document checking
 algorithm Such checks where users will only need to scan their IDs with their cameras and
 take selfies will be sufficient for most uses Some advanced verifications where users need
 to comply with very specific regulations (for example some cryptocurrency exchanges) 
 will be done manually by the Safein team It could take up to few minutes but compared
 to current waiting periods of weeks for some exchanges it is still a radical improvement 
 especially keeping in mind that users will only need to do it once 
 Most of the merchants are well aware of the issues that arise from credit card chargebacks
 and fraud One of the biggest advantages of crypto payments is that they are irreversible In
 standard e commerce the merchant is considered to be a more trusted party hence the
 buyer needs to send the payment first Chargeback and dispute resolution mechanisms
 were invented to help the buyers recover funds from merchants who failed to deliver the
 goods or delivered them in unsatisfactory fashion However recently those mechanisms
 are being abused by fraudsters and scammers in quite the opposite way than intended 
 Crypto payments without buyer protection mechanisms rob customers of a money back
 guarantee in case of failure to deliver Hence Safein will provide a buyer protection mechanism
 for crypto payments in its platform The mechanism shall only be initiated if the
 goods are not duly received by the buyer or if they are not as described Safein will provide
 all the tools to the buyers to protect their accounts hence merchants will be able to feel
 safe as there will be no chargebacks or fraud cases If buyers and sellers are not able to
 resolve disputes themselves a well trained Safein support team will intervene and resolve
 the outcome of these disputes

 4 Token Model
 The idea of having a single account for everything you do online is simply brilliant 
 but it requires large scale Developing Safein is the same as trying to solve the
 chicken and egg problem you need a lot of users to attract merchants and vice
 versa Without merchants you cannot acquire new users Safein will leverage its
 tokens to grow its user base and acquire merchants Use of the Safein platform
 will reward both users and merchants for using innovative payments and identity
 management solutions created by our team 
 23
 Merchants using Safein will be able to reduce their transaction fees by holding SFN tokens 
 Each SFN token held entitles a a merchant to process a specific amount of payments per
 month with no commission fees The initial multiplier right after payments launch will be
 10 i e each SFN token will let merchant receive 10 SFN tokens worth of payments with no
 commission that month The multiplier will gradually decrease within 5 years starting from
 the date when the payments are launched This will lead to a very high token demand from
 the very beginning and merchants who buy tokens during the ICO will benefit the most as
 they will be able to buy them for the lowest starting price 1 ETH = 9 000 SFN

 For example right after the payment functionality launch if merchant has 10 000 SFN tokens 
 he will be able to receive 100 000 SFN worth (at market price) of payments for his
 goods or services with no commission fee in any currency each month After he receives
 100 000 SFN or equivalent amount in other currency that month he will be charged a
 standard 1% commission fee for the remaining part of the month Doing some simple math
 shows that if a merchant buys $1 000 worth of SFN tokens during the ICO and the token
 price doesn’t change that will save him $1 140 of Safein commission per year (1% commission
 on total transaction volume) and more than $2 000 yearly compared to other payment
 service providers charging commission and fees more than twice as large as Safein 
 Accordingly this should allow us to incentivize merchants to promote payments with SFN
 tokens even more as this would allow them to store the tokens received from customers
 and minimize their commision fees further 
 Users paying with SFN tokens will receive 0 25% cashback for all of their purchases Merchants
 will only be charged 1% no matter what payment method is chosen by the user 
 No other crypto payments solution currently has an active cashback bonus system for its
 payments 
 10 000 SFN allows to receive 100 000 SFN per month for free 
 $1 000 worth SFN tokens saves $2 000 yearly compared to other
 payment service providers

 The Login Pool will have 5% of the overall issued tokens They will be distributed over the
 first 24 months as of the launch of Login Pool which we expect to happen within a few
 months following the conclusion of the ICO 
 At the end of each month the system will count qualifying logins for each user and each
 participating website (qualifying one unique login per user per site per day i e if a user
 logs into the same site three times per day only one login counts) If total amount of qualifying
 logins is X the total amount of SFN tokens in the pool dedicated to users that month is
 Y then each qualifying login is awarded with Y/X tokens Users and websites can claim their
 tokens in their panel on Safein website 
 Unclaimed tokens will stay in the pool for the next month Tokens are distributed by last infirst 
 out principle those tokens not withdrawn from the pool for longer than 3 months will
 be transferred to Safein company reserve 
 Users split ¾ of the pool Websites split ¼ of the pool 
 Safein allocates 5% of its total token supply for its Referral Program Users who invite their
 friends to register on Safein will be rewarded the same amount of Safein tokens that the
 new user is rewarded from the Registration Pool For more details please see the Registration
 Pool section Referred users will only entitle their friends to referral bonuses if they
 fulfill all of the below within 90 days from registration 
 Not many people know that PayPal’s referral program was a key factor to its success PayPal
 has spent about $60 000 000 on their referral program and achieved 7 10% daily growth in
 the early 2000s Its referral program was a key to their user base growth to 100 million users 
 Safein will use the same strategy and grow its community faster than any other crypto
 project 
 The Safein Referral Program is planned to be launched within 6 months of completion of
 the ICO however not before the launch of payments

 All of the above should be done by Q4 2018 (obtaining the EMI license may take a bit longer) 
 After all of these goals are met Safein will slowly distribute its tokens in the market to get the
 funds needed to continue project development mostly for B2B sales (i e onboarding new
 merchants acquiring more users launching payment cards if community supports it and
 going into NFC mobile payments) 
 In the short term it is expected that token value will grow due to the growing user base and
 expanding list of partnering merchants Users will be incentivized to use SFN tokens for
 their payments due to cashback bonus merchants will be buying SFN to receive commission
 free payments Due to merchants holding the tokens and users buying them to receive
 the cashback bonus demand will be going up supply will be going down and token price
 should therefore go up Section 4 2 goes into more details on how beneficial it is for the
 merchants to save on commission by possessing SFN tokens 
 N B Since the company shall be working in an extremely fast changing environment and
 is still under rapid development itself some features envisioned for the company’s token

 5 Bussines plan
 Safein’s success is based on rapid growth of the user and merchant base Safein won’t be
 successful if it’s not widely used Given that imperative one of the key project priorities
 is adapting every part of the project (including token model marketing strategy business
 strategy and technical development) for rapid growth of user and merchant base Safein’s
 token model is designed to incentivize users and merchants to use Safein as much as possible 
 The rise of the cryptocurrency market allows us to approach growth from a very different
 angle Until now all business strategies had their growth projections built around a bottom
 line concept of “cost to acquire single user ” Our solution is to adopt the same strategies
 that the fastest growing companies did but use them with modifications from the decentralized
 cryptocurrency world in tandem with extremely low payment commissions for merchants 
 The Safein team will use different strategies tailored for users and merchants Our user
 base growth strategy initially relies on the Referral Program This strategy was actively used
 by PayPal Airbnb Dropbox and other companies which managed to achieve viral growth 
 Initial user base will be achieved by signing up users during our ICO and then launching
 our referral campaign 5% of the generated Safein tokens will be allocated to the Referral
 Program With an initial critical mass of users registered during our ICO our user base will
 grow exponentially Starting active marketing campaigns in certain industries as mentioned
 in previous sections will allow us to demonstrate user benefit of having one single login for
 most popular websites Similar example can be seen in the gaming industry where Steam
 login is already extremely popular when it comes to websites where users don’t need to
 show their true identity or pay for goods 
 5 1 G ROW T H S T R AT E G Y
 30
 Acquiring merchants in crypto and gaming spaces is easier with a very large user base and
 Safein’s benefits for both industries 
 All of the above solves real current issues for both markets For example Steam stopped
 accepting Bitcoin on December 2017 due to extremely high network fees (more than $40
 at the time) Merchants accepting Safein payments will be able to process those payments
 completely free by having Safein tokens in their wallet 
 With all of the mentioned benefits and large user base merchants from crypto and gaming
 sectors will be very easy to approach not only due to direct benefits but due to increased
 conversion rates as well users won’t need to register or remember different passwords to
 purchase goods immediately 
 Safein will start its user acquisition from two different verticals the crypto audience and the
 online computer games market Both of these sectors have tech savvy user bases already
 using or at least aware of cryptocurrencies Users in these sectors often face repetitive
 registrations KYC procedures and identity verification

 extremely cheap currency conversions 
 reduced fraudulent payments due to
 verified identities 
 buyer protection mechanism 
 access to crypto payments

 31
 The gaming industry is also suffering from fraudulent payments Safein would be able to
 eliminate this problem Global revenue for online games related industries passed $100bn
 in 2017 making it a very attractive sector to start Safein user acquisition especially as the
 founding team has great experience and connections in this market After establishing in
 the gaming industry it’s logical to go to all markets surrounding it 
 Crypto markets are suffering from delayed registrations to exchanges and ICOs due to very
 slow identity verification processes Safein is currently securing partnerships with crypto
 market players to save their time and costs on KYC processes and to improve user experience
 allowing to sign in to websites passing KYC documents from Safein account This
 would be completely free of charge for users and businesses with only a very small commission
 for payments going through Safein platform 
 Since payment services are envisioned to form the core of our operations these services
 shall fall under increased governmental scrutiny and thus be subject to licensing in most
 markets On the other hand we should note that Safein plans to allow payments in both
 fiat money and cryptocurrencies Accordingly at least for the foreseeable future most jurisdictions
 will treat these types of payments differently and different considerations are
 therefore relevant for these payment methods 
 First Safein plans to initially focus its expansion in the European Union Accordingly EU
 E Money Directive (2009/110/EC) establishing universal guidelines for regulation of Electronic
 Money Institutions (EMI) across the EU is the primary focus of our legal considerations 
 In view of this as well as numerous discussions with various regulators and other
 legal professionals Safein acknowledges this EMI license as necessary for successful development
 and continuous expansion of our business In view of the above obtaining this
 license for payment operations e money issuance SEPA transfers and IBAN account creations
 will be a top priority as of the first days following the ICO It should also be noted 
 that once received this license will enable us to enjoy the so called “passporting” right and
 conduct our operations in all 28 EU member states 
 On the other hand it should not be forgotten that most leading jurisdictions still lack clarity
 in respect to regulations applicable to cryptocurrencies Accordingly at the time of writing 
 this usually means that such payments do not fall under the scope of already existing regulatory
 regimes and hence are not subject to licensing Even though this might seem convenient
 at first we see this lack of established rules more as a threat than an opportunity 
 In view of this Safein is determined to place all our payment activities under due regulatory
 5 3 R E G U L AT O RY C O N S I D E R AT I O N S
 32
 5 4 C O R P O R AT E S T R U C T U R E
 5 5 F I N A N C I A L P RO J E C T I O N S
 scrutiny as soon as possible and to obtain the above mentioned EMI license for payments
 not only in fiat money but in cryptos as well Accordingly our present aim is to seek this
 license in Luxembourg currently the only EU jurisdiction fully catering to our needs We
 should note however that the process of obtaining this license in Luxembourg is quite
 lengthy and can take more than a year thus crypto payments functionality might be provided
 to Safein users even before the license is obtained In that event these services will only
 be provided in countries where such license for crypto payments is not yet mandatory and
 will remain unlicensed only until the respective license covering both methods of payments
 is received Furthermore we continue to actively monitor the regulatory developments in
 other EU countries and will strive to take advantage of them in case a more optimal licensing
 procedure becomes available 
 Finally it should be noted that the EMI license grants limited powers outside the EU and is
 not a global solution to all regulatory inquiries Accordingly our regulatory efforts will not be
 limited to EU only and further regulatory considerations will also be duly made before any
 expansion outside the EU 
 Since regulatory regimes financial logic and accepted business practices often dictate division
 of project operations among separate legal entities companies implementing the
 Safein project shall also be organized in a company group composed of several separate
 legal entities Accordingly initially the ICO company shall be established in Estonia Most of
 the operations will be performed by a company in Lithuania whereas payment operations
 shall be conducted through an entity or entities established in jurisdictions providing the
 applicable legal framework for these operations Further developments of this company
 group might also be possible in the future as the need for such changes arises 
 The Safein team has prepared a preliminary financial model for the first 36 months of operations
 after ICO The profit and loss statement has been developed bottom up building
 from the initial quotations we have received after discussions with regulators third party
 solutions providers as well as benchmarking with industry peers Top line (merchant and
 user base growth monetization) has been modelled as a result of investing resources into
 proactive initiatives such as registration and login pool our own referral campaign as well
 as paid marketing and business development efforts 
 33
 In the following sections we present key estimated figures We believe that even if some of
 the assumptions are proven wrong as we go along having a structured model allows us to
 understand fundamental relationships between key operational and financial KPIs providing
 great value and allowing a transparent and pragmatic view of the business’ viability

 The number and value of transactions through Safein is expected to grow in line with the
 launch of crypto and fiat payment functionality Our business model is based on an 18 20%
 cumulative monthly growth rate which we believe is a conservative projection The monetization
 scheme is based on a flat commission rate hence Net Commission Revenue will
 grow in direct relationship with to the value of transactions

 At the initial stages significant development costs will be incurred It implies that the first
 year’s business cost structure will be biased towards product development and cyber security
 infrastructure development expenses Significant one off costs will be incurred around
 the time when it is expected to receive EMI license 
 Cost of revenue will appear as we launch crypto and fiat currency payments Safein will
 need to participate in the financial system hence it will incur payment processing costs 
 Despite of the obvious competitive advantages against currently existing payment providers
 at the start we also understand competitive pressures will arise as we go As a result we are
 determined to keep superior cost structure and be as lean as possible 
 5 5 3 B O T T O M L I N E A N D C A S H F L O W
 Launching a product on blockchain and using a token based incentivization scheme allows
 us to achieve a very competitive cost structure which in turn improves profitability and
 decreases pressure on cash flow That is of great importance atr the inception of the company 
 At currently estimated transaction levels (scenario conservative) the company is expected
 to reach monthly operational breakeven at months 30 36 after the crowdsale and approximately
 20 months after launch of revenue generating activities
