31 31 31 31 BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol BANKEX is an organization that unites members of the \xef\xac\x81nancial markets in order to build a community and implement the Proof of Asset Protocol enables community members to pro\xef\xac\x81t from mutual use of assets The product of BANKEX is the Proof of Asset Protocol which solves the issue of non fungible asset liquidity Proof of Asset means the token released as part of the protocol is ensured with an asset The know how of BANKEX is the Proof of Asset protocol in essence a combination of BaaS (Bank asa Service) and blockchain technologies We take a client asset primarily on the \xef\xac\x81nancial market we tokenize it then without waiting for the portfolio to accumulate critical mass we turn this asset into money for the bank This is made possible through formation of a single pool of similar assets (e g pool of banks) thereby creating a marketplace where banks bene\xef\xac\x81t from liquidity and investors bene\xef\xac\x81t from a predictable and transparent cash \xef\xac\x82ow 31 31 33 35 Introduction Disclaimer You are reading The Smart White Paper It was developed by the BANKEX team and describes a decentralized technology for control of liquidity of smart assets based on the Proof of Asset Protocol 2 \x0c1 3 Speci\xef\xac\x81cation White Paper of Examples in We o\xef\xac\x80er a solution \xe2\x80\x94 the Proof of Asset Protocol the point of which is an instant audit of the asset Now every investor is aware of the status of his investments in non public companies and assets Equipped with this tool the market will force certain businesses to change (lawyers accounting auditors and in separate cases banks and collectors) What is our plan We will begin by modernizing the mechanisms of assigning and validating ratings as the cash \xef\xac\x82ow recorded on the blockchain using the Proof ofAsset protocol is transparent understandable as well as much faster and cheaper In essence the asset\xe2\x80\x99s state is being constantly monitored by the logic of smart contracts In turn the increased amount of information on economical operations and their authenticity grant new opportunities for the development of an economical AI building su\xef\xac\x83ciently precise arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence systems for risk evaluation making the cost of such calculations approach zero This would enable the creation of a competitive market of economical AI working for the good of modern society All examples and demonstrations in this White Paper are used only as demonstrative examples of the SmartDeal technology The business of BANKEX involves manufacturing \xef\xac\x81ntech products and tokenizing primarily \xef\xac\x81nancial assets although we do not think it impossible to apply the Proof of Asset Protocol in other \xef\xac\x81elds with approval from the BANKEX Foundation in case of non \xef\xac\x81nancial Smart Assets In our case \xef\xac\x81rst and foremost we create liquidity for \xef\xac\x81nancial assets 1 4 Game Theory Behind the Proofof Asset Protocol Game Theory1 is a branch of mathematical economics focusing on the outcomes of con\xef\xac\x82icts between players and the optimality of their strategies Game theory is one of the prime fundamental directions in economics 11 scientists specializing in game theory have received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences including John Nash [4] [5] responsible for introducing one of the key concepts in game theory known as the Nash equilibrium It is a state in which a single player cannot bene\xef\xac\x81t by changing strategy while the other players keep their set of chosen strategies unchanged Analysis carried out according to game theory indicates that the global \xef\xac\x81nancial market is currently trapped in the sub optimal equilibrium of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s dilemma This dilemma is a fundamental problem of game theory illustrating how players will sometimes fail to cooperate even if it was in their best interest We see that players in \xef\xac\x81nancial markets distrust each other and keep overpaying for an ine\xef\xac\x83cient set of various ratings scores and audits although these are frequently wrong (as with the Enron scandal and the subprime mortgage crisis) This ine\xef\xac\x83ciency leads to high costs and often losses which in turn raise the cost of capital and lead to a lack of access to capital for decentralized small businesses or borrowers Another issue derived from this dilemma is the obstructing cost of deployment to the public market If this barrier is removed then the market itself is cable to evaluate every asset based on the collective wisdom of all trading participants as the increase in volume of transparent and authentic trade operations provides more information that can be used by the market to verify the assets 1 2 2 1 Modern Financial Markets Bank as a Service (BaaS ) Business Model Bank as a Service (BaaS ) is a business model that makes it possible to build new \xef\xac\x81nancial products that are integrated with multiple existing technological solutions and jurisdictions On one side of these platforms are originators in various jurisdictions with various technologies and on the other are \xef\xac\x81ntech companies wishing to launch a new product or expand to a new market Thanks to the platform they are able to do this quickly and e\xef\xac\x83ciently without the need to work out integration with the legislation of every country and every new bank from scratch Since the platform already contains technological and legal integration it can provide access to a new player more cheaply and more quickly The originator in the BaaS model is a storefront essentially establishing access to the end client be it a bank a \xef\xac\x81ntech company an internet platform a stock exchange or an insurer It is critical that when building the BaaS business model the originator of the platform maintains his client and access to the client under his control but at the same time he provides the client with the most up to date and competitive products on the market by the best tech Game theory is the study of the ways in which interacting choices of economic agents produce outcomes with respect to the preferences (or utilities) of those agents where the outcomes in question might have been intended by none of the agents [6] 3 \x0c(\xef\xac\x81ntech IT) companies on the market It\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent solution to preserve and monetize clients How does an end client see it Like a bank \xe2\x80\x94 he does not have to see the third party provider There exist several levels of integration of participants of the BaaS model from primitive analogue integration where an employee would have to re enter data into a separate service to fully automated integration The originator makes the choice of whichever model of work with an end client is most bene\xef\xac\x81cial to him either where the end client is shown that the company he is interacting with provides services by outside service providers or where the end client sees the entire product line under the originator\xe2\x80\x99s brand Some researchers call this conception \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lego Bank\xe2\x80\x9d which owns no pieces but assembles the pieces into di\xef\xac\x80erent form factors The constituent pieces are all the same It is how you put the pieces together that makes the di\xef\xac\x80erence Like Lego you can build the pieces into a Castle a House or a Winnebago It\xe2\x80\x99s all about how you click pieces together [8] As a result the Bank as a Service platform is a uni\xef\xac\x81ed window where corporate or retail clients can choose and receive services that are being o\xef\xac\x80ered by various banks and tech companies in various countries This platform takes over technical and legal integration of various players on the \xef\xac\x81nancial market 2 2 streams are becoming global They are no longer easily controlled by common tools Regulators and central banks de\xef\xac\x81ning the movement of the market are responding to this with more strict regulations In turn banks respond by creating as many service o\xef\xac\x80erings as permitted by their license beyond their con\xef\xac\x81nes They aim to create innovative services leaving only themselves with just the core This trend creates the risk of a bank evolving into something more similar to a telecommunication company \xe2\x80\x94 a company with a license that no longer sees its clients At BANKEX we see this risk but believe it is right for banks to preserve the status of the most important key element of the world\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81nancial ecosystem Fintech and IT companies should not be disrupters of the banking system Instead they should supplement each other in a mutually bene\xef\xac\x81cial way Several years ago banks and innovative technologies existed separately with banks expressing an interest in external IT products such as certain separate features Today the market has changed leading banks of the world work more and more closely with \xef\xac\x81ntech companies while the \xef\xac\x81ntech companies in turn ceased to see themselves as disruptors triumphing over banks and instead view themselves as partners to banks Everyone acknowledges that of\xef\xac\x82ine bank departments will remain even if nobody goes to them as foundations of faith in the system A customer must understand that the \xef\xac\x81nancial service he receives is that of a bank the bank actually exists it has a department in the city to which the customer can go in case of an issue for assistance This reason at least will remain This isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a domain that might close tomorrow and leave its end client alone with their issue On the other hand \xef\xac\x81ntech and blockchain companies acknowledge that the market share occupied by their products is too small below 10% and in order to amplify it they must partner with banks In other words \xef\xac\x81ntech products must end up at banks Clients in turn will purchase and use innovative \xef\xac\x81nancial products much more willingly if they can do so under the brand of a familiar bank It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that some banks will remain skeptical about integration with \xef\xac\x81ntech companies Luckily the banking community understands that \xef\xac\x81ghting innovation will only result in market share loss On the other hand FinTech innovation alone is not su\xef\xac\x83cient to absorb the exorbitant transaction \xef\xac\x82ows and and vast \xef\xac\x81nancial streams One explanation is that banks don\xe2\x80\x99t trust one another and they don\xe2\x80\x99t trust technological companies They are afraid of losing their client base by partnering with a stronger or more technologically advanced player Decentralized BaaS Model According to McKinsey & Co there are three main trends in banking evolution \xe2\x80\xa2 automation \xe2\x80\xa2 increased regulation \xe2\x80\xa2 increased pace of technological development Blockchain allows to automate di\xef\xac\x80erent processes and banks can bene\xef\xac\x81t from it a lot Accounting legal and risk parts might be automated McKinsey & Co states that blockchain based on advanced cryptography might allow doing such operations in the most e\xef\xac\x80ective safe and transparent way in human history For global players adaptation to such trends will become a vital issue Enhanced \xef\xac\x81nancial regulation will force participants to use partner BaaS platforms as adaptation to new jurisdictions independently will become prohibitively expensive Fast tech development which many of the banks can\xe2\x80\x99t handle will drive banks interest in using other \xef\xac\x81ntech companies\xe2\x80\x99 services It will drive a demand for BaaS usage Decentralized BaaS is the future of banking Why The world has changed and \xef\xac\x81nancial 4 \x0cSuch architecture allows technically complicated applications to constantly evolve without the need to wait for the release of a new version of the product to make changes There is no need to release an updated version of the product if the changes apply only to a small part of the product That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to customize for various business tasks of every enterprise department or person Notably microservices can be fully managed by di\xef\xac\x80erent teams in compliance with di\xef\xac\x80erent standards and are also more available even if one of them crashes it does not lead to the crash of the entire application A uni\xef\xac\x81ed architecture facilitates work in situations where multiple modules need to interact with one another or where classes need to be transferred from one module to another At the same time microservices can guarantee that there will be no shared states between the modules Finally microservices allow you to use multiple technologies and languages depending on business needs (Figure 1) They are concerned that upon close examination their products will not be competitive compared to alternatives They are afraid regulators would penalize them for use of innovations in their base products Another important note is that decisions regarding such risks are made by top managers most of whom are more concerned with protecting their reputation than introducing innovation Technological progress has presented us with solutions to such issues \xe2\x80\x94 organizing mutual trust of participants in the system and trust in operations in the system based on decentralized data storage and automated smart contracts Many professional market players admit that a decentralized BaaS business model is an optimal path to collaboration between classic banks and \xef\xac\x81nancial companies with cutting edge IT companies and continually growing decentralized technological companies of the future Front service of clients remains in the hands of the banks while products are presented by narrowlyoriented product banks or companies We believe that the B2B2C combination of business models and technologies is the key to BANKEX\xe2\x80\x99s success 2 3 2 4 On an Ethereum blockchain micro service architecture is used in the implementation of external oracles At the same time the Ethereum network is itself an example of network that uses the concept of micro services since it contains all the characteristic features of micro services (Figure 2) Classical Microservice Architecture Microservice architecture is a network of module services that can be deployed independently from one another Microservice architecture is an approach to structuring applications whereby they are broken down into smaller independent internal components \xe2\x80\xa2 excess and reservation as each node of the network is autonomous \xe2\x80\xa2 service discovery for automatic con\xef\xac\x81guration of network topology \xe2\x80\xa2 extensibility through the use of other types of micro services (such as oracles micro services allowing to display statistics etc ) Advantages of Microservice Architecture \xe2\x80\xa2 autonomous ownership for di\xef\xac\x80erent microservices within an application The logic of the BANKEX liquidity protocol is based on the concept of the Ethereum smart contract2 and accordingly uses all of its infrastructure advantages At the same time technically the BANKEX protocol is a series of smart contract updates however these smart contract updates are not micro services themselves the micro services are in relation between API calls themselves From our side the business tasks of the protocol which require a classical micro service architecture are realized through the creation of the oracle system Protocol oracles are designed strictly according to the principles of the micro services that is the instances of these oracles should be automatically added under the required conditions In this case dynamic \xe2\x80\xa2 agility application micro components can be developed and tested in autonomous decentralized teams much faster \xe2\x80\xa2 improved scalability (scaling independent of other components on demand scaling) \xe2\x80\xa2 continuous delivery and deployment of microcomponents A monolithic architecture is much easier in implementation control and deployment while microservices require careful management as they are deployed on di\xef\xac\x80erent servers and use API 2 Blockchain Servi\xd1\x81e Architecture The phrase \xe2\x80\x9csmart contract\xe2\x80\x9d was coined by Nick Szabo initially in [10] and later in [9] 5 \x0cMonolythic Architecture Microservice Architecture UI Microservice D UI

\x0cbalancing of the number of oracle instances is used Part of the BANKEX oracles is implemented on the basis of Microsoft Azure cloud technologies since it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most bank friendly platforms An example of the protocol logic was realized through the interaction with the signals from Internet of Things sensors But for the description of the BANKEX Proofof Asset protocol the de\xef\xac\x81nition of the micro service architecture is not entirely correct BANKEX team calls it the Blockchain Service Architecture Moreover the Smart Asset retains all the features of a blockchain Smart Contract \xe2\x80\x94 everyone is able to see what value is behind it and how truthful it is You can add your own logic block to the BlockchainService chain \xe2\x80\x94 Proof of Asset Protocol because it is an open source code To do that \xe2\x80\x94 you will need to address the BANKEX Foundation community 2 6 Blockchain Service Architecture is a sequence of smart contracts every step of which can be customized by a predetermined pool of actors validated for the particular step of the included smart contracts while the contents of contracts in a step and the number of steps are embedded in the business logic necessary to tokenize the Smart Asset It is an asset tokenization constructor but one that only works in a sequence of smart contracts correctly arranged after one another supplemented with oracles connected as micro services This allows to tokenize an asset with maximum precision and transparency for all participants of the market while also working in line with the open source BANKEX Proof Of Asset protocol 2 5 Bene\xef\xac\x81ts of the Blockchain Service Architecture Why would the service architecture of the future use blockchain In the existing infrastructure a large application or product consists of a large number of modules which are almost always developed by di\xef\xac\x80erent teams and even if the teams work within the same bank they still requires a large number of cash \xef\xac\x82ows between di\xef\xac\x80erent participants in the system and a large amount of agreements and inspections It is costly time consuming and very likely to result in mistakes including system errors Blockchain helps automate the chain of transactions increasing reliability transaction transparency and removing ine\xef\xac\x83ciencies and bureaucratic hurdles It lowers the risk of human mistakes and for many operations completely removes the need for human intervention This will make your business faster lower your costs and increase the market\xe2\x80\x99s trust in you Finally Blockchain Service Architecture will allow you to build in the best way a product line \xef\xac\x81tting with the trend of personalization and to o\xef\xac\x80er unique solutions to consumers exactly when they really need it Blockchain technologies are perfectly suited for this task as they provide an infrastructure with an open register of immutable operations The \xef\xac\x81rst release of the Proof of Asset protocol relies on the established technology of open blockchains most importantly Ethereum Technologies for the creation of private blockchains are currently on their way to becoming established and accepted by the industry Thus the \xef\xac\x81rst release focuses on the tokenization of open assets In the future the algorithm will be adapted to private blockchains in line with their readiness for industrial application We see the current issues with \xef\xac\x81nancial instruments from within we see how many ine\xef\xac\x83ciencies exist between market participants Our mission is to provide technologies that market participants will like that will improve upon the current market structure and that will enable the same people \xe2\x80\x94 the same market participants to interact more e\xef\xac\x83ciently and above all more pro\xef\xac\x81tably Complexity regulation of the Blockchain Service Architecture We often hear from technical experts Your protocol is too complicated Other technical gurus say \xe2\x80\x94 your protocol is too simple Yes they are correct The complexity of the BANKEX protocol which is based on the Blockchain Service Architecture is regulated by the increase/decrease in the number of smart contracts in the tokenization logic (Figure 3) The creation of a smart asset of a certain type does not necessary use all the steps that are laid out in the Blockchain Service Architecture only the steps of the smart contract chain that are required by a particular Smart Asset are used The simplest Smart Asset consists of three steps initialization validation and valuation And in this case the Smart Asset will ful\xef\xac\x81ll its mission \xe2\x80\x94 make the asset liquid It\xe2\x80\x99s not complicated at all At the same time BANKEX is an old company in the sphere of \xef\xac\x81nancial technologies classic \xef\xac\x81ntech We know very well how complex \xef\xac\x81nancial tools can be and how di\xef\xac\x83cult it is to properly formalize them Our solution is the Blockchain Service Architecture \xe2\x80\x94 exactly what you need You can add any level of complexity to the asset tokenization chain which will result in a Smart Asset 7 \x0cAdditional Information Initial Information Smart Contract 2 Smart Contract 1 Smart Contract N 1 Smart

This as a result requires the buyer to check the described characteristics in order to make a purchasing decision This happens because this \xe2\x80\x9casset\xe2\x80\x9d is not digitized at the outset so the mechanics of selling it become more complicated compared to the sale of a similar new asset To address this problem various niche technological services emerged that assist in making an asset more liquid while also facilitating trust between each sides of the deal Services do this in di\xef\xac\x80erent ways from simple announcement boards to complex internet services with risk insurance included These services make an asset \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandable\xe2\x80\x9d to the market after which said asset becomes signi\xef\xac\x81cantly more liquid than it initially is This is an example of digitization of an asset giving it liquidity But tokenization is di\xef\xac\x80erent from digitization digitization is about creating descriptions its consumer characteristics photographing etc Tokenization beyond the aforementioned steps adds \xef\xac\x81nancial components \xe2\x80\x94 automated smart contracts for deal execution commands for automatic transactions formulas for calculation of the asset price automatic validation of the initial data and much more So digitization is about asset description and its Liquidity of an asset is the ability to sell or buy the asset quickly without signi\xef\xac\x81cant change in its price Higher liquidity alleviates the trade o\xef\xac\x80 between the price of an asset it can be sold/bought for and the speed of its sale People have preference for liquidity such a theory was \xef\xac\x81rst introduced by John Maynard Keynes [3] Many theories and empirical studies suggest that lower liquidity results in underrated value stored in assets [1] Making these assets more liquid will help unlock the value Protocol of liquidity is a derivative of what we refer to as The BANKEX Proof of Asset protocol We call it that because today unless it possesses a certain description of characteristics it is fairly di\xef\xac\x83cult to sell an asset even if at \xef\xac\x81rst glance it appears liquid For instance a new consumer good as an asset is fully liquid \xe2\x80\x94 all one needs to do is list it in an online store making it possible for an end client to buy it But not all types of assets and even not all of the simplest consumer goods have deliberately truthful characteristics and a capacity for digitization The most common example a used consumer good requires at least a description of changes to its base characteristics and then the buyer needs to be con8 \x0cpublishing on the market Tokenization is about asset description validation by oracles asset price calculation automated audit calculation of cash \xef\xac\x82ows based on its price execution of the SmartDeal One of the major reasons for tokenization of an asset is the possibility to avoid fraud that may be present in the case of classic digitization A good can be digitized but might also contain false information in its description Often it is di\xef\xac\x83cult for an asset owner to see the real information about cash \xef\xac\x82ows even if there is no intention to hide them BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol provides the proof that an asset and its cash \xef\xac\x82ows are authentic We remind you that this BANKEX White Paper uses examples and demonstrations only as demonstrative examples of the SmartDeal technology The business of BANKEX involves manufacturing \xef\xac\x81ntech products and tokenizing primarily \xef\xac\x81nancial assets although we do not think it impossible to apply the Proof of Asset Protocol in other \xef\xac\x81elds with approval from the BANKEX Foundation in case of non\xef\xac\x81nancial Smart Assets 2 8 Mathematical Market Models for Smart Asset and empirical Most of the theoretical research papers model market maker as a single player with whom other market players can trade with no trading activity apart from that On the other hand there are some research papers where market makers compete with middlemen (dealers/brokers) In this model the author introduces market makers to a model by D Spulber with buyers sellers and dealers A number of researchers have focused on the optimal behavior of a market maker (specialist) Some papers examine the e\xef\xac\x80ect of risk aversion and inventory on the pricing policies of a market maker In another paper the authors study the pro\xef\xac\x81tability of market making strategies Other researchers model bid ask spread as a need to compensate for losses due to adverse selection problem traders who engage in trade with a market maker might know information that the market maker does not know Recent papers have focused on combining \xef\xac\x81nancial market maker model with the \xef\xac\x81eld of arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence high frequency trading has made a signi\xef\xac\x81cant footprint in market marking models For example Abraham Othman combines two concepts \xe2\x80\x94 automated market making from the arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence literature and risk measures from the \xef\xac\x81nance literature In another paper the author studies the impact of high frequency market making on liquidity price discovery and institutional traders\xe2\x80\x99 returns Making What is market making Market maker is a player on a market for a good or security who provides both buy and sell opportunities for traders thus making this market more liquid Market makers hold both the security/good and cash in inventories in order to be able to take the opposite side of trading order volume to \xef\xac\x81x imbalance in buy and sell orders Market makers earn on bid ask spreads but bear the risks of price decline of their inventories Benefits of market making \xe2\x80\xa2 liquidity provision (buyers and sellers do not need to make orders simultaneously) \xe2\x80\xa2 reduction in dealers\xe2\x80\x99 bid ask spreads due to MM publicly quoting prices Key players \xe2\x80\xa2 traders responsible for creation of purchasing/sell orders \xe2\x80\xa2 less uncertainty due to market maker displaying quotes publicly \xe2\x80\xa2 market makers (specialists) display public buy & sell quotations for a guaranteed number of securities/goods to traders and ful\xef\xac\x81ll orders from traders at these quotations \xe2\x80\xa2 lower search costs because traders do not need to search other traders or dealers to sell at good price \xe2\x80\xa2 dealers buy and sell securities/goods from

\xe2\x80\xa2 lower transaction costs for all players due to centralized exchange Liquid trade is of great importance for the stability and e\xef\xac\x80ectiveness of \xef\xac\x81nancial markets Market making is an established trading practice which has inspired much research both theoretical \xe2\x80\xa2 lower market volatility because \xef\xac\x82uctuations of demand and supply are smoothed 9 \x0cExamples of market makers today We see that selling public equities takes several seconds bonds can be sold within a day municipal bonds would take weeks or months Private equities \xe2\x80\x94 10 years real estate \xe2\x80\x94 5\xe2\x80\x9310 years objects of infrastructure such as bridges roads or factories \xe2\x80\x93 tens of years Works of art may wait for their buyer more than 50 years In this situation blockchain tokens which can be bought and sold on a decentralized blockchain in less than 10\xe2\x80\x9330 minutes are an opportunity to tokenize everything that currently takes longer than that to sell The potential tokenization market includes everything that sells over days weeks or years Meaning potential for the tokenization market is enormous The issue currently being addressed by the best blockchains in the world \xe2\x80\x94 Ethereum and Bitcoin the issue of having to wait several minutes to receive several transaction con\xef\xac\x81rmations is no issue to us Asset Tokenization does not work on the market of assets liquid enough to be sold in seconds The Market Opportunity of BANKEX Asset Tokenization stands to the right of Tokens on Figure 5 We therefore do not compete or \xef\xac\x81ght for the assets that take seconds to sell This is the market of Ripple3 \xe2\x80\x94 the world\xe2\x80\x99s only enterprise blockchain solution for global payments To them instantaneous transactions are key unlike liquidity of Smart Assets during tokenization where a few seconds don\xe2\x80\x99t matter In our opinion target assets for tokenization can include classes of assets with summary capitalization exceeding 100 million USD They also play a major role in stock exchanges and historically exchanges have often appointed trading \xef\xac\x81rms to act as o\xef\xac\x83cial market makers for speci\xef\xac\x81c equities \xe2\x80\xa2 market makers typically either own or are members of an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade \xe2\x80\xa2 NYSE designates a single market maker for each stock known as the specialist for that stock In contrast NASDAQ allows several market makers for each stock \xe2\x80\xa2 HFT \xef\xac\x81rms buy and sell simultaneously pro\xef\xac\x81ting from spreads thus they are market makers however without formally being designated so They forecast increases in buy orders volume buy before other buyers and then sell to them at a higher price The BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol includes Smart Asset Exchange support of liquidity of Smart Assets being traded within the protocol is an important task for BANKEX It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that market making to support liquidity of Smart Assets in OrderBook is a more complex task than it is on a classic stock market This is due to certain types of Smart Assets having more characteristics that a\xef\xac\x80ect price than the classic balance of supply and demand Another signi\xef\xac\x81cant note is that the BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol is based on the Ethereum blockchain meaning Smart Asset tokens issued in the ecosystem of BANKEX can be traded on any market supporting the ERC20 standard 3 3 2 Target assets for tokenization 3 1 We receive hundreds of requests can our business in the real sector be tokenized and how Many business owners see an opportunity to fund their business using crypto economics via ICO or ITO Experienced businessmen understand this capital to them is signi\xef\xac\x81cantly less costly compared to classical sources of capital and is also associated with less administrative risk as the business decision making center stays in the hands of the owner In crypto economics there can be no board of directors with members who are non amicable to you Types of Assets and Asset Requirements Everything in our world is relatively liquid The Figure 4 is taken from a report [7] by Blockstone \xe2\x80\x94 one of the biggest equity funds in USA demonstrating that everything is liquid and has a duration of sale They mention that investing into assets that could seem insu\xef\xac\x83ciently liquid at \xef\xac\x81rst may in fact result in greater pro\xef\xac\x81tability than other assets 3 Choosing a Role in New Economy Coin or Smart Asset Ripple provides global \xef\xac\x81nancial settlement solutions to enable the world to exchange value like it already exchanges information \xe2\x80\x94 giving rise to an Internet of Value (IoV) Ripple solutions lower the total cost of settlement by enabling banks to transact directly instantly and with certainty of settlement Banks around the world are partnering with Ripple to improve their cross border payment o\xef\xac\x80erings and to join the growing global network of \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions and market makers laying the foundation for the Internet of Value https //ripple com/xrp/ 10 \x0cFigure 4 Everything Is (Relatively) Liquid Based on [7] source [2] For illustrative purposes only Figure 5 Realizing the Value of Liquid Assets Takes Time 11 \x0c(b) Distributed asset You own several o\xef\xac\x83ce buildings that are rented out several rooms at a time You can easily see the authenticity of cash \xef\xac\x82ow from the entire asset but you may \xef\xac\x81nd it very di\xef\xac\x83cult even downright impossible to \xef\xac\x81gure out the authenticity of cash \xef\xac\x82ow from a single o\xef\xac\x83ce room In terms of forming a new economy BANKEX sees a solution to real business funding in separating technological and infrastructure projects from projects in the \xef\xac\x81eld of business operating industrial and manufacturing assets Technological and infrastructure projects that can help decentralized economy develop and become bigger more convenient as well as expand usage of technology over the globe can de\xef\xac\x81nitely receive funding via ICO But what about projects in the real economy segment that require tokenization but lack strong technological teams experienced IT founders \xef\xac\x81nancial evangelists We all know the crowdsale mechanism will only work with in\xef\xac\x82uential founders powerful ideas and a fully transparent vision of the project\xe2\x80\x99s technological realization The answer is obvious use the technology and infrastructure of core projects in decentralized economy including ones utilizing an open source protocol The BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol is precisely this kind of solution We present to you the procedure of creating a Smart Asset \xe2\x80\x94 ISAO (Initial Smart Asset Offering) based on decentralization protocols such as the BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol Your asset even if it\xe2\x80\x99s an o\xef\xac\x84ine business will be able to attract resources by tokenizing its assets using already made powerful technological protocols You don\xe2\x80\x99t need an ICO procedure instead you can perform Asset Tokenization of your business using ISAO It\xe2\x80\x99s simple Use Smart Asset Businesses (farms stores manufacturing enterprises) referred to as Smart Assets in our White Paper can be tokenized as part of the ISAO procedure subsequently forming an Asset Community and receiving returns via Smart Deal 3 3 (c) Standardized end product This would allow us to identify meta information when creating a Smart Asset It\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to be able to bring it to a single basis (d) Fungibility (tradability) The possibility of trading one for another One asset for another asset since you as an owner are not concerned with what the asset is What matters is the cash \xef\xac\x82ow provided by this asset (e) Use of token as a mean of payment for endproduct An option that would allow the ISAO token released not to be too similar to a payment obligation A Smart Asset token insures receiving payment but it can also be used as a means of payment For example it can be bought to \xef\xac\x81nance construction of a building but then this same token can be used to rent a room in this building As a result it becomes a utility token which is important (f) Use of the token to own a large asset by a high number of investors and easy means for a buyer to exit co ownership of a large asset If an asset can simultaneously be owned by a large number of owners then it\xe2\x80\x99s makes entry into asset ownership easier A classical example is shared ownership of large real estate or non public company shares Entering such assets with a small share is very complicated at the time Requirements and Options for Asset Tokenization (g) Ability to automatically and unambiguously measure characteristics that directly or indirectly indicate a potential quantity and quality of end products The ability to integrate regular IoT audit of an asset signi\xef\xac\x81cantly increases the quality of Smart Asset monitoring It\xe2\x80\x99s a signi\xef\xac\x81cant competitive advantage over auditing or rating agencies whose annual surveys become inferior to real time IoT audit Over the years working in classic \xef\xac\x81ntech we have become accustomed to always seek situations that have some sort of problem Today we realize that in each of these searches we would also e\xef\xac\x80ectively seek out a problem that prevented an asset from being truly liquid Below are several problems causing a decrease of an asset\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity and the more of the below qualities your asset has \xe2\x80\x93 the more attractive tokenization of such an asset would be Tokenization of assets gains the greatest value under the following conditions (h) Possibility to withdraw an asset from the owner if the terms of the contract are not ful\xef\xac\x81lled This means that aside from auditing a contract and tokenizing with an escrow module there is the option of trading the asset receiving collateral or di\xef\xac\x80erent contract conditions in the event of a breach of terms (a) Presence of a large number of asset owners This means the asset has multiple owners who can have di\xef\xac\x83culty reaching a consensus 12 \x0c(i) Control of end product sales and minimization of the possibility of sales that are not accounted for This feature does not suit all cases What this means is that the end product that is tokenized and funded is traced In the event of tokenizing an agricultural asset such as strawberry IoT sensors need to be installed that would calculate the number of grown berries to determine whether all of the manufactured berries have brought the appropriate cash \xef\xac\x82ow These IoT sensors must detect the entire lifetime of an asset up to the generation of cash \xef\xac\x82ow kens of this Smart Asset At the same time shareholders are essentially not changing All presence rights of token holders are passed to the SPV For non public companies that don\xe2\x80\x99t want changes in their board of governing shareholders obtaining liquidity of their capital via tokenization of part of their equity into a Smart Asset is essentially the only mutually acceptable option for all sides involved For early investors this method of investment becomes a new step to decreasing investment risks and as a result increases the possibility of investment into formerly unavailable assets (j) Assets the transfer of which require high legal and accounting expenditures Early investors frequently want to sell their assets at the peak of pro\xef\xac\x81tability while other investors are similarly interested in entering ownership of said assets Tokenization will make such deals signi\xef\xac\x81cantly simpler and cheaper 3 5 3 4 Fundamental Advantage of Tokenization for an Asset The analytical block of BANKEX gathering and analyzing \xef\xac\x81nancial technologies from all over the world for several years is seeing an interesting trend that has been forming around \xef\xac\x81nancial tools during the last few years If we take apart the basic needs of a person or a company in terms of movement of funds it would be easy to discover that every person or company does not have that many basic \xef\xac\x81nancial needs namely Example Tokenizing Shares in Non Public Companies To give an example of high suitability for tokenization let us examine late stage private shares that have yet to go public These are assets that require very high legal accounting and administration costs There are many investors in non public companies who early ones in particular are ready to sell their shares while other investors are interested in entering But such companies are not public and their shares cannot be traded on the public stock market Furthermore they frequently can\xe2\x80\x99t be resold without the approval of company board since company management must control who their private shareholders are and prevent their number from exceeding a certain quantity because otherwise they would breach the limit of investors and become a public company These limitations born from the ine\xef\xac\x83ciency of a historically established system are an inconvenience to everyone involved \xe2\x80\x94 both the investors and the company board In particular this ine\xef\xac\x83ciency may often lead to disagreements among shareholders and the stalling of company development Blockchain technologies allow the necessary details on shares to be recorded in a Smart Contract Part of the company share intended for early investors or investors with a miniscule share is tokenized as an asset in a Smart Asset Its nominal holder can be any entity permitted by the legislation of the company\xe2\x80\x99s location such as an SPV After that from the nominal token holder\xe2\x80\x99s perspective they can easily change upon reaching consensus among themselves as buyers or sellers of to \xe2\x80\xa2 spending money \xe2\x80\xa2 moving money \xe2\x80\xa2 storing money \xe2\x80\xa2 earning money By correlating these basic \xef\xac\x81nancial needs with the current range of \xef\xac\x81nancial technologies it turns out that today there is a strong leaning towards saturation of certain needs with \xef\xac\x81nancial technologies \xe2\x80\xa2 spending money \xe2\x80\x94 the need that is most saturated and easiest to digitize There are currently thousands of companies that help a person or a company to easily and quickly spend their money \xe2\x80\xa2 moving money \xe2\x80\x94 similar in terms of saturation but this basic need has several unresolved issues including ones currently being addressed by our colleagues at Ripple \xe2\x80\xa2 storing money \xe2\x80\x94 the need for people and companies to keep their money in their pockets is virtually non existent today having fully been digitized and moved to plastic cards and a whole range of innovative solutions The BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol allows people and organizations to ful\xef\xac\x81ll an important vital need \xe2\x80\x94 the need to earn money By becoming part of the Asset Community you will have the option of 13 \x0cearning and thus realizing yourself in \xef\xac\x81elds of your choosing Cryptocurrencies solve the global issue of digitization of the human need to earn money and altogether the emergence of cryptocurrencies is a technological response solving this fundamental issue SmartDeal based on open source Smart Asset by the Proof of Asset Protocol is the next step You will be able to build your future with your own hands 4 the simplest example being an IT company or ecommerce o\xef\xac\x80ering their clients more and more new services including \xef\xac\x81nancial ones They are originators It is also fair to assume that there is the option of tokenizing an end client\xe2\x80\x99s assets without the participation of a product storefront That\xe2\x80\x99s why based on the methodology of processing data in blockchain systems we de\xef\xac\x81ne two di\xef\xac\x80erent types of originators (Figure 7) Originator Agent \xe2\x80\x94 an organization (such as a bank) which serves as a storefront for an end client is the owner of client data or searches for clients wishing to conduct tokenization Originator End client \xe2\x80\x94 an end client wishing to create a Smart Asset in the BANKEX ecosystem which will be backed by an provided asset Originator Product Owner and Supplier 4 1 Schematic of the Proof of Asset Protocol In previous sections we have examined the Bank asa Service product model and the concept of Smart Asset Tokenization These are two big entities so you may want to know just how BANKEX combines them in its protocol The Proof of Asset Protocol is the technology for interaction of multiple sides that normally take part in \xef\xac\x81nancial deals but the most important systemforming sides of the protocol are these three Several important notes Both roles can be \xef\xac\x81lled by one and the same organization simultaneously For instance a bank tokenizing assets that the bank itself owns From a technological standpoint it is also possible to omit the Originator Agent role in the event of for example an end client owning a large asset that they can tokenize themselves To that end an Originator End client asset needs to have su\xef\xac\x83cient capitalization For small end clients work through an Originator Agent is the only possible method to create a liquid Smart Asset This will be discussed further as we will examine this very situation in the form of merging requests into portfolios and possibly securitization It is also easy to see that tokenization is no threat to Originator Agents such as banks that are owners of storefronts or end clients but rather an opportunity for them to provide their end clients with new services and bene\xef\xac\x81ts in merging client requests (also similar to securitization) Thus the Originator in the protocol has the following characteristics \xe2\x80\xa2 originator \xe2\x80\xa2 supplier \xe2\x80\xa2 product owner Let us examine them using the schematic depicted on the Figure 6 4 2 Originator On the left side of the schematic is the asset The originator is the owner of the asset that is being tokenized The BANKEX protocol allows for the originator to have di\xef\xac\x80erent roles On the schematic for example the Originator is marked as an end client As we\xe2\x80\x99ve already said the originator is the owner of the asset tokenized But despite the originator being the owner of the asset being tokenized he can also serve as the storefront for products of other originators (types of tokenization types of Smart Assets) This is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed while examining the BaaS model Normally the originator for \xef\xac\x81nancial assets is a Bank but even today it can be an internet platform (ecosystem) ecommerce a \xef\xac\x81ntech platform a stock exchange a broker an insurance company Meaning this is the company the end client goes to the owner of a client Anyone can see this almost daily \xe2\x80\xa2 role creator of the Smart Asset \xe2\x80\xa2 function providing asset for tokenization initiating Smart Asset creation Here\xe2\x80\x99s a simple example a small business enterprise (SME ) Originator End client comes to a bank Originator Agent wishing to receive a small business enterprise loan Product (Smart Asset Type) The bank has a product small business enterprise loan Product Instance 1 and receives the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s request Next the bank has its scoring procedure for this enterprise in order to make a decision on the loan but the results of scoring mean that the loan cannot 14 \x0cFigure 6 Asset \xe2\x80\x94 BANKEX \xe2\x80\x94 Exchange \xe2\x80\x94 Capital Originator Originator End Client (customer fund portfolio) Originator Agent (bank ecom \xef\xac\x81ntech IT ecosystem etc ) Smart Asset Type (choose product tokenization type) Figure 7 Asset Originator be given according to the bank\xe2\x80\x99s rules Product Instance 1 The bank automatically checks other available product instances \xef\xac\x81tting the request and \xef\xac\x81nds an alternative such as small business crowdfunding Product Instance 2 the requirements of which are well suited for Originator End client Then the deal can be made As a result the bank gives the client the product they require while also keeping their client and satisfying them instead of turning them down and forcing them to look for a di\xef\xac\x80erent bank which may lead to irreversible loss of a client for the bank 4 3 creates new types of Smart Assets for the Originator At the time of Summer 2017 the BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol ecosystem has two functioning Product Owners \xe2\x80\x94 daughter company Findelivery4 (founded in 2015) and BANKEX Lab (founded in 2016) It was BANKEX Lab that created the Smart Asset Types that you can try out today by using the tokenization demo https // dev web prototype bankex azurewebsites net/ Obviously the mission of developing and creating all types of SmartAsset the world needs neither can nor should be undertaken by the \xef\xac\x81ntech team of BANKEX Lab alone That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to us that more and more smart contract developers from banks and \xef\xac\x81ntech companies as well as blockchain community specialists join the Proof of Asset Protocol ecosystem Product Owner Vision Product Owner \xe2\x80\x94 a company that creates various \xef\xac\x81ntech products In the future it will become something more both the company and the community that create product technologies together It\xe2\x80\x99s a Solution provider Product provider and \xef\xac\x81nally Technology Provider Mainly it is a company that owns the technology of Smart Asset creation based on the Blockchain Service Architecture and it 4 BANKEX is creating the protocol architecture with the goal of creating various types of Smart Assets and in our ideal vision of the future every type of asset will come to have an Asset Community formed for its development support and audit Findelivery (for Google Findostavka) \xe2\x80\x94 \xef\xac\x81ntech company on russian market The company provides services delivery of bank cards remote conclusion of contracts remote o\xef\xac\x84ine KYC clients of the bank The company has an operating pro\xef\xac\x81t https //findostavka online/en 15 \x0csolutions must stand the test of time To solve this issue BANKEX utilizes the concept of the Smart Asset Certi\xef\xac\x81cation Center Its key mission is a synergy of interaction between classical \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions and the newest decentralized communities This concept is already functioning today Despite being an innovative approach we have already turned to it in reality several times Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it works On the one hand BANKEX is a classical \xef\xac\x81ntech company known and valued in many classical banks and \xef\xac\x81nancial institutes On the other hand founders of BANKEX are all fairly experienced members of the blockchain community This allows synergy when evaluating the Solidity of open source code of new Smart Assets Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it is done currently We must note that for di\xef\xac\x80ering locations and jurisdictions the same Smart Asset (Product) would have a di\xef\xac\x80ering Product Instance because for the moment di\xef\xac\x80erent countries have di\xef\xac\x80erent laws and legal conditions for transaction processing This means an enormous number of tasks for developers for programmers who will be working on the Smart Asset code that will change the way deals are made in the whole world Realization of this task is upon the BANKEX Foundation Every Product Owner can become part of the BANKEX Foundation and make his own contribution to the tokenization of deals worldwide An important function of the Asset Community in the BANKEX Foundation is support of Product Owners by providing access to product expertise and security audit of the written smart contract code CEO of the BANKEX Foundation Petr Korolev5 successfully worked with the BANKEX Lab team to develop one of the Product Instances of the protocol in August 2017 at a hackathon BANKEX\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum storage of mortgage securities earned BANKEX \xef\xac\x81rst prize6 of the blockchain hackathon from the hands of Ethereum Foundation Council\xe2\x80\x99s Vitalik Buterin During development the Blockchain Service Architecture methodology was used which allowed the creation of a superior quality Product Instance from scratch both signi\xef\xac\x81cantly quicker and more e\xef\xac\x83ciently than other competitors It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that Product Owner just like separate Product Instances is a business A Product Owner can issue Smart Asset tokens and subsequently provide product expertise o\xef\xac\x80er audit services or technical support for his Smart Asset Type together with the BANKEX Foundation 4 4 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xef\xac\x81rst the Product Owner creates the Smart Asset code and the code goes to BANKEX Lab \xe2\x80\xa2 next BANKEX Lab conducts code analysis using in house programmers \xe2\x80\xa2 next even after the brilliant technical expertise of BANKEX Lab\xe2\x80\x99s inhouse team the program code is sent for audit to our partners with old school global technology consultancy receiving feedback on code quality from top level IT specialists working with leading technological brands in the world \xe2\x80\xa2 next step the updated code is sent to be checked by programmers from several blockchain communities Their experience is priceless Almost all of them have had a chance to learn the price of Smart Contract bugs on their own wallets Product Owner Certi\xef\xac\x81cation Obviously both Product and Product Instances created by the Product Owner based on the Proof ofAsset Protocol must be certi\xef\xac\x81ed This is particularly important for \xef\xac\x81nancial Smart Assets That\xe2\x80\x99s why the ecosystem includes the Smart Asset Certification Center (SACC ) The mission of the certi\xef\xac\x81cation center is to ensure the security of Smart Assets created Today we can see an industry paradox which is that the blockchain created as a technological solution to ensure \xef\xac\x81rst and foremost the security of transactions is frequently attacked and such attacks are occasionally successful We understand that this is the issue of blockchain technology\xe2\x80\x99s rapid development and new 5 6 \xe2\x80\xa2 as the \xef\xac\x81nal step of the code audit the code is validated together with all suggested \xef\xac\x81xes from all sources by members of the BANKEX Foundation together with the Asset Community and other friendly blockchain foundations This process may at \xef\xac\x81rst glance seem to take more time to validate the Smart Asset code\xe2\x80\x99s quality but when you are steeped in the atmosphere of blockchain research and development you come to realize that in green\xef\xac\x81eld smart product development experience of programmers with various training backgrounds allows to achieve impressive results and optimal code quality as quickly as possible GitHub of Petr Korolev https //github com/skywinder GitHub of the winning solution https //github com/BankEx/Blockchain Hackathon Kazan 16 \x0cResulting from the work of the Smart Asset Certi\xef\xac\x81cation Center you receive a guarantee of the Smart Asset code\xe2\x80\x99s safety from Bankex a company well known and recognized by the global \xef\xac\x81nancial community and listed among the top 50 \xef\xac\x81ntech companies worldwide7 It can be added that the BANKEX team being a pioneer on the market of legally valid audit of Smart Assets understands that audit of blockchain based smart contracts is a new and enormous industry that will augment and possibly replace the existing order of business consulting We are ready to work in this direction with all players interested in smart contract security from community teams to consulting leaders We have no agreements with consulting on paper but we are negotiating these matters with virtually all the world leaders of consulting and audit such as Microsoft E&Y PWC Deloitte and others Their interest in this topic over the last year has greatly increased and that is the correct approach for everyone 4 5 Product \xe2\x80\x94 a Smart Asset Token consisting of a chain of smart contracts based on the Blockchain Service Architecture methodology and the rules of the BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol The methodology gives the option of creating a Smart Asset on any blockchain but currently all Smart Assets are being created by the BANKEX team on the Ethereum blockchain Formulas written into the product set the rules for product info that has to be digitized by the Originator and Supplier during tokenization determining the interconnection between three of the main entities of the protocol We call this \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Asset initialization data\xe2\x80\x9d 4 6 Smart Asset After examining the entity of the Product Owner we now understand that the Proof of Asset Protocol is able to realize a multitude of product solutions and Product Instances depending on application location and legal conditions The number of Product Instances is not limited so to introduce the Product in a new country or account for a change in current legal conditions the Product Owner needs only update the Smart Asset formulas and releases a new Product Instance With time a large number of Product Instances is going to form for every Smart Asset Type and this number will form a product catalogue that the protocol\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem will interact with The BANKEX team calls this the \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Asset Catalog\xe2\x80\x9d Let\xe2\x80\x99s examine how members of the BANKEX ecosystem interact with the Smart Asset Catalog using a schematic As you can see we have the BANKEX Lab Product Owner 1 which for instance has created a Smart Asset \xe2\x80\x94 Blockchain KYC Product This technology is going to be listed in the Smart Asset Catalog Product Catalog of the Proof of Asset Protocol catalogue This is very similar to Product Containers utilized in classical banking development Let\xe2\x80\x99s say that next two companies came to the ecosystem Company A from Japan and Company B from USA with the intention to sell the Blockchain KYC technology Product in their countries For these companies and more importantly together with them as they have better understanding of the particular traits of business in their country the BANKEX Lab Product Owner 1 develops a Blockchain KYC Product solution for the Japanese market Product Instance 1 as well as a solution for the US market Prod Product Owner Basic Information In the last few segments we have determined the mission of the Product Owner \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a company that creates various products meaning types of Smart Assets based on the Proof of Asset Protocol The Product Owner has the following characteristics in the protocol \xe2\x80\xa2 role technology owner \xe2\x80\xa2 function to provide technology to Originators in order to tokenize assets To create various Products and Product Instances on the BANKEX for members of the BANKEX ecosystem Every Product Owner is a member of the BANKEX Foundation Products and Product Instances that come from Product Owners must be certi\xef\xac\x81ed using the Smart Asset Certi\xef\xac\x81cation Center Let us examine the Product Owner from an initial data standpoint using the schematic on Figure 8 A new Product Owner joining the Smart Asset ecosystem must provide basic registration info To become a member of the BANKEX Foundation this needs to be a company with a registered legal entity and a bank account Code of products created by the Product Owner can go not only through a BANKEX audit but also audit of other organizations and community teams via the Smart Asset Certi\xef\xac\x81cation Center 7 Product Owner Catalog According to \xe2\x80\x9cTop 50 Financial IT Path\xef\xac\x81nder Ranking\xe2\x80\x9d [11] 17 \x0cProduct Owner (bank \xef\xac\x81ntech) Product Product registration data Product audit by BankEx Foundation adn other Escrow Setup Originator product data Setup Supplier product data Product Smart Asset Tokenization and Other Magic Figure 8 Product Owner uct Instance 2 Next let\xe2\x80\x99s imagine some time after the above a \xef\xac\x81ntech lab called Another Lab Product Owner 2 develops a Smart Asset for the Blockchain KYC technology Product which gives this technology new consumer features which could be either superior or inferior to the predecessor In order to introduce this new technology to the Proof of Asset Protocol ecosystem Another Lab Product Owner 2 chooses the country and jurisdiction where they wish to apply their solution and they \xef\xac\x81nd an integrator Company D Company D is for instance a company on the market of Singapore where it realizes its solution Product Instance 3 which updates the product catalog for the Blockchain KYC technology Product with a new instance It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that Smart Asset pioneers who hold the role of Product Owners of their technologies can realize Product Instances for the \xef\xac\x81rst solutions on their own without the need to involve third party integrators Decentralized Product technology allows to perform integration in the most e\xef\xac\x83cient way possible skipping steps that would not apply to a particular situation Now let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the Smart Asset Catalog from a competition standpoint Obviously instances on markets of di\xef\xac\x80erent countries will have little to no competition amongst themselves They are located in di\xef\xac\x80erent countries the markets of which are for now developing independently But it\xe2\x80\x99s also obvious that Product Owners who harness the technology of building Smart Assets will begin to expand to newer and newer markets utilizing new integration partners With the technology developing further there will come a day when several Product Instances form in the same country and the same legal \xef\xac\x81eld This will serve as the push to technological competition between Smart Assets There will come a future age of competition between Smart Asset Tokens dedicated to the same Smart Asset Type In this competition of fully digitized and tokenized assets the main competitive advantage would be the actual performance of the asset as well as the outstanding algorithms and value calculation formulas of Smart Assets and subsequent Smart Deals Competitive advantages of the old world that are achieved through a di\xef\xac\x80erent kind of bene\xef\xac\x81ts will become a thing of the past This is an enormous quality increase for people in the whole world as they will have access to assets distinguished by their performance On the side of the BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol ecosystem the Instance Switcher block comes into play responsible for switching between Product Instances within a single product container Within the Instance Switcher Product Instances are processed and arranged \xef\xac\x81ltered based on various parameters competing among themselves for buyer requests Inside the Instance Switcher every product container has its own Instance Trigger that selects optimal Product Instances out of those available for a product based on the criteria set by the client Until now we have observed the Smart Asset Catalog top to bottom from the Product Owner to the Product Catalog but with the emergence of competing Product Instances the logic of analysis changes instead and we go from bottom to top seeing the picture of product choice in its entirety As competition emerges it\xe2\x80\x99s the consumer who determines which Product Instance he will choose and that is exactly how the process of bidding begins within a single type of Smart Assets The Instance Switcher can therefore 18 \x0cbe viewed as an analogue of the classical order book A buyer\xe2\x80\x99s request falls into this order book following the client\xe2\x80\x99s product choice This is how a decentralized product exchange begins \xe2\x80\x94 the Smart Asset Exchange 4 7 tential We are aware that in order to create a global technology the participants of said technology must not be limited so the Supplier Accreditation procedure is not a limit Is it merely one of the smart contracts within the chain of Supplier tokenization and in the event where a resource is unable to pass Supplier Accreditation this merely means the Product Owner of this particular Smart Asset needs to determine the ensuing path of the resource tokenized with the new parameters received This includes determining special legal conditions for it where necessary if it is required by the country where the Product Instance of the particular Smart Asset functions This allows to bypass limitations of usage for the Proof ofAsset Protocol on a low technological level stemming from the particularities of local legislation \xe2\x80\x94 they are simply included into the tokenization formulas of the corresponding Product Instance It is also important to note that as with the Originator work through a Supplier Agent is a very simple mean of investing their resource into previously inaccessible types of assets for smaller end clients End client resources are easily merged into portfolios during tokenization granting them access to pro\xef\xac\x81table and secure asset types Never in history have such types of assets been accessible to a simple end client with a moderate amount of resources Blockchainbased tokenization gives these opportunities to practically any person regardless of accumulated riches or social status It is a true evolution of liquidity of assets and their accessibility So the characteristics of the Supplier in the protocol are as follows Supplier On the right side of the schematic presented in section 4 1 of the Smart White Paper we see the Supplier The supplier is the owner of the tokenized product BANKEX engineers have conducted research of entities and characteristics of resources presently used in various \xef\xac\x81nancial and internet ecosystems and have reached amazing results We have discovered that our typical perception of the resource taking part in deals as \xef\xac\x81nancial resource only is too limited Perhaps we as a \xef\xac\x81ntech company should be compelled to state here that resource equals money but our research and development on the matter shows that within the protocol\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem when creating various types of Smart Assets there will sometimes be Smart Deals with a di\xef\xac\x80erent resource That is why we give the following de\xef\xac\x81nition of a Supplier End Client \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s an end client in possession of \xef\xac\x81nancial or other resources wishing to use his resource in a chosen Smart Asset to create a Smart Deal with a tokenized cash \xef\xac\x82ow or other goods The BANKEX protocol accounts for the possibility that the Supplier may also have various roles as shown on the schematic on Figure 9 Supplier Agent \xe2\x80\x94 an organization (e g bank) representing a portfolio of end clients who wish to take part in a Smart Asset using their resources There is a signi\xef\xac\x81cant di\xef\xac\x80erence here from the similar structure of an originator because in the situation where a Supplier End Client enters the ecosystem without a Supplier Agent he has no way of accessing a Smart Asset deal directly instead BANKEX serves the role of a Supplier Agent in this case Frequently the Supplier will be represented by \xef\xac\x81nancial resources and in order to allow them to enter the Smart Asset Exchange they will require at the very least a KYC procedure of the Supplier End Client based on the requirements of the country where the particular Product Instance functions That is our current method for our active \xef\xac\x81ntech products For some Smart Assets the BANKEX team develops special procedures of Accreditation This has to do with the complicated matter of acceptable risk levels for a resource and not all end clients are able to evaluate it accordingly One of our advisors regarded the development of the Supplier Accreditation procedure as a potential limit to the technology\xe2\x80\x99s po \xe2\x80\xa2 role Smart Asset consumer \xe2\x80\xa2 function taking part in the Smart Asset and creation of Smart Deal using his resource 5 5 1 Initial Smart Asset Offering (ISAO) BANKEX Foundation BANKEX Foundation is a non commercial selfregulated organization with a community the members of which are engaged in work and development of smart contracts for new Smart Assets and Product Instances created with its participation It includes blockchain technology experts programmers as well as product providers and product experts The BANKEX Foundation as a non pro\xef\xac\x81t organization is an important element of the BANKEX Protocol ecosystem which allows coordination of the actions of various other elements of the system 19 \x0cSupplier Supplier End Client (investor people infrastructure element) Smart Asset Type (choose product KYC accreditation token) Supplier Agent (bank fund investor infrastructure owner) Figure 9 Asset Supplier We must note here that while other sections of The Smart White Paper BANKEX describe processes and technologies in various states of readiness but existing in the real world this section is going to present the model of a concept not yet existing in the world but aimed at solving issues When creating prototypes of various Smart Assets at the BANKEX Lab we have encountered a situation where many business owners from various countries started coming to us wishing to tokenize their assets via the ICO procedure Our vision of tokenization which we have already discussed in this White Paper earlier concludes that issuing your own coin is a poor solution for assets belonging to the real sector of economy where rocket science technologies don\xe2\x80\x99t exist Nonetheless the necessity and even inevitability of the tokenization of their assets in the future are obvious We suggested the procedure of Smart Asset emission to these clients some of the resulting Originators were accepted by the BANKEX Lab as pilot designs These assets will be prepared for the Initial Smart Asset Offering (ISAO) in the Proof ofAsset Protocol ecosystem But we turned down the majority of them How do we see the possibility of providing these businesses with the option to tokenize regardless of the centralized initiator company of the Smart Asset The BANKEX team assumes the Market will form more and more such requests as time passes These requests will come from owners of businesses or assets meaning Originators with No token Asset The BANKEX Lab is receiving such requests now but subsequently they will be addressed to multiple Product Owners in the ecosystem Those requests that the Product Owners can tokenize they will process creating Product Instances Of course they will also turn down many incoming requests The reason is not so important at this point Such requests for tokenization of a new type of assets are directed by acting Product Owners to the BANKEX Foundation (Figure 10) Now let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the schematic to see how the BANKEX Foundation coordinates actions is clearly an individual or group of individuals who are pioneers and enthusiasts of this product These are the people the BANKEX Foundation forms a product community from for the creation of a new type of Smart Asset This product community then takes over the business development of the aforementioned Smart Asset The initiator of the request for such a Smart Asset Type may become the founder of said Asset Community Such communities are also needed by the ecosystem for two more important functions product expertise and providing Proof of Asset evidence in the event of Smart Deal disputes It\xe2\x80\x99s important that in the Asset Community we do not require identi\xef\xac\x81cation of all the members \xe2\x80\x94 they take part in the ecosystem only with their knowledge and experience Foundation Community \xe2\x80\x94 this is a community of programmers and business developers who are fans of the decentralized Blockchain Service Architecture They are the people responsible for creating the world changing chains of Smart Contracts for various No token Assets New Smart Asset Type \xe2\x80\x94 is a program code fully ready for initiation As we see on the schematic the Asset Community Foundation Community and the BANKEX Lab with participation from third party experts takes part in the creation of this code The quality of the code is guaranteed by the BANKEX Smart Asset Certi\xef\xac\x81cation Center So the BANKEX Foundation in the protocol has the following characteristics \xe2\x80\xa2 role community built around the protocol \xe2\x80\xa2 function creation of new types of Smart Assets and the development of the protocol that will be in demand by the community as well as the growth of the community that is going to use the protocol Asset Community \xe2\x80\x94 as the request for creation of a Smart Asset came from the Market there 20 \x0cFigure 10 ISAO Structure 5 2 BANKEX Crypto FIAT Depository stance Banks are unable or rather they cannot permit assets to be stored with such security parameters One of the existing and not yet solved issues in asset tokenization is the impossibility for legally signi\xef\xac\x81cant organizations to purchase tokens There is a long series of details relevant for di\xef\xac\x80erent locations Let us pause on the most important and de\xef\xac\x81ne their common features First banks and organizations are able to invest into companies using stocks and equities In banks classical funds and large \xef\xac\x81nancial groups there are special departments that invest into corporate securities and other \xef\xac\x81nancial instruments on stock exchanges These departments are able to invest into securities but lack the ability to invest into cryptographic coins and tokens as they have no common tools for that Second banks and organizations must place purchased assets on their balance upon investment for that they require legally relevant documents that con\xef\xac\x81rm purchase of the asset Token purchase provides no such documents Third banks and organizations lack the technology to follow their existing security regulations when storing cryptoassets As we all know should the private key be compromised that would be enough to lose access to the crypto wallet and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what amount is stored on the wallet if a malignant party obtains the private key it can vanish in an in In the BANKEX ecosystem solution of these problems is handled by the BANKEX Crypto FIAT Depository This is a legal organization and a technology for cryptoasset storage The Crypto FIAT Depository works as any classical depository with the only di\xef\xac\x80erence being that it grants its classical clients the ability to store cryptoassets We see this as the Depository forming a legal agreement with a bank or organization to give the Depository permission to store clients\xe2\x80\x99 cryptoassets After that the client registers a wallet in the Depository for the cryptoassets he requires If it\xe2\x80\x99s an ERC20 token then an Ethereum Wallet is registered After that the client does not receive the private key to the wallet instead it\xe2\x80\x99s instantly conserved in the depository\xe2\x80\x99s storage until the client closes the account The client receives a regular depository receipt in return for his cryptoasset The technology to store coins and tokens in the Crypto FIAT Depository allows a client to conduct operations with cryptoassets on his balance and what\xe2\x80\x99s more important it lets him do this in a way that he\xe2\x80\x99s used to He sees these cryptocurrencies in the same way he would see classical assets This is the very technology that FIAT and Crypto markets are waiting for 21 \x0c5 3 5 4 BANKEX Crypto Fund Initial Smart (ISAO) Asset 5 5 Open Source Smart Asset Core BANKEX Foundation presents a platform for collaborative work with an open source code created to promote technologies in the banking and \xef\xac\x81nancial sectors An Open Source approach to development based on collaborative use of software can ensure transparency stability and support needed to implement blockchain technologies The main task of organizations is the development of a global cooperation and support of leaders and entrepreneurs in the \xef\xac\x81eld of \xef\xac\x81nances banking Internet of Things and decentralized technologies We welcome all who take part in the developer community of the Smart Asset Protocol regardless of membership status Additional information on the technical details and methods of collaboration can be found on the community page https //github com/ BankEx Open Source Protocol \xe2\x80\x94 Smart Asset Core (https //github com/BankEx/smart asset core) is the base structure to tokenize and securitize assets It contains all the necessary modules for integration of third party information providers and tools for writing specialized smart contracts O\xef\xac\x80ering Initial Smart Asset O\xef\xac\x80ering (ISAO) \xe2\x80\x94 is the initial Smart Asset o\xef\xac\x80er with the goal of tokenizing \xef\xac\x81nancial assets or real economy sector assets in the form of emission and sale of Smart Asset Tokens to buyers An ISAO can only be carried out with an asset present in other words either a functioning or planned cash \xef\xac\x82ow A technological startup or RnD cannot be tokenized via the ISAO procedure On the schematic (Figure 10) we can see the request for an ISAO comes from an Originator i e owner of a \xef\xac\x81nancial or manufacturing asset This Originator does not need to create the tokenization technology \xe2\x80\x93 instead the best programmers from various teams coordinated by the BANKEX Foundation compete for its creation It would be fair to state that a \xef\xac\x81rst time Originator with the desire to create a new type of Smart Asset and an Originator initiating an Initial Smart Asset O\xef\xac\x80ering can be one and the same person which is what we are striving for But at the same time this schematic does not permit centralization of the program solution as the Originator neither in\xef\xac\x82uences the actual writing of the Smart Asset code nor controls the programmers the Originator is only able to take part in the development via product expertise using the Asset Community mechanism In the BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol ecosystem the following can take part in the initial purchase of Smart Asset Tokens on a technological level Open

important consequence of the decision to take registration data beyond the tokenization cycle using the BANKEX KYC Adapter is that various Originators including banks can now be integrated more comprehensively and with minimal e\xef\xac\x80ort The Originator de\xef\xac\x81nes identi\xef\xac\x81cation parameters and the Proof of Asset Protocol adjusts to suit those parameters creating a link between client data and the Smart Asset blockchain wallet What about the data that goes into the Smart Asset That\xe2\x80\x99s product data an arrangement of data necessary to tokenize the client\xe2\x80\x99s asset with parameters and contents de\xef\xac\x81ned exclusively by the Product Owner separately for every Smart Asset Type On the schematic you can see along with the protocol entities you have already become familiarized with that the Product segment includes blocks that de\xef\xac\x81ne product data for both the Originator and the Supplier The quantity and types of product data \xef\xac\x81elds are not limited in any way \xe2\x80\x94 it is decided entirely by the Smart Contract logic necessary for a particular Product Instance As a brief summary the ecosystem of the protocol generally allows for various other registration data \xe2\x80\x94 the principle of work with them is always going to remain unchanged they are technically impossible to store in a Smart Asset In any event where any entity needs to be identi\xef\xac\x81ed the process of identi\xef\xac\x81cation itself is always going to be beyond the logical cycle of the Smart Contracts included in the Smart Asset The protocol only interacts with such data on the level of con\xef\xac\x81rmed or uncon\xef\xac\x81rmed registration data hashes that come from external oracles The only possible exception to this rule is when the Smart Asset Proof of Asset Protocol is fully realized on the Microsoft Azure Bank API server within the bank\xe2\x80\x99s security network Registration data & product data The our \xef\xac\x81rst step in researching the liquidity protocol is data BANKEX as a classical \xef\xac\x81ntech company is well aware how many di\xef\xac\x80erent existing banking systems there are many with an architecture that was established many years ago That\xe2\x80\x99s why in order to build the protocol technology we have begun our research from scratch rather than basing it o\xef\xac\x80 of any existing IT infrasctructure of a bank This may be an unexpected decision to some IT specialists of the banking segment but we have decided to separate all the information we work with during initialization of Smart Assets into just two parts registration data and product data We see no reason to overcomplicate this Registration data \xe2\x80\x94 data that allows the identi\xef\xac\x81cation of a client Modern registration data contains an intrinsic fundamental controversy On the one hand internet platforms have evolved to the highest level of simpli\xef\xac\x81cation for this data most of them request nothing but a client\xe2\x80\x99s e mail upon initial registration On the other hand in order to work with \xef\xac\x81nancial information in global economy it is necessary to receive the most extensive registration data from the client this is a matter of public security In the blockchain network technology there is in essence only one vitally important identi\xef\xac\x81cation which is the address of one\xe2\x80\x99s wallet As we are building the \xef\xac\x81nancial asset tokenization protocol we \xef\xac\x81nd this information insu\xef\xac\x83cient Here is our solution The registration data that allows client identi\xef\xac\x81cation is taken beyond the tokenization cycle When a Smart Asset is created on the Ethereum blockchain we retain the technological capability to perform tokenization using only the Ethereum Wallet number but at the same time we also create a connection between the Ethereum Wallet used in tokenization and the other registration data using the BANKEX KYC Adapter This is imperative as di\xef\xac\x80erent banks may have completely di\xef\xac\x80erent assortments of client registration data and what\xe2\x80\x99s more important these are personal details that are protected in many countries It would be unwise to create a Smart Asset reliant on them On a technological level the Proof of Asset Protocol allows the BANKEX KYC Adapter to be integrated with any KYC provider functioning in the country BANKEX has a subsidiary with a working product of this type This is not rocket science All we can say is we are followers of the technology of client identi\xef\xac\x81cation via blockchain stored hash re 6 2 Creating a Smart Asset As we have already discussed the Blockchain Service Architecture allows formation of various chains of smart contracts based on the protocol Let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the order in which a typical Smart Asset is created We see \xef\xac\x81ve desired logical steps in the Proof ofAsset Protocol to be able to call a token a Smart Asset (Figure 11) These steps are \xe2\x80\xa2 initial contract \xe2\x80\xa2 validation 23 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 audit Proposal \xe2\x80\x94 Smart Contracts that \xef\xac\x81x the base price of a Smart Asset and de\xef\xac\x81ne the type of operation that will be performed with the taken asset on the Smart Asset Exchange From a stock exchange perspective the result of this step is the creation of a bid From a blockchain perspective \xe2\x80\x94 the issuing of a token \xe2\x80\xa2 legal \xe2\x80\xa2 proposal We \xef\xac\x81rst initialize the contract selecting a type of Smart Asset The Smart Asset\xe2\x80\x99s type determines product data required for the token and the logic by which that data is processed Next the Originator \xef\xac\x81lls in General Information which can happen both manually and automatically Data entered by the Originator is what we presently call digitalization The information is there but its value is unknown as the \xef\xac\x81lled in forms have no function and more importantly have no validity we have no way of knowing if that information is genuine The next step is Validation This is where Smart Contracts are executed that validate the information entered by the client using various trusted sources These can include Internet of Things Sensors Eternal Oracle Crawlers and others It is crucial that the contract is saturated with data from sources independent from the Originator which allows for an accurate assessment of the authenticity of General Information provided Next the result is audited always by an outside party This is the part of tokenization where a 3rd party gets involved Primarily this is BANKEX comparing hash totals of the current Smart Asset code with certi\xef\xac\x81cation data from the BANKEX Foundation Only a veri\xef\xac\x81ed SACC code can get the BANKEX Verifed mark These can also be accounting services or any other services that can check the process of tokenization based on Smart Asset logic It is also important that at this point classical o\xef\xac\x80chain organizations can also get involved if that is supported by the issuing conditions of the Smart Asset Legal is the step where every Product Instance can set up legal conditions speci\xef\xac\x81cally required for both it and the country where it\xe2\x80\x99s located This is also where the Smart Assets intended for global liquidity establish the norms of governmental and customs regulations The Blockchain Service Architecture allows any existing legal regulations to be written into Smart logic If the government of your country demands that you must receive an o\xef\xac\x83cial document from the town hall for your asset then you do just that You head to the town hall receive the o\xef\xac\x83cial document scan it and add it into the Smart Asset with your signature or that of a certifying of\xef\xac\x81cer After the government implements tokenization to their algorithms you can simply change the one corresponding Smart Contract included in your Smart Asset 6 3 Smart Asset \xd0\xa1aterpillar The BANKEX team named this tokenization principle the Smart Asset Caterpillar although it was not our \xef\xac\x81rst choice of name It was picked up when we realized that in order to achieve true value of a Smart Asset which means proving that it is ensured by an actual asset it was imperative that smart contracts in the chain were to \xef\xac\x82ow from one to another in an uninterrupted sequence If you were to cut an earthworm in half its parts will survive for a time But if a caterpillar is cut in half or even if it loses any segment of its body \xe2\x80\x94 it dies This principle is true for the Smart Contract chain in a Smart Asset If you interrupt the chain or either of the links becomes invalid then the Smart Asset formula will result in a value of zero for the asset Any link of the Smart Asset \xd0\xa1aterpillar being insu\xef\xac\x83ciently validated would have a detrimental e\xef\xac\x80ect on the resulting value of the entire Smart Asset A second important consequence of the Smart Asset Caterpillar tokenization principle is that every signi\xef\xac\x81cant step on the chain that a\xef\xac\x80ects the Smart Asset\xe2\x80\x99s value is recorded on the blockchain You enter your General Information during step one and press next the Blockchain Service Architecture asks if you wish to record your commitment on the blockchain (Figure 12) after which you will receive details of the transaction on blockchain (Figure 13) This is not just digitization \xe2\x80\x94 it is tokenization an imprint of your commitment and the further along the Smart Asset Caterpillar you are the more valid your commitment is to other members of the ecosystem It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting here that the BANKEX Proofof Asset Protocol technology supports several technical solutions for the recording of the aforementioned imprints on the blockchain including industryspeci\xef\xac\x81c know how 6 4 Initial contract The exact way in which every contract is initialized is de\xef\xac\x81ned by the Product Owner when calculating the Product Instance (Figure 14) Let us note several signi\xef\xac\x81cant steps for the majority of Smart Assets First initialization will require the registration 24 \x0cFigure 11 Proof of Asset Protocol Figure 12 Step 1 \xe2\x80\x94 Asset Initialization Figure 13 Step 2 \xe2\x80\x94 Asset Validation 25 \x0cFigure 14 Initial Contract Figure 15 Example of Asset Initialization 26 \x0cdata of the Originator End Client and as we operate in the technological stack of the blockchain network we have agreed not to store registration data \xe2\x80\x94 we must receive a Wallet address For the demo version of our product we used a web interface with the Metamask Ethereum Wallet plugin (Figure 15) With this iteration the Ethereum wallet address is automatically taken from the plugin In other iterations or on other blockchains this may work di\xef\xac\x80erently Why do we need a wallet address By using it we receive the ability to perform client identi\xef\xac\x81cation through the BANKEX KYC Adapter or any other KYC provider Additionally the demo shows it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to request an optional \xef\xac\x81eld as well such as an e mail Second when initializing the contract data is entered into General Information \xef\xac\x81elds General information is entered either manually by the client or automatically but its accuracy is decided only by the person inputting it It would be fair to state that tokenization does not rely on accuracy of the General Information entered We take it as it is whereas the authenticity required for the Smart Asset is going to be determined by the logic of subsequent contracts in the chain It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that not all true information may actually be required by the Smart Asset and an Originator End client who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to determine a code\xe2\x80\x99s Solidity may not even know how important the \xef\xac\x81elds he is \xef\xac\x81lling in are When the BANKEX team hears talk about the need for each and every person in the future to have programming skills we immediately recall our Smart Asset Caterpillar Third in the General Information block of the demo we show that information \xef\xac\x81elds may be of any type depending on the habits of a programmer A type bar a \xef\xac\x81le a catalogue digits \xe2\x80\x94 any type of \xef\xac\x81eld at all Fourth part of the General Information block\xe2\x80\x99s function may be carried outside the blockchain logic and outside the logic of external oracles instead being based on the UI alone Our RnD showed that the simplest but sometimes necessary function of the logic such as checking hash totals in speci\xef\xac\x81c \xef\xac\x81elds can easily be diverted to web based or any other programming logic used in a particular Product Instance The results of the Initial contract steps are \xe2\x80\xa2 a data record on the blockchain 6 5 Validation The Validation step (Figure 16) of a Smart Asset is the most fascinating for Research and Development this is where various means and methods for the validation of the General Information can be built Let us de\xef\xac\x81ne the following terms Internet of Things (IoT ) will be the main condition for the validation of Smart Contracts and this will come much sooner than we can imagine Very soon our world will become \xef\xac\x81lled with myriads of various sensors and transmitters for smart contracts just as it has already become \xef\xac\x81lled with smartphones and surveillance cameras IoT Sensors can come in any number of di\xef\xac\x80erent combinations BANKEX is not an IoT company and yet our lab already has more than 50 di\xef\xac\x80erent sensors with di\xef\xac\x80erent purposes In the demo application we used three of them an accelerometer a location pin and a photo camera that any smartphone is equipped with Let us remind you here that cell phones are already used as tools for payment Many companies today are trying to create Smart sensors out\xef\xac\x81tted with an internal logic but the decisive potential is de\xef\xac\x81nitely held in a combination of IoT Sensors and the logic of Smart Assets The second element are External Oracles which are the obvious choice for data validation today and which are used by many companies worldwide You can check a person\xe2\x80\x99s information using his Pass ID or request information on an organization using its Registration Number You can request information on rates and constants being developed by public organizations or institutes Or you can simply perform crawling of information from a chosen website Everything you need for your Product Instance Using External Oracles it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to implement almost any logic you could need on the Ethereum blockchain even today it\xe2\x80\x99s not complicated Use of the oracle technology to examine images or videos captured by IoT sensors deserves additional mention Soon enough you will not have to pay for the recognition of your car license plate The Smart Contract would be able to send a \xef\xac\x81ne from your bank account on its own Smart Asset creation logic may include any number of External Oracles and each calculation will have its price but even today there are technical solutions which allow them to be cheapened on the Ethereum blockchain It would be safe to assume that in the future there will likely be even more such solutions available Internal checks are simplest logical \xef\xac\x82ags or hash \xe2\x80\xa2 creation of a Smart Asset entity \xe2\x80\xa2 assigning the Smart Asset with a unique ID for subsequent connection IoT and Oracle \xe2\x80\xa2 may involve the creation of a legal Soft Commitment 27 \x0cFigure 16 Validation Step totals that nonetheless may greatly impact the price of a Smart Asset for instance a \xef\xac\x82ag showing whether or not there is a supporting document uploaded along with the request to the Microsoft Azure cloud The results of the Validation step are mark it with the tick then the Smart Asset becomes valid and consequently gains value Obviously the implementation of Smart Contracts is only a matter of time for any e\xef\xac\x83cient nation since the volume of ine\xef\xac\x83ciencies in any large organization including nations is enormous It is both bene\xef\xac\x81cial and sensible Once a nation\xe2\x80\x99s work conditions are modernized you need only update your contract chain to the latest Product Instance In fact if you are the Originator you won\xe2\x80\x99t even have to do that \xe2\x80\x94 it will be done by the BANKEX Foundation Cost of delivery estimation and automatic customs tax of the exported asset based on data from the location sensor could also occur during this block Which we may add opens the way for export/import of cash \xef\xac\x82ow associated with various types of assets between nations \xe2\x80\xa2 additional information input into the Smart Asset entity \xe2\x80\xa2 formula determining the importance of concluded validation \xe2\x80\xa2 operation saved on blockchain 6 6 Audit & Legal In terms of technical implementation interaction with third party audit organizations jurisprudence or government is also dedicated to an External Oracle We initially called this section Global Delivery Conditions because in order to make an asset as liquid as possible it must achieve global liquidity It is similar to Amazon com in the \xef\xac\x81eld of digitized goods Global liquidity of various assets is our future now the most important task is the embedding of the Smart Asset ecosystem into existing national legislation and state regulations We are often told that the implementation of Smart Assets is extremely complicated due to the impossibility of giving them legal signi\xef\xac\x81cance It\xe2\x80\x99s true that it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated task but o\xef\xac\x80chain legal conditions are not at all di\xef\xac\x83cult to write into the chain of Smart Asset contracts even if one of the Smart Contracts requires action to be taken o\xef\xac\x80chain or even o\xef\xac\x84ine Does something need to be done and then marked with a tick Good we include this condition into the logic of the Smart Asset\xe2\x80\x99s function and 6 7 Proposal Logically and technically this is the most di\xef\xac\x83cult step of the Smart Asset \xd0\xa1aterpillar It\xe2\x80\x99s where the magic happens \xe2\x80\xa2 trading rules are set for the chosen type of Smart Asset \xe2\x80\xa2 asset authenticity rate is calculated \xe2\x80\xa2 the asset\xe2\x80\x99s base price is calculated \xe2\x80\xa2 the asset\xe2\x80\x99s intended use is speci\xef\xac\x81ed \xe2\x80\xa2 Hard Commitment parameters are set \xe2\x80\xa2 cash \xef\xac\x82ow distribution is de\xef\xac\x81ned according to Smart Deal 28 \x0cActually everything is much simpler with complicated deals that we make in the o\xef\xac\x80chain world becoming signi\xef\xac\x81cantly easier once they are given an algorithm with the Smart Asset logic You can \xef\xac\x81nd this out yourself by simply breaking down any deal that interests you to its basic elements Now do the same thing again while also removing human error and you get a Smart Deal (Figure 17) The result of this step is the issuing of a token and formation of a bid for the Smart Asset Exchange 7 7 1 Technical solutions 7

Asset Core v 3 7 27 One of the most important features of Plasma protocol is an ability to extend EMV and add required functionality that is now only possible by use of external oracles One of such examples would be a development of JWT (JSON Web token) like message exchange format with mandatory cryptographic signatures that would allow some form of replayability and authentication of requests to external resources Such exchange format and use case can be illustrated as following Over the lifetime of smart asset some data from external service (External API request) Traditionally it\xe2\x80\x99s solved by use of external oracle (such as oraclize it) that performs a request on your behalf provides some proof of authenticity (TLS Notary) and performs a callback Such operation is expensive and requires few roundtrips TLS Notary is not possible in modern versions of TLS protocol Our proposed approach would be to build a standard requests protocol that would start with presigned (by smart contract itself or other way) payload that can be used to perform a request to external resource at some timeframe and requiring a response to be signed by private key of external resource (with public key also known upfront) Also standard would require that ANY request with such payload would return THE SAME response so it would allow to perform distributed computing and easy veri\xef\xac\x81cation for including information into the blockchain Another interesting extension would be possibility to perform \xe2\x80\x9cdelayed calls\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 requests to a smart asset functions that should be performed either at known date or regularly For now such action would also require an external oracle while such information can potentially be saved inside a blockchain so every participant could trigger a function execution for an incentive in a form of fee (similar to the gas price) At some point an extension of EMV can be required to facilitate new requirements or have backward compatibility with older systems Such functionality can be RSA functions (for old systems) Schnorr signatures (can be extended already as convenience method) or post quantum cryptography We see a need in having a degree of backward compatibility to connect existing systems to blockchain But the most tedious questions to be solved for wider applications of blockchain where computations are transparent are in our opinion random number generation and homomorphic cryptography First one is the cornerstone of cryptography in general and a way of obtaining a random number of appropri Version 3 of Smart Asset Core is presented on Figure 19 7 25 Smart Asset Core v 4 7 26 \xe2\x80\x9cPlasma\xe2\x80\x9d protocol & Proof ofAsset Protocol The most important features of Plasma protocol A \xe2\x80\x9cPlasma\xe2\x80\x9d protocol was proposed recently that is universal extension of any Turing complete blockchain (such as Ethereum) and allows creation of \xe2\x80\x9cdaughter\xe2\x80\x9d blockchains that are governed by higherlevel (\xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d) blockchain These \xe2\x80\x9cdaughter\xe2\x80\x9d chains can have di\xef\xac\x80erent consensus rules functionality (extensions to EMV for example) and underlying base token Such extension naturally \xef\xac\x81ts Proof of Asset proposal with Bankex token (BKX) being an underlying currency used to pay for manipulations with asset records If functional requirements for some types of assets or operations would impose a need of extended functionality such type of assets can be moved to separate chain These \xe2\x80\x9cdaughter\xe2\x80\x9d chains can be viewed as side chains for ease of understanding properties but strongly governed and penalized by \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d chain for any sign of misbehavior of fraud Such approach and further extension of \xe2\x80\x9cdaughter\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d relation to the whole tree of chains would allow participants of Bankex protocol to e\xef\xac\x80ectively do transactions with minimal trust and be able to be minimally exposed to potential fraudulent actions of other participants especially ones not even related to their current transaction in contrast to traditional single level chain where potential attack a\xef\xac\x80ects all users immediately (DAO hack for example) 31 \x0cFigure 19 Smart Asset Core Version 3 32 \x0cate quality will be a major breakthrough in a \xef\xac\x81eld The latter is for now the only known possible way to achieve privacy and computation transparency at the same time We think that extensive development and experimenting in this \xef\xac\x81eld should start as soon as possible with choice of currently known candidates and implementing them in a \xe2\x80\x9csubchain\xe2\x80\x9d to which data can be transferred manipulated and returned to the parent chain without disclosure of nature of underlying data 7 28 created asset which is done using a WebSocket connection Until this step only the client and the blockchain are aware of the asset and unless it is taken backend won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to send events from the server if they are linked to the current asset A WebSocket connection solves this problem 4 To connect the asset to IoT devices the web page displays a specially generated QR code containing a link to the asset ID http //iot bankex com/ASSET_ID IoT Integration Scheme 5 The user scans this code using the BANKEX IoT App If it\xe2\x80\x99s not installed the code can alternatively be scanned by any QR code scanner application which is going to open the link in a browser automatically redirecting the user to App Store or Play Market to download the application Deep linking support allows the application to be launched with additional parameters including the asset ID immediately after installation which helps prevent scanning the same QR code twice One of the necessary steps for IoT enhanced assets is the procedure of integrating them with the IoT device control infrastructure The procedure is shown on the Figure 20 There are four major layers of back end applications involved The backend consists of four primary server applications 1 web3j compatible connector to the Ethereum network node 2 TLS secured web server for serving HTTPSrequests for both API and frontend 6 BANKEX IoT App is now ready to connect the asset ID to the ID of the device which the application already knows at this point In a simpler case the BANKEX IoT App already supports the phone\xe2\x80\x99s sensor identi\xef\xac\x81cation which requires no additional tools to demonstrate capabilities External sensors can also be added using this application 3 secured WebSocket server (wss //) 4 DeviceHive8 server for IoT device management Let us describe the full process of integration in the case of a web application (with a MetaMask extension installed) and the Android IoT App 1 The asset owner selects one of the types provided 7 The device contacts API sending two key parameters asset ID and device ID This information is also shared with the DeviceHive where the new data is automatically registered as well as WebSocket to inform of the client\xe2\x80\x99s newly added device 2 Initial data on the asset is \xef\xac\x81lled in by its owner After all the information is \xef\xac\x81lled in the user initiates the procedure of publishing the asset on a blockchain by using the contract function via MetaMask On this stage we learn the newly created asset\xe2\x80\x99s unique identi\xef\xac\x81cation which the client receives following a successful transaction 8 At this stage the device ID is not yet added to the smart asset although it is visible in the web client in the list of devices available to be added To \xef\xac\x81nish the integration the user must con\xef\xac\x81rm the device using the function in MetaMask This transaction can charge additional Ether or BKX tokens to credit the oracle\xe2\x80\x99s IoT event execution expenses 3 After receiving the asset ID the web interface moves on to the next step The \xef\xac\x81rst thing that is required is a

\xe2\x80\x94 a cryptographically secured database containing the history of all transactions performed on the platform It works the following way 1 Transaction info is sent into the blockchain network 2 This transaction together with other transactions forms a block Every block has its number and holds encrypted information about preceding blocks 3 The block is sent in to be checked by all members of the network 4 If there are no discrepancies every member adds the new block to the chain of previous blocks and the transaction is executed Node \xe2\x80\x94 a blockchain network participant storing information on past transactions (blockchain) checks information on new transactions for authenticity and is able to add in new transactions (adding blocks) All the nodes are connected to one another forming a single network A public blockchain is a decentralized system where the information on transactions is stored and checked in many multiple locations This kind of synchronization between millions of locations consumes large amounts of electric energy and is signi\xef\xac\x81cantly more expensive than a private blockchain The system also becomes slower However a public blockchain may prove preferable for industries where decentralization is necessary A private blockchain is centralized making it similar to traditional centralized systems however it exceeds them in terms of e\xef\xac\x83ciency and security ICO (Initial Coin Offering) \xe2\x80\x94 a method of invitation to \xef\xac\x81nance a campaign/project Tokens/coins are issued that grant the right to receive a share/service/good now or in the future or else they grant a percentage of future pro\xef\xac\x81ts After the start of sales tokens can be resold to other investors Trade is conducted on a blockchain Cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\x94 digital money without a physical analogue It is supported by the complexity of its development \xe2\x80\x94 mining Today we are able to identify \xe2\x80\x9cclassics\xe2\x80\x9d such as Bitcoin or Litecoin and newer currencies such as Ether which act as platforms for the creation of new assets tokens Ethereum \xe2\x80\x94 the most popular platform for issuing of tokens and smart contracts Gas \xe2\x80\x94 a unit used to measure the price of calculations done on Ethereum More di\xef\xac\x83cult calculations are rewarded with higher amounts of Gas This works the following way the originator of a smart contract sets a price in gas Miners whose PCs handle the calculations make the choice whether or not to perform these calculations If the price o\xef\xac\x80ered is too low then neither the calculations nor as a result the contract will ever be concluded Smart contract a set of pre programmed tasks that the program automatically carries out upon certain conditions being ful\xef\xac\x81lled then forms a deal That\xe2\x80\x99s why it requires no trust between sides nor a middleman the contract has a strict logical structure and the computer executes it automatically Smart contracts allow for inclusion of a large number of conditions and states and for a correlation between their every possible combination and various outcomes Ditigal tokens \xe2\x80\x94 croptygraphic assets issued using specialized blockchain platforms An analogue would be a record in a register A token has an address and may also contain a smart contract that de\xef\xac\x81nes its function and also acts as a separate execution mechanism Tokenization \xe2\x80\x94 the process of transforming rights into a digital token which is then traded on a blockchain with low transactional costs Tokenization is an analogue of securitization on a blockchain Smart Asset \xe2\x80\x94 an asset that has gone through tokenization using the BANKEX Proof of Asset Protocol ISAO (Initial Smart Asset Offering) \xe2\x80\x94 a method of \xef\xac\x81xing businesses (farms stores manufacturing plants) using tokenization of their assets based on the BANKEX PoA protocol 35 \x0cProduct instance \xe2\x80\x94 an iteration of a \xef\xac\x81ntech product owned by a BANKEX product provider For instance a product provider can customize his product for various regions thus creating a product instance for each country Blockchain agnostic protocol \xe2\x80\x94 an application level protocol that does not depend on the exact blockchaintechnology utilized and
