to the economy exactly what language means to the speech with natural historic competition borrowed features and things lost in translation A language evolves in the direct proportion to the number of its users and with the amount of pronounced/written/read material \xe2\x80\x9ctransactions\xe2\x80\x9d in it What keeps it alive and saves it from extinction is its circulation and the Darwinistic ability to adapt to a change Most traditional currencies developed naturally similar to most dialects formalizing over time and gradually gaining success through adoption Constructed languages have failed in spite of their claim to a global success due to wellplanned features and lack of such artifacts as irregular verbs Now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve entered the world of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain it is getting clear that the acquired ability to adapt to a change is what makes a platform a preferred means of transaction While many known blockchains have rigid and clumsy designs Enecuum\xe2\x80\x99s platform is highly adaptive and truly decentralized with participants being able to vote for desired new changes with no entailing protocol modification Yet if needed changes of the blockchain parameters can also be introduced through a modified protocol version You will find all the technical explanations below sharing the same core idea we trust that our enhanced privacy

economy The subsequent emergence of smart contracts facilitating credible automated transactions on pre determined conditions significantly expanded application potential of this technology We believe that blockchain is capable of revolutionizing many areas of financial and economic activity such as trade financial markets voting and even logistics Today almost all leading institutions compete to develop the best solutions The largest banks and corporations are forming consortiums while governments are looking for ways to create appropriate legal framework to support the technology Existing solutions and Ethereum being amongst the most prominent of them are already providing ampleopportunities for the application of blockchain technology in combination with smart contracts Nevertheless for further development and mass popularization of the technology it is necessary to overcome a number of problems that can be grouped into these three categories scalability security and privacy 3 1 Scalability A disadvantage of a decentralized blockchain system is its limited bandwidth In fact most existing consensus building mechanisms utilized by distributed ledgers present a trade off between a large number of transactions per second and degree of network centralization [1] Thus the desire to increase the number of processed transactions often leads to growing risks associated with the system reliability Besides as the size of a blockchain grows it requires more disk space a stronger Internet connection and higher computational power All this may result in a decreasing number of full nodes and have a negative impact on the security of the entire network (cf 5) 3 2 Security In addition to problems associated with scalability there is a number of threats produced by various features of the blockchain architecture itself For example the Proof of Work based transaction confirmation mechanism can lead to a high degree of mining capacity aggregation in one location for example there has been aggregation of bitcoin mining capacity in Mainland China where the cost of electricity is one of the lowest in the world This fact greatly increases various risks associated with the centralization of the system for instance an opportunity for conducting a \xe2\x80\x9c51% attack\xe2\x80\x9d WWW ENECUUM COM 6 \x0cAnother threat to security arises in relation to smart contracts which are more susceptible to vulnerabilities and bugs than the blockchain itself and have already resulted in millions of dollars\ losses for users and inflicted damage to the industry We expect that the number of smart contracts in use will continue to grow however the existing ways of identifying their weak spots are still inadequate Another important issue these days is the effect that centralization can have on blockchain direction and control This may arise where there is power centralization in the hands of a small group of people who can effect modifications to the core protocol [2] If and when the opinions of these groups contradict the interests of the community it may lead to a conflict that can completely paralyze the process of system modernization necessary for its stable development It can lead to a split in the community and the blockchain (cf 5) 3 3 Privacy Some blockchain systems strive for transparency of all transactions However we believe that this feature limits their commercial attractiveness and infringes individual privacy While transparency is one of the main advantages of a distributed registry this property is not always desirable especially when it comes to transfers between business counterparts particular financial transactions and other kinds of transactions that users may legitimately prefer to keep private and confidential We believe these issues are being confronted by a large number of developers working on dozens of different projects As a result more and more ad hoc blockchain platforms are designed every day to solve specific tasks in various areas This brings another problem related to the interoperability of different types of distributed networks \xe2\x80\x93 a problem that several cross chain projects have already been launched to tackle Nevertheless a universal solution that effectively solves the problems mentioned hereabove in one protocol has yet to be introduced We are confident that Enecuum is the solution to them a blockchain system based on a fundamentally new structure that allows a full realization of all the advantages of the distributed registry technology in everyday life(cf 5) WWW ENECUUM COM 7 \x0c4 Product Description Enecuum is designed as a decentralized blockchain platform of the next generation with unique features that have the potential to help implement a large number of secure and well scalable blockchain services and decentralized applications One of Enecuum\xe2\x80\x99s key advantages over other platforms is the \xe2\x80\x9cHyperDAG\xe2\x80\x9d which is a data model for storing and writing transactions with flexible settings that offer new opportunities for the practical application of blockchain technology HyperDAG supports the creation of separate branches where the rules can be tailored to solve numerous potential business problems including the ability to handle a large number of transactions cheaply and quickly Furthermore this solution allows to integrate the \xe2\x80\x9csharding\xe2\x80\x9d technology that is successful in solving the scalability problem Figure 1 Pending DAG as a part of a HyperDAG Enecuum uses a hybrid consensus algorithm combining the Proof of Work (\xe2\x80\x9cPoW\xe2\x80\x9d) [3] Proofof Stake (\xe2\x80\x9cPoS\xe2\x80\x9d) [4] and Proof of Activity (\xe2\x80\x9cPoA\xe2\x80\x9d) [5] algorithms as part of its consensus mechanism PoA is proposed to be applied for the first time in a real world context through Enecuum Utilizing a combination of consensus mechanisms makes it possible to confirm transactions from virtually any device connected to the network That in turn leads to the maximum possible decentralization of the system and makes Enecuum highly resistant to various types of attacks Enecuum has developed \xe2\x80\x9cSHARNELL Smart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d [20] to operate on the Enecuum platform These contracts consist of formulae and business oriented linear logic SHARNELL Smart Contracts aim to contribute to a high security level within Enecuum WWW ENECUUM COM 8 \x0cLinear logic allows for reliable automatic certification of smart contracts prior to their publication to the system which we believe significantly reduces potential vulnerabilities misuse freezes deadlocks and other undesirable outcomes in the system Another advantage of Enecuum is that it is a highly adaptive system Users can take part in its development and vote for other participants\xe2\x80\x99 proposals for improving system functionality There are two ways to factor in changes of system parameters \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 to branch the project repository on GitHub and present a modified version of the protocol (likely to be used by experienced developers) or to vote for adjustment of any network parameters that do not require protocol modification The latter is provided by the system architecture and can be used by all holders of ENQ ENQ is the native cryptographic digital token proposed to operate on Enecuum Following the test period the voting algorithm is proposed to be open for the users to present changes to the Enecuum\xe2\x80\x99s consensus model During the test period the Enecuum team proposes to retain control over the protocol for testing and debugging purposes Enecuum has been developed using Haskell a programming language used due to stability of execution and reduced chances of side effects A custom version of Cryptonight [6] (Keccak + AES + X11) as the core cryptographic protocol has been chosen because of its high resistance to application specific integrated circuit (\xe2\x80\x9cASIC\xe2\x80\x9d) devices ENQ\xe2\x80\x99s are proposed to be generated according to system specific parameters and paid out to miners as a reward for spending their computational power Primarily ENQs can be received and sent with no fees They can also be used as a payment tool for publishing smart contracts to the network performing complex mathematical computations on a smart contract creating custom macroblocks new Tickets Tokens and branches and participation in PoS mining 4 1 Transactions In our view there are two broad approaches to storing transactions in distributed registries \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 as blocks (Bitcoin Ethereum and many others) and as directed acyclic graphs (\xe2\x80\x9cDAG\xe2\x80\x9d) (IOTA Byteball) The advantage of the former is its high reliability that is achieved through 100% registry duplication among all nodes of the network However that approach imposes certain restrictions on the network speed and scalability In the latter DAG there are no blocks and every new incoming transaction refers to several previous ones virtually confirming them As a result registries of this type can quickly process WWW ENECUUM COM 9 \x0clarge amounts of transactions but their security level raises certain concerns in the community [12] Such method of representing transactions offers vast opportunities for their sorting analysis and sampling For example it is possible to create different branches (chains of blocks) in the frame of one network and also to apply the sharding technology to increase the network speed and eliminate the need for 100% registry duplication among all the nodes Figure 3 Sharding 4 2 Blocks In Enecuum the block size is not proposed to have a fixed value and may vary from 4 KB to 4 MB Minimum size blocks can be created to reach the minimum delay in speed per operation while possible and as the load on the network increases the block size grows In circumstances where a user needs a block of the size bigger than 4 MB the system also supports combining any number of blocks into a macroblock thereby allowing to store large volumes of data on the blockchain Figure 4 Varying block size Bitcoin NG protocol is proposed to be introduced into Enecuum macroblocks [12] to reduce the latency between the creation of blocks so that each microblock inside a macroblock is created in realtime and adds transactions to the blockchain immediately upon their arrival So we do not WWW ENECUUM COM 10 \x0chave to wait until an entire macroblock is completed its hash is found and it is synced between all nodes on the network \xe2\x80\x93 small microblocks can be generated concurrently inside it The block structure consists of 3 main sections represented in the following picture Figure 5 Block structure 4 3 Branches Using HyperDAG to store transactions enables creating branches (chains of blocks) containing only homogeneous transactions Each branch is in essence a separate blockchain and at the same time is a part of the whole system Each branch may set its own specific rules for creation and confirmation of new blocks Nodes do not have to duplicate and store all auxiliary Enecuum branches The main branches of the system are proposed to be 1 The Transactional Branch that focuses on storing all ordinary transactions between the users of ENQ 2 The Statistical Branch that focuses on accumulating and analyzing statistics on the operations in the system This branch contains data on the overall number of nodes mining records block sizes and a multifold of other parameters including PoA mining reward sizes Also Enecuum proposes to support the creation of other branches described below 1 Ticket branches that focus on providing opportunities for implementing different scenarios through Tickets Tickets are intended to allow for the creation of and access to dedicated private blockchain branches which we call \xe2\x80\x9cticket branches\xe2\x80\x9d (cf 4 6) If for instance a user creates a Ticket and issues Tokens on that Ticket branch all operations involving this Ticket can be encrypted and stored in this dedicated branch Moreover these Ticket branches may have their own rules for example all nodes can be WWW ENECUUM COM 11 \x0crecognized as valid in turn transactions coming from them can be processed much faster since there is no need for the consensus between all network members 2 Data branches that can act as decentralized repositories The underlying principles are similar to those of the BitTorrent protocol however instead of traditional hashing Enecuum proposes to offer its own solution the seamless hash algorithm It is designed to enable authorized access to a part of any size in the encrypted file without rehashing and sharing the hashtable between the nodes again which cannot be done in BitTorrent 4 4 Hybrid Consensus Algorithm (PoW PoA PoS) In Enecuum consensus is achieved through interaction between the following three mining algorithms Proof of Work (\xe2\x80\x9cPoW\xe2\x80\x9d) Proof of Activity (\xe2\x80\x9cPoA\xe2\x80\x9d) and Proof of Stake (\xe2\x80\x9cPoS\xe2\x80\x9d) This combination makes it possible to achieve a high degree of network decentralization while significantly increasing both the network security level and its speed The transaction confirmation process that is proposed to be implemented in Enecuum can roughly be divided into 3 stages corresponding the algorithms mentioned above Stage 1 At first stage PoW miners find a proper hash for next block After a hash satisfying the current complexity requirements is found a miner translates it to the network Figure 7 Hybrid consensus algorithm Stage 2 WWW ENECUUM COM 12 \x0cDuring the second stage PoS miners use ID based cryptography to obtain publishing key for certain K block This key is then split into shares and distributed among certain subset of PoA miners This subset is defined by K block PoA miners then check the hash in the translated block then create microblocks with transactions sign them and send them back to the PoS Stage 3 During the third stage PoS miners collect enough confirmations for microblock from PoA miners aggregate threshold signature and publish microblock By default the mining reward is distributed between the participants as follows PoA 65% PoW 10% PoS 25% However the presence of the Statistical Branch (cf 4 3) enables the system to control this distribution scheme protecting its interests from possible abuse 4 5 SHARNELL Smart Contracts Smart Contracts in Enecuum are to be written in JavaScript and executed on Google\xe2\x80\x99s V8 engine Smart contracts are to be composed exclusively of mathematical formulae and based on the business oriented SHARNELL linear logic Linear logic is completely predictable hence minimizing the chance of any potential vulnerability Logical smart contracts are to consist of a \xe2\x80\x9cdata card\xe2\x80\x9d containing conditions and parameters and the formula itself which takes into account these conditions and parameters with the possibility of full or partial achievement and actuating Each condition of a logical contract is to be placed in the data card and assigned a corresponding symbol This type of smart contracts is ideal for performing the most common operations and transactions such as multisig escrow and so on They are proposed to be created via a graphical editor in the first version of our system 5 Problems and Solutions 5 1 Scalability One of the most important problems facing an open blockchain system is facilitating a large number of transactions cheaply and securely Scalability is necessary for global scale adoption WWW ENECUUM COM 13 \x0cof the technology The throughput of Bitcoin and Ethereum is often compared to the VisaNet system capable of processing over 50 000 operations per second [14] a number thousands times greater than the current throughput of most popular cryptocurrencies As the number of cryptocurrency users is growing globally at an enormous speed the peak times fees for transactions in the current decentralized systems can reach prohibitive levels We believe that a simple increase of block size is a partial and temporary solution to the problem however it will not solve the underlying scalability issue Currently the data in the block is stored there permanently and this means the size of a blockchain will keep growing steadily With an increase in throughput its size will grow even faster As a result only big corporations will be able to allocate enough resources to store and update this vast data set which is likely to lead to an increasing centralization of the network Using HyperDAG (cf 4 1) to record and store transactions we believe that Enecuum is ideally suited for implementation of the sharding technology that allows for division of the blockchain into several smaller parts presented by separate branches or parts of those branches and processed in parallel Combining sharding with varying block size Enecuum can efficiently handle thousands of transactions per second without jeopardizing the security of the system It is intended that the resulting commission for transactions in most cases will be zero or minimal In addition the support of potentially unlimited number of branches in the system makes it possible to create various decentralized business applications without the need for their own blockchain or more workload on the main Enecuum branch It is possible that each branch can have a custom ruleset tailored individually to reflect service specific needs Furthermore it is proposed that each branch can either be open for all the members of the system or be private with a defined list of participants If the transaction speed or block size needs to be upgraded in a certain branch it is proposed that it can introduce its own nodes to modify the consensus rules The only constraint in this case is the nodes capacity in this branch Enecuum\xe2\x80\x99s architecture is intended to support macroblocks of potentially unlimited size a solution allowing the protocol to scale in parallel with the growing performance of modern CPU\xe2\x80\x99s 5 2 Security Low Decentralization Problem First generation blockchain systems used PoW for transaction confirmation PoW is a reliable algorithm with a proven efficiency in protecting blockchain systems from various types of attacks such as Denial of Service (\xe2\x80\x9cDoS\xe2\x80\x9d) and spamming As the popularity and value of cryptocurrencies increased PoW mining turned into a large scale business with hundreds of millions of US dollars invested in mining projects WWW ENECUUM COM 14 \x0cLow electricity and labor cost in China led to a massive aggregation of mining capacities in Mainland China This situation put the relevant blockchain system security at jeopardy due to potential collusion between large pools of miners and an increased \xe2\x80\x9c51% attack\xe2\x80\x9d possibility The emergence of ASIC devices further exacerbated the problem as using regular mining rigs lost any economic sense and led to an even higher degree of mining capacity centralization in the hands of large investors [16] It is believed that the combination of three types of mining and the use of the Cryptonight cryptographic protocol in Enecuum make it possible to achieve a high degree of decentralization in the system not only geographically but also in regard to different device types and demographics We believe that these features will help make Enecuum one of the most secure distributed registries In addition to that the presence of the Statistical Branch (cf 4 3) in the system for collecting and analyzing blockchain status data will further protect Enecuum and its users from potential threats of various types by evenly distributing the degree of influence on the consensus among all its participants Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts The invention of smart contracts gave the whole cryptocurrency industry a powerful push but currently their implementation has many weak points Once a smart contract is published on the blockchain it is closed for modification hence an error during its creation can result in multimillion dollar losses for its users a situation that happened many times in various cryptocurrency projects [16] The existing methods of assessing the security of smart contracts mostly boil down to manual code auditing by the developers in the community It is submitted that this method of smart contract creation and testing is very inefficient Especially taking into account that the number of smart contracts being created grows outstrippingly fast and so does their complexity Ethereum the most popular platform for smart contracts proposes to write them in a specific programming language Solidity [17] which is yet to gain popularity in the developer community It results in a drastic shortage of experienced Solidity developers and in our opinion does not alleviate the problem The linear logic which is to be used in the implementation of SHARNELL Smart Contracts seeks to take the security of this technology to a new level It proposes to introduce reliable automatic testing of every smart contract before it is published on the blockchain This in turn focuses on minimizing chances of any errors and potential vulnerabilities In addition the proposed language of the SHARNELL Smart Contracts will be JavaScript which is one of the most popular scripting programming languages so a large number of professionals have a chance to engage in creation of SHARNELL Smart Contracts which leads a reduced cost of smart contract development Centralization of Power over the Blockchain The failed Segwit2x upgrade of the Bitcoin network and its hard fork that resulted in creation of Bitcoin Cash highlight the potential disagreements in the community [18] Unfortunately the Bitcoin\ s architecture is arranged in a way that its miners developers and ordinary users have WWW ENECUUM COM 15 \x0cdifferent motives which shape their views on proposed changes to the protocol [2] The competing interests have the effect of slowing down adaptation to changing market conditions It may lead to system obsolescence if not resolved Enecuum is to solve this problem by providing users with a fairer opportunity to influence the platform improvement process by conducting on chain voting for users\ proposals on any parameters or new changes Moreover the implementation of any changes is to involve a secure process as changes can be tested for potential failures in one of the auxiliary branches prior to their release in the main system branch 5 3 Privacy A popular belief is that cryptocurrencies are anonymous and thus provide ample opportunities for illegal activities It is also a common belief that despite the fact that all transactions inside the network are transparent and open real individuals and companies behind them are unknown However this is not entirely true since every operation in an open blockchain leaves a digital trace kept there forever and a detailed analysis performed on this trace can help determine real counterparties with a high degree of accuracy Hence if intruders manage to match a public address with a real person or company they can gain access to important confidential data and cause irreparable damage [15] [19] Enecuum will provide a way to make anonymous payments in ENQ converted to intermediate form Emission of custom anonymous tokens also will be available for DApps 6 Use cases 6 1 Token Emission Platform The proposed high throughput of the Enecuum blockchain is to allow emit custom tokens without the risk of a network hang up This tokens can be used for payments in DApps infrastructure Token issuer will use all Enecuum benefits like high speed and zero fee transactions Since smart contracts in Enecuum are to be implemented in JavaScript they will be easy to write for any web developer thus cost of their creation is likely to decrease significantly In addition the use of linear logic helps eliminate potential vulnerabilities in smart contract code and helps minimize the risks of hacking Token issuers will be responsible for the appropriate design of their Tokens use cases and ensuring that their Tokens comply with all applicable legal and regulatory obligations WWW ENECUUM COM 16 \x0c6 2 Distributed computations Enecuum aims to have the ability to run heavy smart contracts in dedicated branches Enecuum also aims to permit complex calculations that require high computational power without increasing workload on the main Enecuum branches (useful for neural networks training scientific calculations rendering computer graphics JS libraries etc) Payment for using such \xe2\x80\x9cheavy\xe2\x80\x9d smart contracts is to be made in ENQ at a flexible rate similar to the transaction price concept in the Ethereum blockchain Creating the request to perform the calculations the customer sets the price and miners decide whether it is beneficial for them to provide their computational power for the task If miners agree with the terms provided the customer\xe2\x80\x99s funds are reserved by the smart contract for future payment When the task is completed and valid results are provided the funds are released and automatically transferred to the miners 6 3 Decentralized storage The application of sharding technology and possibility to change the transaction duplication parameters allow for effective use of disk space on users\ devices For instance if 4 users provide 5 GB of space each and the duplication and sharding parameters are set to 50% the effective storage capacity for files is 10 GB Extrapolating this pattern to the entire network the size of the \xe2\x80\x9cglobal decentralized disk\xe2\x80\x9d will grow proportionally preserving the availability of data and a sufficiently high speed of access This means that in the future users may build on top of the Enecuum Blockchain such services as decentralized hostings cloud data storage services and content delivery networks 6 4 IoT applications Enecuum proposes zero transaction fees for a decentralized microtransaction service and very low fees per transaction in case of a centralized microtransaction services that involve a lot of data from a single device All generated data can be stored in blocks as transactions\xe2\x80\x99 payload We believe this is a perfect use of Enecuum\xe2\x80\x99s functionality in relation to the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Things\xe2\x80\x9d An implementation of a simple client for PoA mining on various devices could be able to completely cover their carried transaction fees Besides the Enecuum network protocol is designed to provide a high availability of such devices by establishing a mesh network between them
