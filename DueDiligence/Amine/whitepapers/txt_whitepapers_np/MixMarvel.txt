the past 20 years the rising gaming industry achieved a rapid explosive growth According to the report released by NEWZOO the game market revenue in the Asia Pacific region will reach US$71 4 billion in 2018 accounting for 52% of global game revenue with 16 8% yearly rise Owing to the growth of mobile gaming the Asia Pacific region\ s share of the global gaming market has been increasing every year by leaps and bounds North America is still the second largest game market in the world accounting for 23% of the global game market with 10% year on year growth and is expected to reach $32 7 billion in 2018 The share of Europe the Middle East and Africa is slightly behind North America accounting for 21% of global game revenue and is expected to reach $28 7 billion in 2018 The game market in Latin America will increase to $5 billion this year accounting for 4% of the global market 2 \x0cHowever in the past two years with the rise of short video sharing platforms live broadcast platforms and other entertainment methods the revenue has been lessened and the game life cycle has cut short Except for a few games none can regularly increase price and ARPU which makes the traditional game industry extremely competitive Leading many small and medium game manufacturers to barely survive The reasons for this situation are related to user demands and have a direct relationship with the shortcomings of traditional games \xe2\x97\x86 Blockchain Industry Condition During past two years the blockchain industry has experienced an explosive growth with the average number of daily users increased by hundreds of thousands By 2018 nearly 25 million wallet holders have created a market of hundreds of billions of dollars 3 \x0cGaming has a very special position in the blockchain field As in the internet field and the blockchain field games are one of the most easily accepted industries and the gaming industry also tend to have the characteristics of low trial and error costs The blockchain game industry is gradually attracting more attention in the past two years because of the booming blockchain game contents and the attraction of young aged users with high willingness to pay globally The addition of digital assets into gaming create another scope of potential value for the gaming industry There are a lot of talented teams exploring blockchain games and some have successfully created products that achieved global awareness As the industry gradually matures the blockchain oriented game business model and publishing model have become much clearer 4 \x0c1 2 Traditional Gaming Limitations \xe2\x97\x86 Data ownership problems \xef\x82\x9f Data generated by a player who has spent time and money in a game belongs to the gaming company not the players \xef\x82\x9f Gaming companies recklessly use player data manipulating it in a way that jeopardizes player interests \xef\x82\x9f Players do not own their data or the potential benefits derived from that data \xe2\x97\x86 Divided gaming economy value \xef\x82\x9f An independent in game economy makes interaction between games difficult \xef\x82\x9f Every game has limited life cycle when a player loses interest in a game the ingame assets he/she owns are wasted Whenever a new game is launched it needs to perform user acquisition every time which can be performed in more economical way \xef\x82\x9f Independent third party suppliers that offer trading of in game assets provide services with low security lots of disputes occur in the outside markets \xe2\x97\x86 Resources are monopolized and quality content cannot get exposure \xef\x82\x9f Oligopolies control the distribution channels user pools and data sources raising the cost of game development and distribution which is passed on to the players \xef\x82\x9f Although independent studios and developers create great content reaching the market is difficult \xef\x82\x9f Gaming has gradually become a \xe2\x80\x9ccash cow\xe2\x80\x9d for investors and the vicious cycle prevents really great gaming content from getting sufficient acknowledgement 5 \x0c\xe2\x97\x86 Lack of transparency \xef\x82\x9f In mainstream games players can usually gather some special items which are unique and have high value for players The items can boost character power or can earn game coins for the players In the mainstream game era the rate of generating special rare items is not disclosed to players \xef\x82\x9f In mainstream games generally players might get special in game items through lucky draw events In the existing game operating systems the special items quantity or generation rate are usually not disclosed the lack of transparency usually create unfairness and potential inflation and over supply of special items \xe2\x97\x86 Security issue \xef\x82\x9f There is rising emphasis on in game virtual asset security such as stealth of in game asset transactions and hacking behaviors that jeopardize players\xe2\x80\x99 interests \xef\x82\x9f Secondly all in game assets are issued by the gaming company Assets and items only circulate inside the game and if that game is suspended players will lose all their ownership to the assets and items which will harm the players\xe2\x80\x99 interests as well 1 3 The advantages of Game + Blockchain The blockchain technology solves the problem of trust and opens up new possibilities that would return rights that should belong to players The combination of blockchain and games not only make games much more fun to play by creating another layer of fun on the assets level but also incentivize new models of designing and 6 \x0cbusiness for the gaming industry Digital assets ownership and liquidity In the traditional game model in game points assets and characters all belong to the game developer and the game developer has the absolute right to change the rule of generation of all in game assets All the in game assets are only valuable within the game they do not carry any value outside of the game Blockchain return the ownership of digital assets back to players that players inject time with playing they will retain value generated by playing not affected by changes made by the game developer Players can manage their assets transfer them to other games rather than being controlled by the developer which greatly increase the liquidity of the assets \xe2\x80\xa2 A new relationship between players and game developers Most of the time players and game developers are never on a same page with each other Players want to earn points and thrill of the game by utilizing skills and following rules The developers always adjusting the game parameters to make the game hardest for the user and extract value through malicious pay to win practices By using the equity distribution of token economy players gain a certain right to speak and become consistent with the interests of the developers so they can reach a certain consensus and form a community to jointly maintain the development of the game To some extent the blockchain may bring unprecedented freedom and democracy to the gaming world moving the industry to a healthy direction \xef\x82\x9f Concept of Game is investment The application of blockchain based assets eradicate the game developers\ 7 \x0cindiscriminative use of game currency and assets Players can use their vote right to abandon the official game hard fork away to a new service Therefore dodgy developers will be abandoned Rare and limited digital assets value would definitely be increased gradually Under these protective mechanisms user\ s game play will truly become valuable Gaming is no longer a simple form of entertainment and consumption activity Players now can obtain practical value through their invested in game money and time and game skills Playing games may no longer be waste but investment \xef\x82\x9f A new business model The combination of the token economy and gaming brings infinite possibilities for a great internal and external economic model In essence the blockchain technology solves the problem of \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d and it is expected to create a true democratic network through application of decentralization Freedom of democracy and efficient collaboration inspire the enthusiasm of the natural participants and bring unprecedented creativity and vitality to the community In addition through completely fair and transparent blockchain based technology digital assets become the label of traffic and new games can be built by digital asset reuse or by means of standard airdrops thereby reducing the cost of asset creation In short with the continuous development of blockchain technology and the continuous innovation of the token design blockchain games will continue to gain new empowerment creating greater value Future of blockchain games is immeasurable 8 \x0c2 MIXMARVEL Overview 2 1 What is MIXMARVEL MIXMARVEL (MM) is a

game developing process to solve the problems in traditional games and blockchain games Returning to game essence entertainment and gameplay are two of the most significant factors and we wish that we can use unique blockchain design to create a safer fairer and independent game environment for game players 12 \x0c\xef\x82\x9f Data Dependability Blockchain ledger multiple node technology can record every unique \xe2\x80\x9conline digital collection virtual assets amount extraction probability\xe2\x80\x9d All of the core data will be saved on blockchain and game company is impossible to spam the virtual assets Blockchain technology can make the data transparent trusted and reduce contradictions and disputes caused by inequality between game company and game players \xef\x82\x9f Game Assets Rights Game asset is the most complex collection in multimedia products which combine art text and coding Virtual assets also become one of the most significant factors Blockchain technology provides a safe and controlled storage which are unchangeable buying and selling records Blockchain also makes virtual assets and digital collections to be secured in transaction Based on multi center storage virtual assets can keep existing as long as the network don\xe2\x80\x99t be shut down Virtual assets will never be affected by centralized operation \xef\x82\x9f The Practical Role of Blockchain Assets in Games Unlike the game assets which can only be used for speculation Game Items in MIXMARVEL also can promote the game progress The players are enabled to purchase his own home on the planet When the planet has enough residents the new planet will be discovered and MIXAMRVEL will enter a new world \xef\x82\x9f Inheritance and Permanent Record By Blockchain Ledgers When the game assets are recorded on chain the operations such as transfer splitting 13 \x0cand withdrawal will be strictly controlled by the account public keys and account private keys Meanwhile all of the operations have signature verification and leave the trading tracks The game assets inheritance will be permanently recorded A full emotional connection will be established between players and digital collections Those collections can be retrieved and interacted by the players in blockchain at any time in the future which become a eternal memory for players \xef\x82\x9f Security Protection The players\xe2\x80\x99 virtual assets are stored on a multi node record blockchain Even meet the extreme situation such as game company\xe2\x80\x99s database get invaded blockchain will not lose plays\xe2\x80\x99 game assets Blockchain can protect users\xe2\x80\x99 virtual property to the maximum extent 2 4 Products Service MIXMARVEL is a global platform and content community created by users

development First\xef\xbc\x8cPoor performance and poor flexibility A good user experience requires reliable feedback in seconds or even milliseconds but even the latest generation of blockchain technology does not have the ability to meet the demands required for gaming applications let alone the ability to handle large amounts of concurrency Different types of games usually have different characteristics in terms of process and logic which require different solutions However\xef\xbc\x8cthe existing smart contracts are relatively simple which is difficult to meet the needs of developers Second\xef\xbc\x8c lack of function and poor service The existing blockchain infrastructure lacks the functions and services to adapt to the game industry Most of the system components collaborative processing modules customization functions system interfaces and so on that developers need they must build themselves Third High cost and high barrier of Entry The high cost of blockchain technology limits not only the flexibility of developers to create applications but also the applications\xe2\x80\x99 spread and popularity among the masses In addition almost all blockchain applications need to follow a node before use Learning and use are costly 23 \x0c\xe2\x97\x86 MM focus on blockchain game solutions MIXMARVEL greatly reduces the game development and operation threshold through the fast access C/S cloud architecture rich SDK and high performance scalable Rocket Protocol 3 2 Fast access via C/S cloud architecture C/S cloud architecture \xe2\x97\x86 Fast access to systems supporting any structure For new developers there is no need to learn blockchain developing they can seamlessly get access based on their original game development experience Traditional game developers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to make major technical changes put their games into the blockchain 24 to \x0c3 3 Rich and convenient SDK MM SDK architecture MMSDK compiles abundant development tool kits for developers including internal and external SDKs as well as player community SDK MMSDK expedites game development and community construction and make it much easier to seamlessly connect players The

achievement system and VIP system can improve user stickiness \xef\x82\x9f Blockchain wallet A in built multi chain wallet can provide support for major chain currencies and NFT item storage while reducing the threshold for new users to install wallets \xef\x82\x9f Trading market Traditional game makers and asset creators can quickly sell their own items in the platform market without the need for blockchain development technology They just need SDK to release smart contracts to get items on the chain \xef\x82\x9f Community Services MM can provide a set of components such as forum system 25 \x0csocial media sharing gift package access rewards and game friends to help developers focus on the game itself without worrying about the operation and community infrastructure 3 4 High performance
