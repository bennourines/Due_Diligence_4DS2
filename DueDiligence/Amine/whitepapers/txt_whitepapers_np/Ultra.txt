and install software by means of important advances in digital content delivery \xe2\x80\x94 commonly expressed to end users as \xe2\x80\x9capp stores \xe2\x80\x9d The success of these platforms over the past 10 years has meant that users have grown to expect and demand the kind of ease of use and seamless purchasing experience that these platforms provide However this success has also produced a number of challenges for the industry These include 1 Monopoly Developers are increasingly having a hard time selling their software outside of these walled gardens which result in large commission fees and loss of control over their own customers 2 Discovery Failure As the catalog of games continues to grow gamers are having a harder time discovering the right kind of content 3 Missed Opportunities The relatively new phenomena of streamers and gaming in\xef\xac\x82uencers has created a new opportunity for game marketplaces to reward and pay users for their play time This White Paper sets out to explain not only the problem faced by Players & Developers today but also how Ultra is best positioned with a solution 4 \x0cTHE PROBLEM INDUSTRY VOICES \xe2\x80\x9c The game market system is pretty unfair Most of the money made goes to middlemen app stores social networks This is broken \xe2\x80\x9c We should not accept this as a status quo We should constantly be on lookout for better solutions \xe2\x80\x94 Tim Sweeney Founder of EPIC games \xe2\x80\x9c Buyers are unaware of [new] games so games fail\xe2\x80\xa6 popular devs\xe2\x80\xa6 get coverage but a lot of other developers who are good lose out Valve is not earning 30% You get almost nothing now from being on Steam other then the fact their near monopoly has limited your options Steam does not drive users to you at all \xe2\x80\x94 Anonymous developer (Market Study \xe2\x80\x9cMission tell Valve\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9c Getting 30% for providing no marketing support is not fair \xe2\x80\x94 Anonymous

Study \xe2\x80\x9cMission tell Valve\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9c No offense Valve but the game ban and VAC area is a joke I can\xe2\x80\x99t even get a list of people that are banned in my game

\xe2\x80\x9capp stores\xe2\x80\x9d These are developers who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with Steam\xe2\x80\x99s heavy 30% revenue share or desire to have more control over their user base However game

has a DSP (Demand Side Platform) Our DSP owns the Advertiser contracts and the Ad Exchange contracts Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s DSP provides them the ability to buy Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s ad tra\xef\xac\x83c Additionally the DSP gets tra\xef\xac\x83c from the SSP (Server Side Platform) / Ad Exchange Our DSP takes a small % of the service charge from Ad Agencies and Advertisers The DSPs allows advertisers to buy impressions from a wide range of publisher sites that are targeting speci\xef\xac\x81c users based on criteria such as location age gender hobbies etc Our DSP \xe2\x80\x98plugs in\xe2\x80\x99 to any typical ad exchange marketplace where publishers make their ad inventory available to Ultra We analyze the impressions SSPs put out and purchase on behalf of advertisers automatically The price of ads \xef\xac\x82uctuates depending on the target user demographics demand and tra\xef\xac\x83c availability each transaction is settled using UOS token 17 \x0cTHE TECHNOLOGY AD DSP TECHNOLOGY Ultra Ads has a DSP (Demand Side Platform) Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s SSP is used to automate the sale of our advertising space and inventory While a DSP is used by marketers to buy ad impressions from ad exchanges as cheaply and e\xef\xac\x83ciently as possible the SSP is designed for publishers to maximize the price they sell impressions at They\xe2\x80\x99re both powered by similar technology but operate at the opposite side of the table Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s Ad technology is therefore able to both buy tra\xef\xac\x83c externally as well as sell its internal tra\xef\xac\x83c to external ad exchanges to optimize ad pro\xef\xac\x81tability and performance 18 \x0cTHE TECHNOLOGY ULTRA GO Ultra Go is our platform companion app It provides convenient features for mobile users on the go adds new sources of

distribution platform or virtual goods trading service These 3rd party services still require Ultra coins to operate and our core platform features such as multi level referral programs are enforced across all shops through our blockchain Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s o\xef\xac\x83cial clients as well as 3rd party websites virtual asset exchanges and even uno\xef\xac\x83cial Ultra clients Toolkits to help businesses interact with Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain and services (buy content trade content upload content etc) EOS based distributed ledger with Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s smart contracts operating with Ultra Coins Global hybrid CDN storing all games and uploading/updating them to client users with virtually unlimited bandwidth capacity Toolkit to help game developers integrate communications with Ultra Protocol (virtual item management and trading) Running game uploaded on Ultra 21 \x0cBLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY POWERED BY ULTRA COINS (UOS TOKENS) All purchases of games virtual items and services on Ultra Games operate through smart contracts which require Ultra Coins also called UOS Tokens All features on Ultra such as our loyalty programs beta testing bug reporting trade of digital goods advertisements etc work exclusively with UOS Tokens To get started users will be required to acquire coins from other users or through our fully transparent credit card and payment gateway solutions Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s Blockchain services are designed to be operated in and outside of Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s o\xef\xac\x83cial clients This philosophy opens the door to new business and revenue streams for 3rd party actors In other words it is possible through Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain protocols and APIs to purchase and trade games and virtual items through websites PC and mobile applications that are not operated by Ultra 22 \x0cBLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY GAME TOKENIZATION Developers will want to publish content on Ultra in order to gain access to their own \xe2\x80\x9ctoken factory \xe2\x80\x9d This will allow them to effortlessly materialize their games into a secure crypto token Ultra Coins can be sold through Ultra and thanks to the decentralized nature of our tokens it is also possible to sell them on external marketplaces By owning a token in Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s token wallet users are able to download games and get updates the same way content and updates are downloaded from familiar platforms such as XBOX and Steam Unique to Ultra our convenient UI allows developers the freedom to customize the services or rights their token grants to other users Notable Game Token Customizations Include \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Secondhand market allowed or not Sales revenue split with multi signature Referral program for UOS tokens Additional referral program for items Game access subscription (World of Warcraft style) Monthly game update subscription 23 \x0cBLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY VIRTUAL ITEM TOKENIZATION Like games the Ultra platform also makes it possible to tokenize virtual items and sell them through our marketplace or through external marketplaces Tokens can be con\xef\xac\x81gured by the game developer with the following optional features \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Consumable the token is destroyed when \xe2\x80\x9cused\xe2\x80\x9d Ex a health potion Item subscription the token grants access to the item during a set period of time Ex a \xe2\x80\x9c24h double xp boost\xe2\x80\x9d token Secondhand market allowed or not Sales revenue split with multi signature 24 \x0cBLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY SECONDHAND MARKET Ultra is the \xef\xac\x81rst platform to offer a solution for second hand games in the mainstream digital games market Developers can give their secondhand games and virtual items new life and increase their revenue by receiving an additional revenue share from all secondhand resales Secondhand resale functionality is fully blockchain based optional and customizable For example it is possible to allow resales only after a certain amount of time has passed to avoid cannibalizing launch sales revenue The Bene\xef\xac\x81ts of the Ultra Secondhand Market are Clear \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Players re selling their games are able to earn Ultra Coins allowing them to buy more content Players buying second hand games have access to content that may not have been affordable to them at full retail prices Developers capitalize on an additional revenue stream We believe that secondhand games sales managed in this way is a huge opportunity for users and game developers 25 \x0cBLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY 2 LEVEL REFERRAL PROGRAM 50% of Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s share of game sales revenue is redistributed to players and developers that bring new users to the platform Good for Players Players who invite their friends to the platform will receive Ultra Coins every time their referees purchase content Good for Developers Game developers are incentivized to direct their marketing efforts towards Ultra to earn an additional revenue stream from their users\xe2\x80\x99 purchases \xe2\x80\x94 even purchases of content from other developers \xe2\x97\x8f Any Ultra gamer or developer can invite new users to the platform \xe2\x97\x8f 2% of all a referees\xe2\x80\x99 game purchases are shared with their referrer \xe2\x97\x8f Referrers can accumulate an unlimited number of referees \xe2\x97\x8f Referees can in their turn also invite new users earning them 1% ongoing commission 26 \x0cBLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY RELIABLE CRYPTOCURRENCY CONTENT PRICING The 14 Million Dollar Pizza In 2010 it was possible to purchase a pizza with 5 000 Bitcoins If the price of this delicious Italian food never adapted to the market one of those pizzas today would cost about 30 million dollars It is safe to assume that nobody would buy pizzas at that price The 1 Dollar Solution To tackle the UOS Token value \xef\xac\x82uctuations content providers will con\xef\xac\x81gure the sales prices of their content in USD Ultra will pull the latest USD value of an Ultra Coin from its internal coin exchange and provide the USD to Ultra Coin conversion rate to smart contracts in real time In this way USD prices set by content providers can be converted in Ultra Coins automatically at purchase time In Other Words An application that costs $50 will always cost $50 however the amount of Ultra Coins required to complete the transaction on the blockchain will \xef\xac\x82uctuate according to the latest Ultra Coin market price 27 \x0cTOKEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND HANDLING TRADITIONAL PAYMENT METHODS While Ultra\xe2\x80\x99s content marketplace will offer both Ultra Coin and classic payment options all transactions will ultimately be executed using Ultra Coins Payments via traditional methods like credit card PayPal etc are automatically and transparently converted to Ultra Coins (by purchasing them from coin holders) which are then used to complete the transaction User uses Credit Card Or PayPal Ultra coin conversion rates found on exchanges Ultra coin purchased from Ultra coin holders User buys game with Ultra coins Game added in player inventory 28 \x0cTOKEN

Acquisition War Chest \xe2\x80\x9d These coins will stay frozen in a smart contract for a period of at least 2 years Unfrozen War Chest coins will be used to acquire new exclusive games and services for Ultra bringing even more players to our platform generating more pro\xef\xac\x81ts redistributing more coins and consequently increasing the amount of Ultra Coins in the War Chest at each cycle While this process in essence burns away part of our short term pro\xef\xac\x81t it ultimately guarantees the healthy growth of both the user base and exclusive games Coins are released to game studios when they reach their development milestones Ultra Coins frozen for 2 years Investment in exclusive games Players join platform & purchase content 29 \x0cTOKEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND COLLATERAL Collateral For Reclaims 10% of all games sales occurring on Ultra will be frozen for period of 2 months as collateral against refund requests Ultra will use these funds for veri\xef\xac\x81ed and

\x0cDISCLOSURES RISK FACTORS This section on risk factors is not and does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved with the purchase of ULTRA tokens There may be additional risks of which the Company is not aware The following therefore highlights certain risks to which the Company is subject to and which the Company wishes to encourage prospective purchasers of ULTRA tokens to discuss with their own professional advisors \xe2\x97\x8f Risk of software weaknesses The ULTRA platform and the underlying technology are still in an early development stage and unproven There is no warranty that the process for creating the ULTRA Platform will be uninterrupted or error free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses vulnerabilities or bugs causing inter alia the complete loss of the Tokens \xe2\x97\x8f Regulatory risk The blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on or introduce new securities law tax or other laws or regulations addressing blockchain technology based applications and/or the issuance and sale of tokens which may inter alia result in substantial modi\xef\xac\x81cations to the sale of ULTRA tokens and/ or the ULTRA platform including its termination and the loss of all ULTRA tokens \xe2\x97\x8f Government action Because of the regulatory uncertainty described above blockchain activities including the activities of the Company may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny including investigations or enforcement actions All of this could subject the Company to judgments settlements \xef\xac\x81nes or penalties or require or cause the Company to restructure its operations and activities to cease offering certain products or services in one or more jurisdictions or refrain from delivering the ULTRA tokens to certain persons or in certain jurisdictions \xe2\x97\x8f Risk of abandonment/lack of success The creation of the ULTRA tokens and the development of the ULTRA platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons including lack of interest from the public lack of funding lack of commercial success or prospects (e g caused by competing projects) Also even if the ULTRA platform is partially or fully developed and launched there is no assurance for its future users to use and access the ULTRA platform as anticipated \xe2\x97\x8f Risk associated with other applications It is possible that alternative platforms and businesses could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the ULTRA platform The ULTRA platform may compete with these alternative platforms and businesses which could negatively impact the adoption of the ULTRA platform and the ULTRA tokens In addition the ULTRA platform may give rise to other alternative projects promoted by una\xef\xac\x83liated third parties under which the ULTRA tokens will have reduced or potentially no intrinsic value There is a risk that the Company or its representatives or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the ULTRA platform interfering with the use of or causing the loss of the ULTRA tokens \xe2\x97\x8f Risk of theft The smart contract used to generate the Tokens and the underlying software application may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals including but not limited to malware attacks denial of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil attacks smur\xef\xac\x81ng and spoo\xef\xac\x81ng Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of payments made to the Company and/or the ULTRA tokens adversely impacting the ability to use or develop the ULTRA platform and derive any usage or functionality from the ULTRA tokens 46 \x0cDISCLOSURES RISK FACTORS \xe2\x97\x8f ULTRA/Other Blockchain Mining Attacks As with other cryptocurrencies the blockchain being used for the ULTRA tokens is susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks \xe2\x80\x9csel\xef\xac\x81sh mining\xe2\x80\x9d attacks and race condition attacks Any successful attacks present a risk to the ULTRA tokens and the ULTRA platform expected proper execution and sequencing of token transactions and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations \xe2\x97\x8f Development Risk The timing for issuing the ULTRA tokens and for completing various steps in the implementation of the ULTRA platform are set forth in this Whitepaper However there is no assurance that the Company will meet those target dates The ULTRA platform operationality may be limited at the time of the ULTRA tokens delivery date and not all of the anticipated operational features intended for the ULTRA platform may be functioning at that time The ULTRA platform will still be subject to ongoing development and could undergo signi\xef\xac\x81cant changes over time In addition because the development of the ULTRA platform may be depended on third parties the Company may have limited control over future ULTRA tokens functionality or in assuring the ongoing operation and performance of the ULTRA platform \xe2\x97\x8f No Liquidity ULTRA tokens are not intended for investment purposes ULTRA tokens holders may not be able to sell transfer or trade its unused ULTRA tokens to any other party ULTRA tokens are intended to be used only in connection with the ULTRA platform There may never be a secondary market for the ULTRA tokens ULTRA tokens may be subject to signi\xef\xac\x81cant transfer restrictions as a result of actions taken by the Company or by government regulators \xe2\x97\x8f Early Stage Companies The Company is a start up and has no operating history against which purchasers of the ULTRA tokens may consider the appropriateness of purchasing the ULTRA tokens Many risks and uncertainties affect start up and early stage companies which often have very limited operating history pro\xef\xac\x81ts or cash \xef\xac\x82ow There can be no assurance of the success of such enterprises Their potential must be considered in light of the problems expenses di\xef\xac\x83culties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with new or developing businesses including technology risks unproven business models untested plans uncertain market acceptance competition and lack of revenues and \xef\xac\x81nancing The technological \xef\xac\x81elds and markets that many start ups and early stage companies address have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and signi\xef\xac\x81cant change Rapid technological developments may result in the technology of companies becoming obsolete uneconomical or uncompetitive before any commercial success or \xef\xac\x81nancial return can be achieved Numerous other risks may affect developing companies and ventures including risks that products or services will be found to be ineffective unreliable unsafe or uncompetitive and risks that such companies\xe2\x80\x99 technologies products or service will not achieve market acceptance or penetration Market acceptance of new products services or technologies depends on many factors and uncertainties and cannot be assured Startup and early stage companies may compete with entities that have established businesses relationships and positions in the market and that have much more substantial \xef\xac\x81nancial business technological marketing and distribution assets operations and resources There can be no assurance that any developing company will be able to compete successfully with more established companies These companies may be overly dependent on the vision skill and leadership of a single or limited number of executives In a startup business the loss or disability of a key person(s) can result in signi\xef\xac\x81cant \xef\xac\x81nancial hardship in some cases the failure of the company More than other businesses start ups are highly dependent on the skills and contributions of very few key employees 47 \x0cDISCLOSURES RISK FACTORS Any projections forecasts plans or other forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks uncertainties changing circumstances and other factors that could cause actual results performance plans prospects operations and opportunities to differ materially from any forward looking statements including competition inability to identify and do business with appropriate customers existing and future law and regulations liabilities under the securities laws inability to hire retain or qualify
