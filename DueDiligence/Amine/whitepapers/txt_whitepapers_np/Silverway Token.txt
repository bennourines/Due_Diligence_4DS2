b Silverway OTC marketplace for private round tokens Whitepaper v 1 2 silverway io \x0cIntroduction Silverway is professional the first investors OTC buy (over the counter) and sell private marketplace round tokens that and helps access aggregated data and analytics on OTC transactions to support investment decisions Silverway introduces an effective solution to an unstructured and non transparent market segment unlocking $4 bn worth of locked value The current ecosystem already includes 750+ professional investors [1] and hundreds of projects and could potentially be opened up to far more accredited market participants The platform has been created by a team of former Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital investment bankers and private equity professionals who have been amongst the pioneer professional investors in the crypto and blockchain sector Silverway team has embarked on a journey to institutionalize the $4 bn private token sales market segment making it more

space needs a simple and transparent platform for the secondary market for SAFTs and locked tokens The existing secondary market for private round tokens entirely operates in a gray area \xe2\x80\xa8 Its current structure creates a number of issues and risks for all participants involved \xe2\x80\xa8 It is very fragmented hard to access opaque sometimes chaotic \r It operates via secret chats in Telegram/WhatsApp/Skype [6] personal meetings syndicating pools redundant and often unreliable intermediaries [7][24] This creates a high risk environment wherein all bona fide participants face the threat of encountering legal problems AML related accusations fraud [11] and theft of assets [12] \xe2\x80\xa8 as well as opaque intermediary chains [5] All counterparties face these issues due to complicated market structure described below \xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8 \xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8 \xe2\x80\xa8 Sellers Large amounts of locked up investments Around $4 bn of funds from investment entities are already locked up [2] \r Investors are often in need of faster cash out/ liquidity/ portfolio rebalance \r Buyers High risk and limited access to private rounds Private rounds of the most game changing projects are largely occupied by a limited number of funds and investors so a lot of VC / blockchain funds and family offices are struggling to get access to these rounds [2] \r Though many investors would eagerly pay premiums to enter well performing projects that are close to TGE (token generation event)/token distribution no procedure exists for doing so When sourcing transactions on the secondary market investors are forced to waste time and face a number of risks associated with a non transparent network of unverified intermediaries [15] \r Low transparency of the deals on the existing OTC market often results in high fees included into transaction price Projects Risk of token dump and uncontrollable secondary market A limited number of investors frequently hold more than two thirds of tokens for 3 sale which creates an inevitable risk of dump after public trading starts [ 1] \xe2\x80\xa8 3 To mitigate this risk projects have to experiment with lock up structures [ ] \r The existing secondary OTC market for locked tokens is spontaneous Projects have no control over it The volatile nature of a still nascent blockchain investment market means that locking up their investments for a year or more creates unnecessary challenges for potential sellers and buyers 01 \x0cThe Solution Silverway is the first platform to enable the professional investors to buy and sell private round tokens in a transparent marketplace as well as provide aggregate OTC market data on past and active transactions/offers to support informed investment decisions The marketplace collects buy and sell offers from investment funds and other professional investors and facilitates direct transactions between sellers and buyers In addition to that paid users also get access to comprehensive market data for monitoring analyzing and tracking OTC market dynamics \r The company\xe2\x80\x99s key goal is to institutionalize the $4 bn private token sale market segment making it more transparent and safe to invest in Using the Silverway platform will safeguard market participants from the major risks related to OTC crypto trading [10] and bring benefits to the market as a whole \r Benefits for Sellers Liquidity management and portfolio rebalancing Any part of the private sale allocation can be sold on the platform at any time regardless of the lock up period \r This provides far more flexibility for locked tokens portfolio management \r Realized gains can be re invested or distributed to LPs (limited partners) Potentially higher sell prices Effective selling prices can be set higher than on the currently dominant gray market due to the liquidity premium and removal of cumbersome intermediary chains \r Higher prices give sellers more opportunities for effective risk management \r Sellers can auction off private round tokens when demand is high Benefits for Buyers Access to private rounds of top/best performing projects The transparent procedure will allow a wider range of interested investors to enter the top projects\xe2\x80\x99 private rounds which are currently mostly occupied by the largest funds \r Strategic buyers will get access to allocations in such projects on the secondary market without the risks associated with today\xe2\x80\x99s market \r 02 \x0cPortfolio diversification Strategic buyers can expand their investments by adding top projects across any market segment \r Such diversification enables investors to build more risk resistant portfolios \r Investment opportunities are less restricted by geography or fund size Benefits for Projects Increased number of institutional token holders Having many institutional investors is beneficial for a project \r With more qualified investors joining the project its dependence on public token trading is greatly reduced \r Protection of token price from dumps Secondary tokens are usually purchased with a premium to the private sale price additionally mitigating the risks associated with unfavorable token price dynamics \r By attracting strategic buyers on the secondary market the project forms a new layer of committed investors including long term holders Additional income Projects will receive a share of the transaction fees without any direct costs or operational involvement Fundraising platform for launching projects (coming soon) \xe2\x80\xa8 By conducting primary fundraising through the Silverway platform\xe2\x80\x99s community of institutional investors projects will be able to reduce their operational and time costs Benefits for all market participants Market growth Large number of new investment funds and family offices will be able to enter the market and increase their capital allocations in blockchain projects by purchasing SAFTs/locked tokens on secondary market Direct transactions For a large proportion of the deals conducted on its platform Silverway directly matches verified professional investors on the buy and sell sides Simplicity and effectiveness Simple and user friendly platform with only relevant information\r Well structured deal pipeline that allows for better and more secure deal matching and closure\r Transparency and certainty Market participants no longer have to deal with opaque intermediary chains secret chats and lose time when looking for allocations and reliable counterparties 03 \x0cRisk reduction As a one stop platform Silverway takes care of all associated risks \r All the transactions are anonymously matched with the counterparties\xe2\x80\x99 identities which are revealed privately only after a Proof of Intent submission \r The Market The crypto market is crowded with a large number of exchanges and OTC brokers However its lucrative private placement niche remains underserved Silverway will help significantly increase the presence of institutional participants liquidity volume and funds turnover in the blockchain investments market Since Protocol Labs introduced SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) \xe2\x80\x94 the structured legal contract \xe2\x80\x94 in Q4 2017 the token sale market has promptly shifted to the private placement model By the end of 2018 private sales had taken over 50% of the market volume on average and up to 75\xe2\x80\x93100% of the most sought after projects [2] \xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8 A sharp market drop in November 2018 along with uncertainty regarding further market dynamics made most projects in the last year postpone the launch of their token generation events On the other hand projects that conduct placement via the recently introduced Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) vehicle [8] mostly either align the cliff and/or vesting period to the IEO date or even extend past it Moreover they tend to alter the selling conditions so as not to favor funds and other institutional investors effectively increasing the total lockup horizon and as a result the market size of frozen capital 04 \x0cFundraising $ mn Acc unlock $ mn Public trading (indicative) The typical scheme of a blockchain project\xe2\x80\x99s private round is to lock up investments for 8\xe2\x80\x9324 months For instance TON network (which alone made a placement worth $1 7 bn) suggested multi stage private rounds with lockups of up to 18 months since the mainnet launch date was scheduled for December 2018 at the earliest As a matter of fact the TON mainnet launch was postponed (most likely will be launched by Oct 2019 as per the token sale agreement) which extends the effective lockup period for more than two years for the first private round investors [32] According to Silverway research the total volume of locked up investments has reached the impressive amount of $4 bn [2] The large amount of frozen capital on the market along with high volatility leaves investors with assets that are not traded and thus illiquid Attempts to overcome this drive the current gray market in locked private round tokens conducted through a large number of OTC chats OTC Market Overall positive dynamics have been observed in terms of growing attention from established traditional investors toward the blockchain space There is growing interest in crypto assets from institutional investors is supported by evidence from diverse areas of the financial industry [18][19][20] including hedge funds trading liquid assets [16] as well as from VC/PE funds increasingly investing in blockchain projects [33] Alongside UHNW individuals expressing interest in crypto firms like State Street Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also set up shadow crypto trading desks [22] Since December 2017 institutional investors have been entering OTC crypto markets [14] \xe2\x80\xa8 at times driving surges of up to 60% in the net imbalance between OTC buys and sellers [17] The positive market dynamics in April 2019 also prompted a 66% increase in OTC trading activity on Binance [21] \r According to Cryptofunds Research crypto assets under management by hedge venture and PE funds reached $14 350 M as of April 2019 [1] \r 05 \x0cMarket Size Evaluation Estimates of the size of the OTC market vary drastically since being relatively unregulated it undergoes little in the way of strict quantification For instance in April 2018 the Bitcoin OTC market was estimated to be either three times larger1 or 15 times smaller2 than the exchange market \r However evaluating the size of the OTC market for locked tokens and SAFTs is much more complicated since the OTC desks prefer to work with the most liquid digital assets and it is almost impossible to monitor all closed deals and their final terms in OTC chats and groups The absence of an institutional grade trade facilitator for these type of investments leaves locked private round assets to be traded on a labyrinthine market that lacks trust between participants \r Silverway\xe2\x80\x99s in house research reports a substantial TAM with a current estimated size of over $4 bn [2] This data was aggregated from multiple industry sources including Cryptodiffer Hypernum ICOBox ICORating Tokenschedule ICOData SmithandCrown ICOBench SATIS TokenData ICODrops Coindesk Medium and broker research as well as private discussions with the most active investors on the market \xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8 $21 1 bn Total volume of \xe2\x80\xa8 token sales in Q1 2017 Q1 2019 $4 1 bn Agg volume of locked up \xe2\x80\xa8 funds from private sales Q1 2019 750+ Institutional \xe2\x80\xa8 market players in Q1 2019 This estimation falls in line with other research For instance the crypto intelligence platform InWara reports that in 2018 despite a sharp decline in public sales private funding saw ~100% growth as VCs / dedicated blockchain funds went long on blockchain projects which as of the end of Q3 2018 collectively raised ~$4 1 bn [37] 1 ~$4 vs ~$12 bn worth of bitcoin processed per day the TABB group estimation [13] 2 Digital Asset research estimated the market to hold $250 M in bitcoin trades per day [15] 06 \x0cMoreover according to Circle research in the US alone there has been a more than 6 fold increase in the number of Reg D offerings filed with the SEC [38] This kind of investment is subject to a 12 month lockup and is only available to \xe2\x80\x9caccredited investors \xe2\x80\x9d3 In 2018 287 such offerings collected ~$8 7 bn quadrupling the amount raised \xe2\x80\xa8 in 2017 This trend being concurrent with the growing number of cryptofunds [1] is indicative of a rise of investor grade token sale products Transparent Customer Universe The current list of active market participants includes 750+ investors (~400 VC and private equity funds as well as at least 350 crypto hedge funds) [1] and hundreds of projects [2] \r The undoubtable advantage of this market is relatively easy access to all of its participants There is no need to overcome a client\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge gaps since all market participants are highly motivated and it is in their own interests to be ultimately collaborative \r 3 Companies that have over $5 million in assets or individuals that have a net worth of over $1 million or that have consistently made over $200 000 per year in income 07 \x0cCompetitive landscape There is a significant interest in OTC deals with SAFTs and locked tokens but there is no platform that addresses all investor requirements The token trading market is currently represented by Hundreds of exchanges that trade only listed tokens and derivatives A large number of OTC brokers/desks that trade liquid crypto and crypto/fiat pairs 4 Fundraising platforms used for primary token sales Platforms for whales and syndicating pools to participate in a limited number of private sales 5 OTC Telegram/ Wechat/QQ brokers The demand for a new OTC service paradigm is also supported by the increasing number of OTC desks launched by crypto asset exchanges in recent months despite the bearish market [23] These include such projects as Coinbase Prime [28] Poloniex [26] and Huobi OTC The latest to jump on the OTC bandwagon in 2019 were Bittrex [29] Bithumb\xe2\x80\x99s Ortus and Coincheck [27] \r Circle Trade founded in February 2018 was one of the earliest OTC platforms and trades \xe2\x80\xa8 a \xe2\x80\x9cvery limited\xe2\x80\x9d selection of cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x9caligned\xe2\x80\x9d to its \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory licensure [7] However in 2018 Circle executed 10 000 OTC trades with 600 different counterparties with a total volume of

08 \x0cNonetheless despite the large number of brokers and other intermediaries there still aren\xe2\x80\x99t any institutional grade platforms dealing with the secondary market in SAFTs/locked tokens Silverway leverages its unique founding team experience to enter into a market segment that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been rationalized or penetrated by an institutional player \r The private token sale market often has a high entry threshold many projects prefer to deal with large funds [30] Therefore a lot of professional investors have limited access \xe2\x80\xa8 to private sale rounds and are looking to buy private sale tokens sometimes with significant premiums Taking into account the nature of the market and the very fast changing environment presented by both the market overall and by particular projects buyers are looking for access to the best performing projects (e g the projects which are close to TGE or mainnet launch) On the other hand many investors are also looking for ways to sell their locked tokens in order to realize price premiums get additional liquidity to diversify their portfolios or just cash out faster Thus all counterparties are inherently interested in secure direct deals without redundant intermediaries 09 \x0cLegal side Developed by Cooley in 2017 [35] the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) model was widely employed throughout 2017\xe2\x80\x932018 as a way for projects to avoid potential regulatory concerns while raising funds Inspired by SAFE6 contracts used by startups SAFT specifically addresses unregulated \xe2\x80\x9cdirect presales\xe2\x80\x9d of pre functional platform tokens that are sold before the platform is complete \r Numerous SAFT like instruments that allow projects to avoid compliance pitfalls and security regulations for token sales have been deployed since then Most SAFTs are restricted to accredited investors and many are registered with national regulatory bodies under official fundraising regimes most commonly Regulation D in the United States [9] \r While their owners are likely to be eager to partially liquidate their investments most projects require explicit consent from project side for the transfer of future tokens to third parties Sanctions for breaching lock up can even lead to agreement termination Nevertheless investors do not abstain from trading their locked tokens on the secondary market in an effort to make their investments work \r \xe2\x80\xa8 An excerpt of a typical SAFT\xe2\x80\x99s lock up section The lack of a transparent SAFT trading procedure creates legal complications and prevents legitimate investors from trading thus creating a niche for gray market schemes such as backdating funds\xe2\x80\x99 capitalization tables \r The Silverway platform aims to provide a compliant institutional grade solution for OTC trading of non listed tokens Silverway will apply its best efforts to be compliant with projects\xe2\x80\x99 SAFT

and Proof of Intent payments The discounts diminish quadratically over time providing additional incentive to use tokens as fast as possible To simplify the discount calculation for platform users the initial quadratic function is replaced with a closely resembling step function \xe2\x80\xa8\xe2\x80\xa8 Year 1 \xe2\x80\x94 50%\r Year 2 \xe2\x80\x94 28%\r Year 3 \xe2\x80\x94 14%\r Year 4

passed on to Silverway This mechanism ensures that token value is dependent on platform usage \r To protect the platform\xe2\x80\x99s users against volatility prices are set either in common currencies (for services/Proof of Intent) or percentages of the total sum (for fees) and then recalculated into platform tokens Therefore the token dynamics may be expressed by the following system Where The burn rate is set to constant values which will be determined at a later time subject to change by a decision by the board of directors \r Essentially at each period the amount of SLV earned by the platform is equal to\r while the token valuation is simply a reserve rate discounted sum of all upsides (service and fee discounts) that token holders can receive over the platform\xe2\x80\x99s
