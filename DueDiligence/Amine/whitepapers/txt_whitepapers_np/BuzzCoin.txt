BUZZcoin\xe2\x84\xa2 is a non profit blockchain implementation that aims to help save the worlds declining bee population By implementing blockchain technology into existing bee hives BUZZcoin aims to create a worldwide data network that collects beehive health data The project brings together a diverse group of experts developing a smart hive device prototype that will soon enter its field testing phase BUZZcoin is supporting the global effort to save the bees by providing collected data to scientific projects and organizations that focus on saving the worlds bee population By providing this data to the network and being able to get highly accurate data from the hives beekeepers are rewarded in cryptocurrency for their data collection This will ensure a wide spread usage of the smart hive devices The core team\ s main focus when they started the BC HMD\xe2\x84\xa2 Device development back in October 2017 was collecting industry specific research primarily focusing on the smart hive technology The teams experience in various industries is the driving force behind the prototype development Transitioning the architecture of BUZZcoin from a proof of stake coin into one of the very few existing cryptocurrencies that have a real world application The network data provided coupled with the features of a modern blockchain implementation can truly revolutionize the entire beekeeping industry WHITE PAPER Revision V3 0 20190714 \xe2\x80\xa2 Copyright \xc2\xa9 2019 BUZZCOIN INC \xe2\x80\xa2 The BUZZCOIN\xe2\x84\xa2 PROJECT is a non profit open source project 4 / 34 \x0cCORE TEAM

BUZZcoin\xe2\x84\xa2 3 2 is currently based on PoW and PoS HEXAGON Algorithm SHA256d HEXAGON Reward 10 BUZZ per Block HEXAGON New Block every minute on average HEXAGON Variable POS ROI rewards HEXAGON 20 billion (20 000 000 000) maximum supply HEXAGON 5% development fee on every POS stake Please note POW was disabled when BUZZCOIN reached max supply Since BUZZcoin 3 2 BUZZ is running on POS only and is therefor highly energy efficient and environmental friendly All technical details are subject to change with the release of BUZZcoin 4 0 DEVELOPMENT FEE Due to the lack of an ICO the BUZZcoin development team decided to allow 85% of the Proof of Stake coins to be generated without a development fee When 17 billion coins had been generated a development fee of 5% was implemented It will allow generation of around 150 000 000 in BUZZ for the development team before Maximum Supply is reached To manage IMPORTANT the expenses required for research development infrastructure and production we have HEXAGON The BUZZcoin project was taken over in January 2018 by the current core team with an empty \t\t developer wallet added the mandatory 5% development fee for every stake For example on a stake of 100 000 HEXAGON All services to maintain the project are being paid by the core team\ s own money BUZZ a payment of 5 000 BUZZ is sent to the HEXAGON The coins collected through the developer fee will be used to set up Masternodes to stabilize \t\t development fund to ensure constant advances the BUZZcoin 4 0 network in the development of the BUZZcoin project WHITE PAPER

Proof of Stake is an algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network achieves consensus by using existing coins to confirm new blocks For more information please see https //en wikipedia org/wiki/Proof of stake Single User Wallet Node Only Support In the past with Proof of Stake staking pools massively undermined the health of the BUZZcoin network We firmly do not support Staking Pools as they go against the principles of a decentralized Proof of Stake blockchain network BUZZcoin\xe2\x84\xa2 only supports single user wallet nodes Year Percentage Reward Algorithm Year % = ( 1200 ( 1200 * (Current Supply / Max Supply) ) For example at a current supply value of 19 500 000 000 at the time of this writing the yearly reward algorithm follows these basic mathematical principles Year % = ( 1200 ( 1200 * (19 500 000 000 / 20 000 000 000) ) Year % = ( 1200 ( 1200 * ( 0 975 ) ) Year % = 1200 1170 Year % = 30% The maturation time is 2 hours Maximum Supply The Maximum Supply is set to a value of 20 billion (20 000 000 000) At this maximum supply value Proof of Work and Proof of Stake rewards will be turned off Please note that BUZZcoin has hit Maximum Supply on June 6th 2019 Transaction fees are constantly burned and deducted from the circulating supply These burned fees are constantly available as staking rewards WHITE PAPER Revision V3 0 20190714
