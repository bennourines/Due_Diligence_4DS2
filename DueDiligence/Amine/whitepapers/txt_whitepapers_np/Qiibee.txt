\x0cExecutive Summary Loyalty market offers USD 500bn opportunity for blockchain infrastructure \xe2\x97\x8f Today\xe2\x80\x99s point based loyalty market is inefficient for both brands and customers \xe2\x97\x8f Converting points into real value loyalty tokens on the blockchain has enormous potential qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s LoyaltyToken Protocol capitalizes at significant scale and adoption rate \xe2\x97\x8f Brands issue own loyalty tokens via plug & play and enjoy full flexibility of loyalty program design \xe2\x97\x8f In 2018 only 10 brands confirmed loyalty token and DAPP issuance on qiibee Massive demand for the qiibee token QBX is driven by substantial B2B usage of loyalty tokens \xe2\x97\x8f Buying QBX on the public market is required to back issue and use loyalty tokens on qiibee \xe2\x97\x8f This not only creates demand but also decreases the free circling QBX supply Team advisors and partners have the blockchain expertise and executional track record to deliver \xe2\x97\x8f qiibee is pushed by well known experts funds and market makers Block Collider Fingenom Bamboo BitBoom \xe2\x97\x8f Adoption is boosted by 5 partnering agencies that resell QBX based loyalty tokens and white label DAPPs qiibee White Paper | Page 3 of 43 \x0c1 What is our mission At qiibee our mission is to establish a loyalty ecosystem for hundreds of brands that service thousands of customers We help brands run their loyalty programs on the blockchain \xe2\x80\x8band aim to become an efficient protocol that enables brands to operate their own loyalty programs where they maintain full control Apart from providing a robust blockchain agnostic protocol qiibee streamlines the integration experience for brands by offering a software development kit which has a direct impact on brands\xe2\x80\x99 time and resources In this sense consolidating the loyalty market means creating a loyalty ecosystem that is based on the same foundation and enabling different loyalty program owners to either move their existing loyalty programs from off to on chain or create their own loyalty tokens and reward their loyal customers qiibee will also support brands with the help of marketing agencies and the qiibee software developer kit We give loyal customers the freedom they deserve Within the qiibee ecosystem customers will always have full control of and transparency about their loyalty programs and tokens What is more they have a larger set of options to choose from and a more convenient way of managing their loyalty programs Also they are free to exit the ecosystem anytime and can participate in the crypto market without buying crypto with their own FIAT money In sum we want to offer brands and customers the possibility to easily engage with blockchain technology directly and indirectly without the need for cost intensive integration for brands or an upfront investment for customers By making the loyalty landscape more efficient and user friendly we aim to make it a better experience for both brands and the customers qiibee White Paper | Page 4 of 43 \x0c2 What problems are we solving For brands loyalty is a tricky game According to Reuters & Affinity Capital Exchange (2017) an \xe2\x80\x8bestimated USD 500 billion in points are left unredeemed by members\xe2\x80\x8b This figure clearly shows that brands have to make their programs more effective to really drive customer behavior While loyalty programs have become fairly common at the same time customers increasingly expect more personalized and shared interactions across brands\xe2\x80\x99 loyalty programs which makes it essential for brands to rethink their loyalty strategies (Bond Brand Loyalty 2017 p 2) What makes it so hard for brands to successfully navigate the loyalty landscape First loyalty in itself is connected with \xe2\x80\x8bhigh customer acquisition costs for the brands\xe2\x80\x8b Not only are loyalty programs expensive to set up but it is difficult to attract new customers by means of a loyalty program In general customers are reluctant to sign up for a new loyalty program since the value added is not always immediately apparent and there is a vast amount of programs available Moreover the \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty landscape is characterized by low levels of engagement and redemption\xe2\x80\x8b Most of the time customers collect the points but rarely redeem them Against this background it is difficult for brands to boost the level of activity with their programs Also the \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty points translate into an outstanding liability for the brands as they are accounted for as deferred revenue\xe2\x80\x8b In this sense the brand has to determine the amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services For this it needs to estimate the redemption value of their loyalty points where variations could have a significant influence on their respective yearly profit or loss Lastly there are \xe2\x80\x8boperational risks and inefficiencies inherent in loyalty programs\xe2\x80\x8b Given the vast amount of personal customer data a company holds the risk of a massive data breach is apparent Complex data protection requirements and account guidelines make it more complicated to manage the security risk Loyal customers on the other hand have a hard time in today\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty market First it is a \xe2\x80\x8bhighly fragmented market with a large number of loyalty programs available making it more difficult for customers to pick the most suitable program Customers face a personal barrier to sign up and actually use the programs qiibee White Paper | Page 5 of 43 \x0cSecond current \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty programs lock in their customers by not offering any options for exchange\xe2\x80\x8b In this sense customers also entirely rely on the brands on how much and what exactly they can receive for their collected points Third the \xe2\x80\x8bpoints do not have a real value outside of the brand context\xe2\x80\x8b meaning that generally speaking customers cannot cash out their received loyalty points qiibee White Paper | Page 6 of 43 \x0c3 Where are we already qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s standardized plug & play solution enables brands to easily issue their own tokens with the LoyaltyToken Protocol while still having full freedom to specify their loyalty tokens Although there is a pipeline with various brands waiting to be integrated qiibee has decided to limit the rollout to thoroughly test and optimize based on product feedback from brands and customers 3 1 Example Bank issues credit card with token rewards qiibee White Paper | Page 7 of 43 \x0cWhile the campaign of this company is still to be announced the use case demonstrates the flexibility of qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s LoyaltyToken Protocol Through the connection to qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s LoyaltyToken Protocol the traditional FIAT bank is able to issue its own crypto loyalty credit card whereby customers will be rewarded with loyalty tokens for every purchase they make 3 2 Live use case 1 Sausalitos issued tokens & DAPP on qiibee We have teamed up with Sausalitos Germany\xe2\x80\x99s leading cocktail bar and restaurant chain (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //www sausalitos de\xe2\x80\x8b) The company has more than 40 locations across Germany and on average services over 4 million customers each year With their contribution in our Token Sale they are able to use their QBX to create their own token \xe2\x80\x9cCryptolitos\xe2\x80\x9d and use the qiibee LoyaltyToken Protocol In this rollout Sausalitos will be reselling their tokens to suppliers in order to push their products and deals Customers on the other hand will be rewarded for their consumption and are also able to switch their legacy points into the loyalty token \xe2\x80\x9cCryptolitos\xe2\x80\x9d For the test phase a total of 333 333 QBX are distributed qiibee White Paper | Page 8 of 43 \x0c3 3 Live use case 2 Lattesso issued 20m coins on qiibee Lattesso one of the biggest coffee producers in Switzerland is the first company to run their loyalty program on our LoyaltyToken Protocol Currently Lattesso operates in seven different countries across Europe and Asia (DE CH AT BE NLD LUX RU) and sells approximately 14 mio cups of coffees in 2018 For the rollout a total of 2 million coffee cups have been distributed each one with a code under the Lattesso Cookie which could be redeemed for a Lattessocoin (LTS) on www lattessocoin com\xe2\x80\x8b New users were asked to open a Lattesso account through which a user specific qiibee wallet was created where all of LTS and later tokens from other brand rollouts are stored Customers were able to collect their Lattesso tokens and save these in their wallets see their accounts\xe2\x80\x99 value development and make a backup to restore the wallet in case their phone is lost Check out the Lattesso rollout document (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //static qiibee com/qiibee Lattesso Roll Out pdf\xe2\x80\x8b) for further details As of now we are preparing the engagement options for Lattesso like the redemption strategy for collected tokens The rollout was initiated at the Blockchain Summit in Zug in April 2018 and the coffee cups have been available in stores since the 5th of May 2018 Tokenize Reward Engage qiibee White Paper | Page 9 of 43 \x0cLattesso created Lattessocoin \xe2\x80\x8bwith the LoyaltyToken Protocol 2m customers in 7 countries \xe2\x80\x8bare rewarded with coins Customers o \xe2\x80\x8b pen a wallet and activate their Lattessocoins Coffee cups w \xe2\x80\x8b ere redesigned and carry a code Time to market was 4 weeks\xe2\x80\x8b from token issuance to reward Lattesso has rich opportunities to \xe2\x80\x8bengage loyal customers 3 4 Live use case 3 Built loyalty token exchange on qiibee The qiibee app (explained in section \xe2\x80\x9cDecentralized Loyalty Apps\xe2\x80\x9d) enables users to store and exchange loyalty tokens for one another giving them the ultimate freedom of choice on where they want to redeem their tokens Users are therefore not limited to one single loyalty program but can benefit from every brand inside the qiibee protocol On the other hand brands will be able to approach all the users of the qiibee protocol via different tools such as airdrops and campaign promotions inside the qiibee app 3 5 Further sales pipeline qiibee has received a large amount of attention from brands in Europe and in Asia who are interested in running their existing or new loyalty programs on the blockchain For most brands loyalty programs are an integral part of their marketing and customer relationship strategy which is crucial for effective customer retention The rich pipeline qiibee White Paper | Page 10 of 43 \x0cacross products and industries is also highly valuable in terms of the varied product feedback we can expect At qiibee we are extremely motivated by the heavy adoption of the LoyaltyToken Protocol and DAPPs and committed to continuously expanding our product offering while scaling the number of brands in our ecosystem 4 What are the benefits We have seen several issues brands and customers alike face when engaging with loyalty programs For brands high customer acquisition costs low engagement and redemption high outstanding liabilities and operational risks and inefficiencies impede successful customer engagement For customers the fragmentation of the loyalty market the lock in effect and low usability of points the lack of a real value of collected points as well as the absence of ownership of personal data make it less desirable to be active on loyalty programs We believe that qiibee offers the solution to these issues 4 1 Brand perspective qiibee White Paper | Page 11 of 43 \x0cPlug & Play Connect to the LoyaltyToken Protocol and launch your token Engaged customers Higher engagement and customer lifetime value Remove liability Real value tokens free up your balance sheet Remove cost and risk Blockchain technology is very efficient and secure There are four key benefits when considering the LoyaltyToken Protocol from a brand perspective 1) Brands can \xe2\x80\x9cPlug & Play\xe2\x80\x9d with their loyalty program \xe2\x80\x8bHow does it work In a first step the brand\xe2\x80\x99s marketing department sets the budget for the loyalty program which needs to be converted into brand loyalty tokens The qiibee protocol then creates the brand tokens and sends them to the brand It is important to highlight that the brand still has full control of the interaction with the customer for instance over its individual app\xe2\x80\x99s interface In addition the brand can also determine exactly how it wants to reward its loyal customers and how it wants to configure the redemption process 2) Increased level of engagement a brand can achieve It has full flexibility in the construction of its reward and redemption structure The fluctuation of the brand\xe2\x80\x99s token value in terms of FIAT also positively affects customer engagement since customers are seemingly interested in the value of the tokens and are thereby incentivized to hold them for a longer period On top of that a brand can tap into a large loyalty community of existing customers on the qiibee ecosystem which makes it easier to boost new loyalty programs and attain a wide customer reach 3) Elimination of liabilities on the company\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet\xe2\x80\x8b Since the tokens that it will give out are tradeable and have a \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d value rather than constituting qiibee White Paper | Page 12 of 43 \x0ca promise from the company to be delivered in the future the tokens will not be accounted for as deferred revenue 4) Reduced costs and risk \xe2\x80\x8bGiven that a brand\xe2\x80\x99s program is built on the qiibee protocol the set up costs for a new program are very low Customers are also responsible for their own wallets so the risk of a massive data breach is mitigated 4 2 Customer perspective qiibee White Paper | Page 13 of 43 \x0cAccess them all Store all your loyalty tokens in one place Trade them all Exchange loyalty tokens against one another Earn real value Sell your loyalty tokens for other cryptocurrencies or FIAT Enjoy security Blockchain technology protects your data When looking at the customer perspective there are again four key advantages of using qiibee for the collection of loyalty tokens 1) Overview of all their loyalty tokens \xe2\x80\x8bcollected from different brands in the qiibee ecosystem Customers can still use their favorite brands\xe2\x80\x99 loyalty programs and interfaces and later import the collected tokens into one common place 2) Transactions with their loyalty tokens They can trade them with other customers in the ecosystem send or receive tokens from others and participate in the different brands\xe2\x80\x99 redemption offers 3) All brand tokens are cryptocurrencies tied to the qiibee token (QBX) which will be publicly traded\xe2\x80\x8b This way the brand tokens have a real value outside of the brand context 4) Cash out The qiibee ecosystem offers the customer the ability to sell loyalty tokens for FIAT or other cryptocurrencies via third party integrations 5 How does it work qiibee White Paper | Page 14 of 43 \x0cGeneral overview of the current ecosystem The image above represents our current general overview of qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s product offering Our loyal customers w \xe2\x80\x8b ho benefit from having real value usability and freedom Decentralized loyalty apps \xe2\x80\x8bThe qiibee wallet is one of the means by which loyal customers can interact with the LoyaltyToken Protocol The qiibee wallet directly communicates with our API which talks to the protocol Our SDK streamlines the loyalty token creation process for brands As part of the SDK the API is the main component and it acts as a bridge between a decentralized app and our protocol\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bIt is also how brands can join the ecosystem and build and configure their own loyalty tokens The LoyaltyToken Protocol \xe2\x80\x8benables the communication between the public Ethereum chain and the different \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty blockchains to make it possible for brands to set up and run their loyalty programs Blockchain infrastructure\xe2\x80\x8b Our protocol is capable of communicating with both the public Ethereum chain and the \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty blockchains \xe2\x80\x8bTogether these blockchains make up the blockchain infrastructure Brands and customers will not only be able to make the most of the blockchain and crypto technology but also benefit from an easy and user friendly experience qiibee White Paper | Page 15 of 43 \x0cCustomers have full freedom of choice and backed up value in form of QBX Brands have full control over their total brand loyalty token supply and can thereby easily increase or decrease the loyalty token supply Consequently the QBX price increases with each new brand that enters the ecosystem Why do we need blockchain technology Blockchain provides an ideal framework for tackling the weaknesses of today\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty market points without a real value trusted programs (weak data privacy) and highly centralized loyalty programs 5 1 Decentralized Loyalty Apps (DAPPs) Brands can build their own decentralized loyalty apps so customers can track their loyalty tokens on it as well as send tokens to and receive tokens from other customers Developers can connect to our API to easily create these apps qiibee app The qiibee app is one way that our loyal customers can interact with our protocol The qiibee app directly communicates with our API which uses the protocol to communicate with the blockchain and represents the most convenient way for customers to track all their loyalty tokens from different brands They can send and receive tokens check their current balances and receive the latest updates and news from the brands they like The qiibee app is the \xe2\x80\x9cgateway\xe2\x80\x9d for customers to experience the entire qiibee ecosystem qiibee White Paper | Page 16 of 43 \x0cOne wallet for all programs Customers only need to create a wallet once which can be used for all loyalty programs Overview of loyalty tokens \xe2\x80\x8bAll collected loyalty tokens will be displayed in the overview section Ecosystem information \xe2\x80\x8bThe user will get additional information on new and ongoing loyalty programs inside the qiibee ecosystem This provides full transparency and the chance to compare different programs Value development of token portfolio The user can see the value development of the token portfolio in qiibee tokens (QBX) FIAT (USD EUR CHF etc ) and other cryptocurrencies (e g BTC ETH) As it is intended that the QBX will be freely tradeable on various exchanges the total FIAT value of the token portfolio will always be changing and thereby also incentivizes users to log in and check their balance Through third party integration users also have the opportunity to sell their qiibee tokens if they wish to do so Exchange & trade loyalty tokens with other qiibee users \xe2\x80\x8bThe user will be able to exchange and send/receive loyalty tokens from other users in the qiibee ecosystem This gives customers even more freedom and control over their loyalty programs 5 2 Software Development Kit (SDK) The SDK streamlines and facilitates application development running on the LoyaltyToken Protocol which saves the time money and extensive know how required to build it from scratch Loyalty program owners can focus on their businesses and their qiibee White Paper | Page 17 of 43 \x0capplications while we support them with our SDK The bigger the community maintaining and building on the qiibee protocol the stronger qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty ecosystem Additionally we will also develop an interactive dashboard where brands won\xe2\x80\x99t have to rely on developers rather any non technical individual will be able to set up the loyalty programs The SDK is made up of three aspects \xe2\x9d\x96 An \xe2\x80\x8bAPI that brands\xe2\x80\x99 developers can use to easily communicate with the protocol and (1) create loyalty tokens (2) issue more supply (3) see relevant analytics information such as transaction history current supply etc and (4) exit the ecosystem They can also see and modify the token settings name symbol decimals rate to QBX etc \xe2\x9d\x96 The \xe2\x80\x8bdashboard\xe2\x80\x8b which is basically an interactive and user friendly application that wraps up all the functionality available on the API This is targeted to brands that don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rely only on developers \xe2\x9d\x96 Documentation\xe2\x80\x8b tutorials and the support center for developers on how to use the API You can find the code and documentation on h \xe2\x80\x8b ttps //api qiibee com\xe2\x80\x8b 5 3 qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s LoyaltyToken Protocol Our protocol provides a trustless secure and provable manner for issuing loyalty tokens backed by a crypto asset across different blockchains It also guarantees liquidity by allowing easy redemption tradability and exit options qiibee White Paper | Page 18 of 43 \x0cThe LoyaltyToken Protocol is made up of four fundamental components one blockchain containing a crypto asset that backs the loyalty tokens with a real value one or more different blockchains where the loyalty tokens reside a set of loyalty contracts that specify how these loyalty tokens are behave and can be exchanged between them and a cross chain bridge to enable cryptographically secure communication and transfer of value between the different blockchains By staking QBX tokens through the qiibee protocol brands can issue loyalty tokens on different blockchains The QBX token is currently living on the public Ethereum chain and its main utility is to act as the backing asset for each loyalty token One of the main responsibilities of the protocol is to \xe2\x80\x8bestablish communication between the public Ethereum chain and one or more different \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty blockchains (where loyalty tokens reside) which can guarantee cryptographically secure issuance The qiibee protocol is therefore \xe2\x80\x8bblockchain agnostic \xe2\x80\x8bas it does not rely on a particular blockchain For the foundation of its protocol qiibee has chosen to go over Ethereum based blockchains as the \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty blockchains because of its ease of development the size of its community and the demand from existing brands We support the vision that the Ethereum blockchain is currently one of the best solutions for a wide variety of decentralized businesses but nevertheless as stated before the qiibee protocol is blockchain agnostic so we will be working towards providing compatibility with different blockchains It is important to note that we will be considering loyalty blockchains supporting high transaction throughput at low costs as the idea of the qiibee ecosystem is to be mainstreamed to a massive public qiibee White Paper | Page 19 of 43 \x0cqiibee protocol high level overview The image above shows a high level overview of the qiibee protocol flow 1) Brand stakes QBX on the public Ethereum chain in order to issue loyalty tokens 2) The cross chain bridge freezes and locks the QBX tokens in the vault 3) The cross chain bridge through a provably communication between the public Ethereum chain and the \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty blockchain\xe2\x80\x8b issues the loyalty tokens on the loyalty blockchain 4) Loyalty tokens are sent to the brand account 5) Brand can now reward customers 6) Customers can then redeem their loyalty tokens or exchange them for QBX Establishing a cross chain communication Highly popular blockchains (e g Ethereum) are normally chosen to build projects on As a result they are soon susceptible to slow transactions with high fees With cross chain bridges value and data can travel seamlessly between blockchains For example the QBX tokens can remain on the main Ethereum network while the loyalty tokens that will be very frequently traded can be on a network that is more performant In other words cross chain bridges allow us to move computationally intense operations to better performance chains reducing costs significantly The qiibee protocol is responsible for enabling one blockchain to verify the events authenticity on the other one in a provably and secure way Whenever an exchange between the QBX and a \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty token takes place the qiibee protocol must provide a way to atomically perform those actions on both chains This is achieved by the concept of \xe2\x80\x8bbridge\xe2\x80\x8b A bridge allows a value to travel seamlessly between the two chains We will be focusing our attention first on building this bridge between the public Ethereum chain and another Ethereum compatible chain running a PoA consensus algorithm The communication involves smart contracts running on both sides qiibee White Paper | Page 20 of 43 \x0cAs it\xe2\x80\x99s shown in the image above the \xe2\x80\x8bcross chain bridge communicates both with the Ethereum chain and an Ethereum based loyalty chain The bridge listens to events from the \xe2\x80\x8bNativeContract deployed on the public chain On the other side of the bridge transactions signed by the PoA validators are accepted by the \xe2\x80\x8bUtilityContract\xe2\x80\x8bdeployed to the loyalty blockchain | The bridge trust is inherited from validators of the loyalty blockchain The bridge connects two chains the \xe2\x80\x8bpublic Ethereum blockchain (PEB) and a \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty blockchain (LB)\xe2\x80\x8b The qiibee protocol sets one bridge contract on each side (the NativeContract \xe2\x80\x8band the \xe2\x80\x8bUtilityContract\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8brespectively) \xe2\x80\x8band will take care of the inter chain communication When brands stake QBX into the \xe2\x80\x8bNativeContract\xe2\x80\x8b they get the corresponding amount of loyalty tokens according to the brand\xe2\x80\x99s setting for it Brands can use the UtilityContract\xe2\x80\x8bas they would use any ERC20 token Note that for this first approach we are considering chains with a proof of authority consensus Relays between the chains happen in a byzantine fault tolerant way using the authorities of the loyalty blockchain Loyalty token issuance Brands need to stake QBX in order to create new loyalty tokens Once they do it the staked QBX are frozen and locked in a vault as long as the loyalty tokens are in circulation Hence the QBX functions as a sort of entrance and exit to the qiibee ecosystem and works as the backing token for the loyalty tokens brand stakes an \xe2\x80\x8bamount of QBX into the \xe2\x80\x8bNativeContract qiibee White Paper | Page 21 of 43 by calling \x0cNativeContract stake(amount tokenAddress) function and passing as argument the amount of QBX to stake and the contract address of the loyalty token Then through a \xe2\x80\x8bcallback function this contract emits an \xe2\x80\x8bIssue(brandAddress amount tokenRate tokenName) event The \xe2\x80\x8btokenRate is the conversion rate between the loyalty token to QBX For each event every validator of the \xe2\x80\x8bloyalty blockchain calls the \xe2\x80\x8bIssue(brandAddress amount txHash)\xe2\x80\x8b function Once the set of validators reach consensus the loyalty tokens are issued to the b \xe2\x80\x8b rand\xe2\x80\x8b Loyalty token exit to QBX Both brands and customers can decide to exchange their loyalty tokens to QBX because they want to have an exit (in case of brands) or because they want to keep their tokens in the form of QBX and potentially get FIAT money by selling their QBX on an exchange brand or \xe2\x80\x8bcustomers execute \xe2\x80\x8bUtilityContract toQBX(address amount) to convert a given \xe2\x80\x8bamount of loyalty tokens into QBX So this function reduces the balance of the brand or c \xe2\x80\x8b ustomer\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x98s account for that loyalty token and then emits an \xe2\x80\x8bExit(address amount)\xe2\x80\x8b event For every \xe2\x80\x8bExit() event validators create a message containing \xe2\x80\x8baddress\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bamount and txHash of the transaction referenced by the event Once the set of validators reach consensus the loyalty tokens are burnt and the QBX are defreezed and transferred to the a \xe2\x80\x8b ddress\xe2\x80\x8b For our current implementation we are running tests based on a modified version of parity bridge [\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //github com/paritytech/parity bridge/\xe2\x80\x8b] which securely relays these conversions qiibee White Paper | Page 22 of 43 \x0cReward and redemption Brand rewards customer with loyalty tokens Customer redeems his loyalty tokens Loyalty tokens exchange Another feature of the qiibee ecosystem is to provide a way to make the loyalty tokens compatible with one another by creating an exchange mechanism For our first implementation these exchanges will happen within the same Ethereum based chain Customer exchanges loyalty token X for loyalty token Y 5 4 Blockchain infrastructure Our first implementation involves an Ethereum based loyalty blockchain The image below shows the qiibee vision in terms of its blockchain infrastructure qiibee White Paper | Page 23 of 43 \x0cThe \xe2\x80\x8bEthereum based loyalty blockchain provides and ensures high speed transactions for low or no fees These characteristics are key for an ecosystem that wants to offer microtransactions and be made mainstream The exact implementation of the public permissioned blockchain is still an open discussion for the team Nevertheless we are mainly focusing our research on Parity and the PoA Network blockchains and we are currently running PoCs and have already gone live with a private blockchain (more details on section 9 5) As part of the consensus algorithm to be adopted we are considering Proof of Authority Proof of Stake and Tendermint Our current infrastructure As part of our first PoC we have already built an Ethereum based private chain that works similarly to the public one with a Proof of Work consensus mechanism Current running nodes of this blockchain are maintained by the qiibee foundation and hosted on different servers across different countries to guarantee more security and avoid a single point of failure As a general overview of the current implementation we can say that the qiibee ecosystem stands on the two mentioned chains which will interoperate qiibee White Paper | Page 24 of 43 \x0cOn the left side of the image we can see the \xe2\x80\x8bpublic Ethereum blockchain while on the other we have the \xe2\x80\x8bprivate Ethereum blockchain\xe2\x80\x8b The mining of blocks happens only when a new transaction is executed Each one of the nodes is in charge of validating and confirming transactions happening as a result of the rewards that brands give to customers This first approach has some important limitations trust relies completely on qiibee and its API Thus having a private chain is not the way to go to build loyalty programs on top of the qiibee protocol qiibee wallet generation Customers joining a brand\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty system will have to generate a qiibee wallet (an Ethereum based wallet) if they don\xe2\x80\x99t have it yet As the majority of the customers might not be aware of what this means and in order to help brands to offer their customers an easy way to create their qiibee wallets we have designed the \xe2\x80\x8bqiibee web wallet (QWW)\xe2\x80\x8b The QWW aims to make it easy for brands to generate Ethereum wallets for their customers while still allowing customers to use one account for all their loyalty programs This wallet works locally on each customer\xe2\x80\x99s computer or device (to ensure greater security) and it grants them access to their wallet information including their recovery mnemonic phrase and private key After a customer opens a loyalty account on the brand\xe2\x80\x99s site (e g \xe2\x80\x8bwww lattessocoin com\xe2\x80\x8b) they will be automatically redirected to the QWW as shown in the image above If they already had a qiibee wallet they won\xe2\x80\x99t have to do anything Otherwise they will be prompted to set a password to secure the newly generated wallet Let\xe2\x80\x99s consider the following scenarios \xe2\x9d\x96 Alice wants to open a loyalty account in Lattesso She\xe2\x80\x99s never had a qiibee wallet before \xe2\x80\x94 so she goes to lattessocoin com and signs up Then Lattesso\xe2\x80\x99s site will detect through the qiibee web wallet that she does not yet own a wallet The QWW will create a wallet and send the address to the Lattesso site qiibee White Paper | Page 25 of 43 \x0cAlice does not have a qiibee wallet \xe2\x9d\x96 Alice wants to open a loyalty account with Lattesso She already has a qiibee wallet She goes to lattessocoin com and signs up Then Lattesso\xe2\x80\x99s site will detect through the qiibee web wallet that she does have a wallet Thus it will just send Alice\xe2\x80\x99s existing wallet address back to Lattesso site Alice already has a qiibee wallet What happens if a customer wants to collect other loyalty tokens Must they generate a new wallet each time \xe2\x9d\x96 No So long as a customer uses the same device our web wallet will detect his/her wallet Whenever a new wallet is generated its information is locally stored on the device\xe2\x80\x99s browser If a customer switches over to different device they can import the existing wallet by copy pasting the mnemonic phrase generated (available at https //wallet qiibee com/mnemonic html\xe2\x80\x8b) The qiibee team is working hard to provide a host of options to make exporting importing as painless as possible Such options include automatic export from your mobile device browser to the qiibee mobile applications QR scanning etc Private key storage At qiibee we don\xe2\x80\x99t store customer\xe2\x80\x99s private keys Whenever a customer creates a wallet this process is performed client side That means that the generation process is executed on their desktop computer or mobile device not on our or other external servers This ensures (1) anonymity as we never ask customers to provide personal data that may be linked to their wallet address and (2) security since we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any way to access customer funds neither will any bad actors However customers should note that if they lose a device they could lose access to their funds as well Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t store any wallet information on the backend we qiibee White Paper | Page 26 of 43 \x0cdon\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to recover it This is why it is so important that users save their private keys or mnemonic phrase [\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //en bitcoin it/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase\xe2\x80\x8b] in one or more safe places 5 5 Revenue model The guiding principle to determine revenue streams for qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s business model is value If qiibee can help brands run their loyalty programs on the blockchain and offer customers more transparency and control over their loyalty tokens it will be successful Despite not being final the most important sources of revenue will most probably be revenue from brands These might include items such as set up fees for the creation of loyalty tokens transaction fees for the maintenance of a loyalty program and the fees for promotions in the qiibee app such as airdrops to targeted customers or highlighted campaigns As of today qiibee is not planning on taking fees from customers using the services As of today qiibee is not planning on taking fees from customers using the services 5 6 Product roadmap The new product has been designed to offer tools for brands to independently set up and control their loyalty programs and simultaneously to offer customers greater transparency into existing loyalty programs on the ecosystem a convenient way to manage all programs in one place and the opportunity to cash out QBX tokens The product is the current distillation of extensive customer interviews from the off chain solution and feedback from the sales partners In the following qiibee\xe2\x80\x99s high level product roadmap for the next months until the end of the year is illustrated qiibee White Paper | Page 27 of 43 \x0c6 QBX Token Economics & Token Sale 6 1 QBX Token Economics We believe it is extremely important to give participants of our Token Sale a deep understanding of the economics of the qiibee token QBX By structuring the use cases and lifecycle of QBX demand from agencies loyalty system providers brands merchants and loyal customers to use loyalty tokens is directly translated into demand for QBX on public exchanges qiibee White Paper | Page 28 of 43 \x0cAnnual budgets from the loyalty industry build a natural and fundamental driver of the QBX business model For example will marketing agencies partnering with qiibee make the loyalty programs part of their own portfolio provide them with their marketing expertise and offer them to their existing brand clients This approach has three main advantages It allows for strong partnerships with interests that are aligned between the parties involved fast scaling of sales pipeline via multiplicators and improving of the product offering based on bundled sales feedback from agencies Our traction shows The loyalty industry is ready to invest and enters loyalty on the blockchain The B2B demand estimation is based on our H1 2018 agency sales figures with \xe2\x97\x8f On average 9 new brands or merchants per year and agency \xe2\x97\x8f 25 new brands launched in 2018 In this demand estimation there is neither B2C demand nor direct adoption from brands independent of agencies considered We are aware that brands will need qiibee White Paper | Page 29 of 43 \x0csupport in buying and selling QBX and work therefore with various brokers to help us handle the demand volume 6 2 QBX Token Sale 6 3 Frequently asked questions How many qiibee tokens (QBX) will be sold in the TGE In

partners for their effort research network trust and exposure What are the soft and hard cap of the qiibee token sale The soft cap of USD 3m has already been reached The hard cap of the Token Sale is USD 11 25m What happens if not all QBX will be sold What is the QBX price in the Token Sale 1 QBX = 0 0001 ETH Fixing price vs ETH is necessary due to our smart contract The exchange rate to ETH will be used to determine the amount of QBX if a contribution is made in another currency Who can participate in the qiibee Token Sale Everyone passing the KYC & AML process is able to participate in the qiibee token sale Citizens and/or residents of restricted countries are not allowed to purchase QBX during the TGE How will qiibee use the KYC & AML data All KYC & AML data will be checked externally by Intrum Justitia This is a trusted third party authority which is compliant with FINMA All data will be deleted What can I do with the qiibee token Brands can use the QBX to create and distribute their own loyalty token Customers can collect exchange and redeem these loyalty tokens inside qiibee White Paper | Page 30 of 43 \x0cThe generated brand traction is overwhelming If not all allocated QBX for the Token Sale can be sold these QBX will be transferred to the Brand Sale pot and used to onboard brands in the near future Which currencies will be accepted BTC ETH BCH LTC XRP DASH ETC USD EUR CHF OMG NPXS BAT GNT BNT STORM WINGS REP BNB ZRX What is the minimum and maximum contribution size in the Token Sale Minimum = 200 USD maximum = 10\xe2\x80\x99000 USD* * If you are interested in bigger contribution send us an email at c\xe2\x80\x8b ontribute@qiibee com What loyalty bonus will participants of the Token Sale receive 5% bonus for contributions in the first week the qiibee ecosystem or convert them to QBX to exchange for crypto and FIAT Is the QBX transferable The QBX will be transferable after the end of the Token Sale QBX will only be locked for the ecosystem (36 months) team (36 m ) advisors (6 m ) Pre Sale (6 m ) When will QBX be listed on exchanges It is our goal that QBX will be listed on several exchanges after the Token Sale Why do I need an ERC20 compatible receiver wallet address QBX is a ERC20 token In order to receive the QBX every contributor needs an ERC20 compatible wallet address This address can not be an exchange wallet Otherwise the QBX will the be lost and not useable by the contributor Mobile we recommend to create a \xe2\x80\x8bqiibee wallet\xe2\x80\x8b Desktop we recommend to create a \xe2\x80\x8bmyetherwallet\xe2\x80\x8b 7
