has created many wonders and wealth Almost all the internet trade need to use the qualified third party credit institutions to handle the payment purpose These systems are still subject to \xe2\x80\x9c Models that are based on credit \xe2\x80\x9d The digital assets derived from the blockchain are subverting the third party credit institutions and facilitating direct payment without the involvement of third parties Blockchain is a distributed ledger it is a technical scheme to maintain a reliable database collectively by using a decentralize and distrust way Blockchain is the result of the integration of a variety of technical other than a single technical These techniques are combined in new structures to form a new way of recording storing and expressing data Anyone can participate in the blockchain network each equipment can be used as a code and each node is allowed to obtain a complete copy of the database The failure or attack of each node does not affect the continuous operation of the entire blockchain environment Many nodes make up an end to end network which does not include centralizing equipment or management mechanism The nodes are verified by digital signatures without mutual trust Then the node will propagate and record the data in the nodes of the entire network the data will never lost and can be traced back and deception cannot exists between nodes All the nodes anonymous for mutual trust is not needed between them and they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to public their identity \x0cThe purpose of the application of block chain is to construct a trusted distributed business ecological environment that can realize both self circulation and expand outwards It can help millions of physical retailers to open online traffic and offline experiences and a innovative blockchain business system that combines new retail new payment new media together The subordinate of Winner Dynasty Group Tiandi Jinghua Chain Store has applied blockchain technology since the initial stage after it was founded Advanced Pos systems have been installed in each physical store and the system of more than 200 physical stores provides the fastest and accurate detailed data recently which enables the managers and operators to speed up the judgment and decision making on the market by the sharing of data Physical stores are like the codes of blockchain that can provide the latest information of various markets at any time and complete the cyclical development of the ecology system of the enterprise of Winner Dynasty Group 2 Development direction of blockchain Seen from the development history of the blockchain The birth of BitCoin makes the technology of blockchain been proved intuitively and truly However BitCoin only solves the problem of electronic cash blockchain can also solve many problems that are closely related to real life expect electronic information problem Some people say that BitCoin has no value but the truth is that BitCoin is like gold at the moment it has a fixed quantity on the earth and its value is based on market demand Everyone know how it works it\ s like a reserve currency or commodity nobody has the authority to issue more BitCoin because the rules of the network are known and cannot be changed In the future institutions will be required to issue these assets in accordance with the contract The flow mode of digital assets is flowing point to point between the two sides of the transaction the transactions are settled quickly and they are signed in encrypted form There is a clear account book to record or control the chain to maintain the transaction transparent As a result the cost and the risk will be reduced and the fraud will be prevented Financial network is a kind of technology platform where people can set up company and operate business While traditional bank and credit networks are closed platform If you want to \x0cset up a e commerce network a payment network like Ailpay or Paypal or other cash transaction services you must persuade the current financial institutions to cooperate with you However it is difficult to obtain such cooperation the financial institutions will design a variety of hegemon clause to constraint your normal business practices which blocks the universal values of fair and free trade And the birth of BitCoin upended this traditional view of finance 3 What is Wincoin Wincoin is a new type of public chain of DAPPS that is improved on the basis of BitCoin It promote the cross industry coordinated operation of distributed account book completes the promotion of offline data and the offline authentication of online data through supporting the trusted authentication gateway of P2P protocol It is committed to creating a new enterprise ecosystem of online and offline connectivity which enables ordinary group to access and use blockchain technology and enjoy the enjoy the convenience of it 4 Technical architecture of Wincoin We think if the application based on blockchain want to become reliable the traditional technology system shall be integrated on the basis of the blockchain system and the blockchain technology shall be properly integrated into the platform The security of block chain technology and the tamper resistant characteristics guarantee the reliability of decentralization and the orderly combination of mature technologies guarantee the stable and smooth of the system \x0cThe electronic transactions in traditional banking systems are usually reversible if someone steals your credit card you can raise doubts about this transaction In most cases the losses are borne by banks or merchants and consumers do not have to born the losses This is very convenient for consumers but financial system is required to be a fairly rigorous integrity network The allowance of the join of a new member means the increasing of other members\xe2\x80\x99 risk Therefore it is understandable that the current financial institutions are reluctant to dock with unknown e commerce sites or e commerce sites without a strong capital The Wincoin is different because the transaction is password certified and not reversible so there is no need to restrict access to the network There is no risk in accepting payments from the people you don\ t know this means that the threshold for a merchant or financial intermediary based on the Wincoin will be lowered which enables honest practitioners to participate in business activities more easily and all kinds behavior that implied fraud motive will not be implemented Accepting Wincoin also allows merchants to avoid a lot of administrative overhead and enables the transactions to gain more guarantee \x0c4 1 Data layer of Wincoin The blockchain data storage system of Wincoin is made up of relationship database and kv database among which relationship database is used to store information of the block header and specific information for each transaction while kv database is mainly used to store the data after the the serialization the block header transaction and the status The main purpose of this process is that you can look for it directly from the relationship database when you simply want to query block header information and specific transactions And when you want to construct the entire block data you need to construct block header information from the relational database and obtain the information of specific transaction and status table from kv database according to the hash of transaction root and hash of status table root in block header Specific steps of the serialization of the block header information Use the hash of block as the Key Use the data generated by the serialized block height hash hash of the previous block hash of the transaction root block and the hash of the status table root as the Value \x0cStore the <key value> in kv database Specific steps of the serialization of the transaction\xef\xbc\x9a Use the hash of the transaction root in block header as the Key Use the data generated by the serialized transaction hash transaction type transaction data and MetaData as the Value Store the <key value> in kv database \x0cThe following tables are the structure of Ledgers and the Transactions table respectively 4 1 1 Characteristics of relationship database (sqlite) \x0cRelationship database was (sqlite) was born in May 2000 As a self contained and file based database SQlite provides excellent tool set that can handle all types of data has fewer constraints and is easier to use than a relational database hosted on a server This is a lightweight embedded database that takes up very low resources in embedded equipment it might only need a few hundred K of memory Its processing speed is faster than the two famous databases Mysql and PostgreSQL Sqlite also has the following characteristics \xe2\x80\xa2Zero configuration it needn\xe2\x80\x99t to be installed and configured The core engine of sqlite does not rely on third party software when you use it you needn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cinstall\xe2\x80\x9d it therefore you can be free from troubles when you deploy \xe2\x80\xa2It is a complete database that store in a single disk file All the information in the database (such as tables views triggers etc) is contained in a single file And this file can also be used when it is copied to other directories or other machines \xe2\x80\xa2Database files can be freely shared between machines in different byte order Sqlite supports a variety of systems it not only supports mainstream operating system but also supports many operating system that are unknown For example it supports many embedded systems (such as Android Windows Mobile Symbin Palm VxWorks etc ) The database files generated by SQLite can be ported in various smart devices which provides the basis for the popularization of Wincoin to other smart devices \xe2\x80\xa2It is small enough the entire source code is about a few hundred KB therefore it is capable of running in portable smart devices \xe2\x80\xa2The operating of data is faster than most databases that are popular at present 4 1 2 Working principle of the sqlite database \x0cQlite is mainly composed of component subsystems (that is module) these modules are split into front end parsing and back end engines Front end The preprocessing of front end shall uses the SQL statement and the SQLite command passed by the application program Analyze and optimize the acquired coding and covert the codes into the SQLite internal byte code that the back end can execute The front end can be divided into three modules \xe2\x80\xa2 Labeling analysis (Tokenzier) divide the input SQL statements into identifiers \xe2\x80\xa2Grammatical analysis (Parser) the parser analyzes the structure of the identity analysis statement generated by the identifier and obtains a grammatical tree The parser also contains a optimizer that can reconstitution the grammatical tree therefore a grammatical tree that produces an efficient byte encoding program can be found \xe2\x80\xa2Code generator the code generator traverses the syntax tree and generates an equivalent byte encoding program and the front code realized the sqlite3_prepare API function Back end \x0cThe back end is the engine that explains the byte encoding program and the engine does the real database processing work The back end is composed of four modules \xe2\x80\xa2Virtual machine (VM) VM module is an interpreter for the internal byte encoding language It realize the work of SQL statement through executing byte encoding statement It is the ultimate operator of data in a database It regards the database as a collection of tables and indexes while tables and indexes are a series of tuples or records \xe2\x80\xa2B/B+ tree B/B+ tree module organizes each tuple into a tree data structure that has been sorted in one time tables and indexes are placed in separate B+ and B trees This module helps the VM to search insert and delete tuples in the tree It also helps the VM to create new tree and delete old tree \xe2\x80\xa2Page scheduler\xef\xbc\x88pager) the page scheduler module implements a page oriented database file abstraction at the top of the original file It manages the in memory cache (database page) used by B/B+ tree in addition it also manage the locking of other files and use logs to implement the ACID properties of things \xe2\x80\xa2Operating system interface (system interface) the operating system interface module provides a uniform interface for different local operating systems The back end realizes the sqlite3_bind_* sqlite3_setp sqlite3_coloumn_* sqlite3_reset and sqlite3_finalize API function The characteristics of the relational database can meet the requirements of the operation of cloud Wincoin in portable smart devices and can be transplanted in the operating system of various technical architectures without big change which guarantees the rapid promotion and popularization of Wincoin in general group 4 2 Encryption algorithm The basic process of data encryption is to process the file or data that is originally proclaimed in writing into a piece of code that is unreadable by using a kind of algorithm Currently the encryption algorithms that are commonly used in blockchain are symmetric encryption asymmetric encryption public private key Hash algorithm and so on Symmetric encryption symmetric encryption is the fastest and simplest type of encryption the same secret key is used for encryption and decryption Symmetric encryption usually uses a relatively small secret key which is usually less than 256bit The seize of the secret key should be both safe and efficient and it is a trade off \x0cAsymmetric encryption asymmetric encryption provides a very secure way for the encrypt ion and decryption of data it uses a pair of secret keys public key and private key The private key can only be safeguarded by one party and cannot be leaked while the public key can be issued to anyone who requests it Asymmetric encryption uses one of the secret keys to encrypt while decryption requires another key Private key non public it is a 256 bit random number that is kept by the user and is not open to the public The private key is usually generated randomly by the system which is the only proof of the right t use users\xe2\x80\x99 account and the ownership of the assets in the account The effective bit of it is so long that it can\ t be breached and there is no safety hazard Public key it can be disclosed every secret key has a public key that matches it The Ecc public key can be generated by the private key through a one way deterministic algorithm the schemes that are commonly used include secp256r1 (international standard) secp256k1 (BitCoin standard) and SM2 (Chinese national standard) Photon chain and initial data chain select secp256r1 as the secret key scheme Hash algorithm usually hash algorithm means SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) this algorithm is designed by the NSA and the series of cryptographic hash functions issued by the NIST include variations of sha 1 sha 224 sha 256 sha 384 and sha 512 At present BitCoin adopts SHA 256 algorithm Hash algorithms in Photon chain all refer to SHA 256 expect PW Wincoin has improved on this basis the homomorphic encryption used in it is a method that execute calculation without decrypting the encrypted data in advance It provides an urgently needed method which use blockchain technology on the original basis The data stored data on the blockchain can achieve a perfect balance by using homologous encryption technology and it will not cause any significant change to the blockchain property In other words the blockchain is still a public blockchain However the data on the blockchain will be encrypted so that the privacy issues of the public blockchain dealt Homomorphic encryption technology enables the private block chain to have the privacy effect of private blockchain 4 2 1 Processing process of homomorphic encryption algorithm \x0cFigure 3 Processing of encrypted information As shown in figure 3 it is mainly to protect the private information Alice has private function fA and private information XA encrypted private information yB with private public key pkB to get E(y) and send it to Alice Alice use its own private function fA to encrypt private information XA and E(yB) Because of the homomorphism the function fA is hidden and Bob gets E(fA (XA yB)) Bob encrypts D(fA (XA yB)) =fA (XA yB) by private key Figure 4 Processing of encrypted function As shown in figure 4 it is mainly to protect the private operation function Alice has a private function fA which is sent to Bob after been encrypted by the private public key pkA and Bob calculates E(fA)(XB) based on private information Because of the homomorphism Bob\ s \x0cinformation XB is hidden and E(fa(XB)) is obtained and sent to Alice Alice decrypts it with private key and get fA(XB) Homomorphic encryption technology not only provides privacy protection but also allows access to encrypted data on the common blockchain for auditing or other purposes In other words use homomorphic method to encrypt the data stored on a common blockchain can provide the best part of the public blockchain and private blockchain If E is a fully homomorphic function for function_a that is There is a constructible function operation function_b which makes it In which the encryption operation is E plaintext is m and e is get after encryption If you can construct the corresponding function_b for E when you operate function_a on any complex plaintext then E is a homomorphic encryption algorithm for function_a The purpose of purpose of all homomorphic encryption is to find an encryption algorithm that can perform any number of addition and multiplication operations on the encrypted data which makes the result obtains after a certain operation on the encrypted data exactly equals to the ciphertext obtained from the encryption after the perform expected operations on on the data that has not been encrypted 4 3 Use Netty to to build high performance and highly available decentralized networks 4 3 1 I/O module of Netty Based on the realization of non blocking I/O the underlying dependencies are the Selector for the JDK NIO framework \x0cSelector provides the ability to select a task that is ready Briefly the Selector will constantly poll the Channel that is registered on it and if a Channel has a new TCP connection to access read and write events the Channel is in a ready state and it will be polled out by Selector Then a set of ready Channels can be obtained through SelectionKey and perform subsequent I/O operations A multiplexer Selector can poll multiple channels simultaneously since the JDK1 5_update10 version (+) is realized by using poll to instead the traditional select it does not have the limit of the maximum connection handle 1024/2048 This means that thousands of clients can be accessed with only one thread to take charge of the poll to Selector which is exactly a huge technological advance After using the non blocking I/O module Netty solves the performance handling capacity and reliability problems brought by the traditional synchronous blocking I/O 4 3 2 Thread scheduling module There are three commonly used Reactor threading models respectively as follows Reactor single threaded model Reactor single threaded model means that all the I/O operations are performed on the same NIO thread For small volume application scenario the single thread model can be used Reactor multithreading model The biggest difference between the Rector multithreading model and the single threaded model is that there is a set of NIO threads that handle I/O operations It is mainly used in high concurrency and big business volume scenarios Principal and subordinate Reactor multithreading model the characteristic of the principal and subordinate Reactor multithreading model is that it is no longer a single NIO thread for receiving client connections in server it is a separate NIO thread pool The principal and subordinate Reactor multithreading model can be used to solve the problem that the listener thread of one server cannot effectively handle the poor performance in all client connections In fact the thread model of Netty is not fixed and the three above mentioned Reactor thread model can be supported through creating different EventLoopGroup living example in the starting of auxiliary class and configuring appropriate parameter \x0cIn most scenarios concurrent multithreading can improve the concurrency performance of the system However if the concurrent access to the shared resources is not handled properly there will be serious lock contention which ultimately leads to performance degradation In order to avoid the performance loss brought by the lock contention serialization design can be adopted (message processing is done within the same thread as much as possible thread switching is not performed during message processing so that the multithreaded competition and synchronized locks can be avoided ) In order to improve the performance as much as possible Netty adopts serial lock free design and perform serial operation within the he I/O thread to avoid performance degradation cause by multithreaded competition Superficially the CPU utilization of serialization design seems to be low and the concurrency is not enough However multiple serialized threads can be started simultaneously and operated concurrently through adjusting the thread parameters of the NIO thread pool The performance of this local lock free serial thread design is better than a queue multiple worker thread models 4 3 3 Serialization formats The key factors that affect the serialization performance are summarized as follows The size of the bite rate after serialization ( occupancy of network bandwidth) serialization & deserialization performance ( occupancy of CPU resources) Performance of concurrent calls stability linear growth and occasional time delay burrs are used to test the performance of Java serialization and binary coding respectively the code is tested 1 million times and the test result shows that the performance of Java serialization is only about 6 17% of binary code Netty provides support for GuGe Protobuf by default users can realize other high performance serialization frameworks (such as compressed binary encoding and decoding framework of Thrift) by extending Netty\ s encoding and decoding interface Different application scenarios have different demands for the serialization framework Netty has provided the Protobuf binary serialization framework of Google to high performance \x0capplication scenarios If users have demands for other binary serialization frameworks it can also be realized on the basis of the extension of the encoding and decoding framework provided by Netty 4 3 4 The reasons for using Netty framework 1)Design Uniform API for different protocols (blocking and non blocking) Driven model based on flexible extensible event Highly customizable thread model Support of reliably connectionless data (UDP) \x0c2) Performance Better handling capacity and low delay Save more resources Minimize unnecessary memory copying as much as possible 3)Security Full SSL/TLS and STARTTLS support can work well with the restriction environment of Applet and Android 4\xef\xbc\x89Robust OutOfMemoryError may not be caused by fast connection low connection or overloading connection The problem that the read frequency and write frequency of NIO is inconsistent will not occur in high speed network environment 5)Easy to use Perfect JavaDoc the user guide and sample are concise and simple Just relies on JDK1 5 The Netty framework can bring better compatibility security stability and maneuverability to the Wincoin\xef\xbc\x8cand provides a basis for the rapid read and write of the versatility application of the Wincoin Big data field PRC framework of the high performance communication and serialization component Avro of classical Hadoop uses Netty to perform cross node communication by default Its Natty Service is realized on the basis of the secondary encapsulation of Netty framework Large data computing usually uses multiple compute nodes and one /N summary nodes to carry out distributed deployment a huge amount of data exchange exists between the nodes For Netty\ s overall performance is the highest among the NIO frameworks that are mature it is usually selected as the communication between the nodes of the big data \x0cEnterprise software the integration of enterprise and IT requires ESB Netty\xe2\x80\x99s support for multiple protocols and the simplicity and high performance of the customizing of proprietary protocols are the preferred communication module for ESB PRC framework In fact bus manufacturers of many enterprise are likely to choose Netty as the basic communication communication module to be used in the IT integration of enterprise Communication industry Netty\ s advantages of asynchronous high performance high reliability and high maturity make it widely used in the communication industry 4 4 Consensus mechanism of Wincoin Wincoin adopts the hybrid consensus mechanism of PoW+PoS which can maximize the audience Users who hold the Wincoin and miners can participate in the voting and participate in major decisions jointly Digital asset holders and miners can influence pre programmed updates this is truly decentration 4 4 1 The process the proof of POW work POW is a widely tested solution that also has anti attacking performance and extensibility We can summarize the steps of work proof as follows Generate Coinbase transaction and make a list of transactions with all other transactions that are ready to be packaged into the block Generate Merkle Root Hash by using Merkle Tree algorithm Assemble the Merkle Root Hash and other related fields into the Block Header and 80 byte data of the Block Header is input as proof of work Constantly change the value of the random number (nonce) in the Block Header perform double SHA256 operation on the Block Header after each change (SHA256(SHA256(Block_Header))) and compare the value with the target value of the current network If the value is less than the target value the problem is solved successful and the work proof is completed \x0c4 4 2 Proof of Stake In the proof of work each node assists in creating and validating new blocks The reward and contribution is proportional to the power resource of the entire network The risk of malicious attacks or malicious deception of other nodes may also occur The system of the proof of stake tries to keep the benefits of the work proof first and eliminates some potential security issues The proof of stake can be used to reinforce the proof of work other than replace it It can simply be an additional step to add and approve new blocks \xe2\x80\xa2The rational logic behind PoS (1\xef\xbc\x89Enables the owner of the stake to vote to determine the bookkeeper (2\xef\xbc\x89Maximize the dividends of the owner of the stake (3\xef\xbc\x89Minimize the consumption on the guarantee of network security (4\xef\xbc\x89Maximize the performance of network (5\xef\xbc\x89Minimize the cost of operating the network The benefit of the design of Wincoin is that the owner of the stake has the right of control The fundamental characteristic of PoS is that the owner of the stake retains the right of control thereby decentralizing the system It can improve the security of blockchain digital assets because the the potential risk of a 51% attack may exist in the work proof the people who hold most of the power resources will be able to control the entire network easily \x0cOn technology level Wincoin applies the voting mechanism for blocks (a flexible and practical PoS mechanism) In addition a new hybrid consensus mechanism is obtained by combining the double chain structure and the enhanced PoW mechanism of the pole mining idea and the PoS mechanism In this new hybrid consensus mechanism keyBlock must get enough votes to be considered legitimate so both PoW and PoS can participate in the consensus consensus and play an important role 4 5 Use Wincoin to deal the disadvantage that the network speed of the blockchain is slow How does Wincoin solve the problem that the network speed of the blockchain is slow It is realized through \xe2\x80\x9cRingBuffer\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDisruptor\xe2\x80\x9d The Disruptor is an open source concurrency framework that enables the realization of the concurrency operation of the network\ s Queue without a lock Why is the \xe2\x80\x9cDisruptor\xe2\x80\x9d so fast (1)The disadvantage of the lock The Disruptor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use lock at all Instead we use CAS (Compare And Swap/ Set) operation at the place where we need to make sure that the operation is thread safe ( in particular update the next available serial number in a multi producer environment) CAS operations consume less resources than locks because they do not involve operating systems and can be operated directly on the CPU All visitors record the realization way of serial number multiple producers are allowed to share the same data structure with multiple consumers The serial number can be traced in each object (ring buffer claim Strategy producer and consumer) adding the magic cache line padding means there is no false sharing and unanticipated competition (2) Filling of cache line All operations and procedures are performed by CPU RAM is the place where your data (including code line) stores The goal of Disruptor is to be operated in memory as much as possible If you access a long array when one of the values in the array is loaded into the cache several other values will be loaded additionally Therefore can transverse this array very quickly In fact you can transverse arbitrary data structures that are allocated in contiguous memory blocks (3) False sharing (4) Demystify the memory barrier \x0cAs another CPU level instruction memory barrier does not cost as much as a lock The kernel does not intervene and dispatch between multiple threads But everything comes after costing a lot Memory barriers do have expenditure\xe2\x80\x94the compiler/CPU cannot reorder the instructions as a result the CPU can not be used as efficiently as possible Meanwhile the refreshing of cache also has expenditure The realization of the Disruptor minimizes the read and write frequency of the serial number Each read or write of a volatile field is a relatively high cost operation We should also realize that Disruptor would perform well when it is in batch We use the data structure of Disruptor and Ring Buffer because they provide us with reliable messaging features This ground is good enough but it has some other advantages Firstly Ring Buffer is faster than chain table because it is an array and has a predictable access pattern This is great for CPU cache friendly data can be preloaded at the hardware level to the cache therefore CPU does not need to return to RAM frequently to find the next data of Ring Buffer Secondly Ring Buffer is an array where you can pre allocate memory and keep the array element valid forever Which means that the memory garbage collection (GC) does not need to do anything in this situation In addition it is not a like a chain table that when a data is added the object need to be created and when these data is deleted from the chain table these objects needed to be cleared off 5 Application of Wincoin 5 1 Ecology of the enterprise of Winner Dynasty Group

Wincoin 5 1 Issuance of the digital assets As a blockchain platform Wincoin runs a system digital assets in the system to maintains the the normal operation of the whole system economic system Wincoin whose English abbreviation is WC is the symbol of the value system of Winner Dynasty Alliance It is created for the general public and fully and effectively uses the block chain technology to ensure its security Recognized by several countries makes it easy to convert into local currency and it is accepted by many alliance merchants Wincoin is expected to add more new features which make it more dynamic and attract a larger user group and e commerce will be used as its main driver 5 2 Allocation of digital assets \x0c6 3 Interest incentive mechanism of Wincoin Wincoin adopts the hybrid consensus mechanism of POW+POS which is verified by double algorithm The amount o issuance is 0 5 billion dig 0 45 billion in advance the other 50 million is the interest bonus to the holders of Wincoin the interest payment period is three years and the annual interest rate is 3 5% The holders will obtain more interest bonus if they store more Wincoins Concrete implementation method \xe2\x91\xa0POW the full m=name is Proof of Work POS the full name is Proof of Stake The ratio of POW block and POS block is 1 12 that is after each POW block there can be 12 POS blocks consecutively at most Wincoin introduces POS but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop POW the POW is now the cornerstone and the POS is the main body The calculation of the difficulty coefficient of Wincoin is completely based on POW block POS block doesn\xe2\x80\x99t participate in the calculation of difficulty coefficient POS block also has difficulty requirement the difficulty is POW standard difficulty / coinage (coinage is the savings days of the amount of currency X) \xe2\x91\xa1 The relationship of the calculating of coinage and the interest there is no new mine in the POS block it just interest Establish a system of interest payments based on the amount and time of the currency held Under POS mode there is a term called coinage and each coin produces one coinage per day Fr example if you hold 10 000 coins for a total of 10 days your coinage will be 100 000 If you find a POS block at this time your coinage will be cleared to zero If each of your coin has been cleared of 365 coinage you will obtain the interest of 0 035 coins from the block ( it \x0ccan be understood as an annual interest rate of 3 5%) the daily interest of 10 000 coins =10 000 * 3 5% / 365 = 0 9589 coin payment time of POS interest coin is irregular and it is not distributed at a specific time every day but the the overall number matches \xe2\x91\xa2 The advantage of the design of Wincoin the equity holders have the right of control The purpose of the upper and lower limit design of interest bearing time limit is to urge the users\xe2\x80\x99 enthusiasm on receiving interest and to prevent the user from trying to send the POS block to apply for interest all the time In terms of security since PoW only takes effect after been validated by PoS PoW miners cannot decide and change the rules of the network themselves which effectively withstood 51% attack 7 Technology (core) team (1) Jo Win (chief technical officer) Jo Win is the GBBC consultant and has more than six years of experience in the
