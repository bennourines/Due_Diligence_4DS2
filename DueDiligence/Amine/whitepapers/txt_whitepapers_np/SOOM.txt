of Blockchain 2 2 SOOM TECH & 4th Blockchain 05 02 \x0c02 Introduction 2 1 Brief history of Blockchain Blockchain 1 0 Bitcoin The original blockchain is the decentralized ledger behind the digital currency Bitcoin Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s whitepaper published in 2008 outlines the details required for a protocol that establishes a decentralized currency and securely operates it on a trustless network The bitcoin software was released to the public in January 2009 It was and still is an open source software meaning anyone can examine the code and reuse it In the following years many bitcoins clones appeared with minor code changes aiming at improving transactions\xe2\x80\x99 features such as speed privacy ownership etc (Litecoin Zcash Monero ) However problems in the Bitcoin implementation like wasteful mining hardware centralized mining community and lack of network scalability emerged as the network grew larger which triggered a new wave of technical innovation Blockchain 2 0 Ethereum In 2013 a start up called Ethereum proposed to extend the concept of Bitcoin beyond just currency Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s founder proposed a platform where developers and entrepreneurs can build distributed applications for the Blockchain network without having to start from scratch or relying on the Bitcoin software Ethereum made possible easy tokenization of assets and succeeded in gathering a strong developer community enterprise support and establishing a true ecosystem in an extremely short time However along with booming popularity scalability issues remain Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain and similar technologies face extremely low energy efficiency medium to low block validation and high network fee preventing worldwide mass adoption Blockchain 3 0 The contenders The 3rd generation of Blockchain can refer to newer industry players trying to solve all the problems seen in first and second generation while adding new concept to the existing cryptospace Solving scalability speed and energy consumption issues are the main goals of companies like EOS IOTA Qtum or Cardano each of them introducing new approaches technical structures consensus algorithm etc As several technologies yet immature seem promising only a few are being developed to be specifically incorporated to the real world Over the thousands of Blockchain projects launched during the past two years practical applications for daily life improvement remain very scarce Most of current technologies lack interactions with real world data which limits practical implementation into most of industries and keeps outcomes beneficial to a limited number of people 02 Introduction \xe2\x94\x83 2 1 Brief history of Blockchain 06 \x0c2 2 SOOM TECH & 4th Blockchain SOOM TECH 4th Blockchain SOOM TECH has committed to making block 4th Blockchain is a blockchain as a Service chain ecosystem accessible to the greatest platform designed to meet the needs of organ number of individuals SME\xe2\x80\x99s as well as larger izations willing to fully take advantages of corporations and institutions from any indus Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous potential without the tries by leveraging the ubiquity of the smart cost and burden of developing maintaining phone network and placing flexibility richness and updating the backend of a complex and efficiency at the heart of its technology network of nodes 4th Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s innovative features such as Grouping algorithm Proof of Transaction and mobile wallet mining allow the platform to support a tremendous variety of conventional and smart phone based projects from a wide range of industries such as payment systems customer services real estates banking services or telecommunication 02 Introduction

and creation process 08 \x0c03 Technology Introduction 3 1 4th Blockchain characteristics 3 1 1 Background Blockchain network is generally composed of thousands of computers using same protocol Hence selecting proven technology with stability and security is more effective than building from scratch Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are well known for sound and secure cryptocurrency network but there are still compatibility and blending concerns with today\xe2\x80\x99s companies Reasons The slow confirmation process where Bitcoin and Ethereum needs about 10 and 2 minutes respectively This could also be delayed further due to DDOS cyber attack and hackings Hardfork is the only solution to such problems but its development speed is very slow and its specialized technology is not yet proven in the market In addition companies are not given the authority to control transaction speed transaction size and other network configuration This is a very concerning issue for enterprises in adapting the current Blockchain technology because they are unable to prepare risk management plan on uncertainty of system failure and errors However 4th Blockchain technology offers customized business network environment able to meet each enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s unique needs while enhancing security and reliability 3 1 2 General information Today\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain technology faces challenges in offering quality services to general consumers due to limited settings and potential regulation constraints Designed to offer reliable services to general consumers 4th Blockchain offers various solutions to tackle these issues 4th Blockchain technology has been designed to be applied far beyond crypto asset trading and fulfill a large variety of industrial needs 1 Mobile phone mining 2 On 4th Blockchain network one peer to peer transaction requires 512 nodes to form a cell These 512 nodes are selected based on time and location In other words 4th Blockchain adds space time concept to existing blockchain technology to increase security quality with segmented code according to transaction content 4th Blockchain ecosystem has following advantages comparing to current High speed and minimum fee transaction 3 Smart data collection 03 Technology Introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 1 4th Blockchain characteristics \xe2\x94\x83 3 1 1 Background 09 \x0c3 1 3 Technology characteristics By combining blockchain and time/space concept 4th Blockchain benefits from increased processing speed and foolproof security Existing blockchains utilize data + time concept 4th Blockchain utilizes data + time + space Space concept of nodes can be now used in 4th Blockchain Furthermore SOOM TECH would like to introduce Group concept in Blockchain Each node becomes a member of a Group and each full node that manages a Group becomes a Gateway Detail explanation of Group 4 Blockchain th ing concept is given in the consensus algorithm section The time and space algorithms use values of time and space for time stamp and live positioning Time space values are set by algorithms for random one node location values from N names to 512 and location values between locations Nodes pass their space values to the server responsible for it and the Grouping algorithm determines which groups the nodes will belong to The nodes are continuously being managed and Space time Algorithm maintained by the Grouping algorithm Securing time is a common feature for storing data in a blockchain It can be essential for certain contracts that require processing at the time of creation However freeing up time can cause delays in processing speed as more users join the network which is one of the main issues in traditional blockchain Ensuring that nodes in distributed systems have a uniform accurate time between nodes is difficult to ensure in traditional blockchains By selecting a new set of 512 nodes to verify each transaction 4th Blockchain aims at reaching maximum transaction efficiency without altering security 4th Blockchain network allows new Block crea 512 Node maintenance tion every eight seconds 03 Technology Introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 1 4th Blockchain characteristics \xe2\x94\x83 3 1 3 Technology characteristics 10 \x0c3 2 Consensus algorithm introduction With purpose to make mobile mining possible SOOM TECH designed two innovative consensus algorithm named Proof of Group Stake(POGS) and Proof of Transaction (POT) consensus algorithms Based on these algorithms 4th Blockchain core will be operating on P2P basis with widely increased speed In addition these consensus algorithms also speed up transaction Light Node (LN) Full Node Gateway (GW) Wallet that does not maintain Wallet that maintains Block Only Full Node can become a Block Sync Applies to Mobile Sync GW grouping management Wallet Wallet or Linux Wallet Applies to Window generation of POGS/POT Block 3 2 1 POGS (Proof of Group Stake) POGS consensus algorithm is developed by SOOM TECH it uses Grouping technology where each node is part a Group Grouping is done randomly up to 512 members from N people group is decided from group members through a server called Location Daemon Gateway that manages each group can be only a Full Node In order not to breach the ecosystem environment full nodes have to deposit certain amount of SOOM Coin in order to behave as a Gateway This provides an indication of the eligibility of the Gateway and a certain amount of the deposit will be returned to wallet if node is not selected to operate as a Gateway Once grouping is complete Gateway collects Coin Age from each member in its group Each group member (node) delivers its pre calculated Coin Age to the gateway This Coin Age then serves as basis for contribution percentage that each node will receive in return if Gateway gets reward for issuing POGS block The older Coin Age is the more coins each node gets however once Coin Age is reset Coin Age will be recalculated as time goes on POGS Block is created by Gateway managing the Group To avoid POGS Block fork the order in which POGS Block is issued will be determined between gateways in advance Voting algorithm allows the Gateway to issue Blocks only in the particular order that was set This is an important feature to prevent Fork creation POGS Block validation can be done with UTXO(Unspent Transaction Output) each node\xe2\x80\x99s Coin Age will be verified by checking each wallet\xe2\x80\x99s UTXO 03 Technology Introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 2 Consensus algorithm introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 2 1 POGS(Proof of Group Stake) 11 \x0cGrouping Algorithm The Grouping algorithm in POGS works with protocols developed by SOOM TECH Grouping is specified by a server named Location Daemon (LD) Location Daemon communicates grouping information to nodes upon requests Nodes that have received Grouping related information request an Association to the Gateway of the Group where they belong and when the Gateway accepts it the Node becomes a Member of the Group P2P Network Test Daemon Light Node Connection Manager Gateway Test/Log Manager TraceLog LN Daemon Test GW LD Locationd Locationd CLI RPC Command G/W Location Info

create POGS block between Gateways 1 Each gateway calculates the order in which the next blocks will be created based on the synchronized 2 All new gateways wait for the 1 Full Cycle (n Block Equal to number of GW) and then wait for the first 3 Payment time and information on the Gateway are synchronized through the sync process and the GW List information payment top 10 oldest from lastpaid vector are selected Based on payment criteria scores are calculated using the following formula from among the 10 % lastpaid node GetHash (GWCollateralBlock vin prevout + GWCollateralBlockHash +

Consensus algorithm introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 2 1 POGS(Proof of Group Stake) 16 \x0c3 2 2 POT (Proof of Transaction) Proof Of Transaction is a consensus algorithm to Node informs Gateway when its Transaction Point encourage transactions The idea is to provide to becomes Target Level then Gateway verifies transac nodes that performed a lot of transactions within a tion with the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s Wallet Address and checks Target short time the opportunity to create a block Level to issue block When the Gateway issues a POT Unlike POGS which encourages to hold coins POT will Block and receives a Reward it takes off its fee and encourage to perform transaction and spend coins sends the rest to the node The objective is to give every node in the network a The POT Block creation order will be also kept via POGS fair chance to benefit from block mining reward Payment & Vote protocol Validation of the POT Block is The POT Block is issued by the Gateway whose node is done with the transaction address of the correspond a Group Member Again because there must be a full ing wallet The transaction history of the wallet will be node capable of issuing the POT Block the issuing verified to ensure that every past transaction was true Gateway is always a full node that maintains block The coins received via POT Block creation can be seen as sync incentive points concept received when using credit card POT Block Creation The POT Block is issued by the Gateway where the node belongs in a first in first out approach If no POT Block is requested the Gateway next by order of gateways will have the opportunity to create the POT Block Once the Gateway is set to issue the POT Block it checks the transaction score of the node and issues a POT Block including the transaction through its internal process When rewarding coins to the node in compensation for issuing POT Block Gateway takes off its fee and returns the rest of the reward to the corresponding nodes The order of POT Block issuance between gateways is set by the same Voting algorithm as the order in which POGS Block is issued and is also the best way to prevent block fork POT Block is a consensus algorithm introduced to encourage transactions that will function as a virtual currency and serve as a base for improving the transactions quality 03 Technology Introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 2 Consensus

Transaction) 18 \x0c3 3 Dual security Improvement Security is a critical part of blockchain ecosystems Most of the time hash functions prevent hacking on the blocks but there are still many instances where exchange platform had been hacked SOOM TECH designed dual security to prevent hacking specifically during the transaction process In addition to the private key of the wallet used for transaction SOOM TECH developed a new Group Private Key made during grouping The Group Private Key consist of the group members wallet Public Keys and Current Time of Grouping and is updated every 8 seconds Therefore two private keys for the wallet and one private key for the group are used to perform each transaction The security is dual because the transaction is validated by two private keys \xe2\x80\x93 Wallet Private Key and Group Private Key Additionally 2 of 2 Multi signature will be used to validate the transaction OP_0 <Sig Wallet><Sig Group> OP_2 <Public Key Wallet> <Public Key

mobile Block formed by 10 Mobile Block consisting of 8 Table wallet Blocks gathered together Blocks and thus 80 Mobile Blocks 3 4 1 Multi Block Structure With classification structure similar to mobile com and 2 types of reverse channels according to each munication channel architecture our 4 Blockchain function and there is corresponding function for each is able to increase transaction processing speed It channel was designed not only to transfer data but also to between base station and terminal is channel used to detect rapid changes and allows block function to obtain timing information from base station to termi distinguish and expand data nal traffic channel carries actual voice or data traffic In Multiblock is technology developed by ourselves for the same way as each channel is operated according to safe management of cryptocurrency SOOM TECH different function in 4th Blockchain contents are combined mobile communication channel structure grouped and processed by function Mobile blocks are into 4 Blockchain blocks are structured by content gathered into table blocks and are sorted in space to enable faster search and fast transaction blocks by contents 4th Blockchain multiblock structure processing In mobile communication channels are was designed based on structure that processes data divided into 4 types of forward channels by channel classification in mobile communication th th For instance synchronization channel 03 Technology Introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 4 Multi Block \xe2\x94\x83 3 4 1 Multi Block Structure 20 \x0c3 4 2 Multi Block Types and creation process Mobile Block (MBC) Data are collected from real time location and time of particular wallet address on mobile communication environment and then stored in 4th Blockchain Time is saved from 512 node users maintaining nodes for all data MBC is able to classify and divide all transactions in digital wallet by location value and contents category therefore loading and searching necessary information from ledger is a lot faster Mobile Blockchain is created through POGS POT POW algorithms and accessible by anyone Mobile Blocks are g e n e r a t e d through POGS POT and POW in a 3 dimensional way by combining content time and location data An additional security layer is added by introducing a new Group Key for each of the 512 node A new block is created exactly every eight seconds Once 10 Mobile Blocks are mined 1 Table Block is created once 8 Table Blocks are created 1 Space Block will be generated Into each Table Blocks the ten Mobile Blocks are sorted by data content and volume through MerkleRootHash function which allows to increase search speed by bloomfilter Hash of Table Block Header is connected into chain by Prevhash of the next Table Block In current blockchains when searching for a transaction it is necessary to find a block by scanning through appropriate block index until the required transaction in obtained block is found This is very often a time consuming laborious process The logic of Multi Block sketched below is intended to improve search method from 1 dimensional to 2 or 3 dimensional search method During block creation process transactions will be classified by type and location Results of pre search will be kept in block increasing search and load of information 03 Technology Introduction \xe2\x94\x83 3 4 Multi Block
