there have been great developments in financial and payment instruments due to advances in technology Those advances make distances smaller allowing people to interact behave and communicate anywhere in the world Access to information is now in the hands of anyone who wants to have it The way people do business also changes constantly And when it comes to financial markets it\xe2\x80\x99s part of their nature Financial markets are more global than ever with millions of worldwide transactions per minute in real time using digital instruments It was in this technological environment that appeared cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x93 digital encrypted coins that are autonomous and independent from banks or governments Cryptocurrencies have an increasing importance in the financial markets since some had incredible valuation over the last years Trust in these instruments increased which lead to more people using cryptocurrencies due to its low cost fast easy and secure transactions and there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole potential market around it The cryptocurrency market moves fast and will very soon reach the value of $400 Billion from which $250 Billion refers to Bitcoin value at current market price With the growing use of cryptocurrency tokens there will be a bigger demand for services such as cryptocurrency exchange cryptocoin banking system debit/credit cards and other similar banking services We believe that the importance of cryptocurrency exchange platforms will grow dramatically in the years to come We also predict that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an important role in this type of transactions allowing the customer to exchange different cryptocurrencies easily It s in this market that our holding Trade by Trade operates Trade \xc2\xb4 by Trade has a cryptocurrency

whose creation is controlled by cryptography Cryptocurrencies are not issued by central banks and their value does not depend on bank policies Bitcoin created in 2009 was the first cryptocurrency There currently are over 800 alternative cryptocurrencies called Altcoins such as Ethereum Monero and Ripple etc Cryptocurrencies can be considered in a way similar to precious metals in that their creation is controlled and most have a cap on the amount of units just like precious metals which have limited minable amounts https //tradebytrade com/ https //www tcoin eu/ 8 Version 0 2 \x0cTCoin

TCoin Masternode Development Bitcoin brought innovation to the way of doing business but the experimental nature of the initial project did not anticipate the great expansion of its adoption That way there are bottlenecks and issues to be resolved Our platform will be developed in order to implement these improvements and is aligned to meet the technical needs imposed by the increasing demand of the world market These needs range from the ability to handle the large flow of information as well as improve security related aspects TCOIN like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies is based on a decentralized ledger of all transactions known as a blockchain This blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism in the case of both TCOIN and Bitcoin the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW) Miners attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers and when they solve the problem they receive the right to add a new block to the blockchain If all the other people running the software agree that the problem was solved correctly the block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded https //tradebytrade com/ https //www tcoin eu/ 9 Version 0 2 \x0cTCOIN works a little differently from Bitcoin however because it has a two tier network The second tier is powered by masternodes which enable financial privacy instant transactions and the decentralized governance and budget system Because this second tier is so important masternodes are also rewarded when miners discover new blocks The breakdown is as follows 45% of the block reward goes to the miner 45% goes to masternodes and 10% is reserved for the budget system (created by superblocks every month) The masternode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe) since the masternodes provide crucial services to the network In fact the entire network is overseen by the masternodes which have the power to reject improperly formed blocks from miners If a miner tried to take the entire block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the TCOIN software the masternode network would delete that block and it would not be added to the blockchain In short miners power the first tier which is the basic sending and receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending Masternodes power the second tier which provide the added features that make TCOIN different from other cryptocurrencies Masternodes do not mine and mining computers cannot serve as masternodes Additionally each masternode is \xe2\x80\x9csecured\xe2\x80\x9d by 1000 TCOIN Those TCOIN remain under the sole control of their owner at all times and can still be freely spent The funds are not locked in any way However if the funds are moved or spent the associated masternode will go offline and stop receiving rewards Principles and mechanisms of masternodes A masternode is a server connected to the network which guarantees a certain minimum level of performance and functionality to perform certain tasks related to Private Sender and Instant Sender as the anonymity and instant transaction features in TCOIN are called The masternodes are paid for this service using a concept known as Proof of Service This is in addition to the Proof of Work done by miners to secure the blockchain Masternodes are also allowed to vote on governance and funding proposals with each masternode receiving one vote (yes/no/abstain) on each proposal submitted to the system Anyone can run a masternode The objective is to have enough decentralization to ensure that no single person controls a significant fraction of the masternodes However to avoid bloating the network with unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators there is one condition that needs to be fulfilled proof of ownership of 1000 TCOIN The coins don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be in the masternode but they need to be kept in a certain way that is transparent to the entire network If the owner moves or spends those coins the masternode stops working and payment ceases Masternodes are paid by the network for the Private Senders Instant Senders and governance services they provide 45% of the block reward is paid out to the masternodes https //tradebytrade com/ https //www tcoin eu/ 10 Version 0 2 \x0c45% to miners and 10% to the budget In practice half of the reward from a normal block goes to the miner and half to the masternode Then every predetermined number of blocks (approximately X days) a superblock is created that contains the entire 10% payout to the budget proposal winners Masternodes are randomly selected for payment in each block (approximately every X minutes) from a list once they reach the top 10% of the total count of masternodes and moved to the back of the list after payment As more masternodes are created the duration between payments increases Due to the selection algorithm there is always an aspect of randomness to payment selection but in the long term all masternode owners should receive similar payments If the collateral behind a masternode is spent or if a masternode stops providing services to the network for more than one hour it is removed from the list until normal service resumes In this way masternodes are given incentive to provide efficient and reliable services to the network Having so many servers holding a full copy of the blockchain and working for the coin can be extremely useful Thanks to the reward system there is no risk of not having enough masternodes and the developers can rely on them quickly deploying any new decentralized feature they want to implement This is where the true strength of TCOIN lies an incentivized system of thousands of distributed servers working 24x7 means that TCOIN can scale more efficiently and deploy services more quickly than a blockchain run entirely by unpaid volunteers The more masternodes the better and safer the TCOIN network Every masternode appears in the global list Their position in this list is determined by their time since the last payment according to the network not the blockchain New masternodes joining the network and masternodes receiving payment are placed at the end of the list Running active masternodes which are restarted using the rpc commands \xe2\x80\x98masternode start\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98masternode start alias\xe2\x80\x99 are also placed at the end of the list Using the new rpc command \xe2\x80\x98masternode start missing\xe2\x80\x99 avoids this As masternodes are moved to the end of the global list the remaining masternodes slowly migrate towards the top of the list Once a masternode reaches the top 10% of the global list it is eligible for selection from the selection pool The selection pool is the top 10% of the global list Its size is determined by the total masternode count As an example if there are 3700 active masternodes the top 370 masternodes in the global list are eligible for selection Once in the selection pool selection for payment is determined by block hash entropy The block hash 100 blocks ago determines which masternode will be selected for payment A double SHA256 of the funding transaction hash and index for all masternodes in the selection pool is compared with the proof of work hash 100 blocks ago The masternode with the closest numeric hash value to that block hash is selected for payment
