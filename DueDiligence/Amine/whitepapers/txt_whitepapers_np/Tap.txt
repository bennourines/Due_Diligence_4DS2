Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c1 0 5 Who is Tap for With an intuitive user interface and broad access to crypto exchanges the Tap app will make buying and trading cryptocurrencies far more accessible than previously possible In time Tap will become the familiar solution for the entire sector as it will provide unrivalled broad access to tradable cryptocurrencies whilst simultaneously making them spendable through the Tap card Tap\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary middleware does all the hard work for the Tap user Constantly scanning the prices of crypto trading pairs across major exchanges as well as crypto to fiat pairs it will find the best price available with any combination The middleware can do this across major exchanges and supported currencies meaning that as Tap\xe2\x80\x99s user base increases inefficiencies in the market will be eliminated Yet for the Tap user they will just experience being shown the best price for their trade Tap believe in one trusted instinctive and all encompassing portal where anyone can store manage and spend any fiat or crypto asset White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved 1 Transaction limits will be dictated by our card issuer 2 Tap will start with three crypto currencies and three fiat currencies however the aim is to quickly add more and even further down the road be able to support all fiat currencies and all major exchanges Additionally we deliver all this with a Tap Prepaid Mastercard for your convenience allowing users to use any asset to pay for anything be it a coffee or a holiday Tap aims to breakdown financial borders and allow any user to send any fiat or crypto asset to anyone anywhere in the world for free (subject to terms and conditions\xc2\xb9 \xc2\xb2) and to have that asset instantly available to spend We believe our vision is vital to mass adoption of blockchain currencies and is what the crypto sector is crying out for www tap global \x0c1 1 Who is tap for The new investor 6 Anyone who has introduced a friend to crypto knows what an alien process it can be on their first time They go to a site to buy BTC (for a high commission) then if they want to buy any other currency they need to set up an exchange account and become familiar with the process immediately They need to understand wallets how to make a transfer place an order (and ensure the order is fulfilled) Often the new investor also needs a separate wallet as some exchanges do not let you hold funds Each stage of the process attracts fees transaction costs and commissions (including hidden costs such as spreads) Costs compared to Coinbase when instantly buying $1000 of BTC Coinbase 3 99% TAP 1 5% With TAP after a simple registration and KYC process a new investor can fund their account with a bank transfer (as they are provided with a sort code account number IBAN and reference) or debit card payment for free Once funded they can buy any supported cryptocurrency at a spot rate for a maximum fee of 1 5% through the app at a touch of a button and hold crypto in their balance For the new investor there is no process as simple and transparent as Tap White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c1 2 Who is tap for The familiar investor 7 Even investors who are familiar with the buying process still face frustrations when managing their crypto assets They suffer the same problems and costs as the new investor with additional problems when they want to move from an alternative currency (ALT1) to another alternative currency (ALT2) Currently the investor needs to sell ALT1 into BTC (or ETH) before buying ALT2 with the acquired BTC (or ETH) They may also need to move funds from one exchange to another to complete the trade Fees and commissions are charged on each transaction and depending on the selling strategy can take time to fill and require close management With Tap a customer can complete AND fulfil any trade in under three seconds Even when this trade is performed across exchanges Any supported currency (fiat or crypto) can be used to purchase any other supported currency at a spot rate and fulfilment is instant3 The investor can continue his day without closely managing two trades There is currently no exchange that offers instant ALT to ALT fulfilment combined with cross exchange/ currency arbitrage4 to ensure the best possible price 3 Instant fulfilment Tap will hold sufficient liquidity pools in every crypto and fiat currency that supports all the major exchanges This means that if someone wanted to make a trade across exchanges (e g sell ALT1 on Exchange 1 to buy ALT2 on Exchange 2) Tap will use its liquidity pool to complete both sides of the trade on each exchange This will leave the liquidity pool temporarily imbalanced until a backend reconciliation is complete whereby funds are moved out of the user\xe2\x80\x99s cold storage and back to the relevant exchanges The middleware also reads the order books of all exchanges so that when it delivers the price to the customer it is specified that the trade will complete instantly (as those orders are waiting to be filled) 4 The middleware will search every combination to complete a trade Therefore when performing an Alt 1 to Alt 2 trade all possible combinations of fiat and crypto pairings will be calculated essentially searching for inefficiencies in the market that would benefit our users in terms of getting them a better price White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c1 3 Who is tap for The crypto adopter 8 Anyone who has spent a significant amount of time in crypto is likely to have a large proportion of their disposable assets tied up in cryptocurrencies This raises two concerns for the crypto adopter The first is security When much of your wealth is digital you need to know it is secure Tap eliminates security concerns by storing all customer assets in multi signatory cold/offline storage widely considered the highest level of protection (for more on security see section on page XX) The second concern is day to day utility of crypto assets for spending Currently if the adopter wants to free up crypto assets for purchases or bills you need to sell your asset into BTC then sell BTC to fund your bank account Getting the best commission rates requires minimum transaction sizes which may mean selling more of your crypto asset than you wish and missing out on possible gains if your crypto asset value increases Additionally each transaction incurs costs White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved Tap solves this problem in two ways Convert any amount of any supported cryptocurrency into any supported fiat currency and it appears instantly in your TAP account Or just use the Tap card provided to make any payment and your designated crypto asset will instantly be debited at a spot rate for a low fee (with full cross exchange/currency arbitrage) You can even withdraw cash from an ATM using crypto assets Your crypto assets as currency has never been easier or cheaper www tap global \x0c1 4 Who is tap for The international traveller 9 Whether a regular traveler or not we all suffer from punitive exchange rates and/or bank fees Some traveler cards are available but none have the versatility of Tap and offer such favorable terms Tap currently supports three fiat currencies with more to be added shortly Any traveler can now convert fiat or any supported crypto asset into their desired currency at the touch of a button With fiat to fiat conversions any Tap customer can do this for free up to a minimum of \xc2\xa310005 (depending on card level) a month and is only charged 0 5% after that6 Take your Tap card abroad and avoid banking charges and unfavorable commission spreads (Please note Tap card is topped for you by Tap so there is no need to manually top up your card) 5 The allowances are based on which TAP card level There are three possible levels which give allowances of \xc2\xa31000 \xc2\xa33000 or unlimited free currency transfers More information on cards can be found on page xx 6 The Tap card is a Prepaid Mastercard however when keeping assets in your wallet or a fiat balance this is not loaded onto the card Therefore you can take your prepaid card abroad When you use your card Tap has already prepaid it and will only approve transactions after checking your balance when using your TAP card abroad White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c10 2 0 Current limitations White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c2 0 Current limitations of using crypto for payments 11 Very few vendors accept payments using cryptocurrency This is because There is a cost involved with converting cryptocurrency to fiat which they would need to charge unless their suppliers also accepted crypto The vendor would need additional point of sale equipment which is unlikely to justify the cost Perhaps most importantly the time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed on blockchain (around 10 mins for BTC) is highly impractical as it would require both vendor and customer to wait in the shop Cryptocurrency prices are currently very volatile making accepting crypto risky for the vendor In order to use cryptocurrencies for mainstream payments the world needs to instantly convert any cryptocurrency to fiat and transfer that fiat at the point of sale via a Tap card Tap provides this service White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c12 3 0 How tap works White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c3 0 13 How tap works Any seasoned crypto investor is familiar with the laborious KYC processes when setting up multiple exchange accounts Soon that will become a thing of the past as every major crypto exchange can be accessed through a single app Exchange any alternative cryptocurrency without having to move funds from one exchange to another Find the best market price instantly on your phone This brings several advantages to the crypto investor All your crypto assets are kept in one safe place that you can view anytime 3 1 Tap\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary middleware makes this possible Tap will hold accounts with every exchange and scan their order books to find the best price It then delivers the best price through the Tap app With just one click you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to exchange any crypto asset from one exchange to any crypto asset on any other exchange completely eliminating the need to move assets across exchanges Access to the order books of major crypto exchanges ensures customers receive the best possible price Similarly through Tap\xe2\x80\x99s FX provider the same process takes place when using fiat currency As Tap will link all exchanges and have an FX provider the middleware will perform arbitrage across currencies or exchanges on behalf of the customer The user can see the rate charged and if happy can proceed via the app * *Sometimes the same asset can have a different price depending on the exchange This is caused by liquidity issues or general market inefficiencies Exchange/currency arbitrage is when every possible variation of a trade be it through different crypto assets or fiat currencies is calculated to provide the best price for the customer White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c14 3 2 Tap\xe2\x80\x99s hot wallets and liquidity pool TAP holds balances with exchanges and with our electronic money issuer Transact Payments to facilitate instant fulfilment This allows the middleware to execute any trades instantly without having to wait for funds to be moved Now any trade can be completed and fulfilled in less than 3 seconds and card purchases are possible with converted crypto assets 3 3 Tap\xe2\x80\x99s cold storage of customer assets Tap keeps all customer assets in offline/cold storage behind a multisignature wallet with the highest grade security This gives customers peace of mind that their assets are secure Transactions are run through the hot wallets/liquidity pool with funds adjusted in the customer\xe2\x80\x99s cold storage account to return funds to the liquidity pool With our partnership with BitGo we have our cold storage insured for up to $100M White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c15 4 0 Tap user cases White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

the transaction 2 Robert decides to exchange some of his ETH to pay for the jacket 3 The middleware searches all exchanges to find the best GBP/ETH price for the customer 7 4 Robert presents his card at the vendors terminal and the transaction is authorised against the balance in his Card Wallet 5 The ETH/GBP trade exchange rate is presented to Robert and once accepted is executed and the backend reconciliation process will take place GBP will be taken from the exchange to replenish the GBP taken from Tap\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity pool (held with the card provider) ETH is returned to the exchange from Tap\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity pool returning the exchange balance to its original state 6 ETH is taken from the customer\xe2\x80\x99s account in cold storage and returned to the central liquidity pool so that all of Tap\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity pools are returned to their original state leaving only the customer\xe2\x80\x99s cold storage account in debit 7 A notification is sent to Robert as a receipt letting him know the final cost of his jacket in GBP7 White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved 17 As Tap\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity pool holds multiple fiat currencies Robert could have done this same transaction in any fiat currency Meaning that it would have been just as easy to buy the jacket abroad in the skiing resort In time Tap token investors and holders will benefit from additional economies of scale As volumes grow Tap will have the ability to execute both sides of the transaction \xe2\x80\x93 especially in popular pairings This will avoid the need to pay exchange fees thereby increasing margins which can be passed on to the user There will be no visible difference to the Tap user 7 Robert can check the ETH spot price just before he makes the purchase The price quoted to him at that time will be the price that can be executed However this price might not be the exact price that the transaction is settled at due to the market moving up or down between checking the price and presenting the card The customer accepts the changes in price however as the transactions are performed instantly any change in price will be minimal

the FX provider 5 At the same time the transaction is completed and the vendor receives EUR from the card provider liquidity pool 6 By way of backend reconciliation the FX provider receives GBP from the central liquidity pool and in return sends EUR back to the liquidity pool thus returning the balance held with the FX provider back to its original state 7 GBP are taken from Robert\xe2\x80\x99s cold storage account to replenish the central liquidity pool 8 A receipt notification is sent to Robert\xe2\x80\x99s phone telling him how many GBP that round cost him White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9

2) 2 The middleware sees that there is no direct Alt 1/ Alt 2 pairing on any exchange However both Alt 1 and Alt 2 have pairs with BTC and ETH on different exchanges The middleware then calculates the best rate Bob can receive via any combination of possible trades as detailed below A Alt 1 > BTC > Alt 2 B Alt 1 > ETH > Alt 2 C Alt 1 > ETH > BTC > Alt 2 D Alt 1 > BTC > ETH > Alt 2 The middleware undertakes these comparisons in an instant ensuring the user obtains the best price available without having to spend considerable precious time manually checking the options 3 The middleware shows the best price to Robert 4 Robert confirms that he is happy to proceed 5 The Trade is executed and Alt 1 is transferred from the liquidity pool to restock the exchange balances whilst Alt 2 is sent by the exchange to the liquidity pool 6 Alt 1 is debited from the customer\xe2\x80\x99s cold storage account to rebalance the liquidity pool with Alt 2 being credited to the customer\xe2\x80\x99s account from the liquidity pool White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved If Robert wanted to buy BTC with GBP the middleware would also look up BTC prices in other fiat currencies as well as the exchange rate between GBP and these other currencies If for some reason there was low liquidity with GBP and BTC then a more favourable rate could be achieved by changing GBP into another currency (e g EUR) and then into BTC The middleware therefore performs arbitrage on behalf of the customer to deliver the absolute best rate available www tap global \x0c4 4 User case 4

growth will be that fiat banking and card services are free of charge with Tap Tap generates fees when cryptocurrencies are bought or sold including when using a crypto asset to fund a fiat card purchase The fee for any crypto transaction will be between 0 5% and 1 5% depending on the type of transaction the more popular the exchange pairing the lower the transaction fee Users can opt to pay the fee in Tap tokens which as we\xe2\x80\x99ll explain a little later gives the user a 25% discount on the transaction fee A fee of 0 5% is generated when converting fiat to fiat if the customer exceeds normal monthly use (see TAP card section for normal monthly use) This remains significantly below standard banking charges and lower still if this fee is paid with the Tap token (as users gain a 25% discount on fees if they pay with the Tap token) Additionally Tap also earns interchange fee on all card transactions A customer will be charged a fee if they perform any of the following tasks \xe2\x80\xa2 Buy a crypto asset with fiat from their account \xe2\x80\xa2 Buy a crypto asset with another crypto asset \xe2\x80\xa2 Make a purchase on their card where a crypto asset is used to fund the purchase The interchange fee is the fee charged to the vendor and is shared between the vendors bank the card provider and Tap Tap will realistically expect an average of 0 2% of the total transaction amount White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c26 6 0 The tap token White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights

from these 4 features Tap token can be used to pay transaction/exchange fees and receive a 25% discount This will encourage users to hold Tap tokens in their wallet thereby benefiting from the reduced fees When the value of the Tap token increases in line with wider adoption and increased usage the user will see the fiat value of their Tap token holding increase This may encourage them to increase their holding of Tap tokens Customers buying holding and using Tap will bolster the value of the Tap token As the project expands and gains more customers it is expected that Tap holdings will increase Stake Tap tokens for higher card level and better user terms Staking is when you freeze tokens for a set amount of time During this time those tokens can\xe2\x80\x99t be used or withdrawn until the staking period is complete A user can stake certain amounts of Tap tokens to receive a higher card level and enjoy better user terms The amount staked for each card can be seen in the

daily traded volume of $1m+ and the top 14 fiat currencies supported by the card scheme If an external project has a token that they would like Tap to support they can do so by supplying Tap the liquidity to support the currency (an amount in fiat and their own tokens) and commit to sending Tap a number of users As Tap will support the currency before the users are sent a deposit will need to be paid by the external project which will be refunded once the registered user agreement has been reached This will benefit both the external projects (as new buyers can easily buy their tokens) and

cryptocurrency10 all wanting easier exchange processes and simplified access to their crypto assets it is not surprising that competitors to Tap already exist The market has proven that it also recognizes the value of such projects with two competitors reaching peak token market caps of $550m and $250m and one business valuation of $1 4bn We consider these projects to be either incomplete or inferior to Tap After analyzing all competitors in the market (including Monaco Metalpay TenX STK token Revolut Tokencard and WireX) we believe that a genuine competitor to Tap must have the following features to achieve mass market adoption 1 Allow easy onboarding with fiat for the purchase of cryptocurrencies 2 No requirement for merchant opt in (where a merchant needs to change their current method of taking payments to accommodate the project) This leaves just Monaco and Revolut as real competitors to Tap As only one project is functional right now we have gathered information about them through their website and whitepapers (information gathered to the best of our knowledge at the time of going to press their terms may have changed) 9 Source coinmarket com cap on 30th July 2018 10

crypto into and out of the ecosystem Yes No Yes Weak No Token Yes Use of ATM Market Cap Peak Project success link to token value One project worth mentioning here is TenX At their peak their token market cap was $550m We omitted them from the competitive table as there is no easy onboarding with fiat for the purchase of cryptocurrencies However investors can take encouragement from their peak market cap (which has dropped considerably since their Visa cards were revoked) White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c9 1 Analysis of key competitors 37 Revolut is probably the most well known competitor to Tap (certainly in Europe) and has recently seen their value go up five fold in one year to a company valuation of $1 4bn11 Whilst Revolut made its name as a travel app they now offer the option of buying and exchanging crypto assets However there are limitations as Revolut does not support external transfers of crypto This means that you are unable to onboard with crypto or send your crypto outside the Revolut ecosystem This essentially means that if you already have crypto Revolut is not your solution We believe these limitations will lessen Revolut\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the 24 million people who currently use crypto12 TAP\xe2\x80\x99s other main advantage over Revolut is the lack of subscription costs (Revolut charges \xc2\xa36 99 to unlock crypto utility) Tap offers all the services Revolut offers but with higher utility more features and less cost to the end user Monaco provides more features to the crypto user than Revolut and offers many of the same features as Tap However we are yet to see evidence that Monaco will be able to provide instant exchange at point of sale with the card Perhaps the main advantage of Tap against Monaco is the fiat to crypto fee charged At the time of publication Monaco charge 4 5% commission for fiat to crypto exchange which in our opinion would make them uncompetitive when trying to capture the 815 000 new crypto adopters each month13 White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved Investors should seek a strong direct link between the project success and the token value meaning project owners only benefit at the same time as investors and proportionately Investors who stake a minimum amount of Monaco receive additional benefits however we believe that there is a weak correlation between project success and token value There is currently no investment onboarding for Revolut as there is no token attached We believe that much of the increase in market cap of tokens attached to similar projects to Tap has been speculative and exposes investors to greater levels of risk than Tap What makes Tap so exciting to an investor is the stronger direct link between project success and token value (as seen in Tap Token section on page xx) 11 Source https //www recode net/2018/4/11/17219352/ revolut dst global financing

limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c10 1 Competition 39 We have addressed Tap\xe2\x80\x99s current competitors but we acknowledge the potential for future market entrants Tap\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary middleware market leading customer offer and ability to seamlessly move between alternative and fiat currencies provides a service that crypto users and frequent travelers alike are demanding This will drive adoption from both groups and gives Tap a key \xe2\x80\x9cfirstmover\xe2\x80\x9d advantage over future competitors The systems to provide these services are difficult to replicate yet Tap will continue innovating Along with additional features and user benefits as Tap scales the resultant cost efficiencies will be shared with users When you combine this with stringent ongoing quality assurance procedures we believe any serious competitor would find it more favorable to purchase the Tap project rather than to build a competing product 10 2 Project owners rest on their laurels following initial raise There are numerous examples of projects generating significant interest at launch and failing to build on their foundations or certainly at a reasonable rate This raises concerns about the motivation of a project once they have their raised money The Tap project is different The public raise will only happen once we have a minimum viable product ready Therefore the team and owners of Tap can only be compensated for their efforts when the service is ready For more information about the raise please see token generation event on page xx White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c10 3 Payment card services being revoked 40 Followers of projects like TenX and WireX have seen card services revoked even after issue This is because Wavecrest their card issuer issued cards outside of their jurisdiction in the convention of guidelines specified by Visa For WireX who had already performed $1 5bn in transaction volume this proved disastrous for their 1 5 million users (N B WireX was not featured in our competitive analysis as their customers can only hold BTC and would need to convert into fiat manually to make a payment We do however take encouragement from their user numbers and transaction volumes) Visa and Mastercard have subsequently issued strict guidelines for crypto projects to follow whereas previously there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any which led to confusion in the market Better guidelines from Visa & Mastercard and our choice of card issuer Transact Payments (with an excellent record of guideline compliance) mean that we believe we have mitigated this key risk 10 4 Fraud and data theft Any company offering money services and accepting debit card deposits may find itself targeted for fraud or data theft Tap has taken every measure possible to protect against this risk These measures include the highest level KYC registration (provided by industry leader W2 Global Data) the highest level of PCI DSS compliance from all Tap\xe2\x80\x99s partners and making sure no sensitive customer data is stored by Tap On top of this Tap will only accept debit card deposits from 3D secure cards meaning that if the transaction is fraudulent Tap is not responsible for reimbursement White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c41 11 0 State of the crypto market White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www tap global \x0c11 0 42 State of the crypto market The crypto market suffered a large correction in early 2018 which raised questions about the long term health of the market and whether this will affect Tap Our team believes the correction was a necessary (and temporary) response to an over paced expansion in the second half of 2017 It is however important to see how Tap would benefit during any market cycle User trends point to increases in new crypto investors during rising markets Therefore our marketing will focus on new investors and existing investors keen to increase their holdings during bull runs Tap is especially well placed to service these users Tap offers by far the easiest and most transparent onboarding process together with the lowest fiat to crypto transaction fees More experienced investors will look for a place where they can seamlessly navigate between multiple currencies to benefit from more dynamic market conditions Tap\xe2\x80\x99s unique one touch Alt to Alt exchange is the obvious choice for more seasoned and sophisticated crypto investors White paper v2 5 1 | \xc2\xa9 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved During periods of prolonged market stagnation spending of crypto assets has lower opportunity cost which will encourage a rise in crypto to fiat card transactions In falling markets Tap allows customers to move straight from cryptoto fiat at the touch of a button with instant fulfilment and the lowest transaction costs Investors can then choose to invest fiat in other assets or maintain liquidity in anticipation of buying opportunities that present themselves Therefore no matter the market conditions Tap provides the easiest most cost efficient and seamless service to the market Tap generates exchange fees in all market conditions With a dynamic and adaptive marketing strategy for every market condition we can gain market
