surpassing 18 billion USD equivalent and total estimated market cap for blockchain instruments exceeding 325 billion USD equivalent as of April 2018 1 Over 200 crypto focused hedge funds have been formed as of February 2018 while traditional trading houses continue to express interest in increasing their exposure to blockchain assets 2 But crypto investors continue to lack a number of crucial tools that will be necessary for the space to achieve its potential Key among these are professional grade trade execution compliance position and risk management and reporting functionality The large number of digital asset exchanges helps drive the growth of the market while simultaneously exacerbating its challenges Currently crypto investors are forced to choose among many exchanges when executing various trades Often portfolios develop positions on multiple trading platforms with varying user interfaces and functionality Executing orders across these various exchanges is often dif\xef\xac\x81cult Position and risk management are likewise made more challenging by the diversity of platforms that must often be used to trade for a single portfolio Because it is dif\xef\xac\x81cult to harmonize the outputs of different platforms meeting reporting and compliance requirements can present signi\xef\xac\x81cant obstacles for crypto investors as well Caspian is a joint venture between Tora Trading Services Limited (and its af\xef\xac\x81liates \xe2\x80\x9cTora\xe2\x80\x9d) a global leading cloud based front to back technology provider to buy side institutions and Kenetic Trading Systems Limited (together with its af\xef\xac\x81liates \xe2\x80\x9cKenetic\xe2\x80\x9d) a leading blockchain and cryptocurrency investment \xef\xac\x81rm It provides institutional and experienced investors with a full stack crypto trading and risk management platform It equips digital assets investors with a comprehensive Order and Execution Management System (OEMS) Position Management System (PMS) and Risk Management System (RMS) backed by experienced support team The platform which has the potential to drive further participation in crypto trading provides sophisticated connectivity and interoperability across various digital asset exchanges On the back end it offers uni\xef\xac\x81ed compliance and reporting functionality that enables users to analyze all of their trades in one place regardless of which exchange they take place on Contents Legal Disclaimer 1 2 1 (17 April 2018) Coinmarketcap com <https //coinmarketcap com/currencies/volume/24 hour/> Maya Keidan

in 2009 As of April 2018 average daily trading volume across all digital asset exchanges exceeded 18 billion USD equivalent with total estimated market cap for blockchain instruments surpassing 325 billion USD equivalent 3 Market analysts expect that number to grow to 10 trillion USD equivalent by 2033 4 While the size of the crypto space remains small compared to traditional asset classes the growth in this sector is unparalleled More than 200 exchanges are currently active 5 Of these \xef\xac\x81ve exceed 1 billion USD equivalent in daily trading volume and 19 have more than 100 million USD equivalent daily trading volume 6 It would be almost impossible to attempt to list all of the tokens that have been issued to date The top 16 coins alone each have market caps of over 1 billion USD equivalent and among those four coins see a daily volume of more than a billion USD equivalent7 It is therefore reasonable to expect fragmentation of both tokens and exchanges to be a persistent feature of blockchain markets in the near to medium term 3 (17 April 2018) Coinmarketcap com <https //coinmarketcap com/currencies/volume/24 hour /> 4 Evelyn Chang One stock analyst\ s $10 trillion

//coinmarketcap com/currencies/volume/24 hour /> Unreliable Trade Execution Executing trades in the crypto market currently poses a number of challenges of varying complexity to investors At a basic level the current fragmentation of digital asset exchanges coupled with relatively low trading volumes compared to traditional markets often creates problems around liquidity and slippage Even comparatively small order sizes have the potential to consume available liquidity causing signi\xef\xac\x81cant slippage from the current market price This can lead to high trading costs for market participants Because most existing digital asset exchanges began as small ventures and have grown organically as the market has surged they often cannot handle large order volumes As a result exchanges often suffer from high latency In the case of institutional traders in particular this has the potential to undermine investment strategies if it causes delays in executing trades Additionally because of the grassroots origins of most incumbent exchanges outages often occur as a result of the stresses of high trading volumes There have been numerous cases of users being locked out of exchanges in some cases for days due to technical dif\xef\xac\x81culties 8 In many cases exchanges lack adequate customer support which can increase frustration on the part of traders 8 Olga Kharif Biggest Crypto Exchanges Hit by Delays With Demand Surging (30 November 2017) Bloomberg https //www bloomberg com/news/articles/2017 11 29/bi ggest u s crypto exchange hit by delays as demand su rges) 4 \x0cBeyond periodic performance failures trading particularly across both traditional and digital asset venues presents a number of other dif\xef\xac\x81culties Regulated exchanges now list instruments such as crypto futures and we expect this trend to accelerate as publicly traded companies increase their exposure to crypto and additional derivatives arise This requires purchasers to have the ability to access both traditional and digital asset exchanges and to \xef\xac\x82uidly exchange \xef\xac\x81at for digital assets and vice versa Many of these products are also highly regulated and may not be available lawfully The ability to rebalance portfolios presents another challenge for investors trading across disparate exchanges Traditionally rebalancing is a tool used by investors to ensure that trades are made that maintain certain allocation targets across a portfolio that is constantly \xef\xac\x82uctuating In the digital asset space the fragmentation of exchanges makes this dif\xef\xac\x81cult because no platform currently exists that can monitor capital deployments for a single portfolio transacting on multiple exchanges Lack of Security All digital asset traders are aware of the security risks that currently exist in purchasing digital assets Exchanges are vulnerable to hackers a risk that has been born out in a series of thefts resulting in the loss of over 4 billion USD equivalent since 2011 9 Existing exchanges lack many of the customer protections offered by trading 9 Steve Stecklow Chaos and hackers stalk investors on cryptocurrency exchanges (29 September 2017) Reuters (https //www reuters com/investigates/special report/bi tcoin exchanges risks/) platforms in traditional markets These include effective customer support and risk management capabilities Risk management is a crucial element of trading in any asset class and it takes on added dimensions for the digital asset space These include the counterparty risk that is present when transacting on any individual exchange Traders must make contingencies to mitigate the likelihood that an exchange will suddenly fail taking investor funds with it Market participants must also account for liquidity risk The fragmentation of the market leads to situations in which there is insuf\xef\xac\x81cient liquidity on a given exchange to fully exit a position Lack of Reporting Compliance and All fund managers recognize the need for strong compliance procedures Crypto funds are no exception but the fragmentation that exists among the various exchanges can make satisfying these needs dif\xef\xac\x81cult The aggregated information required is simply not available This leaves market participants in dif\xef\xac\x81cult circumstances in which they must contrive individual solutions to this problem In some cases this can mean maintaining a spreadsheet to keep track of a trader\xe2\x80\x99s or fund\xe2\x80\x99s various investments or developing their own reference lists to determine current pricing or other necessary metrics This obviously creates signi\xef\xac\x81cant risk of error Institutional entities are also required to keep extensive audit records for both internal and regulatory purposes The 5 \x0cdetails are often granular to the level of individual traders triggers to pre trade limits and order amendments These outputs are not available on most crypto exchanges and as a result funds must build proprietary systems at signi\xef\xac\x81cant expense in order to monitor and log all activity Institutional investors must also provide regular reports to other investors and stakeholders regarding exposures liquidity risk portfolio returns value at risk summary of performance and future outlook Current exchange fragmentation can make this dif\xef\xac\x81cult In addition to regulatory and reporting requirements investors need to be able to monitor their positions on an up to the minute basis Currently they can only achieve this by watching each platform simultaneously There currently is no consolidated system for monitoring positions across different exchanges As many funds are also sold through regulated entities and/or regulated themselves the quality and security of custody as well as other prudential standards such as \xef\xac\x81nancial crime compliance are particularly important An opportunity clearly exists to provide investors with the tools to address the crypto market\xe2\x80\x99s current shortcomings As the space grows and institutional players increase their exposure to crypto instruments the demand for such tools will grow stronger 6 \x0cSolution An Institutional Grade Crypto Trading Platform Caspian is an ecosystem designed to solve the problems facing crypto investors using a single user friendly interface It achieves this by providing sophisticated connectivity and interoperability across various digital asset exchanges Caspian is expected to drive further growth in digital asset participation on the part of institutional and experienced investors Caspian equips investors with a comprehensive OEMS PMS and RMS backed by comprehensive customer support Its features include professional grade execution position management and reporting capabilities Tora is a leading supplier of asset management technology including an OEMS that averages monthly notional equity volume exceeding US$100 billion and is currently responsible for 17% of Japanese institutional equity trading volume The company with connectivity to over 150 equities and derivatives exchanges as well as clients in North America Asia Europe and Australia is ideally positioned to launch Caspian which will be the \xef\xac\x81rst large scale institutional infrastructure speci\xef\xac\x81cally aimed at traditional asset management \xef\xac\x81rms and market makers Caspian is not designed to disrupt the current digital asset space or to compete with existing exchanges Its purpose is to support purchasing of digital asset instruments in a reliable manner to a large number of entrants helping to bring liquidity volume and dynamism to the sector With over six decades of collective experience building and managing technology and trading systems Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s senior management team is uniquely positioned to build a strong \xef\xac\x82exible secure platform capable of attracting participation on the part of major traders and market makers Caspian currently connects to over 10 major digital asset exchanges The platform plans to add up to forty additional trading venues by Q3 2018 Additional details can be found in the roadmap section of this document Caspian is a joint venture between two \xef\xac\x81rms Tora and Kenetic each of which have successful track records in asset management and cryptocurrency investing 7 \x0cTeam Overview Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s senior management team brings decades of combined experience in \xef\xac\x81nance and technology Members of the

Gerrit van Wingerden CTO & Co founder Managing Director at Tora for the past 12 years Prior to that Gerrit managed the development of high volume trading 8 \x0cBeyond its experienced management team Caspian is supported by the resources of both partners in the joint venture Tora and Kenetic Between Tora\xe2\x80\x99s leading OEMS global trading platform and Kenetic\xe2\x80\x99s industry leading expertise in blockchain the Caspian full stack digital asset management solution is backed by a full team of over 150 people 9 \x0cKey Features and Bene\xef\xac\x81ts This section outlines the Caspian model as currently envisaged and designed but is subject to modi\xef\xac\x81cation Caspian effectively aggregates prices bid/ask information orders positions accounts and executions from multiple crypto exchanges and other sources presenting the information on a single platform It allows users to act on this information by sending orders to exchanges individually or using a Smart Order Router based on existing Tora technology \xe2\x97\x8f The bene\xef\xac\x81ts of the Caspian platform can be organized into three overarching categories corresponding to the current needs of the crypto trading space Execution Position Management and Compliance Further enhancement plans are described in the roadmap section of this document 10 \xe2\x97\x8f Execution \xe2\x97\x8f OEMS Caspian provides a uni\xef\xac\x81ed control center optimized for fast trading which will serve as the main hub for portfolio managers and traders It is based upon technology built by Tora to serve its large client base and has been enhanced to cater to the speci\xef\xac\x81c needs of the crypto space This single interface provides the following \xe2\x97\x8f Access to selected major digital asset exchanges through a single interface \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f 10 Unless speci\xef\xac\x81ed otherwise all features described here are available in the system as it is now e g from day one For each speci\xef\xac\x81c exchange OEMS enables access to all order types asset types and ticket sizes supported by a given exchange APIs allowing traders to stage and send orders and slices obtain order execution and position information and receive pricing information exposure breakdowns and other transaction information In the future the API will be enhanced to allow access to margin information additional Smart Order Router (SOR) control and other metrics Ability to view prices bid/ask and depths for each exchange to the smallest available ticket size Ability to stage send and amend orders in multiple ways including single click orders sent directly from the price depth user de\xef\xac\x81ned order shortcuts and order staging and slicing Choice of whether and how to use Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s SOR Ability to stage order intentions as parent orders slicing them as child orders that can be sent to different exchanges separately or via Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s SOR This can be used to optimize slippage and liquidity consumption at each exchange Messaging functionality for each order related action communicating any potential compliance breach Ability to view and manage margin across multiple exchanges 10 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Ability to view the progress of each order or order slice Users can receive alerts about slippage or time to \xef\xac\x81ll allowing them to take action depending on market conditions \xe2\x97\x8f Position information for each crypto pair or instrument enabling traders to quickly react to market conditions using Caspian liquidation features \xe2\x97\x8f Ability to utilize work\xef\xac\x82ows across multiple distinct users and user roles A single organization can assign different roles to its members e g portfolio managers traders compliance of\xef\xac\x81cers \xe2\x97\x8f Audit report generation for all activity in the OEMS As part of its 12 month roadmap Caspian also plans to add pre trade Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) checks to identify which exchanges will be the most apt to execute orders that need to get \xef\xac\x81lled Smart Order Router (SOR) This module enables users to view all exchanges as a single pool of liquidity The Smart Order Router sends an order with a given objective for example sell ETH and buy BTC within a certain price limit to multiple exchanges at once in order to achieve quick execution even in the case of large orders The SOR algorithm is smart enough to prioritize exchanges based on criteria including price liquidity and commission so that the best outcome can be achieved with as little slippage as possible Algorithms Caspian builds upon Tora\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm framework and Kenetic\xe2\x80\x99s trading expertise to provide institutional grade algorithms from day one Each order can be assigned to a particular algorithm which can then route slices across multiple exchange venues using Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s smart order routing logic Traders can control the behavior of a trading algorithm by applying set parameters and can monitor its performance throughout the lifecycle of the order At the same time more sophisticated traders can also closely monitor all orders that the algorithm engines slice to the market They can manually override order parameters in order to \xef\xac\x81ne tune the behavior of a given algorithm User built strategies In addition to the prede\xef\xac\x81ned complex strategies offered in Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm suites end users will have the ability to de\xef\xac\x81ne their own strategies for managing orders using a simple rule based language For example a user could create an order that executes if the price of an asset increases by 10% or more in an hour Alerts Caspian offers a built in mechanism allowing clients to con\xef\xac\x81gure alerts which can appear as pop ups or be delivered as emails Clients have the freedom to de\xef\xac\x81ne the conditions under which such alerts are triggered combining indicators order parameters position data and market data This logic is built on top of a proprietary coding language similar to Excel functions Position & Risk Management PMS and RMS Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s PMS and RMS together allow users to monitor their positions P&Ls and exposures and to maintain detailed records of each They sit downstream from the OEMS which sends them all execution and order information While the OEMS is designed to be light and nimble for fast trading the PMS and RMS record and track every piece of data in 11 \x0cperpetuity This allows an investor to view all of its positions and historical data at any time Using these features users can maintain a complete book of records for a given trading entity and can view the data in real time or historically In the future existing risk features from the Tora platform will be ported to Caspian including value at risk shift scenarios and stress test scenarios Reconciliations Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s detailed user friendly recordkeeping functions make it easy to perform reconciliations In traditional \xef\xac\x81nance the presence of multiple counterparties including brokers custodians and fund administrators requires reconciliation among all parties to ensure that all transactions have been carried out as agreed This is also true in the digital asset space where the dif\xef\xac\x81culty or impossibility of rolling back transactions means the ability to recognize and correct errors is critical Rebalancing This function currently being ported over to Caspian as part of the company\xe2\x80\x99s short term roadmap applies to multiple scenarios For example when a fund needs to invest or divest funds without altering the relative allocation of each asset within the vehicle a separate order must be created for each instrument Alternatively a fund may employ a strategy dictating a certain ideal level of exposure per currency or per exchange Inevitably funds drift from those targets and rebalancing can help generate orders that continually bring the fund back in line with its objectives Allocation engine The allocation engine allows trading through a single order and a single exchange account even if the result of the trade is intended to be distributed to different funds portfolios strategies or other business units The allocation engine transparently handles all aspects of the distribution of the outcome of a trade into corresponding business units allowing the trader to focus on achieving the best execution for the order The allocation engine covers a wide range of use cases including \xe2\x97\x8f Static order allocation which enables the allocation logic of an order to be de\xef\xac\x81ned on a per share percentage or per NAV basis \xe2\x97\x8f Dynamic position based allocation which allocates trades in line with rules applied to whole portfolios and business units \xe2\x97\x8f Ensuring a fair price distribution across business units Compliance and Reporting Compliance Engine The compliance engine is based on Tora\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary technology which offers extremely low latency and extensive functionality as well as a robust framework that allows Caspian to implement new limits and compliance rules quickly and ef\xef\xac\x81ciently The compliance engine provides multiple levels of functionality to address user de\xef\xac\x81ned limits and rules covering both pre trade and post trade work\xef\xac\x82ows \xe2\x97\x8f Pre trade limits which include simple limits as well as more complex portfolio or trading parameters such as exposure limits These limits can delay order execution until compliance checks are complete They can be triggered at various stages of a trade including staging sending or amending an order There are three 12 \x0clevels to the limits warning limits which can be overridden by the user approval limits which require a supervisor to approve the order before it can be sent to market and absolute limits which cannot be overridden \xe2\x97\x8f Post trade compliance includes alerts monitoring and reporting Alerts and reports can be delivered to users via email or other mechanisms either on a schedule or as they occur Reporting Engine From day one Caspian will feature robust reporting capabilities consisting of simple \xe2\x80\x9c\xef\xac\x82at \xef\xac\x81le\xe2\x80\x9d reports such as trade \xef\xac\x81les snapshot reports position data audit reports and compliance reports These options offer \xef\xac\x82exibility in preparing graphical reports and other external facing materials As part of our roadmap we are also working on a solution that incorporates Tora\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary reporting engine to allow users to design report templates including graphs editable tables and \xef\xac\x81ltering Users can then schedule and receive graphical reports directly in PDF in Excel format or in Powerpoint which users can use as a \xe2\x80\x9cone stop shop \xe2\x80\x9d This includes execution data instrument information and instrument prices (both real time and mark to market) margin and account information and volumes and liquidity information Online Dashboards Once Caspian integrates the Tora Reporting engine it will be able to harness a number of associated dashboarding functionalities In particular it will enable customizable web dashboards enabling users to \xe2\x97\x8f View web based visualizations on an ad hoc basis including exposure breakdown graphs margin reports and order \xef\xac\x81ll status \xe2\x97\x8f Amend visualization in real time by adding formula columns to tables or changing chart types \xe2\x97\x8f Save their amended visualizations as both a new report that can be scheduled and sent as a \xef\xac\x81le and as a new dashboard that can be viewed online Importation of Data Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s various modules import the data provided by each exchange via its protocols and APIs focusing the information into a single portal 13 \x0cTechnical Summary Architecture Caspian is a cloud based platform with distributed services built around a microservice architecture and functionality accessible via thin UIs and APIs This creates signi\xef\xac\x81cant \xef\xac\x82exibility allowing the platform to accommodate solutions ranging from private clouds hosted in a client\xe2\x80\x99s traditional datacenter to environments supporting large numbers of clients hosted on cloud computing platforms provided by established players in the space Each aspect of the system is managed by a distinct service with a dedicated communication channel its own API and a built in protocol for subscribing to its data On the back end the services are either con\xef\xac\x81gured to run in dedicated processes or several (usually related) services can be bound together to run into a single process The services can offer data through both a request/reply and a publish/subscribe mechanism 14 \x0cThe backend services are linked by a high speed certi\xef\xac\x81ed message delivery technology This offers a range of advantages \xe2\x97\x8f Decoupling of services that do not require mutual awareness of the components that act as their clients \xe2\x97\x8f Plug and play architecture enabling the addition of new components to handle new services \xe2\x97\x8f Ability to set different communication priorities for various services \xe2\x97\x8f Scalability the plug and play architecture makes it easy to add new service instances capable of handling greater loads or accommodating more clients \xe2\x97\x8f A built in mechanism that guarantees no data is lost traveling between the various components \xe2\x97\x8f High data throughput Performance The system is designed to handle large volumes of data while ensuring low latency for messages on their way to and from the exchanges While Caspian was not initially designed for high frequency trading the capacity and latency numbers it can achieve nonetheless approximate the performance such a client would need Speci\xef\xac\x81cally Caspian is designed to handle up to 50 000 orders and 400 000 executions per day per user with a throughput of over 2 500 orders per second Scalability Caspian partitions data and communication channels into distinct spaces for each client These silos can be further re\xef\xac\x81ned into narrower categories based on the needs of each client according to relevant criteria (regions types of products traded etc) \xe2\x97\x8f Backend services are con\xef\xac\x81gured to handle one or more such partitions aiming to keep the load of each instance below a set threshold with setup closely monitored If an upper capacity limit is reached re partitioning occurs and new instances are automatically or manually launched (depending on speci\xef\xac\x81c client needs) to cover the new distribution Reliability Reliability is a key strategic priority for the Tora system upon which Caspian was built leading to 99 99% uptime in the past ten years of operation This is achieved via a number of complementary functions \xe2\x97\x8f Fault tolerance and high availability all critical Caspian services have built in redundancy and replication ensuring a resilient architecture with no single point of failure A standby instance is always ready to seamlessly take over avoiding any disruption in the event of a problem \xe2\x97\x8f Load balancing the services are exposed via a load balancer which runs a routing algorithm to redirect any request to the least contended gateway instance which is most capable of handling the request at the time it is made \xe2\x97\x8f Business Continuity Plan/Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR) for the low probability but high severity risk of a major failure that could render the primary site unreachable or unusable 15 \x0cCaspian will offer a backup cloud This disaster recovery environment will constantly be updated to mirror the state of the active cloud and will be ready to take over if activated avoiding any disruption to end users \xe2\x97\x8f Tools and processes no matter how much effort is put into the proper design implementation and quality control we acknowledge that there is no perfect software and there is always a chance something may go wrong To handle such unforeseen issues Caspian has built in \xe2\x80\x9csafety nets\xe2\x80\x9d and control mechanisms Various \xe2\x80\x9chealth check\xe2\x80\x9d jobs and sanity tasks are run automatically on a regular basis Noti\xef\xac\x81cations are then sent to the production support team which will preemptively take the necessary corrective measures Security Security is paramount In order to ensure the privacy and integrity of all data \xef\xac\x82owing through the Caspian ecosystem the following features are in place \xe2\x97\x8f Connectivity between the client application and the cloud is created by a private leased line or by encrypted connections over the internet \xe2\x97\x8f The client app access can be limited to only from a set of concrete whitelisted IPs \xe2\x97\x8f Secure user sign in is enforced through \xe2\x80\x9cstrong\xe2\x80\x9d password complexity requirements and two factor authentication \xe2\x97\x8f Access to the back end is restricted to a limited number of authorized administrative and support users \xe2\x97\x8f Integration with an isolated exchange API \xe2\x80\x9csigning\xe2\x80\x9d service which securely stores the end user\xe2\x80\x99s exchange API keys and handles the message signing without exposing the keys in the vault \xe2\x97\x8f Connections to exchanges or third party systems are always encrypted when supported by the exchange regardless of whether the messaging is handled via FIX REST or any other proprietary protocol Support Any solution is only as strong as the support around it On this front the digital asset space has been historically weak Caspian will leverage the resources of Tora and Kenetic to offer a professional multilingual product support team based on an initial Service Level Agreement All issues are sorted according to their Service Impact Level with anything that affects trading activity assigned the highest urgency Tora has an excellent track record working with demanding clients in the traditional \xef\xac\x81nance world resolving or providing workarounds to critical issues within minutes in most cases Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s support team is skilled and experienced at using enterprise software to provide a level of support unparalleled in the digital asset space Senior developers are rotated among support teams so that both level 1 and level 2 Support issues can be handled intraday with no delays Ongoing development adaptability and An advantage and a challenge to the crypto space is the rapid pace of change Any solution must be able to quickly adapt to new tradable products new exchanges new 16 \x0cdigital assets and new technologies In many cases this requires actual development making a skilled \xef\xac\x82exible and adaptable development team even more critical By leveraging Tora\xe2\x80\x99s development team of over 150 people Caspian offers this \xef\xac\x82exibility The team employs the Agile methodology with short ef\xef\xac\x81cient 2 week development cycles (\xe2\x80\x9csprints\xe2\x80\x9d) allowing Caspian to swiftly and ef\xef\xac\x81ciently adapt to any changes Audit Having systems that are auditable is a must for institutional clients Every action in the Caspian system is timestamped and recorded providing a detailed audit trail where any information like the time the user and the nature of the change can be consulted at a later juncture enabling the clients to track any change back to its origin while providing suf\xef\xac\x81cient information for any regulatory audit Modularity Integration and Third Party While the Caspian solution is designed to be a one stop turn key solution for the digital asset space any of its modules can easily be connected or integrated with other third party systems and solutions including digital asset exchanges risk management systems and proprietary portfolio management systems Caspian plans to offer a variety of such integrations allowing clients to choose the individual components that are appropriate to their current work\xef\xac\x82ow and to have Caspian connect to other systems as necessary 17 \x0cBusiness Plan and Growth Strategy Caspian is currently operational and connected to over ten exchanges We expect to add up to forty exchanges to the ecosystem by the end of Q3 2018 We plan to grow the business and roll out additional features and functionality over the following 12 months as outlined below \xe2\x97\x8f Partnerships with existing exchanges to speed client acquisition and facilitate introduction to high volume traders \xe2\x97\x8f Customer outreach through service providers such as fund administrators Caspian plans to connect with various service providers that work with new and existing asset managers evaluating the crypto space We expect these relationships to be a major source of new clients looking for an institutional grade trading platform \xe2\x97\x8f Build on the existing relationships of both Kenetic and Tora to identify and \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f reach

The Caspian token (CSP) is an ERC 20 compliant token to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain The CSP token model has been designed to serve several principal objectives In the broadest sense the goal is to link Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s best in class functionality with a token that incentivizes platform use and the development of unique third party tools and features Speci\xef\xac\x81cally the token is intended to create a rich participatory ecosystem where platform users also become community members with an active interest in the platform This is accomplished by giving the token user to platform utility (discount and governance) and user to user/developer utility Broadly speaking the token is not required to access the platform but can be used to enhance one\xe2\x80\x99s experience of it through an intentional variety of means and to get a variety of bene\xef\xac\x81ts The hope is that users unfamiliar with token utility will be incentivized to take steps toward using the token in gradually more complex ways User to Platform Utility The Commission Discount Programs (guaranteed and dynamic) and the Discount Payment Function will provide fundamental value to the token by allowing token holders to earn and potentially combine different discounts that can offset platform fees The Governance Node framework will also enable members of the token community to contribute to platform direction User to User Utility The CSP rewards developers who offer their apps for free Caspian will incentivize third party development on the platform though grants bounties and a rewards engine This will allow the (vetted) emergence of new features on the platform complementing the base features with a richer and more attractive functionality Token provides utility but is not necessary The token is designed to enhance the user experience and enrich the Caspian community It is not designed to be necessary to enjoy the base feature set of the platform Even without the token clients can use all core features discussed in the preceding sections That said using the CSP token will open access to unique bene\xef\xac\x81ts that should be compelling to a wide range of users and the multiple sources of utility allows different users to \xef\xac\x81nd value in the token in different ways Token \xe2\x80\x9cStaking\xe2\x80\x9d Many of the bene\xef\xac\x81ts for token holders will involve sending tokens to a staking contract This is designed primarily as a means of accounting for the token balances of active users Tokens sent to the contract cannot be used for transfer or trading However users will retain the ability to withdraw tokens from the staking smart contract at any time at their own discretion As used this section the term \xe2\x80\x98staking\xe2\x80\x99 means sending tokens to the staking contract from which token balances will be read When a user stakes tokens in 20 \x0cthe address Caspian will track that user\xe2\x80\x99s total staking balance and the times at which that balance has changed It will use that to ensure bene\xef\xac\x81ts are appropriately calculated as outlined below An individual staked token can only be allocated to one of the bene\xef\xac\x81t mechanisms though a user can stake different tokens for different bene\xef\xac\x81ts For purposes of determining the Governance Council all of a user\xe2\x80\x99s staked tokens are counted Commission Discount Function The commission discount program has three forms The \xef\xac\x81rst offers token stakers a guaranteed discount that increases in a predictable manner over time up to 25% as long as the tokens remain staked The second allows users paying in CSP tokens to receive an additional discount of up to 25% of their fees The third is a potential dynamic discount with further details to be published in due course In order to count towards a discount tokens must have been staked for one week counted as seven consecutive 24 hour periods as of the daily calculation hour Tokens begin to accrue bene\xef\xac\x81ts beginning on the eighth day after they have been staked If the eighth day falls midweek token holders will accrue a partial discount for that week with a full discount applied to the following week assuming the tokens remain staked For purposes of the guaranteed discount staked tokens designated towards the discounting bene\xef\xac\x81ts gain weight each week they are fully staked up to a maximum of 25 weeks At that point staked tokens are considered to be at \xe2\x80\x9cfull weight\xe2\x80\x9d Guaranteed Discount The guaranteed discount function establishes a mechanism where users can access a set discount that increases over time The discount accruing to tokens staked towards this option increases at the rate of one percentage point per week up to a cap of 25% The value of tokens staked must be greater than 1% of a client\xe2\x80\x99s weekly average of daily trade volumes in order to qualify The staking threshold is established each week based on the previous week\xe2\x80\x99s trading and token price data The user must maintain an average balance above this threshold in order to accrue another point of discount Establishing a minimum staking threshold based on a combination of an individual client\xe2\x80\x99s own notional trading volume and the \xef\xac\x81at equivalent value of the token represents an effort to make the discount accessible to a range of clients from moderate users to the most active The system is also a \xef\xac\x82exible and responsive one where clients will be able to adjust their staked token amounts relative to both their own activity on the platform and \xef\xac\x82uctuations in the token price To illustrate this imagine a client with average daily trading volume of US$1 million throughout week 4 (assuming the client has already ful\xef\xac\x81lled all staking requirements up to week 4 and is currently at a 4% discount) During week 4 the CSP average token price was $0 50 For week 5 the same client would need to maintain a staked token balance of 20 000 tokens the \xef\xac\x81at equivalent of $10 000 21 \x0cin tokens or $1 000 000 x 1% at $ 5 per token in order to gain an additional discount point towards the 25% ceiling under the Guaranteed Discount program If the client did maintain an average token balance of 20 000 the client would enjoy a 5% discount Should week 5 close with the client\xe2\x80\x99s average staked token balance below the necessary threshold (for example in a situation where the client\xe2\x80\x99s trading volume had increased during week 4 requiring an increase in staked tokens for week 5) the client would have a grace period of 72 hours to remedy the de\xef\xac\x81ciency in order to continue to accumulate discount points during the new week A client who fails to top up a de\xef\xac\x81cient staking minimum beyond the 72 hour grace period suffers no penalty and simply does not accrue an additional discount point for the new week During a second week of unremedied de\xef\xac\x81ciency the client\xe2\x80\x99s discount is diminished by 1% relative to the prior week In effect the hypothetical client reverts to their week 3 discount level A client that does not address a de\xef\xac\x81cient token staking balance after the second week will see their staking discount reset to the initial 1% discount Caspian reserves the right to modify the staking threshold or temporarily suspend staking minimums in extreme circumstances including in response to sudden market drops that raise effective token staking thresholds Discount Payment Function Caspian will offer to users who pay fees in CSP a maximum 25% discount that stacks with other discounts A user who stakes tokens as part of the guaranteed discount and pays fees in CSP would receive a maximum 50% discount platform fees Dynamic Discount Caspian intends to develop a dynamic discount program that has the potential to offer a greater discount to those staking tokens Further details will be released in due course User to User Utility Accelerating Third Party Development The CSP token will play a critical role in incentivizing third party development and integration on top of the Caspian platform Possibilities include advanced charting libraries user interface modi\xef\xac\x81cations external trading signal feeds or stress tests for trading strategies Third party developers will have two options when offering an application or service on the platform \xe2\x97\x8f Selling usage of the app or service In order to use an app or service users pay a developer determined subscription fee Caspian will retain a portion of this subscription fee as platform host In order to offer an app for sale developers must stake* tokens as a deterrent against offering poor apps or service *This staking mechanism may be a different mechanism to the other staking described in this paper Further details will be published in due course \xe2\x97\x8f Offering the app to token stakers Instead of offering apps in exchange for subscription fees developers can make them accessible to users who 22 \x0cstake tokens to use them Developers who offer their apps in this way specify the monthly staking requirement and become eligible for tokens Applications offered in this way are called \xe2\x80\x98free apps\xe2\x80\x99 because users aren\xe2\x80\x99t required to pay only to stake tokens Examples include third party charting or fundamental analysis services with an access fee set at 10 staked tokens per month per user or whatever amount the developer deems appropriate \xe2\x80\x98Free Apps\xe2\x80\x99 to Token Stakers In order to view the \xe2\x80\x98free apps \xe2\x80\x99 users must stake at least one CSP Beyond that each app\xe2\x80\x99s token \xe2\x80\x98staking price\xe2\x80\x99 indicates its precise staking requirement Users can only access as many \xe2\x80\x98free apps\xe2\x80\x99 as their total staking balance will support If a user has ten total staked CSPs for purposes of applications s/he can only activate a number of apps whose cumulative staking price is ten tokens This is designed to discourage bloatware while still supporting open application development users aren\xe2\x80\x99t spending tokens but are rather determining where to allocate scarce resources This should prevent the adoption of frivolous apps designed to be downloaded by many users Tokens staked for app access are not eligible for a guaranteed or dynamic discount This is a variation on the \xe2\x80\x9cfreemium\xe2\x80\x9d model Ecosystem Development Incentives From time to time Caspian will consider providing rewards to application developers offering their apps to Caspian platform users These rewards are based on a variety of factors at Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s discretion but are premised on an app being provided for free or in return for a number of tokens speci\xef\xac\x81ed by the developer to be staked Of course application developers always remain free to decide the fee or staking amount (if any) to access their app Whilst ultimately at an application developer\xe2\x80\x99s discretion staking can provide a way for developers to test features and gauge interest recognizing that a user is more likely to stake a token to use an app since that token will eventually be returned than to pay for it Instead of spending a valuable asset they are simply setting it aside while they use the app and providing \xe2\x80\x98payment\xe2\x80\x99 in the form of an opportunity cost The purpose of Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary rewards approach is to incentivize developers to consider allowing users to test their apps for free (or on a staked basis) rather than immediately requiring a fee from users This can help users access innovative apps and test their quality before deciding whether to pay for them (if and when they are offered on a paid basis) This is a key element of Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s vision to build a true community of quality platform members users and developers Further details will be released in due course Additional Development Bounties Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s CSP token will play several additional roles in supporting third party development \xe2\x97\x8f Development Bounties A rewards mechanism slowly releases Caspian held tokens into bounty pools to incentivize developers to build out key infrastructure integration and plug ins Distribution is determined by 23 \x0cCaspian in collaboration with the Governance Nodes Caspian may choose to fund speci\xef\xac\x81c development integrations by establishing bounties for developers to target speci\xef\xac\x81c tools or functionalities \xe2\x97\x8f Community Bounties Users will have the opportunity to vote for new features or apps they would like the see on the platform Bounties for winning features or plug ins maybe awardable Ultimately the nature of the app platform will depend heavily on Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s user base and Caspian will be informed by its community council of top token stakers to help decide where to prioritize its resources Caspian will allow users to vote on new features that have bounties attached These are expected to spur development with Caspian reserving the right to unilaterally establish bounties for use at the Company\xe2\x80\x99s discretion Governance Nodes Caspian will implement a governance function that enables key members of the community to provide input on overall platform development This governing group functions as a council with which Caspian can regularly consult particularly as it relates to Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s evolution into a platform for third party development The group will help de\xef\xac\x81ne the bounty pools and participate in the allocation of development grants In exchange for their input Governance Nodes receive an additional 5% discount on trading fees above that offered as a result of token staking Governance Nodes guide a minimum of 25% of Caspian\xe2\x80\x99s development resources for integration of new exchanges and new tokens as well as the addition of new base level features to be developed by the Caspian team Each quarter Caspian will consult with its current Governance Nodes to set priorities for the quarter This ultimately will include milestones and development targets which Caspian will communicate to these Nodes Caspian has the right to transfer governance activities on platform and potentially onto a blockchain The top 15 token stakers globally will serve as Governance Nodes and help guide the development of the platform Tokens must have been staked for at least six weeks to be eligible for entry into this group Membership is determined quarterly Token stakers can choose to opt out of governance and transfer their status to the next staker 24 \x0cContact Caspian To request further information please use the following outreach channel Email info@caspian tech Caspian Ltd Registered Of\xef\xac\x81ce Intertrust Corporate
