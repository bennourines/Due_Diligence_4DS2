b Halal Chain White Paper HALAL CHAIN WHITE PAPER Halal Chain Team Version \xef\xbc\x9a 2017/11 1 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 1 What is Halal\xef\xbc\x9f 1 1 Halal Food Overview The term \xe2\x80\x9cHalal\xe2\x80\x9d is an Arabic word which means lawful legitimate allowed or permissible 1 From the Islamic legal perspective halal is something which is allowed and permitted by the sharia (the Islamic law) It is the opposite of \xe2\x80\x9charam\xe2\x80\x9d which means prohibited under the Islamic law 2 A basic understanding of what is halal and abiding by the sharia rules of halal is central to every Muslim\xe2\x80\x99s belief An Islamic legal maxim is stated as \xe2\x80\x9cThe fundamental ruling in matters is permissibility unless an evidence proves the prohibition \xe2\x80\x9d3 The concept of halal is quite influential in all aspects of a believers\xe2\x80\x99 life because it provides a comprehensive set of rules and guiding principles That is why halal defines a consumer product or a group of consumer products where the sharia principles and measures should be observed throughout various stages of the supply chain process including production transportation and distribution phases According to the Islamic teachings a person\xe2\x80\x99s spirituality and his/her purity of soul are strongly related to consumable goods particularly the edible goods With this understanding consumers are demanding for an increased production of halal food It is this gap that the commercial halal food sector seeks to fill With the Holy Quran calling for the food to be halal and pure 4 or Tayyib Allah has mentioned in Surat al Mu\xe2\x80\x99minun that \xe2\x80\x9cO messengers eat of the good things (Tayyibaat) and act with integrity I am aware of what you do\xe2\x80\x9d (23 51) This has led to segments of the Halal Food sector creating produce of the highest quality as can be seen in the rise of Halal organic food Consequently non Muslim demand for such quality food is also increasing 1 Baalbaki R (1995) Al Mawrid Beirut Lebanon Dar El Ilm Lilmalayin Mausoo`ah Al Fiqhiyyah Al Kuwaitiyyah (2007) Under the term \xe2\x80\x98Halal\xe2\x80\x99 3 Al Sayuti A R (1990) Al Ashbah Wa Al Nadhair Beirut Lebanon Dar Al Kotob AlIlmiyyah 4 The Holy Quran Al Baqarah 2 168 \xe2\x80\x9cPeople eat what is good and lawful from the earth and do not follow Satan\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps for he is your sworn enemy \xe2\x80\x9d 2 2 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 2 Status of the Global Halal Economy Figure 01 Estimation of Global Halal Market Source HDC According to the State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2016 7 by Thomson Reuters the global halal economy is estimated to be worth around USD 3 9 trillion Growing at an estimated annual rate of 20% the industry is valued at about USD 560 billion a year Thus making it one of the fastest growing consumer segments in the world In 2018 it is expected to hit the USD 6 4 trillion mark 5 The global halal economy consisting of 1 8 billion Muslims is no longer confined to food and food related products The halal industry has now expanded to include pharmaceuticals and health products cosmetics media and recreation fashion traveling and medical devices as well as service sector such as logistics marketing print and electronic media packaging branding and financing In recent years with the increase in number of affluent Muslim consumers the halal industry has expanded further into lifestyle offerings including halal travel and hospitality services 5 WIFE (2016) Global Halal Economy Estimated to Touch $6 4 Trillion Mark by 2018 The Gulf Today 15th November 2016 3 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper as well as fashion This development has been triggered by the change of the mindset of Muslim consumers as well as ethical consumerism worldwide 2 1 Potential Market Opportunity for the Halal Ecosystem \xe2\x80\x93 The Global Muslim Population Figure 02 The World Muslim Population Source Global Islamic Finance Report (GIFR) 2013 Ch 13 The global Muslim population is expected to grow by about 35% over the next 20 years rising from 1 6 billion in 2010 to 2 2 billion by 2030 By 2050 the Muslim population could grow to 2 6 billion representing nearly 30% of the projected global population Figure 03 Breakdown of World Muslim Population 4 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper Source Global Islamic Finance Report (GIFR) 2013 Ch 13 By 2030 Muslim population is expected to spread to 79 countries rising from the current figure of 72 countries The majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s Muslims (more than 60%) continue to live in the Asia Pacific region while almost 20% live in the Middle East and North Africa Elsewhere the Muslim population in Europe and the Americas is expected to grow at a slower rate but still constitutes a rising share of the total population in their regions A major factor that makes the Muslim market particularly attractive to a variety of companies is its largely young demographic profile that is part of an emerging middle class linked to greater consumption Notably Islamic doctrine is also supportive of both trade and consumption activities In Islamic majority and minority countries throughout Asia the Middle East Africa and Europe Islamic business activities are escalating with Islamic trade currently estimated in trillions of dollars The Islamic market is huge lucrative and underserved thus provides opportunities for halal products and services 5 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper Recently the advent of modern technology at the global level brings up unprecedented business opportunities and also numerous challenges for global halal industry The industry has been fully accelerated by breaking through traditional business models expecting a vast market potential to be materialized 2 2 The Current Challenges in the Global Halal Industry \xe2\x96\xa0 Lack of Globally Reorganized Halal Certification System The absence of standardized halal certification system at the global level has given rise to technical barriers for cross border trading of halal products among international economies \xe2\x96\xa0 Inaccurate and Unauthentic Data of Halal Products Halal products that are not authentically certified or lacking transparent mechanism of certification can cause trust issues and delays in setting up a global distribution system Moreover the dearth of data of halal products simply adds up to the concerns Sometimes the data is available however it is found to be either inaccurate or unauthentic \xe2\x96\xa0 Poor Regulation of Raw Materials for Halal Products There is no heavily regulated market for raw materials of halal products Such unavailability enables non sharia compliant ingredients and materials to be mixed with the halal food In this situation it is difficult to avoid this contamination due to the complexity and inter connectivity of the world food supply chain As a result it is increasingly difficult for any halal certification agency to perform its duty of ensuring shariacompliance of food In these circumstances such weakness damages Muslim consumers\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in many ways Due to the current industry landscape the establishment of a uniformed regulatory framework is not possible within a short time span \xe2\x96\xa0 Centralized Regulation for Halal Food A centralized regulatory system for halal food is sufficiently difficult to manage and regulate the industry across the whole chain due to challenges and issues in its implementation The methods technology and regulatory bodies across the globe that run halal food supply chains have not kept pace with growing concerns of our modern Muslim world 6 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper In response to the challenges listed above the Halal Chain provides the solution which is required for the efficient expansion of the Halal Industry 7 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 3 What is Halal Chain Halal Chain is a decentralized global monitoring solution for product safety and integrity which is achieved by harnessing the power of the technology of consortium chain with the particular attention in the field of Halal industry including food medicine and cosmetics 3 1 Consortium Chain for Halal Products Traceability \xe2\x96\xa0 Technical Selection of Halal Chain Public Chain Vs Decentralized Consortium Chain In recent years blockchain technology has attracted exponentially growing attention of the masses This trend is an ode to the decentralized general computing capability by the public blockchain and the introduction and application of the consortium chain technology by the professionals in the circle of traditional mainstream technology The actual uses of the Halal Chain comprise of a far more complex ecosystem taking every factor into consideration such as regional laws and cultural diversities industry implementations and extensibility security and stability of the system In order to establish a cross regional Halal Chain the criteria such as stated below must be checked \xe2\x96\xa0 Regional differences in laws regulations and culture \xe2\x96\xa0 Special requirements of halal industry and business scenarios \xe2\x96\xa0 Optimized governance mechanism of the multi center and multi node collaboration \xe2\x96\xa0 Performance requirements for throughput latency and others \xe2\x96\xa0 Special requirement for data storage and \xe2\x96\xa0 Accessibility After a comprehensive review and technical due diligence of the public blockchain and consortium blockchain the Halal chain adopts Qtum as the foundational blockchain technology and incorporates Hyperledger Fabric technology which could materialize cross chain data exchange 8 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper between public blockchains and consortium blockchains as proposed by the Ink Chain team Based on the above mentioned technical feasibility study and the strategic partnership with Ink Chain and Qtum Chain the Halal Chain\xe2\x80\x99s technical solution is oriented to cater for the traceability of halal products that should be operated within a trustworthy consortium blockchain confined in a limit circle This enables the system to address the concerns of cross chain data exchange and data storage At the same time the Halal Chain achieves its primary objective for the halal industry In brief a consortium blockchain that is developed for a specific industry has inherent advantages in addressing the concerns and issues in the traceability of halal products In this way the traceability system for halal products in the Halal Chain solution contributes to the entire Halal Chain ecosystem In addition the ecosystem also consists of tokens issued on Qtum blockchain considering the most relevant economic model At the same time it has the element of the cross chain protocol between ink chain and HalalChain \xe2\x96\xa0 Technical Implementation of Halal Chain for the Traceability of Products The consortium blockchain of the Halal Chain is a tailor made blockchain space developed for the Halal products traceability Its underlying framework comprises of multi specifications and standards of Qtum Halal Chain and Hyperledger Fabric It has been optimized and upgraded based on the actual business cases of the industry \xe2\x96\xa0 Identity and Access Management The Halal Chain adopts a digital certification mechanism for identity authentication and access control Through certified authority a trusted third party \xe2\x80\x93 trusted by both the subject (owner) of the certificate and the party relying upon the certificate \xe2\x80\x93 ascertains that the public key of the subject and other identification information are bound together to verify a user\xe2\x80\x99s identity The identification authentication process used in the consortium blockchain is as follows \xe2\x97\x8fThe subject submits its basic information (name serial number contact details etc ) affiliated node information (internet protocol (IP) address node identity) and certification authority (CA) public key certificate for the operator for a uniformed access control 9 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper \xe2\x97\x8f Once access is approved by the operator the relevant information of the subject is publicly announced at the consortium blockchain which connects the node of the subject to the network by enabling node handshake and establishing connection \xe2\x97\x8f Once nodes are connected the nodes use the private key in the CA certificate to sign their own handshake information and send it to other party The receiver will then query the CA public key certificate according to the handshake information of the sender and verify the signature through the public key certificate so as to identify which subject has initiated the connection and whether or not it should allow to set up a communication \xe2\x97\x8f The certificate management committee checks the status of the subject s certificate on a regular basis to find out whether the certificate is still valid expired or revoked If the subject\xe2\x80\x99s node tries to connect to the network while the certificate is found to be invalid it will be rejected by the system \xe2\x96\xa0 Node Management A node is a deployed server on the Halal Chain platform It can be connected to the consortium blockchain network with an accessible IP address and is able to provide services to external parties The nodes are categorized as central node and enterprise nodes in order to prevent attacks from malicious nodes Only the nodes certified by the consortium blockchain can act as the central nod It is entitled to participate in the consensus algorithm and to act as the ledger in the chain On the other hand enterprise nodes upload data while also serving as the ledger in the chain but they are precluded from participating in the consensus algorithm \xe2\x96\xa0 Consensus Mechanism The Halal Chain uses the PoL & T (Proof of Land & Time) algorithm It uploads data based on time and land Due to differences from the land and time in generating data it limits the possibility of counterfeiting the data The traceability of data about halal products would be produced based on time and land through marketing incentives \xe2\x96\xa0 The Decentralized Halal Products Traceability Platform The decentralized platform for the traceability of halal products is established as niche market based on Halal Chain ecosystem A variety of technical solutions would be offered to enterprises regulators end10 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper consumers developers and other industry stakeholders enabling the users to trace halal products across the whole supply chain 3 2 Fundamental Reasons for Change Subject to the structure of blockchain smart contracts and their unique ecosystem the technology enables decentralized applications (Dapps) to offer products\xe2\x80\x99 data for public review and avoid its artificial tampering which may occur during the course of production and transportation due to other complexities of the supply chain \xe2\x96\xa0 The Changes \xe2\x96\xa0 Redefining Roles The decentralized model distinguishes the role of manufacturers and the traceability of products provided Thus this would enable the product traceability information to be offered credibly and authentically \xe2\x96\xa0 Redefining the behavior All the data will be collected and uploaded in the production process by Internet of Things (IoT) devices automatically without any involvement of the enterprises The blockchain platform would be self governing to ensure the uniqueness and accuracy of the product traceability data \xe2\x96\xa0 Capabilities and Services \xe2\x96\xa0 Products\xe2\x80\x99 Traceability Services The measurement will be automatically collected and updated by IoT devices in conjunction with blockchain technology which is tamperresistant and features time stamp The services will be offered to the enterprises and end users for the purpose of product safety and maintaining integrity to enhance the core competitiveness of the applied enterprises \xe2\x96\xa0 Auditing Services for Regulating Bodies The service will offer an auditing interface for the regulators by providing access to production data to safeguard all the products manufactured in compliance with relevant regulations and laws in various jurisdictions 11 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper \xe2\x96\xa0 Anti Counterfeiting and Verifying Services All the data in the blockchain would be open for public review The end users could use the relevant mobile/web application to verify and trace the product throughout its entire supply chain \xe2\x96\xa0 Vision of the industry changes Subject to technical feasibilities it is intended to help industries realizing the vision for a traceability system in the long run where At a decentralized platform the production information is automatically collected and uploaded by the IoT devices to the blockchain platform It is significantly crucial because manual input process may be contaminated by human errors mistakes or data deviation due to a variety of objectives and subjective factors The end user\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty confidence and trust in products will be significantly enhanced since all the data in the blockchain would be open for public review and the production process will be vividly displayed to demonstrate decency and authenticity Therefore the brand build up for industry stakeholders will likely be elevated From the perspective of regulators at the event of any incident in the production it might be unnecessary to deploy a host of manpower and time to conduct ordinary investigation because the essential production information could be easily traced via the blockchain platform \xe2\x96\xa0 Blockchain from Islamic Economics perspective The main efforts in Islamic economics so far has been to create new forms Shariah compliance instrument to operationalise Shariah values and ethics into the current conventional economic system and banking products While this is crucial to sustain the global economy as it is today the Islamic economics needs to develop new strategies to cope with the next economy which starts with a clear and deliverable vision of a new world economy And the new vision of a new world economy will be driven by those who embrace innovation that will build the future However it is necessary look at the main building block to enable trust in impersonal financial transactions in a highly globalized society This innovation called the \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d will play a crucial role in boosting the Islamic financial sectors in all its segments which include banking insurance Capital market etc Addressing the digital revolution that is happening right now will foster competitive advantage for the Islamic economy industry This innovation is in accordance with Shariah rules and principles 12 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central authority Simply put it is a mechanism for creating trust Within this open ledger system the blockchain offers an inherent level of trust for the user eliminating the need for the middleman and mitigating the risk of human error Justice and creditworthiness has been emphasized in the Holy Quran in Surat al Nisa which Allah says O you who believe Stand firmly for justice as witnesses to Allah even if against yourselves or your parents or your relatives Whether one is rich or poor Allah takes care of both So do not follow your desires lest you swerve If you deviate or turn away\xe2\x80\x94then God is Aware of what you do\xe2\x80\x9d (4 135) In the blockchain transaction it is publicly accessible log of transactions ensures that the data is protected against tampering and revision and it is virtually impossible for individuals to modify or replace parts of the blockchain secretly The need for transparency is above all an important Shar\xc4\xab`ah consideration in blockchain transaction Any form of concealment fraud or attempt at misrepresentation violates the principles of justice and fairness in Shar\xc4\xab`ah as mentioned in the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an in S\xc5\xabrah Al Mutaffifin Woe to the defrauders Those who when they take a measure from people they take in full But when they measure or weigh to others they cheat (83 1 3) A full copy of the blockchain contains every transaction ever executed making information on the value belonging to every active address (account) accessible at any point in history Every block contains a long reference number or hash of the previous block thus creating a chain of blocks from the genesis block to the current block The below paragraphs explain the concept of blockchain and how a transaction is recorded on the blockchain based on the cryptocurrency protocol 13 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 4 How Does the Halal Chain Solve the Problem The Halal Chain is a Halal products traceability platform on Qtum inclusive of its corresponding tokens and ecosystem 4 1 HALAL Product Traceability Platform The Halal Chain is defined not only as the product traceability platform but also as a complete ecosystem which is illustrated below \xe2\x96\xa0 IOT Data Collection System The core value of the IoT system is that the production information would be automatically collected and uploaded by the IoT devices to the blockchain platform without any manual involvement Thus it safeguards the uniqueness and credibility of the data \xe2\x96\xa0 Consensus Data Processing and Storage System The blockchain platform based on Qtum and Halal Chain can realize classified storage of the data collected by the IoT devices The consensus data would be stored in the blockchain while the image data and product data would be stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) distributed storage system via the adoption of Merkle tree technology from Ethereum 14 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper \xe2\x96\xa0 End User System As for the part linked with end users the halal products traceability platform can provide tracing and verifying services It can also serve as a token exchange service \xe2\x96\xa0 Branch Platform of IoT data Collection System \xe2\x96\xa0 Tags Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Nea Field Communication (NFC) Data Collection System and Sensor Systems A key attribute of the Halal Chain is its comprehensive support to all RFID and NFC based data acquisition devices in the industry This feature provides the ability to tag and monitor physical objects and transmit data associated with them It allows goods to be tracked throughout the supply chain and assures full integrity of readings The Halal Chain primarily collects data from tags tracers sensors and other IoT devices A tag is an element set on the product itself generally on top of the packaging that provides information about the product and its identity 1D/2D barcodes RFID stickers and NFC are examples of common tagging systems which would be used to trace the product flow information The significant part of the Halal Chain is that the tags integrate all essential information in the production which includes consensus data pictures product data etc \xe2\x96\xa0 Data Detection System In order to implement relevant regulations and specifications required by regulatory bodies specific detection systems are selected and deployed by Halal Chain at various stages to offer the most effective and cost efficient assessment of each product at every stage A product\xe2\x80\x99s physio chemical structure composition and quality attributes may vary throughout the supply chain and must be continuously assessed to verify conformity with standards set by participants in the network which will prevent counterfeiting of products The data detection device an IoT hardware deployed in the supply chain provides an automatic data acquisition and input system that results in a credible and authorized input process \xe2\x96\xa0 Data Transmission 15 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper When information is transmitted from a device to the Halal Chain network it includes \xe2\x97\x8f Tag IDs location and time tracer sensors and gateway IDs \xe2\x97\x8f Digitized certificates and transaction IDs \xe2\x97\x8f Transportation handling and storage conditions as measured by sensors and \xe2\x97\x8f Product quality and safety attributes 4 2 Working Mechanism of Halal Products Traceability Platform The diagram above shows how data is transmitted across the Halal Chain \xe2\x96\xa0 Data acquisition in production process \xe2\x96\xa0 Data collected by an IoT device is uploaded to the Halal chain platform through the API edge gateway \xe2\x96\xa0 The block chain platform verifies the data source transmitted by the edge gateway to ensure that the data is uploaded via a certified node \xe2\x96\xa0 The Blockchain platform conducts classified storage of the authenticated data and alerts all nodes in the consortium blockchain \xe2\x96\xa0 The end users use APP to verify product authenticity \xe2\x96\xa0 The regulators conduct auditing to all products in the Halal Chain platform \xe2\x96\xa0 Halal Chain Protocol The system architecture of Halal Chain consists of a variety of underlying blockchains and IoT technologies in which each specific technology is an integral part of the entire ecosystem The major elements of the architecture are as follows 16 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper \xe2\x96\xa0 IoT Data Acquisition Device The function of the device is to collect product information in the supply chain such as time place pictures products and so on \xe2\x96\xa0 Data Acquisition The platform is designed to manage a distributed data set based on Qtum blockchain and IPFS The smart contract records every essential information and relevant features of the product in the supply chain The smart contract is featured with the following characteristics \xe2\x97\x8f Authenticity The Halal Chain authenticates devices by using public private key cryptography Each device on the network signs data transmissions with its unique private key to prove its identity as an authorized device Signatures from devices are verified against a list of authorized devices which is a mapping of public keys to devices that is publicly available in a smart contract When an authorized device sends a message to the Halal Chain network its public key is compared to the Authentication list for verification Once verified the message is accepted and recorded onto the blockchain If an unauthorized device sends a measurement the signature verification will fail and the measurement will be rejected This would ensure the accuracy of the data on the blockchain The diagram below demonstrates a data transmission from a measurement device to a customer device that is authorized on the Halal Chain \xe2\x97\x8f Disclosure and Transparency 17 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper The data on the blockchain uploaded by the IoT device is publicly available \xe2\x97\x8f Tamper proof The data on the blockchain uploaded by the IoT device cannot be modified or deleted by any party \xe2\x97\x8f Block Space Capability The block space capability reflects its storage capacity for data packet Although a single measurement is typically small the system is designed to collect thousands of measurements per batch which may include data from multiple devices such as pictures videos product information and so on Thus in the long term the Halal Chain network will need to handle terabytes of data daily which might lead to transaction jam To achieve this network capacity Halal Chain has created a blockchain that integrates with the Ethereum blockchain and an IPFS distributed storage system enabling the consensus encrypted data to be stored in the blockchain while the IoT measurement data would be stored in the IPFS The measurement data is stored as leaves in a Merkle tree The measurements tree nodes are then mapped to IPFS nodes A Merkle tree is a structure that allows any party to quickly verify the validity of data in a branch or leaf using the root hash of the tree Storing the Merkle tree root on the blockchain ensures the data cannot be modified once it is written in a block Halal Chain also maintains the entire history of all Merkle roots to ensure that no data is lost or altered during Merkle tree updates \xe2\x96\xa0 Smart Contract Enforcement 18 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper Similar to ISO9001 quality certification the products will not be allowed to trade or circulate unless its production quality fulfills the enforcing standards The Halal Chain platform will open access to the relevant authorities for auditing and supervision 19 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 5 Halal Chain Coins The economic model of Halal Chain is based on the cross chain protocol and consortium blockchain In the ecosystem the token Halal Chain Coin (HLC) will be issued on Qtum to act as the utility token 5 1 Other Business Considerations \xe2\x96\xa0 HLLC Bonded Halal Products The tokens HLC are bonded to data As items move through the supply chain and are transformed during the manufacturing process a random token reward (the initial reward amount is 1 token and would reduce half according to the progress The 2% of the total tokens is expected to be allocated for this marketing campaign) assigned can be split and merged into multiple other Measurements Smart Contracts which together create a graph representing the history of a given item The HLC tokens are sent to the network alongside IoT data and remain locked in the Measurements Smart Contract until a batch completes its movement through the supply chain The HLC tokens remain bonded to a product until a defined expiration date or until the \xe2\x80\x9ctermination event\xe2\x80\x9d The termination event can be defined by a purchase delivery product destruction or any other event on the supply chain The end users can claim tokens at the end of the product cycle which could be used to redeem credits or a bonus from the official website In this way the tokens can be recycled and returned to the ecosystem (the tokens will be destroyed by the smart contract if the product is destructed or recalled) The value gained by recycling tokens motivates users to purchase Halal Chain tracked products This cycle also benefits producers who receive free promotion and brand building \xe2\x96\xa0 Token Investment to Industry Stakeholders A certain number of tokens will be used to acquire the ownership of certain industry stakeholders which is going to bond the token with real economy and nourish the global Halal ecosystem 5 2 Cross Chain Protocol The Halal Chain cross chain protocol is fully developed by Halal Chain team by harnessing the only sophisticated solution in the blockchain space that could materialize cross chain interaction between public blockchain and consortium blockchain Its details are given below 20 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper \xe2\x80\x9cFor consortium blockchains distributed under various sovereignty frameworks the capability of cross chain interaction is key to realize the Internet of Value The public blockchain (Qtum) sitting at the very heart of the Halal Chain ecosystem becomes a natural bridge in the transfer of value and information In the early days side chain solutions such as the two way peg have contributed to extending the scalability of bitcoin Later smart contract platforms such as Ethereum provided more possibilities to cross chain interaction scenarios and protocols Some delicate projects like BTC (Bitcoin) Relay enabled Ethereum DApp developers to verify the bitcoin network activities via smart contract Other projects aimed to realize the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Blockchains\xe2\x80\x9d For instance Cosmos and Polkadot are seeking to realize cross chain value transfer or a global consensus through hub or relay mechanism Till date most efforts made in cross chain interoperability remain in the early stages or are restricted to the domain of public blockchain The latter is due to the immature development of consortium blockchain as there is a lack of conducive environment for exploration and testing As Halal Chain sovereign consortium blockchain prospectively extends Fabric to support multi asset accounts and tokens the problems mentioned above will be solved We devote to realize the interoperability of Halal Chain sovereign consortium blockchain with Qtum as it is a key process in prospering the HalalChain ecosystem The interoperability shall realize the reliable asset transfer cross chain orable and cross contract operation The realization of interoperability will benefit from the following two aspects Firstly as highly versatile and general smart contract platforms both the Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) supported by Qtum and chain code which are supported by Halal Chain consortium blockchain have flexible and powerful capability of expression Secondly the Halal Chain consortium blockchain itself provides and also relies on the identity management and access control mechanisms Therefore cross chain operations can rely on multiple trustworthy endorsers just as the transactions do without extra premise on the trust of the consortium system On the side of the consortium blockchain the whole consensus process is decoupled into transaction endorsement ordering and validation performed by different network nodes Furthermore we introduce cross chain relay endorsements The network nodes in charge of cross chain relay need to independently query and verify the cross chain operation event on Qtum as well as the corresponding state value (and ensure fair finality) They are also responsible to sign the legal cross chain operation proposals of the consortium blockchain side Just as the transaction endorsement policy set for instantiated chain code relay endorsement policy is also needed for cross chain operations Specifically Signature Policy structure can be applied to specify the valid relay endorsements forming any complicated signature combination For instance \xe2\x80\x9cOR (\xe2\x80\x98Org1 member\xe2\x80\x99) AND (\xe2\x80\x98Org2 member\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Org3 member\xe2\x80\x99)\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that the condition of the policy can be met with the signature of an Org1 member or with the signatures of both Org2 and Org3 members On the Qtum side the consortium blockchain in need of cross chain interoperability will be registered via smart contract The basic information and current relay endorsement policy are recorded and the triggering of the contract terms also need to satisfy the specified signature combination\xe2\x80\x9d 21 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 5 3 Use cases Through adoption of the technology HLC are based on the Halal Chain ecosystem on Qtum A token holder can transfer the tokens safely to a certain Halal Chain sovereign consortium blockchain through cross chain protocol Those tokens on the consortium blockchain will be generated and managed by the ASCC correspondingly They can be circulated freely by means of direct transfer or triggering smart contracts Moreover users can also transfer tokens back to Qtum securely if necessary 22 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 6 Economic Model 6 1 Ecosystem Construction and Foundation Investment As mentioned earlier Halal Chain will issue tokens called Halal Chain Coin (HLC) based on Qtum As the key component of the Halal Chain ecosystem the HLC will be defined as the utility tokens to invest in companies The trading token will be used to be circulated across the chain The HLC represents the physical assets or securities of the actual companies It means that the tokens are backed by the real economy Additionally as the essential economic instrument the HLC will be used in many actual cases such as incentives for product promotions brand building etc The total number of HLC is 1 billion which will be distributed as follows \xe2\x96\xa0 500 million (50%) of the total tokens issuance of which 1 6% is allocated to the angel phase Approximately 50% of the 500 million is allocated to the private phase which is only accessible to institutional investors 16% is allocated to the traditional stakeholders in the industry 32 4% is allocated to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) phase The income will be used to support further development of Halal Chain including technology development market expansion legal advice etc 23 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper \xe2\x96\xa0 200 million (20%) is allocated to the founding team and contributors who provided resources and technical support to theHalal Chain development during the early stages \xe2\x96\xa0 200 million (20%) of the tokens are reserved for the Halal Chain investment foundation which will use these tokens to invest in the actual enterprises in the consortium chain This is to facilitate the fast applications of Halal Chain technologies in the food industry which gives rise to a nourished Halal chain ecosystem \xe2\x96\xa0 100 million (10%) is allocated to the developers\xe2\x80\x99 incentive This allocation will be used to reward the developers individuals or entities that would play a significant role in contributing to the community development 6 2 Ecosystem Construction A certain share of the funds raised through ICO will be allocated to optimize the platform accomplish the task of source code opening and reward developers for code development within the community The HalalChain and Qtum blockchain will jointly conduct blockchain technology development and operate the Halal chain IoT device It will facilitate all the stakeholders in the chain to adopt a uniform fully compatible device enabling the enterprises to transmit the data to Halal Chain platform smoothly 6 3 Foundation Investment Strategy and Portfolio As part of Halal chain ecosystem the foundation will hold a certain number of tokens to invest in the actual industry stakeholders intending to facilitate the actual use of Halal Chain technology in the industry as well as to correlate the tokens with real economy 24 \x0cHalal Chain White Paper 7 Token Offering Details The ICO will issue 500 million tokens called Halal Chain Coins (HLC) which accounts for 50% of the total circulation It intends to raise 130 000ETH or other equivalent digital

team In the Private Placement Phase investors from China and the United States are qualified to participate because it is considered as an angel investment for the project which is free from supervision of the Securities Act and is bound to the Jurisdictional law of China Except for the Private Placement Phase the other phases of the Halal Chain token offering forbid the participation of China and USA nationals \xe2\x96\xa0 After holistic legal frame work and preparation the Halal Chain team is taking a highly cautious approach towards legal risks in token offering On this basis the Halal Chain team may adjust the strategy of token offering to minimize legal risk when deemed necessary during the entire course of the offering \xe2\x96\xa0 US investors as stated in legal regulations must be whitelisted (a whitelisted investor is someone whose annual income is above 200 000 USD or someone whose spouse\xe2\x80\x99s annual income is above 300 000 US dollars or someone

American investor is not able to participate in the token offering \xe2\x96\xa0 Non American investors or non US investors do not require the same whitelisting procedure imposed on American investors
