with a secure opportunity to receive financial freedom Links beta membrana io membrana io Related documents Membrana Pitch_deck Membrana Business Overview Cryptocurrency market Thanks to blockchain technology a large number of new types of assets \xe2\x80\x94 cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\x94 have appeared on the market Bitcoin Litecoin Ethereum Tron etc These assets are decentralized digital currencies each of them allows their owners to carry out transactions between wallets 6 \x0cAbstract There are cryptocurrency exchanges based on market economy principles for the exchange of various cryptocurrencies Many exchanges such as Binance Bittrex Okex or others offer their users the ability to trade a large number of cryptocurrency pairs which enables traders to use different trading strategies and generate profit from rate changes More and more traders have done it successfully showing a stable and high yield that reaches hundreds or even thousands of percent per year With ups and downs or main cryptocurrency Bitcoin there were a lot of opportunity to earn money But is it that easy for casual people and what are other choices Business opportunities We all know banking system and bank deposits This is counted as the safest investment but what is your usual bank deposit rate Few percent per year It is sometimes lesser than exchange inflation so just forget about potential return of investments Other options like brokers have way to high entry barrier So basically there is no choice for people than to go bank because nobody want to risk they money And what about cryptocurrency market First of all it is trustless ecosystem where you dont have familiar level of safety You can not just send them to trader and receive profit from it Secondary we all see that modern market of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile On one hand it enables successful traders to achieve very high yields On the other hand it brings great risks to all market participants and especially to beginners Unlike traditional exchanges such as Forex in cryptocurrency trading one can easily lose a significant portion of their assets in one day even without leverage 7 \x0cAbstract The difference But imagine the system which will empower you with abilities to earn on cryptomarket to trade by yourself with special features or to trust money for proffessional traders with level of safety which was only available in banking system This is what Membrana Platform is about Welcome to new era of financial freedom Trust asset management Trust management of assets is an area that has always been in demand Investors are ready to entrust their assets to successful traders in order to generate income The crypto currency market is no exception and is of increasing interest to investors and traders By transferring their assets to experienced traders investors retain the possibility of obtaining exceedingly high income in the cryptocurrency market while at the same time minimize the risks of significant loss common to inexperienced players However at the moment there is no convenient and safe tool on the market for the conclusion of contracts between investors and traders for the trust management of cryptocurrencies Regardless such contracts are active in words forums and chats which leave the marketplace ripe for fraudulent acts such as when traders disappear with investors\xe2\x80\x99 fund Membrana blockchain platform Membrana blockchain platform is multi level platform which provides various tools for working with financial markets First of all it is intended to bring investors and traders together for concluding mutually beneficial blockchain protected contracts for the trust management of cryptocurrency assets Membrana provides investors and traders with a transparent decentralized and secure system which controls the process of concluding and executing a contract up to the point of revenue gained by both parties Secondary Membrana provides tools for efficient trading on multiple exchange from one terminal Advanced UI/UX conditional orders Analyzer algo trading and algo builder crowd predictions messenger notifications and many other these tools can be found and used on Membrana platform 8 \x0cConcept CONCEPT Users of Membrana Traders A trader is a participant in the market of cryptocurrencies trading on the exchange and who is potentially willing to receive digital assets in trust management for remuneration paid in the event of profitable transactions involving an increase of an investor\xe2\x80\x99s assets A trader is interested in being a notable investor and possessing all tools for trading on different cryptocurrency exchanges \xe2\x80\x94 both at their own expense and with the funds transferred to them for management Investors An investor is a participant in cryptocurrency market with digital assets who is potentially willing to transfer these assets to a successful trader in trust management for the purpose of making a positive return on their investment Investors are interested in fund safety and obtaining complete and reliable information from traders 9 \x0cConcept Current task The main objective of the Membrana platform is to directly connect an investor and a trader to conclude a mutually beneficial secure and reliable contract To avoid risks for both the investor and trader and to make trust management transactions more profitable and safe Membrana has developed a unique algorithm to solve the following problems \xe2\x80\xa2 The need for involvement of an intermediate party guaranteeing the safety of funds and the fulfillment of contract terms \xe2\x80\xa2 Loss of control over invested fund (transfer of fund to a third party) \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of trust between both parties \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of opportunity to check the exact yield of a trader in the past \xe2\x80\xa2 Risk of violation of contractual terms \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of a convenient tool for trading on different exchanges at the same time Opportunities for traders The Membrana platform offers traders the following opportunities \xe2\x80\xa2 Trading on different cryptocurrency exchanges through a single interface \xe2\x80\xa2 Trading from both of their exchange accounts and accounts transferred to traders in trust management by investors \xe2\x80\xa2 Offering their services on trust management to potential investors Setting parameters for future 10 \x0cConcept contracts such as contract duration target profit and remuneration amount \xe2\x80\xa2 Conclusion of contracts for trust management of cryptocurrency assets with investors \xe2\x80\xa2 Fixing the terms of concluded contracts with blockchain Ethereum Smart Contract technology to guarantee the completion of these conditions Opportunities for investors The Membrana platform offers investors the following opportunities \xe2\x80\xa2 Choosing suitable traders based on complete and definitive information of traders who offer their services on trust management \xe2\x80\xa2 Getting reliable data on past profitability of traders\xe2\x80\x99 commercial activities confirmed by a hash sum of transactions saved in blockchain \xe2\x80\xa2 Concluding a contract with a trader for the trust management of cryptocurrency assets located on various cryptocurrency exchanges in an investor\xe2\x80\x99s account \xe2\x80\xa2 Transferring own funds to the trust management by traders without transferring these funds directly to them Membrana platform allows an investor to give traders an opportunity to manage funds but not possessing the funds Traders get the opportunity to trade with the investors\xe2\x80\x99 exchange accounts but they do not own these funds Also investors do not transfer their funds to Membrana platform \xe2\x80\xa2 Transfer of funds for management from one exchange account to several traders indicating the amounts transferred for management in each currency \xe2\x80\xa2 Setting restrictions on trading with an exchange account transferred to trust management such as a set of allowed trading currencies and maximum trading loss (stop loss) \xe2\x80\xa2 Obtaining information on the progress of the execution of concluded contracts 11 \x0cConcept Membrana technology Safe transfer of funds in trust management For the purpose of transfer of an investor\xe2\x80\x99s exchange account to a trader in trust management an API key provided by the exchange is used The API key is not transferred to the trader but stored on Membrana\xe2\x80\x99s platform in a secure database The trader trades on an exchange via the Membrana single trading terminal Consequently the trader does not have access to the investor\xe2\x80\x99s assets All investors\xe2\x80\x99 funds remain on their exchange account and are not transferred to the trader Membrana also maintains the restrictions set at the contracting stage stop loss time period for trading by the API key etc Contract between Investors and traders To conclude the transaction between investors and traders an Ethereum Smart Contract is used Traders\xe2\x80\x99 consideration is reserved in a Smart Contract in advance and it is automatically paid upon reaching the target profit set in a percent of the amount transferred in trust management or upon expiration of the Smart Contract term 12 \x0cConcept Confirmation of past trader\xe2\x80\x99s profitability using blockchain All contracts concluded by traders via the Membrana platform will be saved to the database This information is further used to calculate traders\xe2\x80\x99 success using indicators such as ROI rating etc These indicators will be provided to investors giving them a greater ability to select suitable traders The Membrana platform uses blockchain to validate traders\xe2\x80\x99 details To do this the hash sum of traders\xe2\x80\x99 transactions for the day is saved in the blockchain Ethereum Smart Contract The block where the hash sum is saved is dated and cannot be counterfeited therefore the validity of all data on traders\xe2\x80\x99 transactions of exchange is confirmed by their hash sum in the blockchain\xe2\x80\x94in the block dated with the respective date of transaction Thus it is impossible to save only profitable transactions in the database and their hash sum externally as far as at the moment of saving because it is not known which transactions are profitable Distribution of investor\xe2\x80\x99s assets among several independent traders The Membrana platform allows the investor to transfer to trader only part of his funds in the exchange account as is stated in the contract terms The remaining funds remain under the investor\xe2\x80\x99s full control and can be used for independent trading transfer of these funds to another trader or withdrawal from an exchange account Trade in cryptocurrencies is actually carried out from one exchange account by different traders or by the investor himself In spite of this the Membrana platform provides isolated and independent trading within the amounts transferred to trust management for each trader and the investor himself At the time of the conclusion of the contract the investor determines the amount transferred from trust management in the accounting currency to be used Fees for using Membrana Membrana\xe2\x80\x99s fee is 0 5% of the amount is transferred into trust management For more detailed information refer to the Membrana Business Overview 13 \x0cConcept Advantages of Membrana For traders \xe2\x80\xa2 Possibility to attract

platform via mobile phone \xe2\x80\xa2 User friendly interface for working with several contracts and traders For cryptocurrency trading ecosystem \xe2\x80\xa2 Additional possibilities for investments \xe2\x80\xa2 Inflow of assets on the market from new investors \xe2\x80\xa2 Increased number and volume of transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges \xe2\x80\xa2 Relaxation in requirements for entering cryptocurrency trading it is sufficient to just select traders and transfer assets to them \xe2\x80\xa2 Increase in traders\xe2\x80\x99 income and their quantity \xe2\x80\xa2 Improvement of trust management reputation on cryptocurrency market 14 \x0cTechnologies Used TECHNOLOGIES USED Ethereum smart contract To conclude a transaction for trust management between investors and traders the Ethereum Smart Contract is used A Smart Contract contains all of the details of the agreement On the Smart Contract account an investor reserves a trader\xe2\x80\x99s consideration in advance in the amount to be paid upon reaching the target profit The consideration is automatically paid to the trader upon the expiration of contract term and the receipt of income by the trader The contract may be terminated ahead of time if the target profit is received by the trader or if the investor undertakes a prohibited action Examples of a prohibited action include an investor withdrawing money from the exchange account or carrying out a transaction on this account without express permission To get information on the current state of the exchange account Smart Contract uses oracles as described below Exchange API Most cryptocurrency exchanges provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for automatic transactions The API is accessed by a certain exchange account using an API key which is obtained by the account owner for use on the exchange website The Membrana platform provides traders with the single trading terminal to carry out transactions on any supported exchange Membrana translates each transaction 15 \x0cTechnologies Used via the exchange API using API keys owned by the trader or transferred to traders in trust management API keys are stored in a protected database within the Membrana platform Fund security for investors The technology implemented on the Membrana platform provides fund security for investors funds are transferred to traders in trust management The funds are not directly transferred to traders under any circumstances nor do traders have access to investors\xe2\x80\x99 API keys API keys are stored on the Membrana platform in a secure database Traders carry out transactions via the single trading terminal on Membrana platform Each trust management contract has specific currency restrictions which are available for trading thus it is impossible for traders to utilize investors\xe2\x80\x99 funds for a dummy currency Protection of investor\xe2\x80\x99s API Keys Security of original API keys is ensured by a backend system The backend system manages the functionality of the personal account and trading terminal and does not allow access to the server that directly interacts with the exchange The trading system is in an isolated environment and access to transactions via this system is possible only by a signature authorization session using the ECDSA algorithm The main concern which we are working on is RAM only fault tolerant system which has no access into security perimeter at all Not even SSH It\xe2\x80\x99s fully locked and has only one opened port with encrypted connection to sign transactions It uses only limited set of software to lower attack possibilities and potential vulnerabilities To encrypt connection we are going to use ChaCha20 Poly1305 aead encryption recommended by Google It also means that no key would be written on a hard drive and any transaction received by key service will be encrypted and verified with elliptic curve signature from our internal services 16 \x0cTechnologies Used Also we will accept strongest recommendations of secure and reliable development and will sign our code with GPG signatures and use 2046 bit public SSH keys to deploy services Oracles An oracle is a software component providing data to Ethereum from the external world These data can be further used by Smart Contracts On the Membrana platform oracles are used by the backend system to obtain and record information in blockchain data on the currency balance in the exchange account transactions of certain exchange accounts cryptocurrency exchange rates and transactions of certain traders MetaMask User authorization on the Membrana platform is executed using MetaMask MetaMask is a plug in for web browsers (currently supported by Chrome and Firefox) enabling users to carry out blockchain transactions in Ethereum via a JavaScript web3 object without a private key The Membrana platform uses web3 to work with the Smart Contract Mobile browsers that support authorization in Ethereum Using modern technologies to create a user interface allows the Membrana platform interface to work on both desktop browsers and mobile devices in browsers that support Ethereum authorization such as Cipher and Toshi The Membrana website is also adapted for mobile devices 17 \x0cTechnologies Used Stack of web technologies The interaction of users with Membrana system takes place via website The site is based on SPA (Single Page Application) technology The following technology stack is used \xe2\x80\xa2 MongoDB \xe2\x80\xa2 Node JS \xe2\x80\xa2 Web3 \xe2\x80\xa2 RabbitMQ \xe2\x80\xa2 Redux \xe2\x80\xa2 React JS 18 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation ALGORITHM OF MEMBRANA SYSTEM OPERATION Authorization In a desktop browser the user installs the MetaMask plug in for the Internet browser and logs into Ethereum using MetaMask On mobile devices the user installs a browser which supports the authorization in the blockchain Ethereum network Cipher or Toshi browsers are available at this time The authorization occurs through browser\xe2\x80\x99s interface Addition the API Key A user logs into the cryptocurrency exchange website and requests an API key for automatic transactions In addition there is an option for adding the API key to be used on membrana io website wherein the key itself and its name are entered for a better understanding of the key assignment For example \xe2\x80\x9ckey for investments\xe2\x80\x9d If this key is passed to the trader for trust management then the added API key enables the user to limit the number of currencies available for trading while at the same time ensuring that USD BTC and ETH (the designated currencies) are readily accessible Such limits protect an investor from a trader buying illiquid fraudulent or other undesirable currencies with the investor\xe2\x80\x99s funds After adding the API key to Membrana the possibility of self trading through this key emerges via the single trading terminal (for traders) It also becomes possible to use this API key to conclude contracts for trust management of funds on the exchange account to which this key belongs (for investors) For one exchange account only one API key may be added into Membrana system 19 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation Trust management offer from traders A trader who is willing to receive funds in trust management sets the parameters of the contract with an investor \xe2\x80\xa2 Accounting currency BTC ETH or USD will be used for transferring to the trader calculating profit according to the contract and the payouts between the parties \xe2\x80\xa2 Target profit to close out the contract as a percentage of the amount transferred into trust management \xe2\x80\xa2 The minimum investment amount and in which accounting currency \xe2\x80\xa2 Contract term \xe2\x80\xa2 Stop loss the maximum allowable loss (as a percentage of the initial amount of assets) \xe2\x80\xa2 Amount of trader\xe2\x80\x99s commission (as a percentage of the target profit) Trader selection by investors An investor who is willing to transfer funds into a trust management looks through the list of active offers from traders in a convenient way with the exclusion of unsuitable options and the help of various filters \xe2\x80\x94 such as trader\xe2\x80\x99s reputation profitability contract amount contract duration etc While viewing the trader\xe2\x80\x99s profile one can see the history of his trades made through the Membrana platform This trading history allows an investor to make an analysis of the trader\xe2\x80\x99s success The reliability of this data is confirmed by the hash sum (sha256) stored in the Ethereum block Any user has the opportunity to check the data of the trader\xe2\x80\x99s transactions by taking transactions for any week in the past counting their sha256 amount (available on a number of websites) and comparing it to the one recorded on the address of a special smart contract of the Membrana platform which is published on websites such as etherscan io 20 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation Conclusion of a contract Having chosen a suitable offer the investor sends an application to the trader for the conclusion of a contract To manage this account the investor must have an account on the cryptocurrency exchange and an API key added to the Membrana platform The investor sets the amount transferred for management in the accounting currency even if the investor has other currencies in the exchange account However the accounting currency must be on the investor\xe2\x80\x99s account and must be greater than or equal to the amount transferred for management The Membrana platform provides the type of distribution in which the trader can only trade the amount transferred in the specified accounting currency All other funds remain under the full control of the investor The trader then accepts the application The concluded contract is recorded in the Ethereum Smart Contract The maximum commission is transferred from the investor\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum wallet to the Smart Contract and is reserved there for payment to the trader in the future Traders\xe2\x80\x99 rating Each trader who uses the Membrana platform participates in a traders\xe2\x80\x99 rating The rating system is based on a comprehensive analysis of the trader\xe2\x80\x99s past results Such parameters include the trader\xe2\x80\x99s ROI the number of contracts awarded the number of profitable contracts the total amount of funds which is currently under management and/or has been managed in the past 21 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation The traders\xe2\x80\x99 rating is \xe2\x80\xa2 A convenient tool used for finding a trader \xe2\x80\xa2 A convenient tool used for assessing the performance of a particular trader \xe2\x80\xa2 A motivating factor for traders \xe2\x80\xa2 An indicator of the successful performance of the Membrana platform Termination of contract The contract between the trader and investor can be terminated for a variety reasons Achievement of the target profit The contract is automatically completed if the target profit recorded at the time of the transaction conclusion is achieved The reserved trader\xe2\x80\x99s payout is then paid in full Expiration of a Contract When the contract expires it is completed creating two options Option 1 The trader\xe2\x80\x99s trading result is negative In this case the trader\xe2\x80\x99s payout reserved in the Smart Contract is not paid to the trader it is returned to the investor in full Option 2 The trader\xe2\x80\x99s trading result is positive In this case the trader gets paid in accordance with the terms of the contract The trader\xe2\x80\x99s payout is calculated as the ratio of actual profit to a target profit Any unpaid portion of the payout reserve is returned to the investor 22 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation Stop Loss In order to protect the investor from large losses a stop loss value as a percentage of the initial amount in the accounting currency is fixed in the Smart Contract If the amount of funds decreases to a certain value as a result of transactions made by the trader the contract is automatically completed Thus the consideration is not paid to the trader and is returned to the investor\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum wallet All currencies purchased by trader are automatically exchanged for the accounting currency at the exchange rate When calculating a stop loss the amount of orders on the exchange for the purchase of such currencies is taken into account The most profitable bid for buying a currency may have insufficient volume thus the next bid is taken and so forth Prohibited investor action The investor is not allowed to withdraw money from the exchange account in an amount exceeding the amount of money transferred for management by traders Similarly an investor is not allowed to make transactions from an exchange account for an amount exceeding available funds If there are insufficient funds for a transaction the Oracle notifies the Smart Contract and the transaction is automatically terminated however the investor forfeits the reserved commission which is paid to the trader in full Examples of some prohibited Investor actions include Example 1 The investor has 10 BTC in his exchange account Out of these 10 the investor transferred 3 BTC to the trader for management Then the investor withdrew 8 BTC from his exchange account This is a prohibited action because the 3 BTC are now unavailable to a trader for trading under the terms of the contract Therefore the violation causes the automatic cancellation of the contract and the trader receives his payout in full 23 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation Example 2 The investor has 10 BTC in the exchange account Out of these 10 the investor transfers 3 BTC to the trader for management Then the investor exchanged 9 BTC for 90 ETH through the exchange interface Since this creates a shortage in the amount of the designated accounting currency it is a prohibited action by the investor Therefore the violation causes the automatic cancellation of the contract and the trader receives his payout in full The following is an example of an allowable transaction Example 3 The investor has 10 BTC in the exchange account Out of these 10 he transfers 3 BTC to the trader for management Then the investor withdraws 7 BTC from his account and purchases a car This is allowed because 3 BTC are still available to the trader for trading under the contract Early termination of the contract The investor has the opportunity to terminate the contract immediately if the current financial result under this contract is negative At the same time all active applications under the contract will be canceled All currencies that are not included in the list of desired ones are converted to the accounting currency at the exchange price 24 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation Payouts between investors and traders When concluding a transaction for trust management the currency of settlement is fixed There is an option to choose among BTC ETH or USD To make any settlement under the contract for example the calculation of profit or loss achieved and all currencies on the investor\xe2\x80\x99s exchange account are converted into the accounting currency at the exchange price at the time of settlement Concurrently the volume of applications on the exchange for the purchase of these currencies is taken into account At the moment of termination of a contract irrespective of reason all currencies purchased by the trader are exchanged for payout at the exchange price Often there can be a situation in which the trader receives a profit exceeding the target This is due to the possibility that the timing of the last transaction and the exact hit on the value of the target profit is different In this case as well as when the target profit is achieved the contract is closed and the investor is invoiced to pay for the trader\xe2\x80\x99s services while receiving additional profit The amount of this additional consideration is defined in the contract as a percentage of the profit received 25 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation Example of a contract between an investor and a trader Trader Bob has been trading on cryptocurrency exchanges for a long time earned a lot of money and feels confident enough to manage other people\xe2\x80\x99s money in order to get revenue from his trading Bob visits the Membrana website and sets up the contract parameters that suit him \xe2\x80\xa2 Accounting currency BTC \xe2\x80\xa2 The minimum volume is 12 BTC \xe2\x80\xa2 Target profit 20% \xe2\x80\xa2 Max loss 10% \xe2\x80\xa2 Terms of the contract 30 days \xe2\x80\xa2 Commission 30% Investor Alice has an account on the Bittrex exchange This account has currencies of 10 BTC and 50 ETH Alice plans to transfer some of these funds to the trust management of an experienced trader In traders\xe2\x80\x99 ratings on the Membrana website Alice finds Bob and in his profile she reads the conditions on which Bob is ready to take money for management The first thing that Alice notes is that a minimum of 12 BTC is needed to enter into a contract however she only has 10 BTCs are on her account Alice decides to get authorized on the Membrana website through MetaMask receives the API key from her account on the Bittrex website and adds this key to the Membrana website Now Alice has the opportunity to trade her own funds through the single trading terminal on the Membrana website as well as transfer her funds to trust management Alice uses the Membrana trade terminal and exchanges 20 ETH for 2 BTC The transaction occurs instantly and she now has the necessary 12 BTCs to contract with Bob Alice sends a request to Bob to conclude a contract through the Membrana website Bob receives the request within 24 hours Alice transfers to the address of the Membrana Smart Contract the maximum amount of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s award equal contract amount (the amount * the target profit * the trader\xe2\x80\x99s reward = 12 BTC * 20% * 30% = 0 72 BTC = 7 2 ETH (conversion to BTC > ETH at the exchange price) Bob does not receive his commission but he sees that it is reserved at the address of the Membrana Smart Contract 26 \x0cAlgorithm of Membrana System Operation For the whole month Bob trades through the Membrana trade terminal with money received for management purposes At the same time the remaining funds in Alice\xe2\x80\x99s exchange account (30 ETH) are not available to him however they are available to Alice Alice removes 15 ETH from the exchange and spends them on her needs For the remaining 15 ETH Alice buys 15 000 USDT considering it a good investment Bob cannot see these changes in Alice\xe2\x80\x99s exchange account but he can continue to trade with the funds transferred to him In 20 days the Membrana platform sees that if to sell all the currencies that Bob bought at the exchange price taking into account the volume of current orders in the exchange order book for the BTC accounting currency 14 4 BTC will be received This means that the target profit of the contract (12 BTC * 120% = 14 4 BTC) has been achieved by Bob and Membrana automatically terminates the contract All currencies that Bob bought are automatically exchanged for the BTC accounting currency at the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s rate Bob\xe2\x80\x99s commission which was reserved all this time in the Smart Contract (7 2 ETH) is paid to Bob in full because the target profit of the contract is fully achieved Now Alice has 14 4 BTC and 15000 USDT on her exchange account Notes \xe2\x80\xa2 Alice had the opportunity to enter into other contracts with other traders and even with Bob himself for the amount that she had at her disposal \xe2\x80\xa2 Bob had the opportunity to contract with other investors along with Alice\xe2\x80\x99s current contract \xe2\x80\xa2 Bob had the opportunity to act as an investor himself and transfer his funds to the management of another trader but those funds should be money from an exchange account already owned by Bob 27 \x0cThe High Level Platform Architecture Beta Version THE HIGH LEVEL PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE (BETA VERSION) Frontend The frontend subsystem of the Membrana io platform which interacts with users is a dynamic web page created using React technology The Internet browser uses MetaMask plug in allowing users to make transactions

the Ethereum network such as Cipher and Toshi The frontend system is published on GitHub https //github com/membrana io/frontend Backend The server part of the Membrana io platform is responsible for processing user requests made through the website The backend is created using Node js 28 \x0cThe High Level Platform Architecture Beta Version Database In order to store all necessary information in the system the MongoDB database is used The database interacts with the backend Ethereum blockchain The Membrana platform uses Ethereum blockchain The technology of the Smart Contract is used to consolidate all of the terms of the transactions between investors and traders for trust asset management Also in the process of initiating transactions by traders data (hash sums) on these transactions are stored in blockchain to confirm the reliability of data in the future Ethereum interacts with the platform\xe2\x80\x99s frontend All transactions are signed by a specific user\xe2\x80\x99s key In order to log onto the Membrana platform users log in with MetaMask or a special mobile browser (Cipher Toshi) Etherscan io The website etherscan io allows users to view information about Smart Contracts and blockchain wallets on the Ethereum network The address of the Smart Contract in which the transactions between the investor and the trader within the Membrana platform take place is public Anyone has the opportunity to see the following information on the website www etherscan io \xe2\x80\xa2 Deal between investor and trader \xe2\x80\xa2 Receipt of the sum of the future commission of the trader to the address of the Smart Contract \xe2\x80\xa2 Payment of commission to the trader upon termination of the contract \xe2\x80\xa2 Refund of funds to an investor which was not used for a trader\xe2\x80\x99s payout \xe2\x80\xa2 Hash sum of transactions of a specific trader for the week confirming the reliability of information about those transactions in the Membrana system 29 \x0cThe High Level Platform Architecture Beta Version Oracles On the Membrana platform oracles are used by the backend to obtain and record in blockchain with data of transactions of a certain exchange account cryptocurrency rates and transactions of a specific trader In the Membrana platform oracles are used to obtain and record in blockchain data about transactions and balances of a specific exchange account Microservices Microservices work on Membrana servers and provide the platform with information such as exchange rates the history of transactions on exchanges the results of the completion of a specific order This approach allows a user to easily scale the system as well as ensure its stable operations For example for this purpose each micro service 30 \x0cSmart Contract Code can be duplicated on independent servers SMART CONTRACT CODE Smart Contracts for the Membrana platform can be found in the official GitHub repository https //github com/membrana io An example of the code of MembranaInstance sol (beta version) \xe2\x80\x94 the main Smart Contract is shown below The code implements the functionality of concluding and

Version) MEMBRANA PLATFORM INTERFACE (BETA VERSION) Currently the Beta version of the Membrana platform is available for open testing beta membrana io Below are the screenshots of the interfaces Single trading terminal for traders 34 \x0cMembrana Platform Interface (Beta Version) Trader\xe2\x80\x99s rating 35 \x0cMembrana Platform Interface (Beta Version) Investor\xe2\x80\x99s personal account 36 \x0cMembrana Platform Interface (Beta Version) Trader\xe2\x80\x99s profile 37 \x0cPerspective Functionality PERSPECTIVE FUNCTIONALITY API of the Membrana platform The entire functionality of the Membrana platform is presented not only in the user interface on the website but also through the API The API will allow traders to automatically trade with their own funds and/or funds received for trust management The Membrana API will give trading robots the ability to act as traders which will greatly expand the circle of potential users of the platform It also provides a great opportunity for the trading robots to raise additional funds and generate more profit Specialized news feed The trader has the opportunity to view the news feed for each currency simultaneously with the standard indicators in the trading terminal which enhances the trader\xe2\x80\x99s ability to fully analyze market conditions This information is not only based on technical indicators but also from information received from the outside world The news feed has convenient settings The trader can choose the news he is interested in and also view only relevant information impacting his cryptocurrency transactional decisions Trust management of Ethereum wallet funds The investor has the opportunity to transfer assets for trust management to the trader that are not only the funds in his exchange account but also the ETH from his own Ethereum wallet This simplifies the process of concluding a trust management contract for an investor because such things as registration on the exchange as well as the confirmation of identity and sending of funds to the exchange account are not needed Investor\xe2\x80\x99s funds within the Ethereum wallet are sent to a special Smart Contract of 38 \x0cPerspective Functionality Membrana platform and are reserved there until the end of the contract period The Membrana platform transfers to the trader his own funds on the exchange account for trading Upon termination of the contract the investor\xe2\x80\x99s funds are returned to the Ethereum wallet in ETH along with any profit The trader also receives his reward ETH This approach also gives an opportunity for a trader to trade investors\xe2\x80\x99 money on any supported exchange as the Membrana platform has funds on all exchanges Contracts with compensation of possible losses by the trader To increase the degree of trust between the investor and the trader the Membrana platform gives the trader the opportunity to deposit funds in advance for use for partial compensation of an investor\xe2\x80\x99s possible losses If upon the completion of the contract the result of the trader\xe2\x80\x99s trade is negative these funds will be transferred to the investor Even if compensation for the investor\xe2\x80\x99s loss is a small part of total loss this approach greatly increases the trader\xe2\x80\x99s interest in successful trading and builds investors\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in their respective traders Example Trader Alice is ready to take 10 BTC under control for a period of 30 days with a target profit of 20% and a maximum loss of 10% To increase the investor\xe2\x80\x99s confidence and interest of the proposal Alice is ready to compensate for 30% of the possible loss Investor Bob makes a deal with Alice and Alice accepts 10 BTC for management After 20 days the contract gets terminated earlier due to reaching maximum loss of 10% Investor Bob lost 10 BTC * 10% = 1 BTC Bob receives 1 BTC * 30% = 0 3 BTC as a compensation for loss from Alice\xe2\x80\x99s funds which were reserved at the time of the contract Thus Alice participated in assuming part of the loss from the unsuccessfully terminated contract 39 \x0cPerspective Functionality Conditional exchange orders The Membrana platform allows the trader to place conditional orders on the exchanges Conditional orders are placed on the exchange when certain predetermined conditions are satisfied such as the current price trading volume and/or other market parameters Manager contract contract between investor and portfolio manager The investor has the opportunity to delegate the task of choosing a successful trader to another more experienced investor That is why a special type of experienced investor \xe2\x80\x93 manager contract can be created An experienced investor gets the opportunity to make deals with traders on behalf of his customer by transferring the customer\xe2\x80\x99s funds to traders for management In such cases the experienced investor will receive a commission The economy of the Membrana token The Membrana platform has its own Ethereum token \xe2\x80\x93 MBR MBR refers to the type of utility token involved in the platform functionality Membrana users get access to the main system functions for free The main functions include trading through a single terminal on any supported exchange finding a suitable investor or trader concluding a contract between the investor and the trader and contract support until its termination Additional functions are available only to users who have a corresponding number of tokens in their wallet In this case users do not spend their tokens only hold them in their account You can read more details about the tokens economy in the Business Overview 40 \x0cPerspective Functionality Order for several contracts Trader can have several trust management contracts with different investors At some point trader can place the same order for all the contracts For example from traders point of view it is necessary to buy a bitcoin for all the contracts For this Membrana platform has a special feature of automatic order placing for several contracts Also trader can select particular contracts from the list for which to place an order and to specify the order parameters 41 \x0cProject Roadmap PROJECT ROADMAP Below you can read Membrana io project roadmap Q1 2017 Concept development This quarter
