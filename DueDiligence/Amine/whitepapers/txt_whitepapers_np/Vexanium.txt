 1 Introduction 
 Blockchains have demonstrated great promise of util ity over several fields 
 including Decentralized Application Internet of Things(IoT) finance 
 governance identity management web decentralisation and asset tracking 
 However despite the technological promise and grand talk we have yet to 
 seesignificant real world deployment of present technology 
 
 Blockchain 1 0 provided the underlying technology for the first cryptocurrency 
 Bitcoin by Pseudonymous Person Name Sathosi Nakamoto which was 
 issued in 2009 Six years later in mid 2015 Ethereum was launched making 
 use of an improved blockchain architecture and promising a faster and lighter 
 
 
 proof of stake protocol for validating transactions Thus blockchain 2 0 was 
 born 
 
 The first two iterations of this innovative technology promised to be scalable 
 interoperable sustainable secure cost effective and governed transparently 
 and publicly So far not all of these promises have been kept Though bitcoin 
 was the first and has always promoted itself as an effective payment system 
 it is overly energy intensive and slow Users often find it to be prohibitively 
 complicated and it often simply wont meet their needs Ethereum which 
 offered the first smart contracts to its users and eventually the concept of a 
 streamlined proof of stake protocol for validating transactions has its own 
 problems It is somewhat vulnerable to outside interference and is sometimes 
 considered to be an expensive and impractical solution This has opened the 
 door to new and further improved implementations of blockchain 
 
 The problems that have faced Blockchain 1 0 and 2 0 iterations are well 
 established and have been limiting factors to their mainstream adoption and 
 acceptance for their true potential Primarily these problems stem from limited 
 functionality in the following areas 
 
 Scalability 
 Interoperability 
 Governance 
 Privacy 
 Sustainability 
 Adoption & Familiarity 
 
 Vexanium The Rise of Blockchain 3 0 
 
 While these problems facing the industry are well established there is no 
 shortage of innovative solutions being applied to them The rise of Blockchain 
 
 3 0 technology is here and with it a new wave of innovations and 
 decentralized applications will become part of the vital architecture to the Web 
 3 0 
 
 Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm developed to 
 secure a blockchain by ensuring representation of transactions within it DPoS 
 is designed as an implementation of technology based democracy using 
 voting and election process to protect blockchain from centralization and 
 malicious usage Delegated Proof of Stake was developed by Daniel Larimer 
 American software developer cryptocurrency entrepreneur and a founder of 
 BitShares Steemit and EOS Daniel invented DPoS as an alternative to 
 energy inefficient consensus of Proof of Work blockchains and Proof of Stake 
 consensus that is poorly protected from malicious intentions of stakeholders 
 First implementation of DPoS was executed in cryptocurrency called 
 BitShares DPoS was also planned to be more scalable alternative to classic 
 consensus algorithms As every block is validated in avoidance of the need to 
 use a lot of energy progressing amount of computing power and other 
 resources all transactions can be performed relatively fast on every stage of 
 networks development Famous examples of cryptocurrencies that use DPoS 
 include Lisk Steem EOS BitShares and now Vexanium 
 
 Vexanium shares Daniel Larimie s values about DPOS and their technical 
 expectations that blockchain will revolutionise the real world vexanium core 
 developer will fully dedicate to participate to build up blockchain ecosystem 
 
 Consensus Algorithm (BFT DPOS) 
 
 Vexanium software enables blocks to be produced exactly every 0 5 second 
 and exactly one producer is authorized to produce a block at any given point 
 in time If the block is not produced at the scheduled time then the block for 
 that time slot is skipped When one or more blocks are skipped there is a 0 5 
 or more second gap in the blockchain 
 
 blocks are produced in rounds of 126 (6 blocks each times 21 producers) At 
 the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen by preference 
 
 
 of votes cast by token holders The selected producers are scheduled in an 
 order agreed upon by 15 or more producers 
 
 If a producer misses a block and has not produced any block within the last 
 24 hours they are removed from consideration until they notify the blockchain 
 of their intention to start producing blocks again This ensures the network 
 operates smoothly by minimizing the number of blocks missed by not 
 scheduling producers who are proven to be unreliable 
 
 Under normal conditions a DPOS blockchain does not experience any forks 
 because rather than compete the block producers cooperate to produce 
 blocks In the event there is a fork consensus will automatically switch to the 
 longest chain This method works because the rate at which blocks are added 
 to a blockchain fork is directly correlated to the percentage of block producers 
 that share the same consensus In other words a blockchain fork with more 
 producers on it will grow in length faster than one with fewer producers 
 because the fork with more producers will experience fewer missed blocks 
 
 Furthermore no block producer should be producing blocks on two forks at 
 the same time A block producer caught doing this will likely be voted out 
 Cryptographic evidence of such double production may also be used to 
 automatically remove abusers 
 
 Byzantine Fault Tolerance is added to traditional DPOS by allowing all 
 producers to sign all blocks so long as no producer signs two blocks with the 
 same timestamp or the same block height Once 15 producers have signed a 
 block the block is deemed irreversible Any byzantine producer would have to 
 generate cryptographic evidence of their treason by signing two blocks with 
 the same timestamp or blockheight Under this model a irreversible 
 consensus should be reachable within 1 second

 2 2 VEXANIUM Solution 
 Application developer builds their work in aggregator state that 
 centralized such as Amazon Facebook Twitter Google or Twitter where the 
 bigger the platform the more competitive them with developer application that 
 builds their work on the state One of the reasons they build their work in 
 aggregator state is because the current HTTP protocol cant store state/data 
 that comes through HTTP With blockchain as innovation in protocol level 
 makes the original data can be stored in the protocol level and also can be 
 sent through digitally in the protocol In other hands the uniqueness of 
 blockchain itself is the ability to transfer value easily and efficiently which 
 makes this uniqueness is at the heart of economic development and modern 
 finance 
 
 Mainnet is the foundation for a blockchain based company to maintain 
 its company in a decentralized system The launch of mainnet is important for 
 a blockchain based company to prove the company s capabilities from only a 
 project idea to a real problem solving project that can be implemented in real 
 life A blockchain based company that has its own mainnet can help a lot of 
 blockchain project to realize their idea 
 
 Vexanium itself aims to become the first Indonesia public blockchain / 
 mainnet that focuses on Mass Adoption By launching its own mainnet 
 Vexanium also enables every blockchain company to operate on the network 
 Besides that Vexanium also opens an opportunity for blockchain company in 
 another country that want to expand their market in Indonesia

 2 2 1 Several Application that already Build on Vexanium Ecosystem 
 VEXGIFT Leading Crypto Reward and Staking App 
 
 VexGift is First Ecosystem that Build by Vexanium team that have 
 purpose to acquire more user into Vexanum platform Vexgift is a blockchainbased 
 application Airdrop and Reward system to distribute free vouchers and 
 digital assets to the user in less than 1 year vexgift itself have around 50 000 
 crypto investor join in the application and already separated their own entity 
 Although this application is designed for cryptocurrency investors non crypto 
 investors user still can use this application VexGift has collaborated with 
 many merchants such as Amazon KFC GO JEK FlowerAdvisor and many 
 more 
 
 Main features 
 
 a Gift Voucher Distribute free vouchers to the user Right now VexGift 
 already distributes these vouchers KFC GO JEK Amazon FlowerAdvisor 
 Gramedia and many more 
 b Token Airdrop Distribute digital assets to the user VexGift already 
 collaborating with Tokenomy Lyfe eSports Ecosystem and Heluss 
 c Token Sale Sale token efficiently to the right market VexGift user 
 majority is a real crypto investor 
 d Deposit Program Store token to maintain value on the market Users 
 can deposit their token for a certain period of time 
 e P2P Voucher Exchange Exchange vouchers from your friends freely 
 You can give and get vouchers on VexGift application 
 VexGift Program 
 
 1 Deposit Stacking 
 Deposit Stacking is a VEX stacking program that is quite similar like 
 Deposit Program On this deposit stacking program you store the VEX 
 amount that you have in wallet provided by Vexanium After you hold 
 some amount of VEX in the wallet then you will get some amount of 
 VEX bonus according to your ranking in this deposit stacking program 
 (ranking will be explained in the next explanation) 
 Formula for Bonus Calculation

 M = Ranking 
 Bonus = Amount of bonuses distributed in the VEX Stacking Campaign 
 
 2 Referral Stacking 
 Referral stacking is another program on VEX Stacking Campaign So if 
 you already joined the deposit stacking program you can join this 
 program by inviting other people to join deposit stacking By doing this 
 you will get an additional VEX bonus The more people you invite the 
 more VEX you get 
 Formula for Bonus Calculation 
 
 AXi=2v + (P1+P2+P3+ +Pn Pmax) 
 
 
 AXi = The calculation amount of user referral 
 Pmax = The highest VEX amount on user referral

 2 2 2 VEXWALLET 
 VexWallet itself is a decentralized wallet that runs on Vexanium blockchain 
 
 where every asset and user account is users own responsibility and no other 
 
 parties that have users access except the user itself 
 
 VexWallet have PC ( Win MAC ) version and Mobile ( IOS / Android Version) 
 
 There are some basic features in VEX Wallet such as store VEX transfer 
 
 VEX and buy or sell RAM CPU and NET to do transactions in Vexanium 
 
 Blockchain VEX Wallet allows users to manage their VEX and use all of the 
 
 Vexanium decentralized applications (Dapp ) using one platform 
 
 
 VEXplorer 
 
 VEXplorer is a blockchain browser allowing users to perform searches API 
 and analysis of the VEXANIUM blockchain Each transaction each block 
 generated and the smart contracts that had already been entered into will be 
 shown at real time in VEXplorer 
 
 Block Producers (BPs) are a decentralized entity (organization) usually 
 consisting of a group companies or organizations selected through the evoting 
 blockchain system in the DPoS Consensus that regulates Vexanium 
 blockchain The block producers task will produce new blocks in the 
 Vexanium protocol blockchain and verifying various transactions that occur on 
 the Vexanium protocol blockchain 
 
 Delegated Proof of Stakes (DPoS) is a consensus mechanism that regulates 
 Vexanium blockchain where only the organization board (delegate/delegation) 
 is selected through e voting can verify the transactions 
 
 These block producers have basic functions like a miner on the bitcoin 
 blockchain (POW / Proof of Work) system but block producers have several 
 additional functions and some new functions such as the Board of 
 Representatives as a country that can regulate and direct the rules and give 
 direction for the Vexanium blockchain 
 
 
 3 Project Roadmap 
 Phase 0 Project Initiation and Token Sales (Q1/Q2 2018) 
 
 Phase 1 Launch of VEXGIFT in Indonesia (Q3/Q4 2018) 
 
 During Phase 1 VEXGIFT will be fully functional and open to 
 merchants and individual users in Purpose of Vexgift is on Users and 
 token Holder Acquititions so it educate new people to staking concept 
 and basic of cryptocurrency in Indonesia Merchants and enterprise 
 users can create voucher tokens and start their marketing campaigns 
 all seamlessly via the one stop mobile app Customers will be able to 
 store and redeem their voucher tokens via VEXGFITApp 
 
 Phase 2 Establishment of VEXANIUM MAINET Ecosystem (Q1Q2 2019) 
 
 In Phase 2 VEXANIUM will complete the establishment of the 
 ecosystem by launching Vexanium own Blockchain (Mainet) Vexanium 
 Mainnet itself opens an opportunity for Indonesia blockchain company 
 that want to expand their market in Indonesia and for blockchain 
 company in another country that want to expand their market in 
 Indonesia 
 
 Phase 3 Business Mainet Expansion across (Q3 2019) 
 
 In this Phase we expect that VEXANIUM will focus on Indonesian 
 Market as Indonesian Public Blockchain and help a lot of business 
 doing tokenization and educate about 
 
 
 Phase 4 Business Expansion to Asia (Q1 2020) 
 
 In this Phase we expect that VEXANIUM will already have proven its 
 successful business model and gained significant traction in its home 
 market We will then expand to major cities or business hubs including 
 Kuala Lumpur Ho Chi Min City Seoul Hong Kong Bangkok Dubai 
 and Singapore 
 
 Phase 5 Business Expansion to Outside Asia (Q3 2020) 
 In this period vexanium will focus and try to engage to market outside 
 asia such as European countries South American Countries Africa 
 where the most poplated countries in the world that support 
 cryptocurrency 
 
 
 4 VEX Token Model and Resource Usage 
 Vexanium Blockchain using Resource Model or Blockchain As a Services 
 Model rather using Transactional Model because traditionally it is the 
 business that pays for office space computational power and other costs 
 required to run the business The customer buys specific products from the 
 business and the revenue from those product sales is used to cover the 
 business costs of operation Similarly no website obligates its visitors to make 
 micropayments for visiting its website to cover hosting costs Therefore 
 decentralized applications should not force its customers to pay the 
 blockchain directly for the use of the blockchain 
 
 All blockchains are resource constrained and require a system to prevent 
 abuse With a blockchain that uses VEXANIUM software there are three 
 broad classes of resources that are consumed by applications 
 
 Bandwidth and Log Storage (Disk) 
 
 Computation and Computational Backlog (CPU) and 
 
 State Storage (RAM) 
 
 Bandwidth and computation have two components instantaneous usage and 
 long term usage A blockchain maintains a log of all Actions and this log is 
 ultimately stored and downloaded by all full nodes With the log of Actions it 
 is possible to reconstruct the state of all applications 
 
 
 5 Business Operations 
 5 1 Business and Revenue Model 
 VEXANIUMs income will come from several major streams in the VEXANIUM 
 Ecosystem 
 
 (1) Service Fees from Merchant Token Generation 
 Merchants will be paying an amount of VEX as a service fee based on the 
 quantity and value of the VEXM generated 
 
 (2) Service Fees of Airdrop Campaigns 
 Merchants will be paying an amount of VEX as a service fee based on the 
 quantity and value of the VEXM being distributed to the target audiences 
 
 (3) Trading Fees in VEXchange 
 (4) Advertising Fees in VEXplorer 
 5 2 Sustainability 
 Sustainable Token Economy 
 
 VEXANIUMs income of VEX tokens will be locked up for two years to ensure 
 a reasonable and effective circulation Such a mechanism will also ensure the 
 sustainability of the VEX token economy and VEXANIUM operation
