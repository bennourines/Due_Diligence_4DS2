Summary 3 \x0c1 Executive Summary Data is the fuel that drives the cryptocurrency economy In an industry formed around virtual currencies that are created and traded in digital form participants are dependant upon accurate real time data from an array of sources The binary and hexadecimal data that constitutes wallet addresses private keys and blockchain headers as well as that pertaining to network hashrate coin velocity UTXOs and a host of other metrics is ripe for analysis The data derived from public blockchains is immensely valuable to entities that operate in multiple industry verticals Valuable insights can be extrapolated from processed data and used to determine trading decisions fee estimation investment strategies and to gauge everything from market cycles to the behavior of major ecosystem players such as cryptocurrency exchanges and so called \xe2\x80\x9cwhales\xe2\x80\x9d As the quality and scope of crypto analytical tools has increased so has the role played by data as a driver of key business strategies Not every area of the cryptoconomy has been served by the growth in analytical services with one sector in particular starved of high quality data driven insights \xe2\x80\x92 the mining industry The tools available to cryptocurrency miners are largely unre\xef\xac\x81ned supplying little more than generic information regarding network hashrate coin pro\xef\xac\x81tability and hardware performance The most valuable data of all \xe2\x80\x92 the sort that has the potential to eke out greater e\xef\xac\x83ciencies and to ease loss making mining operations into pro\xef\xac\x81t \xe2\x80\x92 lies deeper below the surface Extracting this data and drawing actionable outcomes from it is a complex but lucrative task that has proven beyond the reach of mining service providers MineBee intends to change that Through the use of big data accrued with the aid of its mining rig management partners MineBee will deliver valuable insights that will be licensed as technology support From overclocking to temperature regulation and from coin selection to hardware optimization MineBee will help to re\xef\xac\x81ne every last facet of the cryptocurrency mining business The result will be less downtime fewer performance related hazards greater hashrate and ultimately greater pro\xef\xac\x81ts 4 \x0c1 Executive Summary Miners who access MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s vast trove of data delivered via its industry partners will hold a signi\xef\xac\x81cant competitive edge Miners are reliant on multiple data points to maximize pro\xef\xac\x81ts while ensuring their equipment remains within safe operating parameters Modest re\xef\xac\x81nements can be the di\xef\xac\x80erence between pro\xef\xac\x81t and loss As a result access to accurate data in real time is not just desirable \xe2\x80\x92 it is essential MineBee Solution will instantly be able to tap into a large community of miners through its links to key business partners In this way MineBee will overcome the inherent challenges of building its own community and ecosystem from scratch Through focusing on B2B licensing MineBee will quickly begin generating revenue without attempting community acquisition one of the main causes of failed ICOs In addition to providing an advanced data analysis service MineBee is developing a market to facilitate the buying and selling of new and second hand mining equipment MineBee Open Market will enable new entrants to begin mining by removing the cost barriers which currently exist and allow established miners to o\xef\xac\x80set the costs of upgrading through the sale of old equipment With new equipment from leading manufacturers also showcased the marketplace will provide vendors with greater exposure and increased sales From inception the market will be supported by MineBee Contract a secure fast and cost e\xef\xac\x80ective smart contract that will facilitate cryptocurrency payments The contract will o\xef\xac\x80er payment in MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s native MB token as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum Functionality will include the monitoring and automatic validation of wallet addresses and user accounts transaction amounts the number of transactions being processed transaction throughput and transaction status Once escrow functionality has been rolled out MineBee Contract will form a standalone system capable of facilitating trustless transactions for a range of purposes both within MineBee Open Market and for third parties that have integrated the MineBee Contract payment module MineBee will be available as an open API for payment integration in a range of industries including those that operate outside of the cryptocurrency space 5 \x0c1 Executive Summary The MB token will entitle holders to a range of bene\xef\xac\x81ts including a discount on premium MineBee services This includes tools for fully optimizing mining equipment and coin selection to maximize revenue allowing miners to derive greater e\xef\xac\x83ciencies and keep their machines running pro\xef\xac\x81tability even when others have been forced to power down By improving the overall e\xef\xac\x83ciency and pro\xef\xac\x81tability of cryptocurrency mining MineBee will increase the industry\xe2\x80\x99s appeal causing greater demand for hardware as more miners enter the ecosystem This in turn will improve network security and the stability of the Proof of Work (PoW) coins being mined The scope accuracy and real time relevancy of its data will position MineBee as the industry\xe2\x80\x99s premier provider of mining analytics Proof of MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s e\xef\xac\x83cacy will be evident in the enhanced performance levels witnessed by miners who connect to its service stack to transmit their operational data and receiving actionable information in return Together with its partners MineBee will attract and nurture a large community whose input will be instrumental in ensuring the project\xe2\x80\x99s success from day one MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s turnkey solution will supply value to a growing global network of cryptocurrency miners and other ecosystem participants 6 \x0cMarket Overview 7 \x0c2 Market Overview Cryptocurrency mining is the backbone of Proof of Work coins Miners compete to add blocks to a public ledger with the \xef\xac\x81rst miner to \xef\xac\x81nd the correct hash function within a desired range entitled to the block reward plus any fees attached to the transactions contained within it This process of work and reward incentivizes miners to produce the cryptographic proofs that secure the network and ensure its continued stability which in turn supplies users with the con\xef\xac\x81dence to adopt and invest in these protocols Since miners are \xef\xac\x81nancially motivated to validate transactions and their remuneration is directly proportional to the hashrate they contribute to the network they welcome any and every means by which their operation can be re\xef\xac\x81ned Miners can make signi\xef\xac\x81cant pro\xef\xac\x81ts depending on market conditions hashrate network di\xef\xac\x83culty and other factors but their fortunes can swing wildly In early 2017 for example thousands of solo miners purchased GPUs and began mining Ethereum which was rising rapidly in value at the time Many Ethereum miners realized signi\xef\xac\x81cant pro\xef\xac\x81ts before increased competition raised the network hashrate and eroded economic incentives for small scale operators While 2017 saw record growth throughout the cryptocurrency industry this was followed by an extremely testing 2018 that left miners struggling Since late 2017 the value of bitcoin has dropped by 75% while ethereum has fallen by around 90% making it increasingly challenging to derive a pro\xef\xac\x81t from cryptocurrency mining Most altcoins have su\xef\xac\x80ered even more dramatic losses during this timeframe in some cases shedding over 90% from their peak value With crypto assets trading at signi\xef\xac\x81cantly reduced prices many miners have found their business model to be no longer viable In November 2018 a number of major Chinese cryptocurrency miners were found to be dumping their equipment as the economic climate made it no longer cost e\xef\xac\x80ective to continue By this point the solo miners who \xef\xac\x81rst supported the growth of the major blockchains had already bowed out since they could no longer a\xef\xac\x80ord to keep their equipment running As Diar observed in October 2018 \xe2\x80\x9cmining has at least for now and most likely in the future moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets 8 \x0c2 Market Overview It is not just smaller and independent miners who have been forced to cease operations in this tougher prevailing climate with large scale mining businesses also stretched GMO Internet for example who allocated around 10% of the \xef\xac\x81rm\xe2\x80\x99s capital and resources to a coin mining venture in June of 2018 reported losses of $320 million in Q4 of 2018 and o\xef\xac\x83cially ceased all mining In November 2018 the North American mining company Giga Watt went bankrupt leaving creditors out of pocket to the tune of millions of dollars Despite the recent market downturn however the industry continues to innovate and to attract new entrants Market size The hashrate of a cryptocurrency network provides a broad indicator of the number of miners connected to it For example the steady rise in hashpower on the BTC network from January to October 2018 indicates that despite declining coin values the number of miners joining the network was steadily increasing (see \xef\xac\x81gure 1) This was followed by a signi\xef\xac\x81cant drop in hashpower from November to December indicating that miners began ceasing operations in high numbers Despite Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s hashrate having partially recovered since late December it remains approximately 30% below its peak of 60 EH/s set in mid 2018 Hashrate The estimated number of tera hashes per second (trillions of hashes per second) the Bitcoin network is performing source blockchain com 65 000 000 60 000 000 Hash Rate

\xef\xac\x81nancial viability of cryptocurrency mining is dependant upon keeping operating costs at a minimum while maximizing output Miners face a constant battle to drive down production costs amid increased competition posed by new miners and new mining equipment joining the network Electricity costs power consumption cooling hashrate and overclocking settings \xe2\x80\x92 as well as market prices \xe2\x80\x92 a\xef\xac\x80ect the pro\xef\xac\x81ts that miners are able to realize through selling the cryptocurrencies they earn as block rewards and transaction fees 3 2 1 5 1 0 5 0 Jan Feb

miners are driven to seek cost savings and performance enhancements Miners have no control over coin prices but they can still maximize pro\xef\xac\x81ts by setting optimal hashing and overclocking values choosing the most pro\xef\xac\x81table coins to mine and reducing overheads by sourcing cheap electricity 11 \x0c2 Market Overview The average electricity cost of mining most PoW coins still exceeds their market value by a signi\xef\xac\x81cant margin As of January 14 2019 Cryptocompare indicates an 81% daily loss on mining Bitcoin and a 44% daily loss on mining Ether Miners intent on pro\xef\xac\x81ting from their profession must constantly monitor and adjust their equipment to maximize revenue and remain competitive Every miner has a break even point a threshold below which it is no longer economically viable to maintain operations When the cost of mining coins falls below the pro\xef\xac\x81t to be derived from selling them miners are faced with the prospect of having to disband and sell their equipment at a loss or wait for more favorable market conditions to return while still paying rent and other \xef\xac\x81xed costs 2018 Miners Paying Retail Electricity Prices

prices became unpro\xef\xac\x81table in 2018 12 \x0c2 Market Overview Deferring or preferably avoiding reaching the break even point will allow miners to maintain \xe2\x80\x9cskin in the game\xe2\x80\x9d and to continue production until fairer market conditions return For miners who have dropped out altogether by that point and divested themselves of their equipment resuming operations will not be feasible Mining is essentially about survival therefore with the victors claiming the bulk of the hashrate and the spoils Cryptocurrency mining is an adversarial environment by design with miners not only competing with one another to \xef\xac\x81nd blocks but also subjected to di\xef\xac\x83culty adjustments and reduced block rewards that have been programmed into the protocol This forces miners into an arms race in which equipment must be regularly optimized in a bid to o\xef\xac\x80set increased di\xef\xac\x83culty or replaced by newer more powerful hardware From a \xef\xac\x81nancial perspective boosting the output of existing equipment is preferable to upgrading it which is why miners push their rigs to the limit 2 2 Informational Challenges There are numerous ways in which miners can reduce their expenditure and operating costs while increasing output but this quest is hampered by an absence of accurate information To make informed choices miners require up to date information both at the point of sale and in the day to day running of their operations 2 2 1 Mining Data Miners cannot simply plug in their machines and start pro\xef\xac\x81ting from mining PoW coins Optimal hash and overclock values are required to mine e\xef\xac\x83ciently and pro\xef\xac\x81tably The only way to identify the optimal values for any coin is to pool and analyze data from many mining machines Modern big data techniques can produce insights regarding the most e\xef\xac\x83cient mining values for the bene\xef\xac\x81t of all participants Although such insights have the potential to optimize mining operations big data analytics methods are reliant on having access to vast data pools Very little live mining data is made 13 \x0c2 Market Overview publically accessible since few solo miners have any reason to collect and publish data on their own operations The data of large numbers of miners is available to mining monitoring and management services but these entities currently have no incentive to share this data In order to implement performance enhancements mining and monitoring services must be incentivized to collect and share anonymized user data and users of these services must be incentivized to share their data 2 2 2 Marketplace Data At present the manufacture of mining rigs is highly centralized with a handful of businesses dominating the sector The result is a market which is uncompetitive with detrimental knockon e\xef\xac\x80ects particularly in terms of price Consumers are faced with a limited number of options when deciding which equipment to purchase and manufacturers remain free to maintain high hardware prices This problem is further exacerbated at the point of sale where the market has no price comparison site nor is there a place to easily purchase second hand hardware For established miners who wish to sell their used equipment there is no widely adopted platform on which they can advertise the inventory Most existing e commerce marketplaces levy high fees to list items for sale to set a safety reserve and to add special quali\xef\xac\x81cations to a sale Further they typically charge a minimum of 10% on the total value of the sale in fees These charges can render the sale of second hand mining equipment \xef\xac\x81nancially non viable leading to perfectly functional mining hardware languishing in storage or simply being scrapped altogether 2 3 Safety Challenges To date no comprehensive study has been conducted on the dangers of leaving mining equipment unattended However a number of reported incidents of \xef\xac\x81res caused by mining hardware demonstrate the hazards posed In 2014 a \xef\xac\x81re at a bitcoin mining facility in Thailand 14 \x0c2 Market Overview caused signi\xef\xac\x81cant damage with 2 000 mining rigs destroyed in the blaze In February 2018 a \xef\xac\x81re engulfed the upper \xef\xac\x82oor of a Russian apartment complex destroying eight \xef\xac\x82ats in the process In addition to the anecdotal evidence that attests to the dangers of leaving highly powered rigs unattended there is the threat of mining rigs shutting down due to overheating or complete burnout From a \xef\xac\x81nancial perspective the threat this presents to miners is almost as severe given that their income is reliant on equipment performing optimally and running 24/7 Miners must counter the need to operate equipment within safe parameters with the need to overclock their machines and push them beyond their recommended limits in order to maximize revenue Excess overclocking exacerbated by the heat build up from having dozens of GPUs or ASICs connected in parallel can prove just as costly as underclocking Coaxing greater output from cryptocurrency miners without jeopardizing hardware or premises is a delicate balancing act With lives to lead and other tasks to attend to miners are forced to make tough choices They can either 1 2 3 Leave mining equipment to operate unattended at the risk of technical breakdown or potential \xef\xac\x81re risk Power down equipment when unattended resulting in a loss of revenue Physically attend to machinery around the clock at great personal cost in terms of time or as a \xef\xac\x81nancial burden in the form of hired labor Since each of these options is sub optimal there is a clear case for a solution which allows miners to safely maximize their mining performance and uptime while minimizing risks 15 \x0cMineBee Service Stack 16 \x0c3 MineBee Service Stack 3 1 Overview MineBee is developing a turnkey solution that will address the mining industry\xe2\x80\x99s multi faceted problems and supply participants with real time network analysis The MineBee service stack will collect

Client MB Solution \x0c3 MineBee Service Stack 3 1 1 MineBee Solution Big data is de\xef\xac\x81ned as \xe2\x80\x9cextremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns trends and associations \xe2\x80\x9d Through such big data analyses MineBee Solution will yield value generating insights As Peter Sondergaard Senior Vice President of Gartner puts it Information is the oil of the 21st century and analytics is the combustion engine \xe2\x80\x9d In its raw extracted state mining data is of limited value but once it has been subjected to MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s deep pattern analysis it gains a range of monetizable applications which can then be licensed to business partners MineBee obtains data streams from its mining monitoring and management partners who in turn collect it from the miners who connect to their system MineBee Solution integrates with mining management systems through an API to collect data on mining operations of all sizes MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccombustion engine\xe2\x80\x9d processes this data to extract revenue generating insights regarding overclocking cooling and optimal hashing and coin selection Mining companies that license MineBee Solution will be granted access to this trove of processed data in real time MineBee Solution will draw its data points from a wide range of inputs including \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Hashrate per GPU Total GPU hashrate per rig GPU temperatures Full miner log archives Error log archives Reboot rate MineBee Solution will also provide detailed hashing information for all popular PoW coins including information pertaining to \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f 19 Average and maximum hashrate for each coin Maximum theoretical overclock according to VGA series OS and coin type Overclock information regarding memory (Mhz) fan speed voltage memory voltage etc \x0c3 MineBee Service Stack Finally MineBee Solution will contribute to the development of mining pool ID monitoring This provision enables mining management companies to determine whether miners are changing to di\xef\xac\x80erent pool IDs Observation of this trend can give miners an indication of where pro\xef\xac\x81ts are being made and facilitate automated switching to maximize revenue As overclocking and operational settings are improved so is the likelihood if the miner successfully solving a block hash and claiming the reward The same information can also reduce the risks associated with mining by identifying the maximal safe overclocking values for di\xef\xac\x80erent types of rigs Overclocking a mining rig beyond the levels recommended by the manufacturer could result in systems outage overheating power overload damage or may simply degrade the hardware prematurely MineBee Solution can identify these risks and suggest optimal overclocking settings that are precisely con\xef\xac\x81gured for the system in question 20 \x0c3 MineBee Service Stack MineBee Solution creates value for a range of industry participants by increasing the e\xef\xac\x83ciency safety and pro\xef\xac\x81tability of mining operations It achieves this by \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Providing real time data processing tools that produce key insights on hashing data of both coins and hardware overclocking data the pro\xef\xac\x81tability of mining certain coins and so on Such insights may signi\xef\xac\x81cantly improve the overall e\xef\xac\x83ciency and value of the mining industry Providing sophisticated performance analysis tools to partners who in turn provide users with reliable remote monitoring and management services which negate the need for constant physical monitoring This will drastically reduce labor costs Rendering mining pro\xef\xac\x81table by bringing new miners into the space and allowing established miners to upgrade and expand their operations MineBee Solution provides incentives for new miners to get started and allows all miners to improve the e\xef\xac\x83ciency of their operations It facilitates the entrance of new miners into the industry by o\xef\xac\x80ering information via third party mining management services that gives prospective miners con\xef\xac\x81dence their operations will be maximally e\xef\xac\x83cient and pro\xef\xac\x81table from the outset Network e\xef\xac\x80ects The more miners who connect to the MineBee ecosystem the greater the dataset that can be utilized and the more valuable these performance enhancing insights become This creates a positive feedback loop The network e\xef\xac\x80ects of miners joining the MineBee network via MineBee partners and submitting their mining performance data for analysis will drive even greater e\xef\xac\x83ciencies When used in conjunction with the MiningCom app MineBee Solution provides mining companies with unparalleled client management capabilities through its innovative sub ID management solution This enables users to update multiple mining rigs simultaneously and to adjust hashrate coin selection and hashing algorithm 21 \x0c3 MineBee Service Stack MineBee Solution

MiningCom App MineBee is working in partnership with MiningCom on the production and development of a multifunctional and intuitive management app This will allow users to remotely monitor and control their mining operations remotely 24/7 The desktop version of the application which will be available for Windows Linux and macOS will provide a single point of access to the MiningCom platform as powered by MineBee solution App users will have access to pertinent mining related data as well as being able to monitor the performance of their hardware in real time The app\xe2\x80\x99s remote management and con\xef\xac\x81guration system will allow users to control hardware temperatures initiate machine reboots trigger \xef\xac\x81le backups and updates and carry out a range of other operations that will keep equipment optimized and operating within safe parameters The MiningCom app will also employ real time messaging alerts to warn users of any critical issues the moment they arise This will allow swift action to be taken to remedy the matter Warnings can be triggered by such events such as hash rate decreasing GPU temperature rising or mining rig stoppages With the aid of insights provided by MineBee Solution miners can customize settings with con\xef\xac\x81dence prioritize events that require their immediate attention and calibrate software accordingly In the case that a mining device stops the user can quickly and easily reboot the rig Alternatively with the aid of an in app diagnostic it will be possible to troubleshoot the cause of failure before determining the best course of action The user can then decide whether to reset the miner or to leave equipment powered down pending inspection The MiningCom app will feature a range of free and premium services Free services include \xe2\x97\x8f Hashing information for a range of cryptocurrencies \xe2\x97\x8f Marketplace information including equipment prices and spec such as hashrate power energy consumption regional availability \xe2\x97\x8f 29 Market information including crypto asset prices and trading volume \x0c3 MineBee Service Stack \xe2\x97\x8f Mining information on hashing algorithms

avert problems before they occur and reduce costly downtime 30 \x0cBusiness Model 31 \x0c4 Business Model MineBee has established a number of mutually bene\xef\xac\x81cial relationships with high pro\xef\xac\x81le partners in the mining rig monitoring and management industry These partners will provide MineBee with raw data collected from their extensive user base MineBee will analyze this data to improve the e\xef\xac\x83ciency and safety of mining operations and license this information in order to generate revenues for the company Insights provided by MineBee Solution will o\xef\xac\x80er the users of MineBee partners a signi\xef\xac\x81cant competitive advantage A high percentage of blockchain based projects fail due to low user uptake According to research by ICOrating com in Q3 of 2018 \xe2\x80\x9c64% of all ICOs failed to complete their crowdfunding \xe2\x80\x9d This can occur for a number of reasons The project may have an insu\xef\xac\x83cient addressable market poor customer acquisition costs or a subpar marketing strategy With such a high rate of failure it is understandable that many teams expend huge amounts of energy and resources building a platform and marketing in the hope of attracting users and establishing a community to support their projects As a consequence teams often become focused on user acquisition at the expense of fundamental logistical implementation Even those projects that successfully meet their hardcap often fail further down the line A 2018 Boston College study estimated that 55 8% of all cryptocurrency related startups fail within 120 days of completion of their ICO To circumvent these issues MineBee will license its software suite to established partners in the mining industry In doing so MineBee will gain immediate access to a wide user base and will enjoy strong support from launch MineBee will onboard a substantial number of users thanks to its partnership with MiningCom a leading provider of rig management software The agreement will give MineBee access to an established community of users in exchange for licensing its technology MineBee will also enjoy two other sources of revenue in the form of MineBee Contract and MineBee Open Market As a specialist market for new and used mining equipment MineBee Open Market will become an essential destination for anyone who wishes to trade in mining equipment 32 \x0c4 Business Model User Pro\xef\xac\x81t Share User Partner Fee MB Open Market MB Contract Open API MiningCom User Pro\xef\xac\x81t Share Raw Data

Analysis MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s in depth analysis of mining metrics will furnish cryptocurrency miners with an array of performance enhancing recommendations Through intelligent analysis of big data MineBee will supply evidence based optimizations that facilitate improvements above and beyond anything supplied by existing mining management services As a multi faceted project that straddles multiple sectors of the mining industry MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s competitors are equally diverse ranging from traditional marketplaces to mining management software developers Awesome Miner Awesome Miner is a well established provider of rig management software that shares some functions with the MiningCom app In particular Awesome Miner is used to monitor the progress temperature and current status of mining rigs and can also be used to control them Awesome Miner uses real time data to determine which coin or mining pool may o\xef\xac\x80er the best pro\xef\xac\x81tability but this information is supplied by third party sources rather than being derived directly eBay Cryptocurrency miners are frequently bought and sold on eBay However as a non specialist market is challenging to \xef\xac\x81lter searches appropriately when dealing with highly technical products such as mining rigs on eBay Meanwhile sellers are confronted by a basic selling fee of at least 10% from the list value This \xef\xac\x81gure can rise with additional charges for reserve pricing and other auction types eBay does not accept cryptocurrency obliging miners to liquidate their coins and convert into

MB Solution 38 \x0cToken Model 39 \x0c5 Token Model The MB token is a dual discount and medium of exchange token used for purchasing services from MineBee Solution It also enables payments for P2P and B2C trades on MineBee Open Market A total of 5 billion ERC20 tokens will be minted in MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s token generation event (TGE) When used as a payment token for MineBee Partners\xe2\x80\x99 services the MB token o\xef\xac\x80ers users a discount on additional fees With the option to purchase MineBee partners\xe2\x80\x99 premium services at reduced rates users will have a strong incentive to acquire and use the MB token The strong network e\xef\xac\x80ects that will be exerted as the MineBee ecosystem grows will increase demand for the MB token This will be heightened by the increased mining e\xef\xac\x83ciencies demonstrated by MineBee Solution The proven savings that MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s insights can yield will incentivize miners to purchase premium MineBee Solution services through MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s partners While miners are at liberty to make purchases within the MineBee ecosystem using alternative cryptocurrencies in the form of BTC and ETH the signi\xef\xac\x81cant discount bestowed by the MB token will ensure it is the dominant cryptocurrency particularly for MineBee Solution The mechanics of supply and demand mean that interest in the MB token can be expected to rise aided by the fact that there will be no additional tokens minted in future MB\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81xed supply coupled with a steady in\xef\xac\x82ux of new users will serve to accelerate interest in the token as the sole mechanism for acquiring discounted access to MineBee Solution This will also help to reduce the token velocity problem which occurs in systems where participants have no incentive to hold the token Since the MB token will provide discounted access to MineBee services via its partners in perpetuity holders will have strong economic incentives to retain and use the token for its intended purpose Given these factors sustained transaction volume can be anticipated while the discount granted by MB will further mitigate velocity by giving the token intrinsic value in the form of cash \xef\xac\x82ows Once acquired by the community tokens may be traded exchanged locked up or burned over time As MB enters general circulation the token will become available via exchanges or as payment for products and services 40 \x0c5 Token Model 5 1 Sale Structure MineBee held a private sale in the last quarter of 2018 A total of 1 62 billion tokens were sold to accredited

Terms and Abbreviations 56 \xe2\x97\x8f Hashing using a mathematical function to derive a \xef\xac\x81xed length numeric or alphanumeric string from a piece of data of any length \xe2\x97\x8f Hashrate a hashrate is the speed at which a computer can solve a hashing problem The probability of a miner successfully mining a block before anyone else is partially determined by the hashrate of their mining operations \xe2\x97\x8f Overclocking overclocking is the process of increasing the working speed of a computer or component beyond its original clock frequency speci\xef\xac\x81cations This is typically achieved by modifying system parameters or operating voltages Overclocking is typically performed by coin miners to improve the hashrate of their mining operations \xe2\x97\x8f API application programming interface \xe2\x97\x8f Open API publicly available application programming interface for third parties to integrate the MineBee Contract payment module \xe2\x97\x8f ASIC

monitoring system While other industries have thrived on the insights that big data can supply crypto miners have been deprived Inaccurate or insu\xef\xac\x83cient data has prevented miners from optimizing their operations to squeeze out greater e\xef\xac\x83ciencies and from acquiring equipment at the best possible price MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s complete solution will give cryptocurrency miners the tools they need to safely increase hashrate and maximize uptime As a result GPU and ASIC miners will keep working for longer because their operations will be pro\xef\xac\x81table for longer During testing market conditions MineBee will be the di\xef\xac\x80erence between pro\xef\xac\x81t and loss while in favorable conditions MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s technology will signi\xef\xac\x81cantly boost revenue Smarter analysis begets smarter mining As the number of miners sharing their performance data with MiningCom grows the dataset under analysis will increase commensurately This will grant MineBee the ability to derive improved insights on performance optimization and to facilitate new breakthroughs in mining e\xef\xac\x83ciency The MB token will grant discounted access to MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s premium services which will enable miners to further increase their output These optimizations will provide a clear cutting edge from the moment they\xe2\x80\x99re implemented The MB token will also serve as the primary unit of account on MineBee Open Market enabling new and used equipment to be purchased quickly and at competitive prices The marketplace will provide a convenient entry and exit strategy for miners to realize pro\xef\xac\x81ts and then sell their equipment to the next wave of crypto miners MineBee Open Market will also be supported by MineBee Contract whose open API will provide a payment solution suitable for all industries and businesses including those currently outside of the cryptocurrency space This will further increase MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s exposure while yielding bene\xef\xac\x81ts for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem Good data doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lie and MineBee\xe2\x80\x99s analytical approach to cryptocurrency mining will provide the formula for success Every new miner mining pool and mining management service that connects to the MineBee ecosystem will further validate its data driven model 58 \x0c9 Closing Statement Proof of Work cryptocurrencies are widely regarded as the most secure means of validating and decentralizing blockchains The work that miners expend on con\xef\xac\x81rming new transactions and validating new blocks makes the cryptocurrency ecosystem stronger and more valuable for everyone MineBee and its partners are laying the framework for a datadriven solution in which every participant prospers 59 \x0cBibliography and Further Reading 60 \x0c10 Bibliography and Further Reading https //www awesomeminer com/home https //www blockchain com/en/charts/hash rate https
