b WITchain WITchain Makes Your Token and Manages Its Value WITchain WHITE PAPER \xe2\x80\x94WITchain Makes Your Token and Manages Its Value I Abstract 1\xe3\x80\x81Connotation of Token In the narrow sense token is an negotiable document it is the representation of digital assets have the various attribute such as right of use and income Like definition of Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party \xe2\x80\x9d In terms of the essential connotation of the token it has three connotations liquidity\xe3\x80\x81 credit\xe3\x80\x81value Specifically Liquidity negotiable\xe3\x80\x81convertible\xe3\x80\x81exchangeable Credit identifiable and tamper proof\xe3\x80\x81technical consensus Value Value Carrier\xe3\x80\x81Social Consensus From the value attribute of token token has the attribute of 3 dimensions of price\xe3\x80\x81 income and right These three properties are independent and interdependent A token may have one or more value attributes Several properties may be related like Earning and price The pass through model for different attributes may be uncertain or change with the conditions and cannot form the exchange relationship Multidimensional value scale is actually a kind of expression and dissemination of the issuing party rather than purely economic activity 2\xe3\x80\x81The classification of the Token 1 http //www witchain org/ \x0cWITchain WITchain Makes Your Token and Manages Its Value From a generalized Angle according to the attribute dimension the token can be divided into valuable\xe3\x80\x81profitable\xe3\x80\x81rightness\xe3\x80\x81identification Valuable As a carrier of value direct corresponding value such as stored value card exchange certificate etc Profitable The holder obtains rights in the application scenario such as preferential card VIP card etc Rightness Having the right to gain such as bonds stocks etc Identification It is not the specific value characteristic but some kind of negotiable securities or the objective fact of the identification such as the house property certificate the old age certificate In the narrow sense it is the digital currency According to the different properties of blockchain assets we can divide the digital assets into four categories token platform application and tokenized physical assets Token refers to a type of asset which is developed and based on the blockchain technology It does not correspond to a specific usage scenario and only serves as a transaction medium Its asset value is reflected by liquidity Platform refers to a class of assets supported by the development of the underlying blockchain technology and the right to use or participate on such platform Application refers to a class of assets which are related to a particular application scenario and are supported by a certain right of use or participation or right to claim dividend Tokenized physical assets refers to a class of assets supported personal assets such as gold dollar etc 1)Coin Capacity over 1000 varieties Function one of alternative investment varieties medium of exchange in blockchain asset domain Market The most valuable one is bitcoin at present 2 http //www witchain org/ \x0cWITchain WITchain Makes Your Token

basic technical support for various application developments Market Most platforms are in development and institutional investment has a certain share in it Typical products ETH Fabric NEO Main indicators technical indicators 3)Application Capacity about 300 varieties Functions covering finance supply chain management socializing energy property protection and other fields Market the fastest growing category of blockchain assets Typical products OMG Main indicators development progress and number of participation nodes 4)Physical Assets Capacity not more than 10 varieties Function linked to gold dollar and other assets a mirror of physical assets in blockchain Market The market capacity is small due to the lack of regulations and laws concerned in some countries But when combined with asset securitization the development potential is large 3\xe3\x80\x81Design of the token economic system There are seven steps and three elements needed to be solved in the design of the pass through economy 3 http //www witchain org/ \x0cWITchain WITchain Makes Your Token and Manages Its Value Problems to Solve Pathway to Ecological Evolution Combing of Participant Roles Defining Collaboration Rules Setting Contribution Levels Multi level Incentive Mechanism Payment Incentive Method Three elements of the system design 1\xef\xbc\x89Value of circulation Whether circulation creates new value such as bad assets The source of value in circulation demand discovery or cost reduction 2\xef\xbc\x89Create value for who The interests of the issuer Consumer interest Intermediary interest 3\xef\xbc\x89Boundary of circulation The difference between the flow within the boundary and the cross boundary circulation The difference between cross boundary circulation and boundary extension The relationship between cross boundary circulation and current property right system 4\xe3\x80\x81Advantages of token and attack and defense steps 1) super trust 2) superfluidity 3) low transaction costs

industry can be divided into three phases the first stage is a delegate with the BTC named block chain 1 0 stage mainly to solve the characteristic of the BTC such as anonymity privacy speed etc The second stage is the block chain 2 0 which is represented by ETH There are numerous solutions for solving smart contract calculation storage and asset trading The third stage is the application of various industries based on blockchain and Token The first stage involves bitcoin and other competitive coin The typical applications for this privacy and anonymous problem solution are ZEC DASH ZEN AION XMR XZC XWC AEON KMD BCN Typical applications for speed and scalability solution are LTC BCH EMC NAV PIVX XVG BURST 5 http //www witchain org/ \x0cWITchain WITchain Makes Your Token and Manages Its Value The second phase is mainly through the base platform & technical solutions to solve the defects of ETH such as smart contracts storing calculation data scalability specific solutions include 1) Side Chains such as RSK RDN LOOM ZRX XAS etc 2) DAG such as IOTA GBYTE ITC and NANO 3) Cross Chains such as HSR WAN AION ELF XTZ etc 4) Shards such as ZIL ELF etc 5) Asset Trading Agreements such as 0x KNC LRC AST and other typical applications 6) Distributed Storage include IPFS SC and Storj 7) Data Services such as GNX gongxinbao DTA BLZ ENG and other applications 8) Distributed Computing such as GNT and ENG 9) Digital Identity such as ONT CVC ETP and other typical applications 10) Vertical Public Chain include TRX Ulord BTM YOYOW VIA etc The third stage is the combination of blockchain and various industries which is mainly the application of specific industries The industry is dominated by the pan financial and entertainment industries which are both digital and internet
