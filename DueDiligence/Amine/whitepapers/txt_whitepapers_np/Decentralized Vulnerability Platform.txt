b Decentralized Vulnerability Platform (DVP) Whitepaper \x0cTerminology White hats Security researchers who get rewarded by identifying vulnerabilities Decentralized Vulnerability Platform Distributed vulnerability platform without one dictatorial entity Security crowdsourcing Security crowdsourcing is a type of crowd sourcing in the field of security testing project teams submit/announce their products to the DVP platform and the security personnel of DVP (not part of the platform but recruited through the Internet) conducts security testing DVP Decentralized vulnerability platform \x0cAbstract In November 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published the whitepaper \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System\xe2\x80\x9d where he introduced a blockchain network based on proof ofwork consensus algorithm and the concept of decentralized governance Since then blockchain technology has experienced increasing growth and attracted attention from all industries According to Coinmarketcap in June 2019 the market capitalization of cryptocurrency has exceeded $250 billion In the beginning of 2018 the value of crypto industry reached over $800 billion with over 2 000 cryptocurrencies circulating in the market Exchanges wallets dapps media and other related sectors emerged and began to take shape in the market boom however there is still substantial room for further development and real adoption of blockchain technology Blockchain technology is still at its infancy stage and unlike other industries it must develop with its security technology synchronously As blockchain is mostly applied in the financial sector now security must be a high priority Otherwise vulnerability might cause huge irretrievable economic loss Economic loss relating to blockchain security incidents has been increasing every year According to BCSEC statistics in 2018 the number of critical security incidents reached a record of 139 resulting in economic loss of $2 238 billion In the first \x0chalf year of 2019 the number of critical security incident reached 68 cases causing economic loss of $684 million The means of security attack are constantly evolving and difficult to prevent Therefore security requirements of blockchain projects have become top priority and must develop in parallel with blockchain technology to ensure the healthiness of the entire industry Blockchain technology has not been widely adopted yet let alone its security system which is more fragmented This situation has led to a shortage of blockchain security testers \x0cUnder this circumstance the supply of blockchain security researchers is unable to meet the demand of blockchain development It is impractical for small and medium sized blockchain enterprises to hire a full team of security specialists to conduct comprehensive tests on their products This is why security crowdsourcing is an ideal mode through which vendors could offer rewards when they need to conduct security testing But this has led to another problem that is how to build trust between vendors and white hats Vendors rely on white hats to assure their security and vice versa Trust can be built by blockchain technology Blockchain based DVP would in turn guarantee blockchain security They will complement each other and mutually expedite development of each other Therefore to better protect the ecological security of the blockchain BCSEC and PeckShield have jointly launched the DVP decentralized vulnerability platform \x0cChallenges Information security is an interdisciplinary subject a knowledge system that covers the security of software and hardware related to the Internet in all walks of life Blockchain security has a lot of subdivisions smart contract security blockchain node security transaction security and so on Security issues could trigger Cannikin Law a single vulnerability in one link could affect the whole Blockchain must be built with security and developers need to have extensive security knowledge and high level security awareness This is very difficult as developers usually take the business first and turn a blind eye to security Consequently a large number of vulnerabilities in blockchain related software and hardware occur and security cannot be guaranteed A professional team must be there to ensure the security of every link on the blockchain However we surveyed many blockchain teams and found that most of them do not have any professional security team This is the status quo of blockchain industry most enterprises lack professional security teams and cannot discover the vulnerabilities Under these circumstances DVP focuses mainly on providing security for the blockchain vendors in the absence of security teams \x0cChallenges For enterprises with security teams there is no guarantee that all vulnerabilities can be discovered The security issue is a Cannikin Law and more attention should be paid to the blockchain security Multi faceted security does not mean the overall security A single serious security issue may crash the whole blockchain network Recent cases also suggest that blockchain security vulnerabilities continue to cause significant losses to all players in the industry On May 8 2019 one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top cryptocurrency exchange Binance was hacked and lost 7000 BTC On April 2019 a new type of vulnerability TransferMint in multiple TRC20 smart contracts was discovered This could be exploited by hackers to mint unlimited quantity of tokens These incidents point to the fragility of the single security team and the overall industry One single organization or team may not be able to cover every vulnerability Multiple teams are required to do the research and brainstorm more ideas to counter every vulnerability thus providing multiple layers of protection for blockchain security Yet there will be a more significant challenge there is a trust barrier between the white hats and the vendors \x0cChallenges Before narrowing the trust gap the vendors and the white hats are actually in a mental state of hostility Firstly the vendor is actually in a disadvantaged position as they may be worried that the white hats will maliciously attack their system using the vulnerability Furthermore the vulnerability details may also be leaked on purpose by either the platform or the white hats Some vendors even consider the rewardclaiming of the white hats for offering vulnerability clues as a kind of blackmail Blockchain will break the above barriers and set up the bridge between the two sides Secondly the whit hats are also in a passive place regarding rewards distribution They have to face the following issues how will they protect their legitimate rights when the vulnerability rewards do not match its value how will they file for arbitration when the vendor breach the contract and how will they ensure their safety when being pressured by the authorities Ultimately DVP aims to achieve the following mission no matter what size the enterprise is it can conduct the security test for their products through the bounty program on the DVP without worrying that their information will be monitored by the authorities or taken away by the platform neither will the white hats worry about their data being leaked Once the bridge is in place we should also think about how to sustain efficient communication between the vendor and the security personnel in a costsaving way and how to make sure that the white hats will continuously contribute to the vulnerability discovery on the blockchain platform \x0cCurrent Solutions The most widely used platform in the market now is the centralized vulnerability platform such as HackerOne Wooyun After all centralization has its advantages including cost saving fast response and a long term security guarantee for the enterprise But the shortcomings are also noticeable Firstly the platform and the vendor have absolute power to the vulnerability and the white hats cannot protect their rights and interests This case is not rare or is rather common In the past many vendors on Wooyun vulnerability platform tended to ignore the vulnerabilities provided by the white hats or rewarded them with the bounty that did not match the value of the vulnerability The white hats had no way to protect their legal rights Secondly the centralized platform has issues of a single point of failure and a single point of security which may lead to further problems The first is the privacy issue In the centralized vulnerability platform both the vendor and the white hat need to register their real organization or identity There are many ways of information leakage information leakage from internal employees data leakage caused by the invasion or the pressure from regulatory authorities This is a common unavoidable problem of centralization regardless of the size of the enterprise The second is a single point of failure In traditional centralized applications the service is not available as long as the node deployed by the developer is down which is a common problem that users can tolerate The most critical case is this centralized platforms can be arbitrarily shut down by the authorities which is not acceptable in the industry Finally there is an issue of blockchain culture Blockchain based businesses are more inclined to use tokens for transactions instead of fiats Therefore DVP is a future trend in the making It not only has the advantages of the centralized vulnerability platform but also has its unique features For example it uses the pseudonym to protect white hats\ privacy solves dishonesty problem of the vendors through multi party supervision and arbitration fulfills the vendors\ confidentiality requirement of the vulnerability through the encryption algorithm guarantees the speed of the vulnerability review through economic incentives and solves the single point failure and security issues through decentralization \x0cDVP Ecosystem DVP Public Blockchain and Protocol The DVP protocol addresses the security issue of blockchain projects by creating scalable low cost systems Over time we expect that every blockchain project can use DVP protocol to perform security audits as security is the most basic requirement in blockchain projects The protocol contains the major reward payment system An automated bounty payment system for rewarding the participants who find vulnerabilities establishing an automatic reward payment system for white hats and the vendors Thanks to the distributed network of participants DVP protocol is able to mitigate the impacts of malicious players provide the computing power required as well as exert governance DVP protocol will be built on the DVP blockchain where each participant uses the protocol points to pay receive or enhance the verification service \x0cDVP Public Blockchain and Protocol Participants White hats Normal Nodes White hats would earn points as a bounty by discovering various vulnerabilities view the reward task through the platform find the vulnerability and encrypt it by a public key and deliver it to the project team through the platform or Client Any client could be a normal node which acts as a distributed data store for DVP but has no write in permission The block content is maintained and written by the supernodes of the arbitration body Vendors (task publishers) Supernodes (arbitration institutions) After the vendor generation super node arbitration committee will confirm the identity After that the vendor could publish their testing project fill in the information regarding the bounty standards and the testing range and put a deposit which will automatically generate the private and public key The public key is used to report vulnerability for the submitter encrypted The private key enables the vendor to check the contents of the security test report For unregistered vendors the vulnerabilities will be automatically sent to the supernode arbitration organization for inspection Run the DVP verification section to make the arbitration decision and use the accounting for all blocks to write data operations then broadcast and finally get the necessary incentive The node needs to have security verification capability (can be individual team organization or company) supernode will eventually vote for any disagreement or conflicts between the submitter of the vulnerability and the project vendor \x0cDVP Public Blockchain and Protocol Block Information Structure The write in operation will be conducted by the supernodes and the content is only authorized or adding content but not for any deletion or change \x0cDVP Public Blockchain and Protocol Architecture Diagram Architecture Diagram Normal Nodes Record the published information of the blocks broadcast by the supernodes and make sure the data decentralization of the whole network Supernodes Record calculate and publicize the information regarding the transactions rewards and smart contracts and the supernodes usually are security vendors with high capacity The DVP will be a fully independent public blockchain \x0cDVP Decentralized Platform Build the online vulnerability display platform after the release of the DVP public chain(block information browser) The online display platform is mainly used to submit vulnerabilities vendor and white hat registration generation which includes vendor list vendor information page leaderboard page announcement page reward plan description page and also vulnerability description page However the entire data on the platform will be decentralized with only an online DVP browser to display the data in the blocks At the same time we focus on building a decentralized ecosystem to appeal more white hats and vendors to place their security issues onto the platform Vulnerability list Custom activities Information of the vulnerability list includes vulnerability topic the vendor of the vulnerability vulnerability rewards time of vulnerability discovery The vendor could customize the period and bounty activity of a specific period on holidays The vendor is required to define the validity period of the contract besides the bounty contract Vulnerability submission The submitted information by the white hats should cover the title the affected vendor the vendor\ s official website type damage self claimed points selfclaimed level a brief introduction content details proof of code (PoC) and the repair proposal Vendor publishes contract the reward The vendor fills in the information regarding asset category and reward standards and puts the deposit into the contract The reward contract will be broadcast by the supernode across the network and be written into the blocks of the whole network Vendor registration Fill in the contact Email the vendor\ s official website page and introduction information The public key and private key will automatically generate after the registration\xef\xbc\x8c which will be the only passport to get onto the platform and the public key is also the wallet address White hat registration Fill in the personal introduction and name the public key and private key will automatically generate after the registration which will serve as the passport to log onto the platform Besides the public key is also the wallet address \x0cDVP Decentralized Platform Sign in Public page everyone can log onto the personal page using the private key The vendor will publish the new dynamic about bounty activity update Vendor list The vendor list only showcases the vendor\ s name website address and the registration time \xe3\x80\x82 The vendor information page It will show the information and the introduction of the vendors as well as the reward distribution of the bounty activities Ranking list The ranking list will Includes the list for the white hat scoring and one for the bounty rewards The ranking list for the white hats will be based on the accumulation of points by the white hats The ranking list will be published every quarter The platform will choose the top 10 white hats as per the points accumulated by the discovers to ensure the activity across the platform Reward plan description Bounty activity rules Vulnerability description The description of damage level points and reward calculation corresponding with vulnerabilities \x0cDVP Decentralized Platform DVP Workflow 1 Vulnerability submitters can also see the rewards posted in the block in real time through our official platform (online client) select the ones they want to participate Once the vulnerability is discovered the content can be encrypted by the public key published by the vendor The vendor can also check and validate the vulnerability information Upon the concerned confirmation the transaction will automatically issue a standard reward for the submitter of (according to the high medium and low level of the vulnerability) 2 3 After the hole is submitted to the block it will not be processed for more than 24 hours and the message will be automatically pushed to the project side for reminding 4 Any blockchain vendor can submit the reward standards onto our official platform (through the online client) the scope of the test (Smart Contract or any public chain project etc ) After submission of the above information deposit the corresponding tokens to the bounty pool Then the program will automatically generate a public key (encrypt the vulnerability content) for the reward transaction and a private key (the vendor is able to view the security report content) When the vendor has any doubt about the vulnerability the vendor can rewrite the vulnerability transaction to the arbitration institution (supernode) arbitrate by the arbitration institution (supernode) and then conduct a loophole judgment The arbitration result is voted by the verifier As a result of the decision more than 50% of the votes will determine the ruling of the vulnerability and then broadcast the status to the network \x0cDVP Decentralized Platform Requirements for the Vulnerability Report Vulnerability title Vulnerability details Title description The topic should basically cover the information of the vulnerabilities such as one Injection exploit another injection or the web has bypass vulnerability The relapse process is relatively complete but if their explanation is not clear or is lacking in data support it will affect relapse and vulnerability assessment Basic information Vulnerability Type The filled information is correct Vulnerability Level The filled information is correct Vendor information The filled information is correct Vulnerability description Vulnerability Introduction including the summarized description of the vulnerability Graphic description by steps If the critical testing is there but relapse steps are not complete this would affect the vulnerability relapse If only pasting the request of vulnerability use but lacks in steps regarding how to get these requests the vulnerability will only relapse after the secondtime communication Proof of Vulnerability Damage Proof of vulnerability damage is complete Repair proposal Vulnerability repair proposal the repair proposal is correct but overly simple and is not worthy of referring to such as control rights proliferation parameters identity verification \x0cDVP Decentralized Platform The vulnerability information The complete vulnerability information will be encrypted by the public key and only the vendor can encrypt it using the private key 1 Vulnerability Report Not Confirmed by the Vendor Once the vulnerability report has been submitted to the block it will be automatically time stamped If it is not processed for more than 24 hours it will contact the vendor automatically The status will always be vendor unconfirmed until the vendor confirms the report 2 Vulnerability Report Confirmed by the Vendor The vendor can check the vulnerability information of their bug bounty decrypt the details of the report by the private key and validate the vulnerability After that the rewards will be sent to submitter\ s address automatically 3 Arbitration The vendor will ask for arbitration when they doubt about the vulnerability\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness and they will send the decrypted vulnerability report to the arbitration node to vote for the final result And the final result should be approved by more than 50% nodes 4 Disclosure The vulnerability report will be released with the vendor\ s confirmation Upon the confirmation the content will be packed into a block for the nodes to view \x0cDVP Decentralized Platform Bounty Smart Contract Upon the vendor account generation on DVP platform the vendor could fill in the information of their tested project and goal into the programming setting thread which is to be verified by the supernodes After that the vendor needs to put a deposit into the bounty pool which will automatically kick off the bounty program Tasks will be published through B/S client or C/S client by the bounty smart contract and it will define vulnerability bounty into different levels e g 1000$ for high risks 500$ for moderate risks and 200$ for low risks The assets for auditing could be wallets public chain projects or a certain system etc Each level of vulnerability will clearly define its conditions Vulnerability Auditing by Vendors Once the vendor publishes the bounty smart contract they can log onto the DVP main net through client by the private key and view the vulnerability details The rewards will be automatically distributed after confirmation by vendors In case any disagreement occurs Vulnerability repair The submission will be based on the earliest one and the vendor can reject the latter submissions and file for arbitration Ineffective vulnerability In case that the vendor thinks that the vulnerability does not exist or does not pose a threat they should encrypt the details and send it to the arbitration body for voting whether the vulnerability is valid or \x0cDVP Decentralized Platform not As per the voting results if the vulnerability does exist the rewards will be automatically sent to the submitter\ s wallet address Otherwise the result will be publicized to the whole network that the vulnerability is not valid Business Rewards DVP platform will charge a certain proportion of miner\xe2\x80\x99s fee for each business (initial parameters set to 10%) to form a reward pool to reward vendors and white hats who contribute value to the ecosystem of DVP community The value contributed by vendors and white hats will be calculated according to a set of transparent ranking algorithms As for algorithms details please pay attention to the disclosure of official website \x0cAdvantages Vulnerability rewards originated in the United States led by Facebook Google and Microsoft and HackerOne BugCrowd and other commercial companies followed their suit to help companies find security vulnerability through the White Hat community First tier Internet companies such as BAT3 in China have SRC (Security Response Center) to conduct vulnerability reward programs In this way they have reduced the number of external vulnerabilities to a controllable range and won time and direction guidance for their long term security system construction However no decentralized vulnerability reward platform has emerged on the market yet All rewards activities are carried out through a centralized platform or by mail which is not only inefficient and time consuming but limits the use of bounty rewards as it requires companies to hire dedicated personnel to review all rewards Furthermore the submitters are reluctant to expose their identities and contact information The existing platforms do not solve this kind of problems and websites such as Bug Crowd and Hackerone in the present market only focus on traditional network security issues and do not provide a decentralized review mechanism Privacy protection and anonymous designs are the core values of DVP and decentralized review mechanism enables confidentiality and fairness of vulnerabilities \x0cAdvantages Complete Privacy Protection The white hat is anonymous on Only the vendor can see the the platform vulnerability At present on the existing bounty platforms the submitters are forced to reveal their personal information including the claimed rewards However many security personnel are reluctant to do so and may even give up the bounty for being unwilling to communicate with the vendors or reveal their personal information Fortunately the anonymous feature of DVP enables the white hats to be shy away from these issues which will encourage more white hats to be involved in the vulnerability discovery bounty plan The white hats only need to confirm the vulnerability with the vendor to ensure the confidentiality of the information When dispute occurs the supernodes will vote for the result to ensure the fairness and equality All the vulnerability platforms are centralized now Thus the platform is able to check all vendors\xe2\x80\x99 information However the vendors may not be willing to reveal this information to the platform There was a case before when some centralized platform leaked the detail of vulnerabilities and caused the vendor substantial loss DVP will ensure that the vulnerabilities are only available to the vendors and the final decision of publicizing the vulnerability or not is also made by the vendor thus effectively ensuring the confidentiality of the details \x0cAdvantages Anonymous Design Fairness The reward transaction ledger is anonymous and no personal information is required Any award can be open and transparent to ensure fairness and impartiality Each award has a historical record and a complete traceability record Decentralized Auditing Mechanism All auditing standards are confirmed by the vendor The traditional vulnerability platform is usually audited and verified by the central platform The central platform has absolute control If there is any doubt about the vulnerability the white hat or the manufacturer has no right of speech DVP is reviewed by decentralized mechanism which means when the vendor has an objection the arbitrator (supernode) conducts an arbitration to vote for the vulnerability to ensure absolute fairness Encryption from node to node Encrypt the vulnerability information Supernodes arbitration

applications surrounding security ecosystem 2020Q3 Promote real adoption and long term development of security in all industries \x0cThe Core Values of DVP Considering the sensitivity of the vulnerability and the possible harm that it will incur the DVP platform must always be rigorous objective and neutral and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the white hats vendors and the ordinary users Any participant in the platform including white hats vendors arbitral institutions and the execution team of DVP need to clearly understand the starting point and ultimate goal of disclosing vulnerabilities responsibly strictly observe the same rule on the underlying system design and daily operation and effectively strengthen the corresponding vulnerability early warning and emergency response mechanisms At the same time we predict that the vulnerability rewards may cause competition and conflicts among the stakeholders so we require the DVP to be neutral and objective through the entire process In the same way all the capital and team involved in DVP building and operation must also be entirely neutral and necessary measures must be taken to avoid the intervention of the stakeholders Furthermore DVP operation must be transparent in line with the spirit of the blockchain technology \x0c
