technology In traditional networks the network creator plays the dual roles of manager and mediator while users and other stakeholders have very limited power compared with the network creator However in the cryptocurrency network of Qbao Network all participants are considered equals Everyone must follow the same distributed governance protocol and have the equal status to jointly own manage and share such a decentralized social network Qbao Network\ s blockchain technology based QBT token has been widely used in various applications and scenarios in Qbao Network cryptocurrency network Qbao Network\ s blockchain technology based QBT token has been widely used in various applications and scenarios in Qbao Network cryptocurrency network Qbao Network changes the traditional situation where owners of social network owners play a dual role of both \xe2\x80\x9cmanager and mediator\xe2\x80\x9d and provides a decentralized autonomous protocol that users are required to abide by However in the cryptocurrency network of Qbao Network all participants are considered equals Everyone must follow the same distributed governance protocol and have the equal status to jointly own manage and share such a 8 \x0cdecentralized social network Users may obtain various value added social services by spending QBT for example encrypted p2p communication emoticons and skin market An ecosystem can be established through QBT for example trust social knowledge payment massive DAPPs Besides creators partners or users can all benefit from the ecosystem QBT can be used as the unit of exchange between users and content suppliers developing new modes of cooperation and bringing their relationship closer Through the usage of QBT users of the social network and Internet advertisers will be able to allocate interests in a manner Advertisers and users can achieve their objectives through the sharing of advertisements with payments by advertises made in the form of QBT QBT is a non refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of exchange between participants on the Qbao Network for the use of decentralized products and services QBT does not in any way represent any shareholding participation right title or interest in the Foundation or any other company enterprise or undertaking nor will QBT entitle token holders to any promise of fees revenue profits or investment returns and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction QBT may only be utilized on the Qbao Network and ownership of QBT carries no rights express or implied other than the right to use QBT as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the Qbao Network In particular you understand and accept that QBT (a)is non refundable cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation or any 9 \x0caffiliate (b)does not represent or confer on you any right of any form with respect to the Foundation (or any of its affiliates) or its revenues or assets including without limitation any right to receive future revenue shares ownership right or stake share

Qbao Network is also designed to provide a wide range of support for various decentralized applications (DAPPs) enabling the usage of services provided by other DAPPs and tokens built on the blockchain technology for example through the prediction markets on Bodhi and playing games on CryptoKitties Under this model creators of the network partners and users can maintain the whole social network in a more equal and reasonable manner Each participant will be incentivized for assisting with the maintenance of the network and thereby there will be an increase in the network value of the entire social network on Qbao Network 10 \x0cQbao Network\xe2\x80\x99s Vision Qbao Network\ s vision is to become a cryptocurrency service platform that provides technical and service support for the cryptocurrency sector and to promote blockchain technology to a wider range of traditional areas so as to empower the real economy Qbao Network\ s Positioning To develop a new generation cryptocurrency network Qbao Network is committed to providing decentralized cryptocurrency fundamental services and building a reliable and efficient service network based on code security automation and intelligence for new generation cryptocurrencies We believe that the blockchain technology can be used to realize mankind\ s best intentions for freedom fairness and justice As the BTC founder wanted blockchain technology also aims to establish a peer to peer electronic cash system to break the existing monopoly in the market However considering that blockchain is a new technology when looking at blockchain implementation practices it is apparent that the decentralized cryptocurrency is highly centralized and non transparent This model deviates from the core concepts of openness and transparency espoused by blockchain technology The root cause is that current crypto assets do not exist and circulate in a decentralized manner All the crypto based financial practices and services including exchange credit collateral loan risk control default penalties etc are 11 \x0cimplemented or provided by existing highly centralized and non transparent mechanisms As E commerce boom is driven by the improvement of online payment systems the popularization of high speed broadband and the substantial enhancement of logistics efficiency We believe that widely applying blockchain technology is the prerequisite for building a more equalized advanced and prosperous human society in the future The order and fairness of a society should be established on a range of secure and reliable mechanisms provided through open source code rather than merely the good expectation of humanity Qbao Network is a blockchain technology based next generation cryptocurrency network that will provide a series of code based decentralized open and transparent underlying mechanisms and services for all users in order to promote blockchain technology to make contribution to human society Qbao Network\ s Service Users Qbao Network provides the following fundamental services to all stakeholders in the cryptocurrency sector 1 Public chains 2 DAPP project parties 3 Cryptocurrency exchanges 4 Blockchain media 5 Blockchain investors 6 Blockchain technology developers Qbao Network\ s Components 12 \x0cQbao Network\ s cryptocurrency service network consists of the following six parts 1\xe3\x80\x81Qbao Chain A high performance public chain Qbao Network will innovate on the latest blockchain technology and develop a public chain with the following features 1\xef\xbc\x89An Inclusive sandboxed public chain 2\xef\xbc\x89Emphasizing Personal privacy protection 3\xef\xbc\x89Supporting High TPS and infinitely extended side chains 4\xef\xbc\x89Integrating Upgradable smart contract 5\xef\xbc\x89Adopting decentralized Governance Protocol\xef\xbc\x8c 2\xe3\x80\x81A Series of Applications applicable to Android IOS Windows and Mac system to provide professional crypto related services to global users The Qbao Network Client includes a variety of applications built on Qbao Network cryptocurrency service network including the Qbao Network Wallet that has been operating effectively for more than a year and a range of decentralized multifunctional applications (DApp) that are yet to be developed During the development and operations of Qbao Network\ s multi functional cross chain wallet Qbao Network team recognized that the value of a public chain largely depends on diversity of applicaitons and dynamic ecosystem built on this chain Qbao Foundation is dedicated to developing the infrastructure of Qbao Chain and fundamental service systems and welcomes more development teams to build multi functional DApps such as social networking gaming and shopping apps on Qbao Chain This way everyone can contribute to the ecosystem By doing this the Qbao Network community members can be provided with more comprehensive services thus attracting more users to join Qbao Network to make the whole ecosystem more prosperous In addition to developing a high performance public chain Qbao Chain and welcoming global developers to build a range of different applications on Qbao Chain Qbao Network cryptocurrency service network will integrate four fundamental service systems as follows 13 \x0c1\xef\xbc\x89Qbao Network Information System The Qbao Network cryptocurrency information system is a decentralized and diverse information platform It aggregates information in a code based open and transparent manner collects and sorts various hot news and social hotspots in the cryptocurrency field and manages project rating information In addition it objectively records a variety of public opinions in the cryptocurrency world and provides the most detailed and impartial first hand information for blockchain stakeholders in order to help them make informed investment and analytical decisions 2\xef\xbc\x89Qbao Network Capital System The Qbao Network Capital System allows collateral loan asset management funds and other financial instruments in the traditional financial market to utilize cryptocurrencies providing greater liquidity and opportunities for digital asset value preservation or appreciation Cryptocurrencies have been developed over 14 \x0cthe last ten years Compared with mature traditional financial markets the cryptocurrency market is still at a relatively early developmental stage However the innovation brought by blockchain technology also gives cryptocurrencies more space for financial innovation For example the Qbao Network Wallet has created some crypto based financial products in the past year It has added PoS (Proof of Stake) QTUM based mining products to Qbao Network\ s financial product line (Bi\xe2\x80\x99e Bao) and taken advantage of the PoS based token holding feature to continue to generate revenues for users by setting up a mining pool Based on the Qbao Chain the Qbao Network Capital System will provide various financial services such as collateral loans asset identification and management and fund investments for the cryptocurrency world through a range of sidechain and cross chain technologies 3\xef\xbc\x89Qbao Network Risk Control System The Qbao Network Risk Control System is a decentralized system for the valuation pricing and risk assessment of various digital assets based on long 15 \x0cterm tracking and recording of token data and information on each public chain Cryptocurrencies have some features that are different from traditional stock markets such as high volatility and round the clock global trading Based on the Qbao Chain and combined with Qbao Network Information System and Qbao Network Capital System Qbao Network Risk Control System provides a powerful reference for individuals and institutional investors to make prudent investment decisions 4\xef\xbc\x89Qbao Network Compliance System Today countries have different legal requirements for cryptocurrencies Qbao Network cryptocurrency service network has summarized a family of cryptocurrency specifications based on the collection and sorting of policies and regulations of different countries on the issuance supervision and management of cryptocurrencies with the aim of providing guidance and information services to cryptocurrency project parties In addition Qbao Network Compliance System records policies and regulations by coding them on Qbao Chain allowing 16 \x0ccryptocurrency participants to better understand the latest policies laws and regulations By doing so cryptocurrency participants can regulate their behaviors and the development of the entire cryptocurrency market will be healthier and more orderly Through different Qbao Chain applications and the four fundamental service systems mentioned above Qbao Network cryptocurrency service network will provide the global blockchain participants with services that meet their different needs at different levels To motivate participants to be more active and to make more contributions to the entire Qbao Network ecosystem QBT will be applied to the entire Qbao Network ecosystem 17 \x0cQBT Token Application Scenarios in the Qbao Network Ecosystem Qbao Chain As a new generation public chain Qbao Chain is featured with high concurrency sidechain technology and upgradable smart contracting Combined with the four fundamental service systems include Qbao Network Information System Capital System Risk Control System and Compliance System built on it Qbao Chain also supports a series of multi functional client oriented DApps 1\xe3\x80\x81The biggest feature of the Qbao Chain is that it will be a sandboxed public chain The Qbao Chain will accommodate a variety of decentralized agreements other public chains consensus mechanisms and smart contracts It will also provide a simulated socioeconomic test site for research with the help of artificial intelligence simulation data \xe3\x80\x82 A blockchain technology test site can be provided as an incubator for nextgeneration public chains through several flexible pluggable and replaceable sidechains Replaceable modules include but are not limited to the following a Protocol and smart contract layers b Consensus layers c Economic model layers d Organizational form layers e Incentive measures layers Through flexible configurations that are pluggable and replaceable and through AI simulation mechanisms the Qbao Chain will be the incubator for nextgeneration public chains 2\xef\xbc\x8ePersonal Privacy Protection 18 \x0cAnother important feature of the Qbao Chain is the protection of personal privacy We believe that data about people\xe2\x80\x99s behavior shall only belong to each individual When someone desires to commercialize this data and to profit from it He shall give reasonable rewards to individual data contributors The Qbao Chain will use open source technology to protect personal privacy 3\xef\xbc\x8eHigh TPS Public Chains and Infinitely Extended Side Chains Qbao Chain will adopt a consensus mechanism of next generation public chains achieve high TPS under the premise of high decentralization and provide the next generation high performance underlying blockchain technology 4\xef\xbc\x8eUpgradable Smart Contract Qbao Chain will support smart contract upgrades to change the situation in which smart contracts can never be changed after deployment Also the Qbao Chain considers the security and reliability of smart contracts thus providing a flexible underlying technology platform that is more suitable for business use 5\xef\xbc\x8eCommunity Governance Qbao Chain will be a community governance based technology platform which will be more fair and reasonable by using underlying codes and contracts QBT Application Scenarios QBT will be the utility token in all aspects of the Qbao Chain to play the role of value carriers Users can pay for a variety of services that they use on the Qbao Chain with QBT Developers can also receive QBT token rewards and contribution compensation when they help build the Qbao Network cryptocurrency network Throughout the Qbao Chain QBT will be used as an incentive to encourage more notes for joining in the network QBT owners can also participate in the Qbao 19 \x0cChain community governance and determine the Qbao Chain\ s development directions In the future DApps running on the Qbao Chain will also need QBT as a pledge Qbao Network Wallet Since the first version was launched on October 24 2017 the Qbao Network Wallet has been running efficiently for more than a year and had continuous upgrades to achieve multi functionality The Qbao Network Wallet the traffic entrance to the blockchain world is the core Qbao Network client application it plays an important role in the entire Qbao Network cryptocurrency service network Blockchain is the Internet of value and tokens are its value carrier Well protecting the security of tokens is important for blockchain network and the first priority of Qbao Network wallet Therefore the public Qbao Network Wallet 20 \x0cintegrates multiple public chains including BTC ETH QTUM ERC 20 and QRC20 tokens and provides secure token related service for global users With the Qbao Network Wallet users can easily withdraw the tokens they bought on the exchange and store them in their wallets Qbao Network Wallet is both decentralized and centralized Being decentralized means that users\ digital assets will no longer be just numbers in the centralized database but the digital assets faithfully recorded in the blockchain Each user\xe2\x80\x99s transaction will be recorded faithfully in the blockchain and this record cannot be altered by anyone Being centralized means better convenience and user experience Qbao Network Wallet is secure The Qbao Network Wallet uses elliptic curve cryptography and dual signature technologies to sign and encrypt each transaction and it does not store or transmit users\xe2\x80\x99 private keys In addition it provides a cold wallet to secure users\ assets QBT Application Scenarios QBT has many application scenarios in the Qbao Network Wallet QBT can offset the gas on each chain It can also pay the handling fee for withdrawing tokens from Qbag Moreover users can spend QBT to build a chat group and purchase QBT based financial products in token bank to maintain or increase the value of their digital assets 21 \x0cUser Ranking In the Qbao Network cryptocurrency network everyone is a participant and a co constructor The amount of the QBT reward depends on the user\ s contribution to the community The amount of QBT held by users is also important for user ranking Users pay different amounts of QBT to access different applications and enjoy differentiated services To implement community based operations the community will determine major development directions and make relevant decisions Community members can also contribute to the ecological development of the Qbao Network cryptocurrency network through QBT voting 22 \x0cDecentralized peer to peer encrypted communication The current social networks like WeChat QQ Facebook Twitter are all based on a centralized database meaning that all messages sent by people are preserved in the social network owner\xe2\x80\x99s database Therefore the social network owners have full control God mode and can review and filter all messages However the Qbao Network is designed to provide p2p encrypted communication service all messages sent by users are encrypted only the receivers can decrypt the contents and the message can only be preserved by senders and receivers (the message will not be retained in any other third party system) As a result privacy and concealment of social contact is ensured To guarantee that p2p encrypted communication will not be interrupted by network issues and also to ensure that the communication service is efficient safe and stable the Qbao Network allows certain qualified individuals 23 \x0corganizations or companies to establish QbaoHub stations The function of QbaoHub stations are to transmit encrypted messages and in return the operators of QbaoHub stations will be able to receive a network fee in the form of QBT (proportionate to the amount of information processed by that QbaoHub station) QbaoHub stations are only able to send messages and are not able to retain the contents of any private messages QBT Usage Users will need to purchase p2p encrypted communication service with QBT A portion of the QBT paid will be provided to QbaoHub stations (which send messages) as network fee Instance 1\xef\xbc\x89User A is an ordinary user who needs to send some secret data and purchases p2p encrypted communication service with QBT 2\xef\xbc\x89User B maintains a QbaoHub station and a portion of the QBT purchased by User A will be paid to User B (as network fee) for assisting to send User A\ s p2p encrypted messages 24 \x0c3\xef\xbc\x89If a user who purchased the QbaoHub service is forbidden due to various reasons the message will be autonomously transferred to be processed by another alternative QbaoHub If communication is smooth the portion of the QBT purchased by User A to be paid as network fee will be paid to the new QbaoHub instead Trust Social In social networks credibility of the information provider is important Thus for example in WeChat users are marked with \xe2\x80\x9cVIP\xe2\x80\x9d to prevent the transmission of false news This model has proven effective in preventing malicious slander and network violence in social networks In Qbao Network users may use QBT to purchase the \xe2\x80\x9cVIP\xe2\x80\x9d mark to prevent imitation of fake users In addition in the centralized era there is a Chinese app called \xe2\x80\x9cSmall Secret Circle\xe2\x80\x9d which had attracted wide attention In the app all users are required to pay certain basic fees to join into the network which helps to guarantee that all the users in the network are interested From the point of view of founders and moderators of the network the presence of paying users would impose restraints and incentives to ensure the quality of content published Qbao Network will provide the ability for social networks and groups to be created for free However at the same time founders and moderators of each network will also be able to specify certain amounts of QBT which will have to be paid as a fee in order to join private network which will ensure privacy and a more exclusive experience QBT Usage 1\xef\xbc\x89QBT will be required to establish and join private social networks 2\xef\xbc\x89Identity authentication in social networks can be purchased with QBT 25 \x0cInstance 1\xef\xbc\x89User A is a professional investment manager who wishes to discuss trends in NY stocks He may create a private group requiring participants to pay at least 20 QBT as a requirement to participate 2\xef\xbc\x89User B is the developer of a Qtum DAPP who wishes to publish certain information about his project He may create a private group requiring participants to pay at least 1 token (belonging to his own project e g Bodhi) as a requirement to participate Knowledge Payment Taking inspiration from existing knowledge payment products such as Fenda Zhihu Live and Iget Qbao Network will also provide knowledge payment mechanism for key opinion leaders in various fields (such as blockchain experts technical experts investment experts) Users may invite popular key opinion leaders to answer some questions and in return paying them an amount of QBT Other users may also listen in to the discussion by paying an amount of QBT It is contemplated that the appearance fee in QBT will be paid directly to the key opinion leaders while the QBT paid by users listening in will be distributed between the key opinion leaders and the initiator of the discussion 26 \x0cThrough this mechanism for payment for knowledge it is hoped that the Foundation will be able to promote the development of the whole ecosystem more rapidly and in a better manner QBT Usage Users need to purchase knowledge with QBT Instance 1\xef\xbc\x89User A may invite the chief technical officer of a project to answer some questions with 10 QBT which will be distributed to respondents 2\xef\xbc\x89User B may listen in to the discussion by paying 0 1 QBT and obtain the same information 3\xef\xbc\x89As an example if there are an additional 100 users who listen in to the discussion this additional amount will be paid to both the initiator and the respondent Payment Gateway and Clearing Service In order for cryptocurrencies to be more widely linked to the real economy 27 \x0cpayment gateways and clearing services are required Qbao Foundation is committed to creating an ecosystem by increasing the applications of QBT and other cryptocurrencies thus it is important to providing payment services for cryptocurrency servicing online and offline Qbao has developed a payment gateway for cryptocurrencies providing a clearing service to supply business services for various online and offline merchants who can easily receive crypto and carry out clearing The clearing service will be completely free for merchants which is conducive to expanding the Qbao community and payment scenarios to the largest extent The fee charged by Qbao Network will be the channel fee commission of transaction costs QBT Usage Merchants will be required to pay QBT to link with the payment gateway of other cryptocurrencies Instance 1\xef\xbc\x89Merchant A needs to link with the payment gateway in order to use the payment gateway and clearing service provided by Qbao Network 2\xef\xbc\x89The connection of merchant A is free but Qbao Network will charge channel fees of the payment flow This fee will be shared between Qbao Network and its agencies 28 \x0cDAPP Store The value and significance of a public blockchain depends on the number of users of the blockchain To a large extent this number will depend on the number of DAPPs available on the public blockchain When there are more and more valuable DAPPs on a blockchain there will be more users who use that blockchain and the growth will be faster This is the so called ecosystem In order for Qbao Network to become the gateway of blockchain world Qbao Network has established a DAPP store which allows the partners of Qbao Network blockchain community and development fans to publish DAPPs and smart contacts in the DAPP store This will make it convenient for users to obtain the DAPPs and smart contracts they want and evaluate the DAPP with the evaluation system based on QBT of Qbao Network In addition users will be able to use smart contracts in social networks for functions such as initiating a vote forecasting or performing a contract QBT Usage 1\xef\xbc\x89Developers which wish to release smart contracts on the Qbao Network will be required to pay a certain amount of QBT 2\xef\xbc\x89Developers which wish to release DAPPs in the DAPP store on the Qbao Network will be required to pay a certain amount of QBT This will disincentivise the release of fraudulent DAPPs Instance 1\xef\xbc\x89Developer A may develop and release a smart contract on the Qbao Network If this smart contract is used by users part of the usage fee will be paid to that developer automatically which will help promote users to develop some excellent intelligent contracts and expand the blockchain technical community 2\xef\xbc\x89Developer B may release a DAPP in the store on Qbao Network in order to increase the popularity availability and usage of that DAPP 3\xef\xbc\x89User C will be required to hold a certain number of QBT in his account before he will be granted the right to evaluate and score DAPPs \xe2\x80\x93 this is intended to 29 \x0cprevent malicious behavior Emoticon and Skin Market For the current generation of Internet users emoticons and skins are in high demand in the various social networks Generally the younger the user base the more stable and continuous will be the demand for emoticons and skin For the recently released Iphone X a large selling point was the unique emoji package based on face recognition technology which illustrates that the market for emoticons and skins is huge The Qbao Network is designed to establish its own independent emoticon and skin market by defining a series of specifications which will allow users to establish and submit their own emoticon and skin and permitting users to purchase favoured emoticon and skin packages using QBT QBT is used as the mode of payment for this transaction and the creator of the emoticon and skin will obtain majority of the payment QBT Usage Purchasing and using emoticon and skin package 30 \x0cInstance 1\xef\xbc\x89Users may select their favourite emoticon and skin in the market and purchase them using QBT 2\xef\xbc\x89Creator of emoticons and skins will be able to submit their unique emoticon and skin package on to the market set pricing and commission relationships in order to receive payment in QBT from the sales of emoticon and skin Product Promotion Engine As part of the process of continuous expansion of Qbao Network with increased number of users the flow of services through Qbao Network will be more valuable Advertisers with advertisement requirement may also purchase advertisement services from advertising agencies in order to make their own products known by more people through the product promotion engine of Qbao Network so as to increase sales of their products Qbao Network will refer to the features of the advertisement of information flow and combine product promotion and 31 \x0cadvertisement with users generated contents through the product promotion engine The advantage of information flow advertisement lies in advertisements being able to accurately reach the target audience as well as relatively smooth feelings for the advertising process Based on the promotion users can easily view the products they require Qbao Network is also intended to integrate various applications provide application scenarios and token usage and promote their products and services through product promotion engines The product promotion engine will be applied to market promotion of Qbao Network to attract more users to participate in Qbao Network wallet Qbao Chain and Qbao Network community QBT Usage 1\xef\xbc\x89Cooperating with various DAPPs Need to exchange with QBT and purchase the application scenario of DAPP 2\xef\xbc\x89The Qbao Network will receive a portion of QBT as the cost of marketing campaigns 3 \xef\xbc\x89 Advertisers will be required to purchase advertisement from advertising agencies with QBT in order to launch the advertisement The QBT paid by advertisers will be shared between the advertising agencies and the Qbao Network Digital Assets Exchange There are two decentralized exchanges have been integrated in Qbao Network In the future Qbao Network will develop a centralized exchange with more trading pairs and will provide cryptocurrency market and transaction data to enable users to make smarter trading decisions on cryptocurrencies Furthermore With the development of the decentralized exchange transactions among digital assets becomes a very important Qbao Network aims to develop tools for a decentralized exchange protocol for its users to offer exchange services The decentralized exchange among digital assets will not be operated by any entity does not need a centralized database (compared with previous 32 \x0cmatchmaking trading) and all transactions are recorded on blockchains which is very safe and convenient In addition compared with previous centralized transactions exchange fees will be very low QBT Usage 1\xef\xbc\x89QBT will be used for payment of exchange fees for smart contract based transactions on the decentralized exchange provided by Qbao Network 2\xef\xbc\x89For users who trade with higher frequency QBT may be purchased and held to receive some discount off exchange fees Community of User Generated Content\xef\xbc\x88UGC\xef\xbc\x89
