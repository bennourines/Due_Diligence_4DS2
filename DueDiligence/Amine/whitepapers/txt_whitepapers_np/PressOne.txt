distribution network \xe2\x97\x8f Taking advantage of digital signature info and transaction data stored unchangeably on chain highly customizable light contracts and digital currency and distributed storage networks PRESSone expects to drive the revolution of the content trading model and rebuild the production authorization distribution and consumption of the digital content industry \xe2\x97\x8f It will reshape the roles and relationships between content producers/licensors and consumers/licensees by exploring and leveraging new trust relationships organizational structures and models of driving participants\xe2\x80\x99 motivation \xe2\x97\x8f It will build an application layer protocol (the PRS protocol) that spans multiple consensus systems by combining resources including multiple public chains decentralized storage or centralized cloud storage The decentralized open architecture allows everyone to create their own DApps and content based on our data and our infrastructure to explore innovative business models in a transparent efficient and equal way The value proposition of PRESSone is as follows \xe2\x97\x8f Solve the problem of copyright ownership confirmation and declaration for content producers by taking advantage of storing the identity proof of the author and the digital signature of the content they published as unchangeable data on chain \xe2\x97\x8f Create and settle transactions using smart contracts that can be coded and executed automatically Give back the pricing power to content producers (licensors) while lowering the cost of content trading and licensing for consumers (licensees) 1 ( \xe2\x80\x9cPRS project\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPRS network\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPRS team\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d

opportunities in the digital content industry For example general users without sufficient content production ability can participate in the process of value distribution by participating in the spread resale adaptation mining and compiling of others\xe2\x80\x99 content and share income with the original author This creates a win win environment for digital content trading and distribution and promotes the transmission of creativity Background & Problems The internet we have been using is constructed based on essentially digital content When we use the Internet we are either creating or consuming digital content reading/ writing articles editing/watching videos and \xe2\x80\x9cliking\xe2\x80\x9d our friend\xe2\x80\x99s holiday photos We are the creators and consumers of digital content Regarding openness equality and facilitating information flow the Internet has played positive roles since the beginning However with the soaring aggregation of capital data and traffic the Internet is moving farther and farther from its original vision2 Nowadays there are primarily two business models of the Internet the dominant \xe2\x80\x9cfree+advertising\xe2\x80\x9d model and the \xe2\x80\x9cpaywall\xe2\x80\x9d model such as e commerce subscription and Pay As You Use which has been adopted by a minority The \xe2\x80\x9cfree+advertising\xe2\x80\x9d model which the Internet had been proud of for generating significant scale effect is IN NO WAY free for the general user In fact it has cost them so much Data generated from user behaviour has been controlled by commercial corporations becoming the vital commodity and raw material resource of Internet giants and being used to\xe2\x80\x9cextract an inordinate share of value\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x9ccontrol more and acquire more power\xe2\x80\x9d3 During the process the closing off and concentration of power will be further aggravated and it will also lead to hidden and continuous infringement of the values of personal privacy and autonomy Brooker K (2018 August) \ I was devastated\ Tim Berners Lee the man who created the World Wide Web has some regrets Retrieved from https //www vanityfair com/news/2018/07/the man who created the worldwide web has some regrets 2 Tapscott D & Tapscott A (2016) Blockchain revolution how the technology behind bitcoin is changing money business and the world Penguin 3 5 \x0cCommercial and economic activities based on the paywall model are also facing problems caused by this closing off and excessive concentration Regarding digital content the centralization of web traffic the monopolization of distribution channels and exorbitant transaction costs are forcing creators to \xe2\x80\x9cassign their intellectual property rights to what essentially are large rights management operations\xe2\x80\x9d and gradually lose control over their own creation and its property rights4 Meanwhile the rewards obtained are not sufficiently reasonable and fair Why do the creators have to give up their \xe2\x80\x9cright of control\xe2\x80\x9d Why are trading activities and economic value transfer related to digital content still subject to many limitations and difficulties while the creation and acquisition of digital content have become easier Multiple reasons cause the current situation \xe2\x97\x8f Centralized organizations such as publishing houses major content platforms and online content retailers have been dominating the method of sale place of purchase and determination of price Creators have little influence on decisions regarding sales to protect their own benefits \xe2\x97\x8f Other than the centralized channels most content and licensing on the Internet have no marked price You have to find a way to contact the copyright owner for the price and payment method for licensing or purchasing And numerous efforts and a huge amount of time need to be put into signing executing and verifying the contracts for all the parties involved \xe2\x97\x8f The certification appeal and arbitration of copyright rely on an authoritative thirdparty intermediary It is cumbersome for a single individual to manage license or trade his or her own creation\xe2\x80\x99s copyright \xe2\x97\x8f The difficulties of tracing the history of copyright licensing has made it difficult for licensees to know who to ask for approval to use the content Especially after content has been re posted created or adapted it is harder for people to judge \xe2\x80\x9cwho should I contact to request or purchase the license authorization \xe2\x80\x9d The monopoly and closed situation exist during the process of content ownership confirmation and content distribution This has not only caused content owners to lose Tapscott D & Tapscott A (2016) Blockchain revolution how the technology behind bitcoin is changing money business and the world Penguin 4 6 \x0ccontrol and revenue but also suppressed the potential growth of the content transaction market as the development of various profitable business approaches has been inhibited For instance nowadays due to the middlemen\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly there is a market trend that small transactions of content are more difficult to achieve than large transactions because platform vendors have to spend a lot of time and effort in the process of identifying copyright and signing agency agreements with authors With the same cost it is reasonable for vendors to depend on selling content with higher pricing to gain more profit This leads to the situation that finding a sales channel for a short article is much harder than for a book or selling a 20 second video clip is more difficult than selling a full length movie But actually the small transactions of content could be in higher demand and be used in higher frequency If we can fulfill the needs of supply and demand for both parties in some faster easier and cheaper way the resultant cumulative effect would be magnificent For another example it is difficult for creators to be able to determine the pricing and method of trading flexibly according to their own requirements when they sell or distribute their creation through an intermediary such as\xef\xbc\x9a \xe2\x97\x8f Supporting split pricing allowing a customer to only pay for a single chapter of a book or a few bars in a song \xe2\x97\x8f Trading certain types of content for which it is difficult to determine usage and price e g a piece of code or a set of typefaces \xe2\x97\x8f Allowing low frequency or non professional creators to have a low maintenance model for selling content (e g amateur photographers or illustrators) \xe2\x97\x8f Once the needs for micro transactions and flexible transactions are satisfied content creators will be more willing to participate there will be more purchasing options for consumers to choose from and more and more content creators will be driven by the opportunity for higher income If the barriers of copyright licensing and trading can be lowered copyright owners and licensees will share revenue reasonably based their effort and contribution in a transparent and flexible way thereby decreasing piracy and infringement behaviours 7 \x0c\xe2\x80\x9cCo creating with consumers is usually a more sustainable business model than suing them \xe2\x80\x9d5 In conclusion exorbitant transaction costs and monopolistic distribution channels have been damaging the growth of the ecosystem of content creation suppressing diversity and the innovation of new business models The industry of digital content needs to redefine and rebuild new ways of content production distribution consumption and rights authorization This will enable creators to have better incentives and rewards and enable creativity to be transmitted more effectively Opportunities and Solutions Emerging blockchain technologies are expected to \xe2\x80\x9crevolutionize industry and commerce and drive economic change on a global scale\xe2\x80\x9d6 and also open a whole new world of opportunities for solving the aforementioned problems Blockchain \xe2\x80\x9cwill not create a new standard for how artists get compensated Instead it will liberate them to choose and customize an infinite array of solutions that work for their specific needs and beliefs\xe2\x80\x9d5 And it will \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer economic value with lower cost\xe2\x80\x9d7 and achieve flexible income allocation First of all the characteristics of \xe2\x80\x9csecurity immutability and transparency\xe2\x80\x9d of the blockchain and its \xe2\x80\x9cability to cut out the middleman\xe2\x80\x9d 6 is expected to bring trustworthy and transparent solutions to the digital content industry Smart contracts use code to clearly define both parties\xe2\x80\x99 accountability and obligation and how is the value allocated All the contract execution records are saved in the blockchain without being able to be tampered with or retrieved The transfer process of copyright\xe2\x80\x99s economic value is transparent to all the stakeholders which guarantees the safety and credibility of transactions and protects all the participants\xe2\x80\x99 access to fair value allocation based on the promises in the contract Meanwhile malicious breaches of contract are more easily discovered and it is easier to collect the relevant evidence Tapscott D & Tapscott A (2016) Blockchain revolution how the technology behind bitcoin is changing money business and the world Penguin 5 6 Underwood S

common contractual conditions minimize exceptions\xe2\x80\xa6 and the need for trusted intermediaries\xe2\x80\x9d 8 Content creators (licensors) can tie a PRS contract to their creations Consumers (licensees) can execute the contract to automatically calculate for the price to pay and settle the payment Meanwhile saving the contract on the blockchain would make it effortless to trace the existence of the contract related to a certain piece of content and verify if the contract has been executed correctly This would remarkably lower the cost of agreement signing and execution in traditional way thus improve the efficiency of content trading and distribution Moreover the core fundamental of blockchain is a distributed ledger Computer code could be stored and executed on the chain Code automatically executes when certain conditions have been met and the distributed ledger records all transactions forever The transaction records on the blockchain are secured through cryptography and programming It\ s so difficult to build a low cost high efficiency and decentralization automation transactions system on fiat currencies that are not programmable money 9 Based on the consensus and trust mechanism supported by blockchains coupled with the application of smart contracts and cryptocurrency content trading can be disintermediated as never before making possible \xe2\x80\x9csmall transactions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cflexible transactions\xe2\x80\x9d that were previously difficult to achieve Because of the reshaping of the revenue share model between content producers and consumers licensors and licensees will be more inclined to cooperate in a mutually beneficial way to achieve value sharing and amplification The motive of malicious behaviours such as piracy and infringement will be lower with the increased risk of doing evil In the long run more positive and constructive changes will emerge pushing forward innovation in content creation models and business models and finally facilitating the booming industry of digital content Szabo N (1997) The idea of smart contracts Retrieved from http //szabo best vwh net/smart_contracts_idea Html [https //perma cc/V6AZ 7V8W] 8 9 Swan M (2015) Blockchain Blueprint for a new economy O\ Reilly Media Inc 9 \x0cTechnology & Architecture Architecture Design The architecture of PRS protocol PRS is an application layer protocol built on top of several different consensus mechanisms The main purpose of the PRS network is to build a decentralized digital content distribution system The PRS protocol provides developers with the ability to create their own decentralized apps that connect various technologies for example blockchains consensus P2P and cloud storage Dapps can keep private data off chain and store their public data with the PRS network Everyone in the ecosystem will benefit from the shared data Users and developers can write their business logic and verify transactions by PRSC DSL to ensure reliability of these transactions 10 \x0cThe PRS network connects blockchains with different consensus mechanisms among which the major components of the system are the MIXIN network10 (ABFT consensus DAG) and the PRS chain (BFT DPoS) The system uses the MIXIN network as a decentralized ledger to process all asset transactions and the PRS chain takes responsibility for verifying smart contracts and storing transaction related metadata Content storage is not a default service of the PRS network so any storage service including centralized cloud and P2P services can be used to provide content to end users On some occasions even mesh networks and offline storage can become content providers Other blockchains or even centralized banks can also integrate with the PRS network through gateways DApps In the PRS framework a DApp directly interacts with end users Multiple DApps can coordinate to serve requests from users For examples the website and mobile app for PRESS one are DApps Each DApp may contain both private and public data The public data is stored on blockchain and compatible with the PRS data protocol On the other hand private data such as sensitive and personal information could be stored off chain The off chain private data needed by DApps however is not appropriate for sharing with others or storing on chain and should therefore be kept secure by DApp developers and maintainers API Dapp developers needn\ t to implement the protocol from the ground up they can use the PRESSone API service to interact with nodes APIs allow us to hide the complexity of low level blockchain systems and expose the functionality in a friendly way 10 Feng X (2018 July 01) Mixin Network Draft Retrieved from https //mixin one/assets/Mixin Draft 2018 07 01 pdf 11 \x0cContent and storage Hashes of media and text files are stored in the blockchain instead of original copies of files The PRS protocol uses storage location descriptors to define the actual locations of files and resources This flexible architecture allows users to adopt various storage methods including both centralized cloud storage and distributed storage solutions such as BitTorrent magnet links and IPFS Authentication using Public Key Cryptography (for DApp development) Users can create a new key pair and grant permissions to a third party DApp using the key pair to create signatures and execute contracts During the registration process on PRESS one a user creates the first key pair as the root key pair The user can use his or her root private keys for signing transactions to create and revoke third party key pairs PRESSone uses digital certificates to help users verify the identity of DApps and prevent phishing and other security threats PRESSone provides a Certificate Authority to issue the digital certificates for DApp developers Issuing Certificate Authorities is not a privilege of PRESSone and any originator or DAO can become a Certificate Authority based on their reputation PRS Contracts The PRS contract is one of the most essential elements of the PRS ecosystem The PRS protocol will support smart contracts and Ricardian contract that are defined by an easyto understand descriptive language that resembles natural language and contracts will be executed to make trading effective PRS Contract interpreter can interpret and execute the code written by PRSC DSL (Domain specific language) Prices can depend on the requirements of the order and are calculated during the contract code execution A contract instance containing a MIXIN network snapshot_id is created after the success of the user payment and it must be verified by DPOS nodes Then the 12 \x0cnodes will sign a block and after more than half of the nodes have signed the block it is deemed irreversible The MIXIN network snapshot_id is the payment receipt A contract can be deemed digital content and can be traded on the PRS network This will help developers and lawyers to create smart contracts with higher reliability and reduce security risks Following the PRS protocol contracts can be updated or stopped All transactions before the update/stop time remain effective Transaction messages A transaction is a procedure that a client follows in the PRS protocol to publish its requests and write to the network There are several types of transaction messages that the PRS protocol defines for example the identity verification message digital content distribution message and trading confirmation message A contract instance with terms and conditions is attached to a transaction message and the contract execution will make it take effect Verification nodes The PRS validator nodes take responsibility for validating transaction messages and contract execution The nodes sign the blocks with results after validations return successfully PRS Token holders can stake tokens and vote for validator candidates and the voting service runs on the MIXIN Network Malicious validator nodes will be voted out and replaced by other candidates PRS Network The vision of PRESSone is to create a blockchain based digital content transaction and distribution network The PRS team designed an innovative product framework to construct the network by leveraging the features of the blockchain (Decentralization 13 \x0cDisintermediation Distributed Trust Immutability and Programmability)11 and will continue to perfect the framework with the changing complexity and scope of the project The core designs include \xe2\x97\x8f Creating and executing transactions with light smart contracts (PRS contracts) to reduce transaction costs and increase transaction efficiency \xe2\x97\x8f Solving the problem of copyright ownership declaration by storing users\xe2\x80\x99 id proof + content digital signature + transaction history (record of licensing authorization) as unchangeable data on the chain \xe2\x97\x8f Reforming digital content distribution using a decentralized architecture a reciprocal and symbiotic ecosystem and a new way to redistribute revenue between producers/licensors and consumers/licensees \xe2\x97\x8f Framework of PRS Network Transactions and contracts The PRS network supports transactions of any type of digital content whether an article a picture a movie or an encyclopedia Any file can be used to create a digital signature and be used as a tradable object as long as a unique hash value can be produced by the cryptographic algorithm from the file The creation and execution of transactions relies on the programmable light contract an easy to understand descriptive programming language that resembles natural language to set up the contract and define how it runs After the content producer creates a digital content signature for their work they can bind a contract to the signed content and set one or more sets of trading and pricing conditions Similar to the smart contract the PRS contract essentially is a piece of programming code that can be executed A typical example of executing the contract is a content transaction a buyer who wants to purchase a particular content only needs to 11 Iansiti M & Lakhani K R (2017) The truth about blockchain Harvard Business Review 95(1) 118 127 14 \x0cquote the signature of the content associated with the contract to trigger the included operating conditions The total amount needed to pay will be calculated automatically and the execution of the transaction and billing can be done automatically in real time This kind of transaction with smart contracts is irreversible with trackable trading records This can reduce disputes caused by malicious or unexpected behaviour and reduce costs in term of contracting arbitration execution and verification Content producers are no longer constrained by the various conditions of the traditional model and no longer need to rely on intermediary platforms or copyright agencies to manage their transactions 15 \x0cThe range of transactions supported by the contract is immensely diverse such as Payfor Reading Pay for subscriptions licensing for adaptations or translations licensing for re post or resale licensing compiling or publications etc The setting of trading conditions is also extremely flexible For example license grants permitted uses prohibited uses validity periods and termination conditions of a licence can be clearly agreed in the contract restricting the behaviour of both parties to the transaction (an example the author of a column with paid subscription contract must update at least 10 pieces monthly for his/her subscribers) The PRS protocol also supports the application of multiple contracts in combination thereby enabling more innovative models to emerge during the production sale and distribution of content For example re posting sharing content mining listicle producing or review writing can be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cdistributing\xe2\x80\x9d behaviours which allow revenue sharing with the original author The co creators who adapt or translate a work also can develop a new type of cooperative relationship with the original author under the innovative licensing model Both parties can earn income fairly and transparently according to their contribution during creation and production Contract template Based on the PRS contract transaction creators with coding ability can design a contract based on their own needs For those who don\ t know how to program PRESSone offers a contract template store A \xe2\x80\x9ccontract template\xe2\x80\x9d is a set of contract codes that have been pre written such as pay for view authorized translation with an agreed revenue split for translated work are two types of contract templates commonly used In the store PRESSone users can purchase a variety of professionally designed secure and featurerich templates for direct application They can create and set up the contract by simply modifying the parameters in the template rather than coding from scratch by themselves In the PRS digital content trading network the \xe2\x80\x9ccontract template\xe2\x80\x9d is also a type of digital content commodity which could attract developers and legal professionals to participate to develop a variety of contract templates for sale or offer customized contract services Any type of innovative business model of content trading has to be linked to the invention of a new PRS contract template design By designing coding or combining multiple execution conditions in contracts a broader pattern of innovation in terms of 16 \x0ctrading context pricing models and collaboration + income sharing models are allowed to emerge in the PRS network Content signatures The transaction objects in PRS network are the content signatures To create a contract for a piece of content you must first create a content signature declaring yourself as the original author or copyright agent of the content The creation of the signature requires the user\ s private key The successfully signed signature information will be saved as undeleted data on the blockchain which appears as a long character string consisting of the the user address of the creator and the hash value of snapshot of the content file signed supporting offline verification The file types that could be signed include text images video audio pdf and more Users can create a content signature for a single file or a group of files Iterations of a created content signature on the chain will also be supported in the future When you view a digital content signature you can find out who the signature creator is (viewing the associated proof of identity) the timestamp of the signature created the hash value calculated from the snapshot when the file was signed the associated PRS contract the version history of the signature and so on The metadata of a content signature is transparently stored on the blockchain but the originally signed file is probably off the chain The terms of the contract will explain how or where to acquire the original file (or automatically fetch the original file) DApps can choose how original files are stored which part of data is stored privately off chain and which part is stored as public data on the chain Proof of identity In general selling digital content requires the transaction creator to sell using their real name as it involves legal issues such as the validity of an agreement or tax issues But considering privacy and avoiding centralization true real name systems are difficult to implement on Blockchain networks where data is completely transparent The PRS protocol solves this problem by adopting support for multiple types of identity proof 17 \x0cThe protocol for identity proof in PRESSone consists of a proof record stored on the chain and associated social network information To tie a social profile with the user\ s corresponding key pair the user needs to get the ID proof URL by posting on the social network a specified proof information signed with their private key then sign the URL with the same private key and store it on the chain The more social profiles a key pair is tied to the easier it is to judge its authenticity Considering that some social networks require users to register with their real name PRS indirectly completes real name authentication in this simple way In addition to the proof of social network identity the content producer can also prove himself or herself as the owner or account controller by publishing the ID proof URL on a sites such as a personal blog or Medium The PRS protocol will also support endorsement between users as another type of identity proof On top of the above identification methods in some cases requirement to confirm users\xe2\x80\x99 real name can be fulfilled by installing a plugin providing real name authentication services based on the PRS protocol as a third party DApp Copyright ownership confirmation and declaration PRESS one does not provide a centralized copyright certification review and arbitration mechanism However the content producer is required to tie to their identity at least one of the ID methods above to publish a content signature using that identity and it is necessary to link at least one real name ID proof to set up a contract for trading Even if someone succeeded in signing a work copyrighted by others\xe2\x80\x99 and even if they received revenue from selling it through the PRS network the evidence of the misappropriation of others\xe2\x80\x99 work and the record of sales revenues are permanently stored on the chain It is impossible to remove traces of piracy and infringement or hide illegal income This evidence can help the original author claim their rights through legal means Meanwhile in the PRS network DApps operated by third party copyright certification agencies could be connected and used when required These third party copyright certification DApps also need to build a reputation on the blockchain and safeguard their reputation Similar to personal users for a certification agencies or a DApp once a wrong authentication or malicious behaviour occurs the evidence also cannot be eliminated 18 \x0cFinally in the planning of PRESS one there is no place for a centralized content distribution mechanism Ideally content producers have accumulated a certain amount of readers and fans on various social networks or channels so that they can set up contracts to create deals on PRS and then promote them to their readers or subscribers who will return to PRESS one for content or license purchasing At the same time an infringer who impersonates the copyright owner will have no such reputation on SNS or other channels Without enough traffic and income acquired in a short run they possibly have little motives for impersonation or other malicious behaviour on PRESSone Content distribution PRESSone hopes to solve problems related to the sourcing and distribution channels of content by introducing several diverse DApps or combinations of DApps As a Blockchain based digital content trading and distribution network we have no intention to be the control centre of traffic or a monopolist because \xe2\x80\x9cany undue centralization could result in information asymmetry\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpossibly using centralized power to damage participants\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x99s interests in this market\xe2\x80\x9d 12 Such a model also could avoid headto head competition too early from the industry tycoons who operate in a traditional centralized model and see user traffic as their core asset Furthermore there are numerous drawbacks of distributing generic types of content in a centralized way The more reasonable way is to make recommendations guide traffic and spread content targeted at users\xe2\x80\x99 attributes requirements and usage scenarios Based on the open design of an application layer protocol powerful easy to use fundamental services and a symbiotic and mutually beneficial ecosystem PRESSone allows various platform and services to integrate with the PRS network as distribution channels For example digital content publishing platforms various targeted content trading markets digital content co creation platforms and self publishing service providers These services and applications can connect users with different interests in different fields to form a huge market with great diversity and liquidity while at the same time meeting users\xe2\x80\x99 needs in terms of diversity of content requirements as well as differences in consumption motivation or purchasing behaviour 12 Chang J Han F & etc (2016)

digital currency can protect all participants by achieving fair value distribution according to the commitments in PRS contracts All participants will be endowed with fresh impetus during the distribution of content This will reshape the role and relationship of content producers spreaders and consumers Due to changes in the income allocation model each role will be more willing to collaborate and benefit actively participating in every stage of content production and distribution in order to share the value added gains brought by the accelerated circulation of content and facilitation of transactions DApps in PRS Network DApps by PRS Team PRESS one Website PRESS one is the official website of PRS project It contains core functional modules of the PRS network including ID proof and content signature management modules a content trading module and an economic module (My Wallet and transaction history) A Task Admin System Task Hall and other resources will also be open as platforms to fund institutions and stakeholders in the PRS ecosystem 3rd party developers also can find all the documents resources and supports they needed on PRESS one Mobile App The PRESSone mobile App including Android and iOS versions has been in public beta since the end of July 2018 The mobile app is positioned differently than the PRESS one website It focuses on the previewing (reading listening and playing etc ) trading and aggregation of content on PRESS one with the optimal design for mobile application scenarios Future versions will see the mobile app evolve into an online digital content mall and multimedia reader supporting various content types and file formats 20 \x0c3rd Party DApps Since the beginning the PRS team has firmly held the values of openness technology and innovation and attached great importance to the building of developer ecosystems The architecture of the PRS protocol layer clearly reflects that 3rd party DApps are a core component of the PRS network The participation of and contribution from 3rd party developers are invaluable for this project Here are some examples of 3rd party DApps we assume will arise matching the stated values and business logic of the PRS network driven by substantial pent up demand and representing great market potential All of them can be built based on the PRS protocol There are many other similar ideas Hope that these examples can be used as inspiration for developers and entrepreneurs to do more exploration and innovation in the areas product and business models using their competitive advantage to create a market niche of their own 1 Stock photography pictures PRS500 A platform aggregates categorizes and recommends photos and images collected from photographers which allows image users to find what they need and run the contract to pay the photographer easily Product concept Photographers can link their social network identities and upload their work With PRS smart contracts they can customize various licensing models supporting different pricing models and ratios of shared revenue The photographers get paid without wasting energy on dealing with the trading request The website profits from a rational revenue share Several stock photography can co exist with different niche market positioning All signed contracts and revenue sharing details are transparent on the blockchain which is fair for the content producer and the distributor 2 Certificate authority service based on PRS PRSCA A 3rd party with credibility and a relevant reputation can

certification more 21 \x0cconvenient A certificate is also a piece of digital content All smart contacts using PRS can implement fee collecting authentication and certificate issuing processes All the authentication results and certificates will be released on the blockchain after signing by the certificate authority Were something to go wrong the incorrect record would be open to all and damage the reputation of the certification authority Such centralized institutions can co exist and compete which would make reputation a valuable asset to them 3 News aggregator like Hacker News PRS Digg Product concept Users can forward the good content they find in the PRS network and up vote their favourite content by spending PRS In the end all the revenue will be shared based on the associated contract For instance the user who forwards the content receives 30% of the revenue and 70% belongs to the creator of the content PRS Ecosystem Summary One of the ways blockchain is disruptive is how
