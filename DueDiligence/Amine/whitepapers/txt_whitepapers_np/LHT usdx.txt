principles of Continuous Integration and infrastructure and source code are constantly Continuous Delivery automating infrastructure monitored at every development stage This is changes propagation product build and done to prevent vulnerabilities and sensitive delivery These approaches which have information disclosure We collaborate closely already become standards of safe and reliable are successfully neutralized by the with the company which is a leader in the development allow us to mechanisms of blockchain information security industry \xe2\x80\x94 dramatically reduce the human error development is the safety of users personal data Many of the security threats inherent in legacy solutions technology (cryptographic signatures transaction history immutability multi signature Our developers architects and infrastructure engineers work closely with information security code and infrastructure We scan the project for possible vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual analysis for safety of our network we apply a every product update Before release the which will be discussed later bug and security fixes mavens coordinating all changes in the source approach) To guarantee the further number of additional practices \xe2\x80\x94 promptly deliver new versions of the product including product undergoes approximately forty types of checks including static & dynamic code analysis dependency and load testing \xe2\x80\x94 conduct continuous testing of the new features and identify problems in the early stages \x0cTEC HNOLOGIES Security Monitoring Infrastructure Authorization All services of our product are under constant In our infrastructure we actively use the solutions To guarantee the safety of user data and funds we supervision We track the following current provided by the Google Cloud Platform and AWS use two authorization mechanisms The first is a indicators of their health every sub second These provide many security tools to prevent a wide digital signature mechanism based on private and \xe2\x80\x94 CPU usage class of threats out of the box For example these public keys described below To make a \xe2\x80\x94 Memory consumption platforms update operating systems and transaction the user must have both his private key components on a regular basis preventing the and access to the device where he can get the possibility of the exploitation of known authorization code This separates our solution from vulnerabilities other blockchain projects in which compromising Our infrastructure is built on the technologies of the key leads to the loss of all assets The data is then aggregated and analyzed to Docker and Kubernetes Their containerization tools The second is a two factor authorization (2FA) identify potential problems such as an unexpected and flexible access policies allow us to isolate using the phone or push notifications Obtaining the increase in resources consumption or suspicious services safely and prevent threat escalation in case 2FA one time code includes several stages (the next activity Our team of system administrators works of service compromise step is performed if the code was not entered after 24/7 to resolve incidents and involves other Changes in the infrastructure are also subject to the previous one) members of the team (information security constant monitoring by information security 1 The code is sent as a push notification if this function is specialists developers) when necessary As a result specialists Our approach to Infrastructure as Code enabled by the user problems are resolved during the early stages (IaC) makes it easy to track any changes in the 2 The code is sent in the form of an SMS message to the infrastructure This is typically not available for most phone number specified during registration legacy products 3 The code is delivered using an automatic phone call \xe2\x80\x94 Network activity \xe2\x80\x94 Service events \xe2\x80\x94 etc which ensures service reliability \x0cTEC HNOLOGIES Key Management In the blockchain networks each time the user makes a transaction he signs it using his own private digital key and methods of asymmetric cryptography Without a signature a transaction won\xe2\x80\x99t be accepted by witnesses (verification nodes) Principle of Asymmetric Signature When the user creates an account he generates a pair of keys (public and private) As a When a transaction request is received blockchain performs several checks to make sure rule the private key is always generated on the client side and is never left in raw It is very that the transaction is correct It checks whether a user has enough funds to make a important to keep the private key secret as it gives full control of the user\ s funds and transaction whether the transaction expiration date has passed etc and the most important account On the contrary a public key is simply a derivative of a private key it could be is whether the transaction has been signed Knowing the user\ s public key blockchain could distributed publicly without any limitations During the registration process the public key is establish whether or not this transaction was made on behalf of the given user Essentially the stored in the blockchain bound to the user\ s account private key is used to create the signature and must be kept in secret and the public key is Later when the user makes a transaction he uses the private key to make a digital signature only suitable for verifying the signature and can be distributed openly for the transaction signing it along the way \x0cTEC HNOLOGIES Key Management Key storage problem The current level of computer technology provides strict requirements for private key length A In our application we use the Scrypt algorithm which was created specifically to make it as short key can be picked up by an attacker and a long key is not convenient for storage For difficult as possible to guess the password even using specialized hardware (ASIC) The example our network uses keys with a length of 256 bits Such a key is difficult to write Scrypt algorithm places a great demand on both the amount of RAM and the processor\ s down and impossible to remember To solve this problem the brain key methods are often performance when compared to the popular SHA algorithm for example This is not used in which the key is divided into blocks and each block is matched with a word from a noticeable when the algorithm needs to be executed once as in the case of creating an sufficiently large dictionary In this case the user needs to remember not 256 arbitrary account on a mobile application but it becomes a significant problem for the brute force symbols but merely 12 words This simplifies the task but is still too complex as compared to attack It makes the process of password brute forcing unprofitable in terms of cost When standard methods of password authorization Another approach is to store a key as a file on using ASIC it is possible to easily scale the computing power but not RAM and in the case a computer or a mobile device It\xe2\x80\x99s really simple but how can this file be protected so that a of brute force attacks using conventional computers the amount of RAM can be increased hacker or a malicious program could not access it quite simply but it is much more difficult to scale performance In our system keys are generated when a user registers an account and are never left in the Therefore we get the same level of brute force attack resistance as with a 256 bit key and raw (unencrypted) To solve the key storage problem described earlier we use a strong the user gets access to their funds using the usual password authorization To further facilitate encryption algorithm that allows the user to securely save his key on a mobile device with a the authorization process we have introduced the ability to login using a PIN That is after password of his choice Reasonable questions may arise about whether a password of the first authorization the user can create a PIN code and then securely log in on the same 10 15 characters is capable of resisting a brute force attack as efficiently as a 256 bit key device using the code without having to enter the password every time If powerful encryption is used then the password will certainly be capable \x0cMARKE TING Marketing and promotion We completed the beta testing stage in January 2018 MVP was launched in We already had advertising campaigns on several platforms and in
