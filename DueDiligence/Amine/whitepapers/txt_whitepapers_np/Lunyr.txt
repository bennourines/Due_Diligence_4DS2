Ethereum\xc2\xadbased decentralized crowdsourced encyclopedia which rewards users with app tokens for peer\xc2\xadreviewing and contributing information We aim to be the starting point of the internet for finding reliable accurate information Our long\xc2\xadterm vision is to develop a knowledge base API that developers can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence Virtual Reality Augmented Reality and more Market A strategic component of the Lunyr platform is its advertising system which allows for the purchase of advertising on the platform using Lunyr tokens (\xe2\x80\x9cLUN\xe2\x80\x9d) Although the Lunyr platform is unique in its design decentralization and vision it can be compared to Wikipedia Wikipedia today ranks as the sixth most visited site in the world according to Alexa rankings1 It attracts 470 million unique visitors who view over 19 billion pages per 2 month Estimating the amount of advertising revenue Wikipedia could generate if it allowed advertising on its pages provides clues to the potential demand for LUN \xe2\x97\x8f In 2006 Jason Calcanis the cofounder of Weblogs Inc which was acquired by AOL published an article about Wikipedia estimating an annual advertising 3 revenue potential of $100MM 1 2 3 Alexa is an Amazon com company that provides commercial web traffic data and analytics Band Jonathan and Gerafi Jonathan 2013 \xe2\x80\x9cWikipedia\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Value \xe2\x80\x9d Rochester NY Social Science Research Network Calcanis Jason Wikipedia leaves $100M on the table (or PLEASE Jimbo reconsider\xe2\x80\x93media philanthropy could change the world ) Calacanis com 28 Oct 2006 5 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f In 2008 BusinessInsider com performed an analysis of Wikipedia and arrived at 4 an annual advertising revenue potential of $350MM \xe2\x97\x8f In 2011 Vincent Juhel published a thesis about Wikipedia for HEC Paris and 5 arrived at an annual advertising revenue potential of $1 6 billion dollars Vision We will initially focus on fine\xc2\xadtuning the system to improve accuracy increase content and grow readership Once the knowledge base matures we will attract a wider audience by encouraging contributions of near real\xc2\xadtime data on world events and translations in multiple languages Ultimately Lunyr intends to establish its brand globally as a reliable accurate decentralized knowledge base Taking it a step further we will grow the ecosystem by developing an API that will attract developers This Lunyr API will allow developers to use the knowledge base as a backbone for creating next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence Virtual Reality Augmented Reality and more Lunyr API The Lunyr API holds promise for significantly changing existing business models and creating new ones The Ethereum blockchain currently has no knowledge of the real world yet most useful applications require real world information Through the Lunyr API decentralized applications will be able to tap into the knowledge base and grab accurate data on real world events and information This leads to immediate benefits for 4 5 http //www businessinsider com/companies/wikipedia Vincent Juhel Valorisation du benevolat sur Wikipedia (2011) (master\xe2\x80\x99s thesis HEC Paris) 6 \x0cArtificial Intelligence Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence projects similar to Siri or Amazon Echo are enhanced with the Lunyr API When users ask fact\xc2\xadbased questions the decentralized application can dig through the Lunyr knowledge base and provide users with reliable accurate answers Virtual Reality The Lunyr API will enhance the intimate and visceral experience of interactive virtual worlds Imagine putting on a virtual reality headset that lets you experience walking on the surface of Mars As you walk along the cold red\xc2\xaddusted ground information about key landmarks and giant dust storms appear All of this information is drawn from the knowledge base Augmented Reality The Lunyr API can be the foundation for learning\xc2\xadbased applications in Augmented Reality Imagine you are at the beach on a sunny day and you see beautiful flowers by the seashore You want to know what they are so you put on augmented reality glasses which will identify the flowers tap into the knowledge base and give you all the information you need to satisfy your curiosity Problem Current crowdsourced knowledge bases face problems with centralization censorship and inaccuracy Centralization Centralized systems represent single points of failure controlled by central authorities Individuals relying on these systems must trust that authorities will not abuse their power to forward self\xc2\xadserving agendas Yet resisting the temptation to abuse power is difficult in practice for even the most respected authorities In 2012 Wikipedia deliberately shut down for 24 hours to protest against internet piracy laws preventing individuals worldwide from accessing any information6 Censorship Centralized systems are vulnerable to censorship Governments ruling through oppression exert control over citizens by prohibiting access to free knowledge Syria ranks among the governments where internet censorship is pervasive Syria blocks 6 Lee Edward \xe2\x80\x9cDay Wikipedia Went Dark Boston Review 18 Jan 2013 7 \x0cwebsites for political reasons and arrests those who access them7 Previously Syria blocked the Arabic Wikipedia from all Internet Service Providers in the country prohibiting even university students from accessing Wikipedia8 Inaccuracy On Wikipedia many articles can be edited by anyone with an internet connection Therefore users can easily falsify information Although popular articles with inaccuracies are likely to be quickly corrected less popular articles can go uncorrected for months For example John Seigenthaler a former assistant to U S Senator Robert Kennedy was falsely implicated in the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers on his Wikipedia biography for over four months9 Solution Lunyr\xe2\x80\x99s innovative platform solves the problems of centralization censorship and inaccuracy seen in current knowledge bases Decentralization The Lunyr platform is built on top of Ethereum and is therefore decentralized censorship\xc2\xadresistant and autonomous No single point of failure exists No central authority or middle man owns or can corrupt the information The rules in which people interact with the knowledge base and with one another are mutually agreed upon and enforced through smart contracts which are publicly verifiable on the blockchain Token Incentive System Ethereum enables the creation of app tokens which can be used in an incentive system to replace intermediaries In Lunyr\xe2\x80\x99s system tokens play a key role in providing economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in common good Unlike in Wikipedia where volunteers must donate their time to contribute and validate information in Lunyr\xe2\x80\x99s platform contributors are rewarded for their work and are incentivized to continue increasing the value of the ecosystem Mandatory Peer Review Drive\xc2\xadby vandalism and corruption are eliminated in the Lunyr platform All content submissions go through a mandatory peer review process and are not committed to the knowledge base until validated for reliability and accuracy A powerful incentive system enabled by app tokens ensures that peer reviewers act in the best interest of the https //freedomhouse org/report/freedom\xc2\xadnet/2015/syria Arabic Wikipedia Disappears From The Internet in Syria Menassat 19 May 2008 9 Seigenthaler John A false Wikipedia \ biography\ USA Today 29 Nov 2005 7 8 8 \x0cecosystem Platform Design Lunyr\xe2\x80\x99s innovative platform design aligns each individual\xe2\x80\x99s rational economic behavior with benefitting the whole ecosystem Peer Review The contributor\xe2\x80\x99s workflow begins with adding or editing information in the knowledge base in hopes of receiving rewards Each contributor\xe2\x80\x99s submission costs gas so flooding the system with junk has its economic limits just as in Ethereum All submissions go through a mandatory peer review process and are not committed to the knowledge base unless approved Every submission requires sources for reviewers to validate the submission\xe2\x80\x99s reliability and accuracy Hence spam fake or malicious content will be filtered out Every user who submits a contribution is also required to peer review other 9 \x0csubmissions We use Machine Learning to match peer reviewers with topics with which they will likely be familiar Submissions are not committed unless they pass the judgment of multiple peer reviewers It is crucial that peer reviewers are also contributors to ensure that only individuals who are economically aligned with the well being of the ecosystem are able to peer review submissions Bad actors who try to attack the system will be fighting against legions of good actors driven by a powerful incentive system App Tokens Once the submission passes peer review the contributor is rewarded Contribution (CBN) and Honor (HNR) tokens Neither CBN nor HNR can be transferred to other individuals which ensures that only users who have committed to the well\xc2\xadbeing of the ecosystem hold CBN and HNR CBN are used to calculate how many LUN an individual will be rewarded for the current reward period CBN are automatically consumed after LUN rewards are distributed for the two\xc2\xadweek reward period LUN are used to purchase advertising on the platform HNR is used to propose and vote on issues in the Dispute and Resolution system It is consumed upon use Dispute and Resolution The dispute and resolution system exists to solve any content and quality issues that slipped through the peer review system Issues such as malicious content vandalism and content reorganization are dealt with here Proposals and votes cost HNR It is important that HNR is only held by users who have committed to the ecosystem to align their proposal and voting behavior with increasing the value of the ecosystem LUN Pool LUN rewards come from a pool of LUN that accumulates and is distributed to contributors at the end of every two\xc2\xadweek reward period The number of LUN that an individual contributor is rewarded is based on the percent of total CBN they hold by the end of each two\xc2\xadweek period Smart contracts ensure that the distribution will be handled with transparency and fairness The LUN Pool comes from two sources \xe2\x97\x8f New LUN that are created and distributed periodically at two\xc2\xadweek intervals \xe2\x97\x8f LUN that are used to purchase advertising The supply of LUN grows at an annual rate of 3% of the initial token supply This growth 10 \x0cwill not start until the Beta release on the Mainnet These additional LUN provide fuel for the ecosystem to grow in the beginning At the same time the effective inflation decreases over time towards zero also known as disinflation Lunyr receives 15% of the LUN pool each two\xc2\xadweek period This allocation aligns Lunyr\xe2\x80\x99s incentive with growing the ecosystem Since Lunyr\xe2\x80\x99s primary source of value is in LUN Lunyr\xe2\x80\x99s well\xc2\xadbeing is tied to the well\xc2\xadbeing of the ecosystem Therefore the rational behavior of Lunyr is to continually upgrade and improve the ecosystem so that it grows in value for all participants Outside the LUN pool Lunyr may sell additional LUN to purchasers in the future It may do so through exchanges the blockchain or in other ways Lunyr may make changes to the size of the LUN pool LUN distribution and other related matters that it believes in its reasonable judgment are beneficial to the LUN platform growth and development or it considers reasonable under the circumstances Keep in mind that any corrupt behavior would be irrational for Lunyr to do Lunyr will be holding onto LUN and any decisions that dilute the value of LUN and devalue the knowledge base would be harmful to Lunyr Advertising LUN are used to place advertisements on the platform The ads are text\xc2\xadbased such as those seen in Quora We use Machine Learning to make ads content\xc2\xadaware Ads are not committed to the platform until they pass through the mandatory peer review system Ads are a crucial component of the Lunyr ecosystem They create a powerful demand for LUN from those with financial resources Ads provide the economic force that drives network effects as more contributors and readers join the ecosystem

through a Crowdsale LUN may be purchased during the Crowdsale pursuant to a Presale Purchase Agreement at an expected distribution of 44 LUN per Ether LUN are purchased by sending Ether to the 13 \x0cCrowdsale token contract according to our instructions The Crowdsale will aim to begin March 29 2017 at 16 00 UTC and continue for four weeks or until the maximum number of LUN are purchased The actual start and end time will depend on Ethereum block numbers which will be announced on the Lunyr community channels If the Crowdsale fails to result in a minimum number of LUN then Ether sent to purchase LUN will be returned The Crowdsale token contract address to which Ether will be sent to purchase LUN according to our instructions and start and end block numbers will be announced on the following channels \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Website lunyr com Github github com/lunyr Subreddit reddit com/r/lunyr Slack lunyr\xc2\xadcommunity

overall initial distribution of LUN will be as follows \xe2\x97\x8b 78% for Crowdsale purchasers \xe2\x97\x8b 15% for Lunyr founders employees and advisors distributed to a time\xc2\xadlocked vault that prohibits LUN transfers for 180 days \xe2\x97\x8b 5% for marketing and promotion distributed to the Lunyr multisig wallet \xe2\x97\x8b 2% for Bug Bounty distributed to the Lunyr multisig wallet Crowdsale Token Contract Guidelines Before the Crowdsale \xe2\x97\x8b Any Ether sent to the token contract will be rejected During the Crowdsale \xe2\x97\x8b Any Ether sent to the token contract according to our instructions will result in an allocation of LUN to the purchaser at a distribution of 44 LUN per Ether \xe2\x97\x8b LUN cannot be transferred during the Crowdsale period 15 \x0cAfter the Crowdsale \xe2\x97\x8b Users may transfer LUN to another address \xe2\x97\x8b The crowdsale token contract creates additional tokens to arrive at the token supply distribution \xe2\x97\x8b The Lunyr Token contract is now finalized however upgraded releases of the token contract adding core features and improvements are to be expected Security Audit Lunyr is committed to ensuring the security of its platform With each product release on the Mainnet Lunyr commits to performing a security audit with both internal and external reviewers Additionally there will be a Bug Bounty program that rewards developers for finding security and other related issues Funding Usage Breakdown 16 \x0cDISCLAIMER NOT AN OFFER TO SOLICIT SECURITIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LUN AND THE LUNYR APPLICATION Last Updated March 7 2017 This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to sell shares or securities in Lunyr Inc or any related or associated company Any such offer or solicitation would only be made by a confidential offering memorandum and in accordance with applicable securities and other laws None of the information or analyses presented are intended to form the basis for any investment decision and no specific recommendations are intended Accordingly this document does not constitute investment advice or counsel or solicitation for investment in any security This document does not constitute or form part of and should not be construed as any offer for sale or subscription of or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for any securities nor should it or any part of it form the basis of or be relied on in any connection with any contract or commitment whatsoever Lunyr expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from (i) reliance on any information contained in this document (ii) any error omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting therefrom The Lunyr token or \xe2\x80\x9cLUN\xe2\x80\x9d is a cryptographic token used by the Lunyr application LUN is not a cryptocurrency At the time of this writing (i) with the exception of being used to place ads on the Lunyr platform LUN cannot be exchanged for goods or services (ii) LUN has no known uses outside the Lunyr application and (iii) LUN cannot be traded on any known exchanges LUN is not an investment There is no guarantee \xe2\x80\x93 indeed there is no reason to believe \xe2\x80\x93 that the LUN you purchase will increase in value It may \xe2\x80\x93 and probably will at some point \xe2\x80\x93 decrease in value Those who do not actually use their LUN honestly and fairly may lose their right to use LUN and may lose their LUN to those that do use LUN honestly and fairly 17 \x0cLUN is not evidence of ownership or right to control Controlling LUN does not grant its controller ownership or equity in Lunyr or the Lunyr application LUN does not grant any right to participate in the control direction or decision making of Lunyr or the Lunyr application RISK DISCLOSURES 1) Risk of Losing Access to LUN Due to Loss of Credentials The purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s LUN may be associated with a Lunyr account until they are distributed to the purchaser The Lunyr account can only be accessed with login credentials selected by the purchaser The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of LUN Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one or more backup locations geographically separated from the working location 2) Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol LUN and the Lunyr application are based on the Ethereum protocol As such any malfunction unintended function unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum protocol may cause the Lunyr application or LUN to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner Ether the native unit of account of the Ethereum protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to LUN and also other ways More information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http //www ethereum org 3) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials Any third party that gains access to or learns of the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s LUN To minimize this risk the purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices 4) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world The functioning of the Lunyr application and LUN could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions including the licensing of or restrictions on the use sale or possession of digital tokens like LUN which could impede limit or end the development of the Lunyr application 5) Risk of Alternative Unofficial Lunyr Application Following the Crowdsale and the development of the initial version of the LUN platform it is possible that alternative applications could be established which use the same open source code and protocol underlying the Lunyr application The official Lunyr application may compete with these alternative unofficial LUN\xc2\xadbased applications 18 \x0cwhich could potentially negatively impact the Lunyr application and LUN including its value 6) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Lunyr Application or Distributed Applications It is possible that the Lunyr application will not be used by a large number of businesses individuals and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications Such a lack of interest could negatively impact LUN and the Lunyr application 7) Risk that the Lunyr Application As Developed Will Not Meet the Expectations of Lunyr or the Purchaser The Lunyr application is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and functionality of the Lunyr application or LUN (including participant behavior) held by Lunyr or the purchaser may not be met upon release for any number of reasons including mistaken assumptions or analysis a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the Lunyr application 8) Risk of Theft and Hacking Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to interfere with the Lunyr application or the availability of LUN in any number of ways including service attacks Sybil attacks spoofing smurfing malware attacks or consensus based attacks 9) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the LUN Application Core Infrastructure Software The Lunyr application consists of open source software that is based on other open source software There is a risk that the Lunyr team or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Lunyr application interfering with the use of or causing the loss of LUN 10) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography Advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Lunyr platform which could result in the theft or loss of LUN 11) Risk of LUN Mining Attacks 19 \x0cAs with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies the blockchain used for the Lunyr application is susceptible to mining attacks including double\xc2\xadspend attacks majority mining power attacks \xe2\x80\x9cselfish\xc2\xadmining\xe2\x80\x9d attacks and race condition attacks Any successful attacks present a risk to the Lunyr application LUN and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations Despite the efforts of the Lunyr team the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists 12) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Lunyr Application While LUN should not be viewed as an investment it may have value over time That value may be limited if the Lunyr application lacks use and adoption If this becomes the case there may be few or no markets following the launch of the platform potentially having an adverse impact on LUN 13) Risk of an Illiquid Market for LUN There very well may never be a secondary market for LUN There are currently no exchanges upon which LUN would trade If ever exchanges do develop they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight They may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established regulated exchanges for other products and have a negative impact on LUN 14) Risk of Uninsured Losses Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions funds held using the Lunyr application or Ethereum network are generally uninsured In the event of any loss there is no public insurer such as the FDIC or private insurer to offer recourse to the purchaser 15) Risk of Dissolution of the Lunyr Project It is possible that due to any number of reasons including an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether development issues with the Lunyr application the failure of business relationships or competing intellectual property claims the Lunyr project may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch 16) Risk of Malfunction in the Lunyr Application It is possible that the Lunyr application malfunctions in an unfavorable way including one that results in the loss of LUN 17) Unanticipated Risks Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology In addition to the risks discussed in this White Paper there are risks that the Lunyr team cannot anticipate 20 \x0cFurther risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks 21 \x0c
