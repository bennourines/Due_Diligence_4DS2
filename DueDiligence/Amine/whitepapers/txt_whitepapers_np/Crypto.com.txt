b Crypto com Chain The next generation decentralized mobile payment protocol {chain contribute}@crypto com September 17 2019 v0 5 0 Abstract The development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies represent a cryptography and security breakthrough as significant as that created by the internet in the 1990s This technology however is still at a very nascent stage in order to generate mass adoption it will therefore be necessary to find compelling real life use cases that can appeal to an audience larger than the small group of industry professionals and experts We believe that enabling cryptocurrency spending in the real world will constitute an adoption catalyst Current traditional payment institutions and existing blockchains have failed to provide a secure scalable and decentralized solution to support cryptocurrency payment Accordingly we propose Crypto com Chain the next generation decentralized mobile payment protocol the most efficient and secure way to pay and be paid in crypto anywhere any crypto at little to no cost Crypto com Chain will deliver on its vision by developing innovative technology components and processes (inc scalable encryption algorithm to protect users privacy utilizing trusted execution environments sustainable price stability mechanisms user protection via PoGSD) catered specifically to cryptocurrency payment while

Conclusion 2 \x0c1 Introduction to Crypto com Chain Current traditional payment infrastructure and existing blockchain powered payment networks have failed to provide a wide spread easy to integrate and fast settlement of cryptocurrency in the real world The key limitations of existing payment network infrastructures are that they 1 Do not integrate with cryptocurrencies systematically 2 Do not give access to either customers or merchants a way to reconcile the numbers in a trustless way 3 Are vulnerable due to being the central point of failure 4 Are expensive to operate 5 Give low limits on cryptocurrency spending by default Moreover the key limitations of existing blockchain powered payment networks are that they are 1 Too complex to setup and use 2 Not friendly to crypto first timers 3 Rarely supported beyond their own blockchain Our vision is to accelerate the world\ s development adoption of and transition to cryptocurrency Crypto com Chain is the best way to pay and be paid in crypto anywhere anytime and using any crypto \xe2\x80\x94 at little to no cost 2 Design Axioms Crypto com Chain the next generation decentralized mobile payment protocol will be designed based on the following foundational Design Axioms ( DAn ) listed in order of priority ( DAi > DAi+1 ) DA1 Secure \xe2\x97\x8b Protect from fraud \xe2\x97\x8b Highly compliant DA2 Highly Scalable & Fast

transaction validation DA6 Inclusive \xe2\x97\x8b Seamless integration of new acquirers or customer/merchant with low technical barriers appropriate incentives and strict penalties Decentralized ledger technology such as blockchain provides key built in benefits that are aligned with Crypto com Chain Design Axioms \xe2\x97\x8f it handles double spend naturally \xe2\x97\x8f it makes reconciliation easier (it even \xe2\x80\x98removes\xe2\x80\x99 the need for reconciliation as long as the blockchain is properly structured) it facilitates open collaboration \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f it is more inclusive anyone can join the network it lowers the likelihood of central point of failure \xe2\x97\x8f 3 Architecture Overview Building a blockchain is not just about software/hardware development Rather it is a combination of technological design incentive mechanism game 4 \x0ctheory and governance which together nourish a robust system that also allows for continuous innovation Our initially proposed architecture may hence undergo future revisions in response to changes in incentives governance or other external requirements As Crypto com Chain is intended for mobile payments our proposed architecture needs to reflect the inherently federated nature The network consists of nodes arranged in different layers each of which is designed to serve the different needs of different users This architecture is proposed in line with our Design Axioms where DA1 and DA2 are of the highest priority The different node types their permissions and responsibilities are summarised in the table below Node type Who can run it Rights and obligations Requirements Council Nodes Initially Crypto com Council Nodes have the following \xe2\x97\x8f Post CRO collateral

\xe2\x97\x8f Verify related transactions \xe2\x97\x8f Read data Crypto com Chain is open to the public to join participate and scrutinise related transactions We do not expect that for example mobile clients will be able to perform heavy lifting tasks and have a reliable always online network connection For that reason and DA2 the capabilities of Community Nodes are different from those of other node types Trusted Execution Environments In order to address DA1 DA2 DA3 and DA5 the core functionality of Crypto com Chain Nodes is designed to run in secure enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) TEEs such as Intel SGX Arm TrustZone or Keystone1 are extended CPU instruction sets that isolate code executed in an enclave from the host operating system in hardware encrypted RAM TEEs ensure that even the node administrator cannot see private data that enclave code works with Note that enclave code must still follow secure coding practices in order to avoid leaks through memory access patterns etc An important feature of TEEs is their local and remote attestation This feature enables nodes or external parties to verify that the code they plan to 1 An ongoing open source project for RISC V https //keystone enclave org 6 \x0cinteract with is indeed the certified Crypto com Chain code In case of remote attestation each node completes this step before establishing secure communication channels with other nodes In Crypto com Chain design TEEs can find several compelling use cases 1 Sealing ledger data While all transaction data can be distributed to any node for processing humans (even node administrators) cannot view these data in their raw form 2 \xe2\x80\x9cVirtual\xe2\x80\x9d hardware wallets Community nodes can utilize Ledger Trustlet2 like software to protect their private keys 3 Payment protocol enhancements TEEs have gained popularity in blockchain systems research as they can offer high transaction throughputs with low latency 4 Witnessing external data For data from oracles or other blockchain networks TEEs can be used to attest data authenticity In the light of Foreshadow3 attack Crypto com Chain will not rely solely on TEEs for achieving DA1 and DA5 we will also consider other measures including the following \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Double attestation scheme As employed by Tesseract4 decentralized exchange this scheme protects against potential weaknesses in TEE remote attestation CRO collaterals Additional cryptographic measures for maintaining privacy Writing core parts in Rust5\xe2\x80\x996 a programming language that ensures memory safety and freedom of data races Consensus Council Nodes run a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol among themselves which resolves the final order of transaction sequences The 2 https //github com/LedgerHQ/bolos tee 3 https //foreshadowattack eu https //eprint iacr org/2017/1153 pdf https //github com/baidu/rust sgx sdk#rust sgx sdk https //edp fortanix com 4 5 6 7 \x0cinitial prototype will utilize the Tendermint Core7 consensus engine Tendermint works well for PoS / PoA networks allows high transaction throughputs and provides instant transaction finality on block commitment which aligns well with DA2 It was chosen as the consensus engine for the Chain prototype due to the following additional reasons \xe2\x97\x8f Backed by formal research8 \xe2\x97\x8f Robustly tested implementation9 \xe2\x97\x8f Track record of adoption10 including Binance DEX \xe2\x97\x8f Modular architecture In addition to transaction ordering Council Nodes maintain a transparent audit log of Merchant Acquirer Customer Acquirer and Council Node identity changes (external gateway IPs public key certificates etc ) Whenever a Node identity is added updated or revoked according to a specified policy at least 67% of Council Nodes need to approve this change To ensure a decentralized and robust audit log we will explore the use of a skipchain a shared authenticated data structure proposed in Chainiac11 Moreover to facilitate a high availability the total number of Council Nodes in different locations will be required to be greater than a minimum set that is based on real performance tests Governance Council Nodes are responsible for the governance of the network The Crypto com Chain Entity will propose software upgrades for approval by Council Nodes Following a software upgrade approval and release any nodes on the network that fail to upgrade after a specified grace period will be considered as having dropped out of the network voluntarily Security As it is a public network security (DA1) and robustness are critical requirements Threat modeling is a systematic approach to find potential 7 https //tendermint com https

8 8 \x0cthreats by decomposing and enumerating system components There are many different methodologies and/or frameworks when conducting threat modeling such as STRIDE DREAD Attack Tree etc In our case our Threat Model is based on STRIDE and Attack Tree STRIDE provides a set of security threats in six categories 1 2 3 4 5 6 Spoofing Impersonating the identity of another Tampering Data is changed by an attacker Repudiation An attacker refuses to confirm an action was conducted Information Disclosure Exposing sensitive information Denial of Service Degrade the availability or performance of the system Elevation of Privilege For each category we enumerate all the potential threats by breaking down a high level goal into more specific sub goals in a way similar to attack tree enumeration And in each sub goal we set the risk level by combining the Severity and Exploitability of the item Severity \xe2\x97\x8f 5 Severe impact on the whole system \xe2\x97\x8f 4 High impact on the whole system \xe2\x97\x8f 3 Moderate impact on the whole system or Severe impact on individual user/node \xe2\x97\x8f 2 High impact on individual user/node \xe2\x97\x8f 1 Moderate impact on individual user/node Exploitability \xe2\x97\x8f 5 Existing exploit code available \xe2\x97\x8f 4 Relatively easy to exploit \xe2\x97\x8f 3 Attack is practical but not easy a successful attack may require some special conditions \xe2\x97\x8f 2 Theoretically possible but difficult in practice \xe2\x97\x8f 1 Very difficult to exploit \xe2\x97\x8f 0 1 Almost impossible Assets 1 The integrity of the account balance the most important piece of information in the blockchain 9 \x0c2 Validator secret keys (block signing keys of Council Nodes) one of the most powerful keys lost 1/3 of these keys will render the whole system to an unstable state 3 User secret keys key owner implies fund owner 4 Transaction encryption keys transaction privacy of the system relies on the secrecy of this key Scope The whole Crypto com Chain is a complex system and involves many different components And therefore the scope of this threat model is limited only to the major components of the system To be more specific the threat modeling of Tendermint and Intel SGX is not in the scope of this threat modeling We also assume standard security measures such as OS level hardening software patching anti virus network firewalls physical security etc are properly implemented executed and monitored These mitigation strategies are not mentioned here Threat Model The initial threat model can be found here Privacy As TEEs are used the data inside secure enclaves is protected even the node administrators cannot directly view raw transaction data on their nodes To further enhance privacy capabilities (addressing DA1 and DA5) Crypto com Chain will include other software based measures in case of secure enclave breaches The initial prototype will utilize tree signatures12 for threshold multi signatures which provide a good trade off between privacy and accountability Furthermore we will potentially explore employing other techniques such as additively homomorphic commitments (as used for example in Confidential Transactions13) where data remains private even in the case of secure enclave breaches and its processed parts can be securely and verifiably exposed for third party auditing

Merchant Acquirers are onboarded only if they are able to pass the Crypto com KYC check14 and comply with KYC standards when they onboard downstream customers and/or merchants As mentioned in the Consensus section CRO may utilize a Chainiac15style skipchain for robust and decentralized audit logging Acquirer Nodes\xe2\x80\x99 KYC check metadata identities and policies for updating associated keys will be stored in an entry on the skipchain Consumers and merchants (through Community nodes) will also be able to have an entry attesting their identity on the skipchain after passing KYC (performed by Acquirer or Crypto com Chain Entities) The associated keys could be stored in the user\xe2\x80\x99s mobile phone or other devices that interact with the CRO network Merchants whose access is provided through Merchant Acquirer Nodes may maintain their real world identity by linking their existing X 509 certificates The associated private keys can be securely stored in the TEE of the mobile device and interacted with via the CRO Mobile Wallet App In this way private keys of consumers and merchants cannot be directly read and can only be used in a restricted way via mobile app interactions with the \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual\xe2\x80\x9d hardware wallet Certain transaction types may require the wallet address to be associated with a valid entry in the skipchain In the scenario where a mobile device is lost the corresponding Acquirer or Crypto com Chain Entity would be able to update the skipchain entry according to the set policy The consumer or merchant will either restore the corresponding wallet on a new device or request an identity update with a new associated key pair Crypto com Chain Entity and Acquirer nodes will be responsible for updating or revoking corresponding identities on the skipchain 14 Or in future pass KYC check of any entity that runs other services 15 https //eprint iacr org/2017/648 pdf 11 \x0c4 Settlement & Price Stability Routed & Direct Settlement Routed Settlement For transactions conducted through Acquirer Nodes the acquirers will be responsible for settling the funds downstream with customers (debit) and merchants (credit) Direct Settlement Customers and merchants who establish their own Community Nodes and who have enough CRO staked and registered Settlement Accounts will be able to settle directly through the Crypto com Chain with the same float account requirements and rules as Acquirers Nodes This settlement option provides several benefits 1 Faster downstream settlement the moment the counterparty settles the customers and merchants with Community Nodes will settle automatically 2 Inclusive network enabling anyone to leverage the power of the Crypto com Chain network 3 Transparency even for Community Nodes that do not meet the settlement requirements but have declared linkage to one of the Acquirer Nodes they would be able to witness all (encrypted) transactions going through the Crypto com Chain Network and decrypt those that concerning them As a result customers and merchants will not have to rely on acquirers\xe2\x80\x99 report to check whether a transaction has been processed The escrow service \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Goods & Services Delivered\xe2\x80\x9d (PoGSD) will rely on the multi signature wallets and collaterals in the CRO Protocol If a customer decides to pay a merchant without a collateral or who is not on the CRO network the CRO Mobile Wallet App will display a warning that PoGSD is not available before the transaction occurs 12 \x0cSettlement Agents Cryptocurrency asset class is nascent and volatile Merchants are however looking for price stability to manage and forecast their PnL To increase cryptocurrency acceptance among merchants it is key to be able to provide them with price stable conversion post settlement options Settlement Agents will perform this service via CRO currency conversion to currencies deemed stable (transaction details including rates will be recorded on chain settlement will happen off chain) To become eligible Settlement Agents will need to 1 Guarantee at least better conversion rate than the Crypto com Chain benchmark16 for a defined period of time and 2 Stake CRO tokens Settlement Agents will receive CRO tokens in exchange for other currencies at settlement times The extra amount would be added to the 2 of3 lock setup during the exchange process and used as an escrow fee payment in the case of disputes Settlement Currencies All transactions on the Crypto com Chain are performed using the native blockchain token CRO As a customer you will be able to pay using any cryptocurrency paired with CRO Following the transaction authorization the customer acquirer will deduct the equivalent CRO amount in your selected cryptocurrency wallet for future settlement with the merchant As a merchant you will be paid by default in CRO tokens however you will have the ability to convert on the spot to currencies deemed stable (inc stable coins and fiat currencies) Settlement Agents (detailed below) will perform the conversion for merchants and hedge their risk Settlement time is expected to be around T+0 for crypto conversion and T+2 for fiat conversion 16 This benchmark will be likely be calculated using a verified external price source collected using an oracle 13 \x0cSettlement Process Each Acquirer Community17 or Settlement Agent Node18 can maintain their balances by processing blocks that include transactions relevant to them Transaction relevance can be checked using a fixed sized probabilistic filter which tags each block In the absence of a Settlement Agent a customer or his/her acquirer can directly send a transaction that outputs an amount locked for a corresponding merchant and its acquirer Depending on the situation the customer may optionally choose to lock the output with a threshold condition using the escrow service Using a Settlement Agent introduces a counterparty risk between Settlement Agents and Merchant Acquirers This risk is mitigated in the following ways \xe2\x97\x8f Merchant Acquirer nodes maintain a whitelist of Settlement Agents This allows Merchant Acquirers to choose among Settlement Agents they trust \xe2\x97\x8f Involved parties will follow this settlement flow (1) Customer sends CRO to a Customer Acquirer or to a Merchant Acquirer (depending on the setup) (2) Customer Acquirer locks CRO in a multi signature address which can release the CRO to the Settlement Agent when 2 out of 3 signatures (Settlement Agent signature Merchant Acquirer signature Escrow Agent signature) are met Scenario A \xe2\x80\x9cThe good flow\xe2\x80\x9d (A3) Settlement Agent sends corresponding fiat (e g USD) to Merchant Acquirer (A4) Settlement Agent creates a transaction to release CRO and this transaction is co signed by the Settlement Agent and Merchant Acquirer 17 18 For direct settlements For with Settlement Agent trades 14 \x0c(Merchant Acquirer settles with their Merchants based on their existing arrangements e g on a monthly basis ) Scenario B Disputed by Settlement Agent (B3) Settlement Agent sends fiat currency to Merchant Acquirer but the Merchant Acquirer refuses to co sign the fund release transaction (B4) Settlement Agent provides proof to the involved Escrow Agent that the fiat transfer has occurred (B5) If the proof is satisfactory both the Escrow Agent and Settlement Agent will sign the confirmation message to release the CRO to the Settlement Agent Scenario C Disputed by Merchant Acquirer If the Settlement Agent fails to send fiat to the Merchant Acquirer and this behaviour repeats several times Merchant Acquirer could remove the Settlement Agent from its whitelist and (C3) Merchant Acquirer contacts the Escrow entity (C4) After the Escrow verifies the situation both Merchant Acquirer and Escrow Agent create a reverse transaction to release the CRO instead to Merchant Acquirer and co sign the transaction Similar flows are followed in interactions between Settlement Agents and Customer Acquirers When other cryptocurrencies are involved similar escrow arrangements and atomic swaps can be employed 15 \x0cTransaction Flow Summary 16 \x0c17 \x0c5 Block Structure & Incentives The details described in this section as with other technical aspects of the Crypto com Chain are subject to revision The described data structures only highlight a subset of end user metadata that will be exchanged in protocol messages among relevant nodes The exact details handling etc will depend on interactions with the underlying consensus layer privacy and security mechanisms Data Structure Payment Transaction Data Structure The accounting model in the initial prototype of Crypto com Chain prototype will follow the UTXO model similar to Bitcoin except that Chain\xe2\x80\x99s transaction output locking will be more restrictive (addressing DA1 and DA2) The overall accounting model is however a mixed version where staking related utilize accounts (see technical documentation for details) The committed transaction included in a block will include at least these parts A Raw transaction data encrypted against a verifiable shared secret of Council Nodes B Hash of the raw transaction data Moreover depending on the implementation it may additionally include references to past data that needed to be fetched for transaction validation purposes Part A) Raw transaction data will never be revealed directly as discussed in Privacy The following encrypted data may contain additional obfuscation to prevent data leaks in case of TEE access policy breaches 1 Transaction data a Transaction inputs b Transaction outputs 2 An access policy of what can be exposed to whom and under what circumstances from the raw transaction data (enforced by TEEs) This access policy will refer to one time keys related to a The customer\xe2\x80\x99s wallet b The merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wallet c The optional escrow service provider (PoGSD) d Related Acquirer Nodes 18 \x0c3 Transaction metadata this includes versioning information network identifier and metadata related to the use of external currencies 4 Collective witness including signatures on the transaction\xe2\x80\x99s ID against each transaction input To communicate transaction data across the network to related parties interim state transactions will contain some of the above mentioned data In order to address DA6 all transaction data will be serialized in a backwards and forwards compatible way using a well established binary format (the initial prototype will utilize the Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little Endian binary codec defined in Section B 1 of Polkadot RE Protocol Specification) this will help to ensure the ease and consistency of implementations across different programming languages used in third party integrations Transaction Flows Proof of Goods & Services Delivered Scenario A The item is shipped A1) Normal If the buyer confirms and accepts the delivered item he/she can complete the purchase by co signing the transaction to the merchant with his/her signature A2) Payment dispute (escrow/acquirer involved) If the merchant has not received the payment after a certain period of time he/she can contact and provide evidence of delivery to the escrow Once it has been confirmed the transaction will be co signed by the escrow and the funds will be released to the merchant Scenario B The item is not shipped/not as described B1) Reimbursement (without escrow/acquirer involvement) The buyer can request a refund when the merchant failed to fulfil the order If the merchant accepts the request he/she can co sign the transaction and refunds the buyer B2) Refund dispute (escrow/acquirer involved) 19 \x0cIn case of the merchant neither agree with the refund claim nor respond to buyer\ s refund request the buyer can reach the escrow to resolve the issue If the resolution outcome is in favour of the buyer escrow will issue a refund to the buyer by providing the co signature 20 \x0c21 \x0cBlock Data Structure As the initial prototype of Crypto com Chain will utilize Tendermint Core as its consensus engine the block structure will follow the descriptions provided as described in Tendermint\xe2\x80\x99s documentation Furthermore Crypto com Chain will employ these additional conventions 1 AppHash consists from a root of an authenticated data structure such as a Merkle tree19 constructed after committing a set of valid transaction in a given block and other parts denoting the application state Given an AppHash portion a transaction ID and a Merkle proof one can verify whether a transaction corresponding to a given ID was included in a block 2 Each block will be tagged with a fixed sized probabilistic data structure such as a Bloom filter20 that will encode participants from all transactions in a given block 3 The last two characters of ChainID will be assumed to be hexadecimal digits These encode a single byte that should be included in every transaction\xe2\x80\x99s metadata This value will vary for different network deployments such as test and main networks Textual Address Format For backwards compatibility with the existing contract on Ethereum the staking addresses would preserve the hexadecimal textual representation The payment transaction addresses will utilize a new Bech32 based textual address representation where the human readable part would denote the network (i e mainnet testnet regnet) transactions are meant for Transaction Fees The network will initially have the following minimal linear transaction fee scheme A + B*(transaction size in bytes) where A and B are constants (fractions of the native currency) These fees are paid to the rewards pool In the case of acquirers these minimal fees may be subsidised 19 Merkle R C (1988) A Digital Signature Based on a Conventional Encryption Function Advances in

the ACM 13 (7) 422\xe2\x80\x93426 22 \x0cIn the long term we will investigate the possibility of dynamic or zero fee schemes as long as these schemes preserve the payment data confidentiality and do not open the network to spam Transaction Rewards The Crypto com Chain will extract rewards from the Secondary Distribution & Launch Incentives Pool and subsequently the Network Long Term Incentive Pool 21 The rewards will be periodically distributed to the Council Nodes based on their proven operation i e based on the blocks they co signed as long as their corresponding accounts were not punished due to Byzantine faults Additionally transaction rewards in the form of \xe2\x80\x9ccashbacks\xe2\x80\x9d may be paid to the acquirer customers using a faucet like mechanism from the community development pool Dispute Resolution Refund In cases of disputes between customer and merchant both parties will be able to leverage the Crypto com Chain dispute resolution platform in order to agree on a win win outcome (including refund) The dispute resolution handling is facilitated through the use of multi signature wallets and a built in escrow service Once the dispute is resolved and if a transaction refund is agreed upon it will be settled on chain as a transaction that is constructed and co signed by Customer/Merchant Acquirer Double spending 21 See the Crypto com Chain general whitepaper for details on CRO token distribution split 23 \x0cThe consensus algorithm and cryptographic measures are set up to ensure that double spends are prevented by the network protocol as long as 2/3 of Council Nodes are honest 6 Resilience & Agility Network Redundancies To ensure the robustness of the network a minimum number of Council Nodes spread across the globe will need to be up and running The minimum number will be decided based on real performance tests to balance the following factors 1 robustness against compromising a supermajority of Council Nodes 2 efficiency/high performance Network Scalability & Performance Crypto com Chain aims to be a distributed network that is able to handle high transaction throughputs and low latency Scalability and performance are hot research topics in the blockchain space While adopting TEEs in the infrastructure may achieve a performant network we will also explore other advances in the field including sharding consensus protocol improvements transport network enhancements etc Transaction signatures will employ both ECDSA (for backwards compatibility) and a variant of the Schnorr signature scheme22 The Schnorr signature scheme has been recently proposed for the Bitcoin network23 One of the most compelling applications of this scheme thus far is compact multisignatures as n of n signatures are no different from ordinary signatures from the verifier\xe2\x80\x99s perspective (the same scheme is used) In later phases Crypto com Chain may incorporate more recent developments from the blockchain research space in order to meet its network scalability and performance demands 22 C P Schnorr (1990) Efficient identification and signatures for smart cards in G Brassard ed Advances in Cryptology\xe2\x80\x94Crypto \ 89 239 252 Springer Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science nr 435 23 https //github com/sipa/bips/blob/bip schnorr/bip schnorr mediawiki 24 \x0cOne such development direction relates to the blockchain compression approaches For instance Coda24 is a proposed cryptocurrency protocol which that introduces a \xe2\x80\x9csuccinct blockchain\xe2\x80\x9d Instead of storing the entire transaction history as in the current blockchain systems it constructs a constant sized cryptographic proof of the validity of blockchain state this is accomplished through the recursive composition of zk SNARKs Coda promises to reduce the enormous blockchain sizes from hundreds of GBs or TBs to merely a few KBs Furthermore when bootstrapping procedures are developed for Tendermint Core Crypto com Chain may allow for the safe snapshotting and pruning of historical data that is unneeded for transaction validation Crypto com Chain will initially use the standard network protocol stack (such as TCP+TLS) for different node to node communications Depending on the performance needs the later Crypto com Chain phases may explore other options For example QUIC25 is a recent protocol standard proposed by Google on top of UDP that improves over TCP and TLS QUIC can achieve better network latencies than TCP and TLS thanks to various features such as faster connection opening and negotiation out of order packet delivery or forward error correction 24 25 https //cdn codaprotocol com/v2/static/coda whitepaper 05 10 2018 0 pdf https //datatracker ietf org/doc/draft ietf quic transport/ 25 \x0cLightweight client support We also provide support to lightweight clients By connecting to a full note that has access to the complete blockchain only a small part of the blockchain has to be downloaded and verified by the lightweight client This allows lightweight users to access and interact with the blockchain without having to synchronise the entire blockchain As a result clients will be able to perform/verify payments in cryptocurrency using a mobile wallet on devices operating under resource constraints such as smartphones or laptops Upgrading the Network Software development is an iterative process Until the Crypto com Chain stabilizes Crypto com will remain being able to upgrade the network directly taking community contributions into account by rigorously reviewing pull requests Every transaction and every request will include fields related to software versioning When a non backwards compatible upgrade happens each honest node will be aware of both the version number and the time the version upgrade should begin and will thus drop any request or transaction that is broadcasted using an older version When two nodes connect a handshake procedure must be established with remote attestation and some standard checks Connected nodes would also periodically check the handshake information with each other if a connected node is deemed outdated for more than 7 days it will then be disconnected Augmented Decentralization In line with DA3 the capabilities of Crypto com Chain Council Nodes will be split and the entities operating them will be extended to third parties Adding new Council Nodes (or removing them) requires the approval of at least 67% of all the Council Nodes 26 \x0cAs these proposals for Council Node set changes require an inspection and decisions of Council Node administrators each proposal will have a set deadline If a Council Node does not signal a decision after the deadline it will lose a part of its
