\x0cProspectus The fundamental problems of the world sports industry of today are 1 The value of sports is being greatly undervalued in today\xe2\x80\x99s commercial environment as there is no assessment system that can adequately measure the potential of sports 2 The sports industry\xe2\x80\x99s benefit distribution is becoming extremely centralized in favor of the top tier 3 This era of fragmentation is bringing bigger and bigger challenges to sports participation To solve these problems Sports Value Foundation (vSport) registered in Singapore is setting out to bring world class blockchain developers sports elites and top finance experts together to build a public vSportChain Then take that to the sports industry to construct a new business ecosystem The vSport team and its partner organization Sport 8 International have many years of experience in and understanding of the difficulties of the sports industry By using blockchain technology the Foundation intends to create a blockchain based sports value system In charge of the issuance and management of the VSC token (Sport Value Currency) vSport also aims to attract partners to join its on chain ecosystem link and integrate all parties together within the vSport blockchain in order to create a more efficient environment for the sports industry and assist it in transitioning to the new blockchain era To coincide with the FIFA World Cup 2018 vSpor twill first bring sports fans into a user\xe2\x80\x99s community and launch vSport Chain 1 0 which is based on Ethereum and gradually build a new sports eco system step by step as follows 1 vSport v1 0 test run public chain release based on the underlying blockchain technology VSC token issuance (Sports Value Chain) introduction of new partners within the ecosystem creation of new business models and establishment of the vSport ecosystem 2 vSport v2 0 test run introduction of the Sports Evaluation System (to appraise the real value in circulation) creation of value blocks forming a value chain incubating a series of applications to enhance the circulation of VSC through a series of events creating value blocks and a value chain based on a series of 7 \x0capplications enabling value transfers consolidation of the ecosystem R&D completion of applications and migration of the user community to the chain 3 Completion of the vSport ecosystem on chain establishment facilitating the circulation and transfer of value within the sports industry setting up a new standard for the sports industry in the new blockchain era vSport Chain (sports value chain) is the world\xe2\x80\x99s first non profit open sourced platform based on blockchain technology which targets the sports industry Its goal is to upgrade existing forms of sports organizations and improve inter related ecosystems from all aspects of the sports industry Based on an innovative value assessment system it applies block chain technology to subdivided areas and directions of sports to build a basic digital infrastructure and value framework vSport will provides a compatibility protocol and an interface for side chain and private chain applications in order to support its partners within the ecosystem and help them build applications (sports celebrities and teams sports events sponsorship traceable sports rights transactions sports facilities and human resources sharing open and transparent sports quizzes etc ) A community ecosystem for sports which benefit all parties as well as becoming an accelerator speeding up innovation and transformation of the sports industry vSport Chain will establish an underlying sports value assessment system and a value settlement mechanism and issue vSportCoin (VSC) tokens The token is envisioned to be a digital asset on the vSport Chain On this basis vSport Chain provides a compatibility protocol interface for secondary chain applications and private chain applications to facilitate participants in the public chain of vSport Chain vSport wants to develop specific areas for applications and a subdivided value system such as decentralized player agents P2P sports event sponsorship traceable sports copyright trades sharing of social sports facilities and human resources open and transparent sports quizzes all of which contain unlimited potential vSport Will Reshape the International Sports Industry The project to develop vSport Chain will be managed by the Foundation which is registered in Singapore Sports 8 which is an all industry platform for sports and a strategic partner of the Foundation will provide full support to the Foundation and put in place first the development of specific benchmark applications in the vSport 8 \x0cChain Wesley Sneijder world football superstar and the director of vSport will be responsible for aggregating top sports resources \xe2\x80\x9c433\xe2\x80\x9d is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest community on social media (Instagram Facebook Twitter and other major platforms) It has more than 26 million users including 20 000 professional football players across the world As vSport\xe2\x80\x99s high traffic community partner \xe2\x80\x9c433\xe2\x80\x9d will let vSport harness its portal and promotion platform on social media In addition leading blockchain project TRON will be vSport\xe2\x80\x99s cross chain cooperation partner The collaboration between the two parties will greatly promote the on chain move of partners in the ecosystem As a strategic partner Fintech security company Pay Egis will provide technical support for payment solutions The Chinese Sports Value Innovation Alliance which is a think tank for the sports industry will support the development of the sports value assessment system 1 Background 1 1 Sports Industry Worldwide Sports is one of the most promising industries In developed countries the sports industry is a key one with a huge industrial scale It is reported that annual output value of the sports industry in the whole world has exceeded one trillion USD The United States is the country with the most developed sports industry whose output value has reached 498 4 billion USD in 2015 twice that of the automobile industry and seven times that of the film and television industry accounting for about 3% of GDP The sports industry has registered a high growth rate Since the 1990s the revenue of the sports industry in the USA has increased by 10% 15% annually on average dwarfing the growth of GDP In addition the sports industry has a wide range of coverage including central supporting and peripheral businesses with many sectors involved in its secondary and tertiary industries As an emerging industry the sports industry plays a pivotal role in the global economy 9 \x0c1 2 Problems Existing in the Sports Industry First there is a lack of understanding regarding the true value of sports The valuation proposition of sports is different from that of other industries and cannot be expressed simply in terms of money by this economically minded society Traditionally and relatively speaking the sports industry earns less profit and grows slower but influences important aspects of human life such as the human mental state and honor system At the same time the sports industry cannot be evaluated in the same ways commonly used in the Internet industry number of users For example the world\ s top three football clubs Manchester United Real Madrid and Barcelona earned around 800 million dollars and none of these clubs have an on line fan registration mechanism like an Internet app However the influence of each fan club is enormous as their reach extends to all kinds of people with different nationalities in every corner of the world Second There is Improper Allocation of Resources \xe2\x9a\xab Necessary sports resources such as venues are not properly matched with social needs \xe2\x9a\xab Data is not effectively utilized \xe2\x9a\xab Sports insurance and protection systems are not sound Third the Talent Cultivation System is Deficient \xe2\x9a\xab Sports\xe2\x80\x99 practitioners lack motivation at the basic level \xe2\x9a\xab Youth training system is not sound \xe2\x9a\xab Evaluation measures and standards are not effective \xe2\x9a\xab Development of young athletes is given inadequate attention \xe2\x9a\xab Ugly practices such as using stimulants age fraud and bribery are widespread Fourth Business Models are Ineffective \xe2\x9a\xab Valuation of sports IP is confusing \xe2\x9a\xab Sports consumption culture develops too slowly \xe2\x9a\xab Influence of sports stars is not used properly \xe2\x9a\xab Professional sports clubs are run as enterprises kept away from the community Fifth There is Over Centralisation 10 \x0c\xe2\x9a\xab Very few federation organizations control most of the resources creating corruption \xe2\x9a\xab Sports lack financial support at the grassroots level 1 3 The Necessity of Building a Public Chain for the Sports Industry The existing blockchain landscape is basically focused on the underlying technology while the sports industry is resource oriented rather than technology oriented It requires a platform that has both the blockchain spirit and a resource integration capacity None of the existing public chains are established for the sports industry The sports industry itself has distinct characteristics Sports has a unique influence Meanwhile sports has many subdivided sectors that share many things in common need to organize events need for revenue as well as publicity and advertising from sponsors These needs can potentially be met through a single system block instead of having to build from the start again every time In view of these reasons we believe that none of the existing public chain protocols have rules and regulations targeting the features of sports or have developed basic blocks with relevant properties There is a need to rebuild the structure from the beginning 11 \x0c2 Solutions In view of the above problems the Foundation has developed the first public chain specifically for the sports industry \xe2\x80\x93vSport Chain based on blockchain technology 2 1 vSport Chain vSport Chain is the world\xe2\x80\x99s first fully open non profit and blockchain empowered platform for the sports industry vSport Chain is designed to be the \xe2\x80\x9cEthereum\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cQtum\xe2\x80\x9d for the sports industry It aims to redefine and construct a revolutionary and self adapting value system for the sports industry It builds a comprehensive ecosystem and digital infrastructure for the industry benefiting all parties and establishing an underlying value settlement mechanism based on the VSC token providing compatibility protocol interfaces for side chain and private chain applications supporting partners within the ecosystem to build application scenarios on the vSport chain 2 1 1 Unique Properties vSport Chain is a blockchain a service (BaaS) platform that has an independent IPR It not only has the basic features common to general public blockchains it also has the following improvements made regarding the industrial characteristics of sports First KYC Certification and Unified Management of Accounts in the Chain vSport Chain intends to allow any individual or organization in the sports 12 \x0ccommunity (including event organizers training institutions brokerage companies sports products companies venues and other facilities and any agencies that may sponsor sports) to be able to create a unique account on vSport Chain and be verified The Foundation will authorize third parties to authenticate the identity of other users Users may also authorize a third party to inquire about relevant verification information according to their needs After registration users may concurrently manage various sub accounts corresponding to multiple applications in the vSport Chain Second Fast and Efficient Double Level Architecture Transaction throughput on traditional blockchains is limited therefore it is difficult to meet the requirements of some applications requiring high concurrency and in real time application When a large number of transactions are awaiting confirmation congestion of the entire network will occur For example a simple application for virtual kittens had paralyzed the network Ethereum The double level architecture of vSport Chain and the underlying technology of DPOS designed for sports application scenes has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of the system and effectively deal with many application scenarios Third High Efficiency for Development of a Complete Interface The development environment based on existing blockchain clients has a relatively high experiential threshold for new developers vSport Chain will include rich API customized for the common demands of the sports industry as well as a friendlier development interface which lowers the threshold for users participating in development of distributed applications for the sports industry At the same time vSport Chain intends to provide a complete interface SDK which means industrial users need not worry about problems such as mining consumption node maintenance and hacker attacks that traditional blockchain platforms face 2 1 2 Examples for Data Interface vSport Chain will be based on existing blockchain technology but with the addition of bold innovation and improvement which makes real world application of this technology in the sports field more likely 13 \x0cvSport Chain provides a complete data interface for the sports industry such as a storage and query interface for data from China\xe2\x80\x99s young sportspeople Users such as coaches parents teachers youth football clubs and schools may use storage interfaces to store training data for young sportspeople including evaluation and games vSport Chain system will give a certain amount of VSC incentives according to the volume and accuracy of data submitted by users Local teams as well as educational and sports departments at all levels may also use the query interface to select appropriate young sports people 2 2 Value Settlement Mechanism and Native Tokens vSport Coin (VSC) vSport Chain will establish a value settlement mechanism based on its native digital cryptographically secured token vSport Coin (VSC) allowing various sports resources and behaviors to be converted into a certain number of VSC before settling them through corresponding models This will provide compatible protocol interface for users to develop secondary chain applications on vSport Chain to facilitate participants constructing new application scenarios and value systems on public vSport Chain VSC is a digital asset which embodies the value of each participant in any form (individual institution facility event etc ) in the real sports environment 2 3 Consensus Mechanism DPOS vSport Chain will adopt a DPOS consensus mechanism an odd number of delegates will be selected by voting from VSC holders which can be treated as many super nodes possessing equal rights In some ways DPOS is similar to parliament if delegates cannot do their duty (failed to make a block in their turn) they will be disqualified and substituted with other candidates 14 \x0c2 4 VSC Distribution and Reward System The whole token supply will be issued in the Genesis block \xe2\x80\xa2 40% will be used for fundraising and as incentive for the founding team \xe2\x80\xa2 15% will serve as reward for the DPOS super nodes 1% being distributed annually during 15 years \xe2\x80\xa2 45% will be used for community development to fund and incubate new applications in the ecology of sports value chains and to reward individuals or institutions that contribute significantly to the development of the ecosystem The specific budget allocation and distribution will be decided by the foundation\ s voting committee (voting committee candidates must be individuals or institutions with great influence and experience in the field of sports The members will be regularly elected by the community on chain) 2 5 vSport Development Roadmap 15 \x0c3 Technical System With the launch of Bitcoin blockchain in January 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto introduced two revolutionary concepts to the world simultaneously First is Bitcoin a decentralized point to point encrypted digital currency that maintains value without any asset guarantee intrinsic value or central issuer In essence Bitcoin converts money into data Second is the workload based blockchain protocol which introduced information economy networks constructed on the future Thereafter developers began to apply block chain technology in real world businesses These include color coins smart assets domain name coins and more advanced applications such as decentralized exchanges financial derivatives point to point gambling on chain identity and reputation systems There is also Ethereum a blockchain that provides built in mature Turing complete language and creates all of the systems mentioned above as well as many other systems that defy imagination It is believed that the ideal sports value network should first be decentralized and as much as possible mobilize the resources and power of all the people Second it should benefit each link of the entire sports pyramid especially the base and the sides who can also receive fair and reasonable incentives for their contributions to the system Third the sports value chain should be fair by serving everyone on an equal footing vSport Chain is designed with the intent of constructing a reasonable sports value transaction system Through establishment of an information oriented ultimate abstraction base layer and the value algorithm model layer based on the sports value system as well as the blockchain that integrated Turing complete programming language and SMPC (secure multi party computation) algorithm sandbox developers can create smart contracts and applications suitable for various sports scenarios and establish ownership rules transaction means and state transition functions that are based on the basic definition framework VSC is the basic token of the system and supports the secondary chain token in the protocol Developers may design secondary tokens for different application scenarios and quantify their value The design of vSport Chain takes into account five basic principles Simplicity Despecialization Sandbox Orientation and Integration into the ecosystem 16 \x0c\xe2\x9a\xab Simplicity the underlying architecture of vSport Chain should be as simple as possible and the interface should be the easiest to understand It should as far as possible avoid protocols or intermediate layers that are too complex \xe2\x9a\xab Despecialization the characteristic and operational code of the protocol should embody concepts at the lowest level and be despecialized as much as possible using common models and scenarios as the inherent part of the protocol \xe2\x9a\xab Sandbox the end users of intermediate layers cannot see it but it must possess security and stability as needed by directional applications vSport Chain does not pursue a fully open technology system but one with a balance of reasonableness stability practicality and efficiency \xe2\x9a\xab Orientation in specific application development applications should have a star effect can import a large number of users gradually forming a community ecosystem \xe2\x9a\xab Cross chain concepts of blockchain ecosystems have already been developed and vSport Chain does not attempt to construct a closed ecosystem vSport Chain intends to support various protocols for cross chain operation and provide access to various digital asset projects in the ecosystem Key Technologies are as Follows 3 1 Double Level Architecture vSport Chain divides blocks into two layers a high level block layer and a low level block layer High level blocks are controlled by the Foundation The main responsibilities of these blocks include first control of the issuance of VSC and second authorization and review of nodes and maintenance of overall account books these high level blocks do not handle specific transactions Low level blocks are maintained by each node Their main responsibilities include processing users\xe2\x80\x99 transaction requests verifying validity recording transactions and updating the account book as well as cross verification 17 \x0cvSport Chain improves overall efficiency by reducing the cost of communication between nodes through a two level architecture As the number of users increases it can be optimized on two chains to achieve balanced loading and scalability and a multi layer architecture may be considered in the future 3 2 Smart Contract A smart contract on vSport Chain (vSport Contract) is a collection of code (its function) and data (its state) stored on vSport Chain with a specific address Contract accounts can communicate messages to one another to implement Turing complete operations The contract runs on the blockchain through the sandbox by means of a binary byte code specific to vSport Chain Various servers may develop a range of contracts and DAPP to obtain revenues by serving end users Servers may even create and issue their own tokens for their own DAPP through smart contracts 3 3 Secure Multi Party Computation Secure Multi Party Computation (SMPC) is intended to solve the problem of synergy computation aiming to protect the privacy of non trusted participants SMPC should ensure independence of input and correctness of computation it should not disclose each input value to other members participating in the computation Generally speaking a secure multi party computation problem computes any probability function based on any input on a distributed network Each input party has input on that distributed network\xe2\x80\x94 which shall ensure independence of the input and correctness of the computation it shall not disclose other than the respective input any information that can be used to derive other inputs and outputs There will potentially be a large number of institutional users in vSport Chain where possible competition between users makes them reluctant to disclose their own proprietary data to others not even to a trusted third party As a platform vSport Chain could possibly provide a large number of applications from many servers In this case how to protect the privacy of users\xe2\x80\x99 data becomes a key issue Therefore vSport Chain will incorporate secure multi party computation technology The secure multi party computation model of vSport Chain consists of the 18 \x0cfollowing four aspects participants security definition communication network model information theory security and cryptographic security Based on this a protocol that can support joint computation and protect participants\xe2\x80\x99 privacy will be constructed so that each user can realize joint data sharing computation under the promise of protecting information privacy and obtaining all related benefits as well 3 4 Distributed Artificial Intelligence In the application scenario of vSport Chain many models of value evaluation be used such as \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence evaluation model\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cathlete value and growth evaluation model\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontribution value evaluation model\xe2\x80\x9d The establishment and growth of these models will be based on an in depth learning algorithm by artificial intelligence which may consume a large quantity of computational power Therefore we have introduced Distributed Artificial Intelligence Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI for short) is a combination of artificial intelligence and distributed computation DAI has been proposed to meet the needs of designing and building large complex smart systems and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) The main purpose of DAI is to study the behavior and methods of distributed intelligent swarm agents in logic or physics to study knowledge skills and planning for coordinating and controlling them to accomplish multi task systems and solve various problems with definite objectives DAI is divided into two modules one is distributed problem solving (DPS) the other is implementation technology for Multi Agent System (MAS) The principle behind distributed problem solving is to break up the whole problem into several sub tasks and to design a problem solving sub system for each sub task First it is necessary to intelligently determine an allocation strategy how to allocate the total work among a group of modules or nodes Second it is necessary to intelligently determine a strategy for task coordination seek to solve the problem in a cooperative way on the basis of distributive and loosely coupled knowledge sources The concept of \xe2\x80\x9cdistributive\xe2\x80\x9d herein means that control and operation of tasks and the available information are distributed without global control and global data 19 \x0cKnowledge sources are distributed across different processing nodes while data information knowledge and answers to questions can be shared according to certain rules Multi agent system or MAS for short mainly coordinates behavior and tasks among different agents To achieve the goal of finding solutions to multi task systems and various complex problems it is necessary to adopt essential strategies and operations by coordinating knowledge objectives skills and system planning among a group of autonomous agents MAS coordinates the behavior of many agents to complete large scale complex tasks in a cooperative way 3 5 Trans Chain Operation Protocol The blockchain ecosystem has been formed vSport Chain does not attempt to construct a closed ecosystem It has the potential to support various cross chain operation protocols and provide access for various digital asset projects into the ecosystem vSport Chain supports cross chain asset exchange protocols that is to make extensions to existing asset exchange protocols allowing multiple participants to swap assets across different blockchains and ensuring that steps in the entire transaction either all succeed or all fail In order to achieve this function we need to create a contract account for each participant by using the functionality of vSport Contract For other blockchains vSport Chain will be compatible through adaptive protocol plug ins in the future vSport Chain also supports cross chain distributive transaction protocols Cross chain distributive transaction refers to the multiple steps of a transaction being executed in different blockchains and ensuring the consistency of the entire transaction This is an extension to the cross chain asset exchange extending the behavior of the asset exchange to an arbitrary one In popular terms vSport Contract makes a cross chain smart contract a possibility When different parts of a smart contract are being executed on different 20 \x0cblockchains they are either all executed or all sent back to their state before execution This leaves great room for imagination about cross chain collaboration \xe2\x80\x93 the Foundation is exploring application scenarios of cross chain smart contracts 3 6 Decentralized Information Storage and Distribution As we all know one of the major problems of Bitcoin is its difficulty in scaling With the number of users and quantity of data constantly on the rise the size of blocks becomes a main hindrance to their development vSport Chain contains a point to point information sharing network application which positions public resources through content addressing technology It disperses and stores multiple files on different nodes through Hash Computation If a user accesses a file he can access it according to the Hash address In addition it features point to point equality that allows files to be stored as fragments on some of the computers or servers closest to users which increases load speed Similar to Bittorrent users can access data from multiple nodes at the same time as long as a single node hosts one datum which makes it possible to distribute data without collocating any type of server (data accessibility is independent from locations) At the same time the need to host services when the original node is not connected to the network is avoided by motivating other nodes in the network to copy and store data by themselves and provide index services 21 \x0c4 Industrial Advantages 4 1 Sports Strategic Partner Sport 8 Sport 8 is a strategic partner of vSport As

idle resources in the sports industry such as vacant venues and facilities idle coaches and unutilized sports data etc In a TED speech in November 2016 Don Trapscott the father of the digital economy said that Uber and Airbnb are just bringing together and selling services Only blockchain technology can really turn a sharing economy into a reality First Venues and Coaches FODA (Youth Football Volunteer) A venue may lay idle for a long time The owner may receive incentives in VSC as long as he places all idle resources on vSport Chain These resources when shared and used will entitle the owner to receive VSC incentives according to the size of the contribution In the same way coaches can get the incentive of VSC by sharing their free time to teach sports skills The users of these shared resources need to spend their VSC to buy resources and they can also get VSC incentives if they share their sports data In this way the whole ecosystem may maintain a virtuous circle People will be willing to move up together to promote the development of public sports Second Data Sharing Sports generates a huge amount of data each participant\ s resume sports 30 \x0cperformance of one\xe2\x80\x99s sports life achievement and data in each competition All these data have value and may be stored verified transmitted and analyzed with the blockchain technology of vSport Chain Application developers can make rules that each person who contributes to the data is incentivized for their contribution and get paid for the amount of use from the data they share These data may potentially play a role beyond imagination in the future For example a teenagers\xe2\x80\x99 promotion to school precise marketing of sports brands sports insurance etc Third Event Crowd Funding and IP Sharing In sports events top IPs compete heavily The middle and bottom resources find it hard to receive support In vSport Chain application developers potentially develop apps release event tasks and build their own tokens Those who are willing to make contributions may provide financial support venues human resources support publicity etc and receive incentives in VSC and certain rights to events All users on Sports Value Chain collaborate to build the event into IP and can participate in the value created by that IP 5 2 2 Cultivation and Appraisal of Sports Talents First Physical Training for Teenagers Participation by teenagers in sports training shows a trend of high speed development As the number of people increases together with enthusiasm there are many problems created In vSport Chain the Foundation may use blockchain technology to record all the information since one\xe2\x80\x99s physical training including age duration and frequency which will be used as big data for training sports talents and provide important reference for the whole industry By comparing data of young people after participating in sports training we can clearly record their great progress physical and mental development after participating in sports which can promote young people in the whole society to take an active part in the healthy growth of sports Every parent who encourages their child to take part in sports and also contributes their time and their child\ s data to the industry and can be incentivized Second Skill Appraisal Appraise sports skills record data compare results and seek a breakthrough 31 \x0cApplication developers may do in depth development on vSport Chain appraise the sports skills of participants and use blockchain technology to record and keep track of them as an important indicator for scouting of sports talent Third Road of Growth of Youth On vSport Chain each sports talent can have his/her own supporters who contribute to the growth of youth in sports in ways such as sponsoring youth training abroad with tokens and participating in competitions Supporters can potentially get generous incentives from those they support when they are on a career path 5 2 3 Professional Sports First Event Ticket Services Ticketing for sports events in China has been in a state of chaos All aspects from prices to sales are neither standardized nor professional seriously affecting the box office Take China Super League for example different clubs sell tickets at different prices Second distribution channels are chaotic For some very popular events even one ticket is hard to get but ticket scalpers are rampant However in normal times sale of tickets is very difficult Sometimes tickets are given out free to attract audiences On vSport Chain VSC can support a uniform ticketing standard that cannot be forged and can ensure the tickets\xe2\x80\x99 distribution channel certification and stable circulation Second Sports Copyright Management and Asset Tracking The right to broadcast events has always been big business When people\ s viewing habits are constantly changing the copyright market is also becoming increasingly fragmented In addition to watching live games on television more sports fans will watch short videos from a variety of social media on their phones The vSport blockchain technology helps copyright owners track the use of the authorized and easily trace piracy since each copyrighted content has a unique ID and is intended to be automatically paid through the smart contract of the blockchain Third Sports Stars Stars have powerful influence on consumers while at the same time fans have very high loyalty to the stars Now sports stars have super high levels of popularity no lower than entertainment stars Each star may issue his/her own token on vSport 32 \x0cChain while fans can get the token by supporting their favorite star and redeem the opportunity for close interaction with stars Fourth Professional Clubs vSport Chain blockchain technology allows individual sports clubs to develop proprietary tokens just as each club now has its own social media account The club\ s fans can obtain tokens by supporting the club They can buy tickets merchandise and even food and drink at the site of the game making club operation more efficient At the same time based on the credit mechanism of the blockchain technology digital authentication of tickets is realized which will put an end to industrial problems such as fake tickets or scalper tickets Fifth Sports Quizzes Users may obtain virtual income through a token quiz on the chain which is open transparent and unchangeable These technical features improve the security and fairness to an unprecedented level 5 2 4 Promotion and Development of Sports at the Grassroots Level First Compensation Mechanism for Sports at the Grassroots Level When all the data of youth athletes participating in sports training are recorded on vSport Chain all the clubs and coaches who have made contributions in the initial period of training will be incentivized with VSC These data are unique and unchangeable and can be queried online When these athletes start their career path to becoming sports stars with high popularity or when they acquire high transfer fees clubs and coaches at the grassroots level will be able to be rewarded for their efforts which will fundamentally change the present situation where capital gathers on the top while people at the middle and bottom levels live a difficult life without protection Second Insurance Sports data and biological data on vSport Chain such as age will be unchangeable which facilitates the solution to problems in the sports industry like difficulty in defining sports insurance as well as disputes on compensation Third Sports Public Welfare 33 \x0cThe blockchain technology of vSport Chain can be employed to track the specific use of all public welfare funds which ensures public welfare is reasonably used in the scope of compliance and the results are open and subject to supervision of all participants in public welfare 5 3 Ecosystem Partners 6 Distribution Plan 6 1 The Distribution and Allocation of Sports Value Chain Currency (VSC) In order to promote development of vSport Chain and complete the ecosystem development a total of 2 5 billion units of VSC will be distributed Proceeds of the VSC sale will be used to support development promotion operation and deployment of vSport Chain VSC can be exchanged for Bitcoin and ETH Considering the recent

2018 Early Investment Supporters Phase \xe2\x9a\xab Feb to May 2018 Private Placement & Roadshows \xe2\x9a\xab May 2018 Distribution via Exchanges 6 4 Capital Budget \xe2\x9a\xab Product technology team 20% of budget This budget will be used to 35 \x0cestablish a technical team to support research development and promotion ofvSport Chain \xe2\x9a\xab Integration of sports resources 35% of budget This budget will be used to integrate sports resources forall walks of society \xe2\x9a\xab Overhead management 10% of budget This budget will be used on expenditures concerning relevant laws security finance human resources etc \xe2\x9a\xab Market operation 30% of budget This budget will be used in market promotion and user operation \xe2\x9a\xab Other incidental expenditures 5% of budget This budget will be used for unpredictable expenditures 6 5 Entitlement Agenda for Founding Members of Sports Value Foundation \xe2\x9a\xab 125 million VSC will be released 6 months after issuance \xe2\x9a\xab 125 million VSC will be released 12 months after issuance \xe2\x9a\xab 125 million VSC will be released 18 months after issuance \xe2\x9a\xab 125 million VSC will be released 24 months after issuance \xe2\x9a\xab Which means after 24 months of being listed on exchanges the VSC of the founding members of sports value foundation will all be released 6 6 Risks Investors acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing VSC holding VSC and using VSC for participation in the vSport Chain (a) Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions The regulatory status of VSC and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions It is impossible to predict how when or whether 36 \x0cregulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications including VSC and/or the vSport Chain Regulatory actions could negatively impact VSC and/or the vSport Chain in various ways The Foundation (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions or changes to laws or regulations make it illegal to operate in that jurisdiction or it becomes commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction After consulting a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies the Foundation will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of VSC Therefore for the crowd sale the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible For the crowd sale the Foundation is working with Tzedek Law LLC a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain space (b) Competitors It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar code and protocol underlying VSC and/or the vSport Chain and attempt to re create similar facilities The vSport Chain may be required to compete with these alternative networks which could negatively impact VSC and/or the vSport Chain (c) Loss of Talent The development of the vSport Chain depends on continued co operation with the existing technical team and expert consultants who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors The loss of any member may adversely affect the vSport Chain or its future development (d) Failure to Develop There is the risk that development of vSport Chain will not be executed or implemented as planned for a variety of reasons including but without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset virtual currency or VSC 37 \x0cunforeseen technical difficulties and shortage of development funds for activities (e) Security Weaknesses Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with VSC and/or the vSport Chain in a variety of ways including but not limited to malware attacks denial of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing Furthermore there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Foundation or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of VSC and/or the vSport Chain which could negatively affect VSC and/or the vSport Chain (f) Other Risks In addition to the aforementioned risks there are other risks (more particularly those set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your purchase holding and use of VSC including those the Foundation cannot anticipate Such risks may materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks You should conduct full due diligence on the Foundation its affiliates and the vSport team as well as understand the overall framework and vision for the vSport Chain prior to purchasing VSC 38 \x0c7 Management Team 7 1 Organization Structure of
