28 \x0cPage 2 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 ABSTRACT SpaceChain aims to pioneer solutions for humanity to thrive in the coming space age Combining blockchain technology with current astronautical resources and capabilities SpaceChain will inspire more people to join the space community and advance the propers of space technologies together\xef\xbf\xbd SpaceChain positions itself as a private space agency with an open network driven by collaboration and transparency using blockchain based technologies Activating the principles of decentralization and international collaboration in an already vibrant global community SpaceChain will leverage the dynamics of tokens and private funding to accelerate space development SpaceChain was founded in March 2017 and has completed the development of SpaceChain Operating System (SpaceChain OS) SpaceChain OS has been successfully adapted to the Sparc V8 satellite operating system and achieved stable operations at the system level The SpaceChain OS integrates Qtum blockchain technology and has established a platform for the development of space based applications SpaceChain will be releasing fully functional satellites using the SpaceChain OS blockchain nodes in 2018 By harnessing the power of tokens private funding and leadership SpaceChain provides on an open source platform to accelerate outer space development and settlement We will choose and execute missions that fit this blockchain based philosophy \x0cPage 3 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Part 1 Introduction The Value of Blockchain & Space Technology 1 1 The Trend of of Internet Technology Innovation Blockchain The blockchain is a computer programming breakthrough that solved the Byzantine Generals problem Also known as the Byzantine fault tolerance and an \xe2\x80\x9cerror avalanche \xe2\x80\x9d this concept was a generalized \xe2\x80\x9cunsolvable\xe2\x80\x9d proof that led to roadblocks in software development We have always needed a third party that demanded a payment to perform transactions or submit information to ensure that the transactions were accurate and create a reliable history Blockchain enables trusted exchange without middleman It creates a secure and resilient shared history which is accessible anywhere in the world The first real world application of blockchain is Bitcoin Beyond cryptocurrency blockchain allows us to program transactions and signals that allow for a decentralized self governing network with no middleman and executable contracts between machines called \xe2\x80\x98smart contracts\xef\xbf\xbd\xe2\x80\x99 New technology can emerge in a manner that seems outof the blue even though it is the culmination of decades of intense research and development by near anonymous collaborators Societies that encounter this technology when it is finally ready for users divide into two camps idealists citing it as proof of a revolution or establishmentarians who heap scorn on and attribute harm to the technology A small subset of society trained in technology develops discusses and explores its capabilities At this point commercial interests that look for new ways to do business usually intervene and mainstream products are built on the findings Profound changes then occur in commerce and culture\xef\xbf\xbd This evolutionary arc has characterised technologies from the printing press in 1440 personal computing in 1975 the Internet in 1993 and most recently blockchain in 2008 Blockchain has received its share of news coverage in recent years and has captured the interest of technologists and economists since 2008 It solved the \xe2\x80\x9cavalanche of errors\xe2\x80\x9d that the open Internet presented where otherwise unrelated parties interact over an untrusted network For the first time information like digital signatures digital contracts digital keys to physical locks digital ownership of physical assets like real estate and digital money could take place in a matter of minutes between untrusted parties with no need for a middle institution brokering history or ensuring honesty\xef\xbf\xbd And once the transaction is complete it is final Blockchains represent the Internet wide distributed ledger (or shared history) and server for both information and commerce that cannot be rolled back (also known as immutable) Blockchain is the first true community powered super computer Now blockchain can power smart contracts taking complex legal commercial and cultural interactions programmed with no third party intervention to execute between machines like computers sensors or systems like grids \x0cPage 4 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 1 2 Brief History of Telecommunication & Internet Evolution The future is already here it is up to us to equally distribute it A brief history of the Internet and discussion of the evolution of blockchain reveals a true revolution of our capabilities to understand explore our world and ultimately advance our species through technology The combination of the Internet and the computer was a leap forward in our capacity as a species Combining worldwide broadcasting instant information dissemination and platforms for collaboration without geographic location has opened new avenues for advancing a more transparent and collaborative world where breakthroughs can benefit all of humanity all at once SpaceChain is advancing the evolution of the decentralized Internet to the next level by essentially inventing true decentralized multitenant software capabilities and networked space on a satellite system SpaceChain is building a universal OS that can be used across any satellite to transform satellites into multi use computers rather than the single use satellites that are prevalent today The Internet in the context of our global telecommunications evolution represents the most successful example of sustained global collaborative decentralized development of information infrastructure Blockchain originated from Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper represents how the economic collaborative component is driving Internet evolution The decentralized Internet today has become the widespread information and economic infrastructure and forms the true initial prototype of what has been called the National Galactic Information Infrastructure As JCR Licklider of MIT wrote in a historic memo in 1962 discussing the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cGalactic Network\xe2\x80\x9d of a globally interconnected set of computers through which anyone at any location could access and change data and programs so did Satoshi Nakamoto envision a purely \xe2\x80\x9cpeer to peer version of electronic cash\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9callow any one party\xe2\x80\x9d to send value to anyone else they chose without a third party intermediary on a series of computers running software called nodes Tog Ethereum protocoler with advances in computer programming on blockchain with programming and smart contracts like Qtum we finally have the capability to fully transform entire industries Currently the international space industry has two prevailing problems that hinder the development of this industry as a whole 1 3 Technical Platforms Have Led to the Era of Decentralized Space Tech \xe2\x80\xa2 First are security issues which mainly exists between countries \xe2\x80\xa2 Second conflicts of interest between commercial corporates and state owned companies The first issue is being addressed by diplomacy and cooperation encouraged by leaders and communities through collaboration and open source technology\xef\xbf\xbd SpaceChain addresses the second issue Space technologies have always been closed source and highly guarded The problem is that in this type of environment it is difficult for new businesses to utilize the existing infrastructure and access workable knowledge outside of the organization and for countries to audit projects Businesses have also avoided space technologies due to the high capital requirement Unlike other software arenas it is not possible to build space based applications with low budgets Lack of human capital specialized professionals and limited talent are also major constraints\xef\xbf\xbd \x0cPage 5 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Current space projects are dominated by governments so they are hindered by external factors and become inefficient Research and innovation are under resourced Purely commercialized space projects like SpaceX deserve more attention and are indeed seeing high valuations from very modest upfront investments At the dawn of Internet age startups benefited greatly from the traditional venture capital model Typically a business is owned by key members of the company and the shareholders keep working in the company and make contributions Innovation and creativity of entrepreneurs in technology were able to thrive and succeed with the support of venture capital However for companies that require longer time and larger initial outlays for research and development (R&D) such as space exploration VC model is not necessary the best option Many technologies based on the VC model would be announced as unworkable when they need more time and capital investment to succeed and reach markets to thrive For example traditional satellite research and development cycles may drag across many decades Once the funding for research is ready it takes months to complete research and development before teams can apply for additional funding for next stages to get technologies to market We have seen projects spend 5 years stuck in this cycle only to have their satellite prototype unable to launch Tokenized fund raising provides flexibility and progressive ways to support such projects With sufficient funding the project can recruit the best talent enhance internal efficiency and focus more on the long term R&D This is very important within space technology where setbacks are to be expected and part of the cost of development Hence traditional VCs may not be willing to take the risk and leave this space to us to achieve somEthereum protocoling great under a crypto economic model Long term feasibility and timeframes can be reached with smart contracts to lock and hold token sale funds with a clear roadmap and timeline for deliverables SpaceChain is a private space agency that will partner other organizations where crowdsourced funding can be employed on collaborative projects and smart contracts employed to lock in funds till certain software markers are met to unlock them SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized application platform built on satellite technology will begin the opening of this industry and community SpaceChain will promote SpaceChain OS to traditional space industry satellites such as communication and navigation among others Also SpaceChain will promote SpaceChain verification system to better aggregate and utilize current space resources in an open source audited and secure system SpaceChain OS can be developed and used by different satellites and different organizations wherever they are located in the world \x0cPage 6 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 1 4 Introducing SpaceChain SpaceChain aims to establish a network infrastructure that is very much like the public telecommunication infrastructure we share globally This network infrastructure will not involve any military or government bodies and is only for use by the general public and by private individuals and organizations People can access build and interact like they do on the Internet SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s first application is like a mobile app development platform With blockchain software we provide an application sandbox or app firewall so that independent apps may be uploaded to the satellite similar to apps on a mobile application layer Until now inter satellite links (satellite to satellite communications) present a fundamental hurdle to a decentralized mesh network In order to have this resilient mesh network you first need satellite to satellite communication that is blockchain based However there are still security issues related to commercial satellites such as data integrity and safety of the satellite SpaceChain invented SpaceChain OS which is a sandboxed blockchain technology that is built upon StylixOS and Qtum This system will ensure the safety of data running on the satellite as the programs are operated at the immutable and completely public blockchain layer The aim of SpaceChain OS is to enhance hardware capability while maintaining security SpaceChain OS can adapt to global hardware systems and cater to varying satellite technologies In order to ensure the safety features and functions of SpaceChain OS the foundation will carefully evaluate each generation of SpaceChain OS through in orbit testing and it will provide the community with reliable open source code and results For more detailed SpaceChain OS information please refer to \xe2\x80\x9cSpaceChain OS Whitepaper\xe2\x80\x9d Internally SpaceChain will tokenize and equalize technology and resources This will optimize use of available technology and resources and provide the space industry with an efficient and reliable consensus on value and collaboration to begin SpaceChain was funded in March 2017 and has already provided solutions in the space frontier SpaceChain OS development with infrastructure design and operating system started in November 2017 SpaceChain OS has been successfully adapted to Sparc V8 satellite operating system and has achieved stable operation at the smallest system level The migration from Qtum blockchain technology has achieved basic sandbox function and the EVM Virtual Machine is on track to being developed in 2018 \x0cPage 7 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Part 2 path Realizing the Value of Blockchain Tech 2 1 General Overview of the Structure of SpaceChain 2 1 1 Upcoming Milestones \xe2\x80\xa2 2018 March

orbit upgrading of software without changing satellite platform use better performing hardware to design and build third generation satellite \xe2\x80\xa2 2021 \xe2\x80\x93 2022 launch 4 third generation satellites and form a space network with previous satellites to support application development \xe2\x80\xa2 Further move forward with the hardware and software upgrades while conducting in orbit testing SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to integrate blockchain nodes on satellites to add a new dimension to the core framework of distributed ledgers SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s node satellites will bring blockchain to space and make use of existing space technology to build a worldwide distributed application layer We are pioneering a new layer of infrastructure for the Internet of blockchains by taking advantage of space resources SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s platform features data collection computing applications and storage SpaceChain uses satellites as its operational nodes for realizing direct on satellite data processing and secure in space data storage through cryptographic technologies such as quantum communications People everywhere will have access to this layer of infrastructure just as they do the Internet wherever they travel with their various devices \x0cPage 8 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 SpaceChain will bring satellite technology beyond a repeater model (RM) Our partner will provide better language than traditional RM RM essentially describes how most current satellites function They usually take a signal from the ground and then simply broadcast live satellite tv or provide GPS or one other function at a time RM allows very little actual data processing to take place on the satellite SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s system will change this model to a model that is multi tenant with flexible software capabilities Most satellites are single owner and thus single operator and single tenant With SpaceChain for the first time combining existing space technology and blockchain we are able to create multi tenant as a new user model and a new economic model for satellites Additionally SpaceChain has created a system to drive down the cost of space applications to allow teams and investors to do more development with their money SpaceChain will combine and contract the cheapest rocket launches globally with multiple payoffs per rocket As more cheap spacecraft reach orbit we are able to have many redundant nodes in the network launched globally Thus our network also self heals We can see a mesh network in space of many satellites where loss and replacement will enable the network to be low cost and resilient in a \xe2\x80\x9cmany plus cheap\xe2\x80\x9d model These rockets will take off from many different sites and be ensured secure by open source auditable practices that the larger respected technology and space communities can see and support\xef\xbf\xbd SpaceChain will employ this mEthereum protocolod to projects we undertake in space including asteroids or planetary bodies exploration where we can send out many remote drones powered by apps run on satellites around celestial bodies in our planetary system Hardware design also involves internal redundancies especially as spacecraft using our \xe2\x80\x98smart\xe2\x80\x99 satellites will have redundancy of computing \x0cPage 9 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Figure of Overall SpaceChain OS Structure \x0cPage 10 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 2 2 The Hardware of SpaceChain Future of Internet Infrastructure What follows is a technical breakdown of SpaceChain from both the hardware and software perspectives The key function of the blockchain payload is processing application safely on the satellite To achieve this goal the payload uses SpaceChain OS to provide the software environment to applications Blockchain sandbox provides a safe environment and a high performance chip to guarantee all the software above The main logic structure is shown below Dapp

SylixOS Hardware Drivers Hardware Payload Hardware The beta vision payload hardware is on board CPU and FPGA The Payload provides a powerful processing module for Blockchain applications and OS The module contains two main parts \xe2\x80\xa2 A very powerful ARM/FPGA on board computer (OBC) designed as an efficient system for space application \xe2\x80\xa2 The power system is divided into two one for ARM and one for FPGA \xe2\x80\xa2 Dual ARM Cortex A9 MPCore up to 800 MHz \xe2\x80\xa2 1GB DDR3 RAM/4 GB storage \xe2\x80\xa2 Powerful FPGA module \xe2\x80\x93 125K logic cells \xe2\x80\xa2

glass/polyimide \xe2\x80\xa2 IPC A 610 Class 3 assembly z7000 \x0cPage 11 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 In the future blockchain payload will be rapidly upgraded to meet the future demand of blockchain applications However the existing processors have different problems that will slow the update rate down For example \xe2\x80\xa2 x86 is complex and not open source the internal structure of the processor is not clear there may be a back door unable to be safely controlled \xe2\x80\xa2 ARM has expensive intellectual property costs that will reduce user number \xe2\x80\xa2 SPARC is product of commercial companies whole technical system has long term sustained support risk \xe2\x80\xa2 MIPS and Power belongs to commercial companies which are focused on making profits and their business model may not promote democratisation of technology It is easy to have conflicts of interest with upstream and downstream companies it may lack good industrial chain ecological support To satisfy the update rate of blockchain payload we need an open source processor project In 2010 David Patterson a distinguished professor at UC Berkeley launched the RISC V processor open source project which has great properties like \xe2\x80\xa2 Free authorization no patent barriers exist Block Diagram \xe2\x80\xa2 Permanent non profit foundation to dooperation management \xe2\x80\xa2 Complete alliance of upstream and downstream industry \xe2\x80\xa2 Two international workshop meetings each year At present there are 50 core member companies 270 companies and 29 universities participating in the RISC V open source project In the future SpaceChain will develop a blockchain payload processor under the open source RISC V ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) The blockchain payload will be updated in performanceand reliability Functional description Microcontroller OS I2C Interface CAN Interface The OBC is based on a Zynq 7000 All Programmable SoC (AP SoC) devices integrate the software programmability of an ARM based processor with the hardware programmability of an FPGA enabling key analytics and hardware acceleration while integrating CPU DSP and mixed signal functionality on a single device The OBC has a default SpaceChain OS installed OBC has an I2C bus supporting bidirectional data transfer between masters and slaves multi master bus arbitration between simultaneously transmitting masters without corruption of serial data on the bus Serial clock synchronization allows devices with different bit rates to communicate via one serial bus and is used as a handshake mechanism to suspend and resume serial transfer\xef\xbf\xbd One of the main interfaces of the OBC to communicate with other subsystem hardware is a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus interface It is a serial communications protocol that supports distributed real time control with a high level of security \x0cPage 12 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 2 2 1 Intelligent Satellites SpaceChain will build

technology resource and human capital At the same time these startups will use SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s verification system so they can quickly commercialize and produce products and services thatsociety needs globally The most effective solution to alleviate the expense problem will be to encourage cooperation between companies while also significantly increase the usage rate per satellite In the same way the mobile phone industry was revolutionized when Apple introduced the iPhone with its exceptionally usable iOS SpaceChain introduces a universal space iOS for space software development The space industry needs a stable and versatile operating system and SpaceChain OS is the solution Developers can create applications using the environment provided by SpaceChain OS SpaceChain OS greatly lowers the difficulty of developing space applications while putting the resources like infrastructure to best use Additionally SpaceChain OS deployed sandbox technology ensures an interference free environment for the applications Our introduction of SpaceChain OS powered smart satellite system will lower application costs Upon the success of in orbit testing SpaceChain Foundation will launch several customized LEO satellites with their partners that are equipped with communication camera sensor gesture and orbit control functions Please refer to \xe2\x80\x9cSpaceChain Satellite Whitepaper\xe2\x80\x9d for more details By launching these low orbit satellites a simple network is formed to provide developers the platform needed to start creating software Establishing standards for smart satellite hardware and achieving standardized production of satellite parts will make greatly reduce the cost of producing a satellite and spur organic growth of the industry This will ensure an economically viable ecosystem To simplify the development process there will be a development SDK for SpaceChain OS It provides a modular development environment that is similar to Java Script By being fully opensourced more people will join the community and create a vibrant development community There will be tutorials for software development and space hardware developer board for people to try out developing application for satellites\xef\xbf\xbd \x0cPage 20 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Partnerships with well known universities through lab establishment research open courses technical forums and other educational resources SpaceChain Foundation will provide free resources for universities to take part in this exciting journey by providing free developer boards hosting hackathons and community development on SpaceChain OS globally SpaceChain Foundation wishes to establish an eco system where every contributor is fairly rewarded Through such an economic model more resources will be attracted into the space industry and more people will join the grand adventure of space exploration SylixOS is an open source RTOS (Real Time Operating System) project SylixOS has been applied widely in various fields such as defense and security aeronautics and astronautics high speed railway system smart grid industrial automation and motion control etc In the SpaceChain project SylixOS is used in the satellite platform to manage hardware resources and in the Blockchain payload to provide standard API interface and various system features for applications \x0cPage 21 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Part 3 Tokenomics and Blockchain Structure of SpaceChain 3 1 SpaceChain Bottom Layer Qtum The SpaceChain OS framework is divided into a Blockchain application layer that includes these layers \xe2\x80\xa2 Mainly Qtum provides the basic service API for smart contract and block chain application \xe2\x80\xa2 Qtum also offers a sandbox to guarantee the safety of applications processing \xe2\x80\xa2 Compatible for Ethereum protocol (ETH) ereum EVM to process Qtum smart contract\xef\xbc\x9b \xe2\x80\xa2 Open for any public blockchain and their smart contract application\xef\xbc\x9b SpaceChain requires a blockchain technology with low power consumption high stability and strong expansibility Qtum uses a PoS (proof of stake) consensus mechanism whereas most other blockchain technologies widely use PoW (proofof work) such as the Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum protocol PoW has high requirements for energy and hardware resources to work well so it is not suitable for satellite systems Qtum has fully absorbed the accumulation of both the Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum protocol Thus Qtum technology has advantages in areas from code stability to third party support In addition Qtum uses UTXO technology to increase the network expansibility so that it can support a simple payment protocol SPV and the Lightning Network and fully support the EVM smart contracts as well So Qtum meets all the demands need to fully run blockchain technology on satellites SpaceChain chose Quantum Chain Technology (Qtum) from the beginning after doing a complete technical assessment of both hardware and software necessary for space technology development In addition to the above reasons Qtum has many unique innovations Qtum is the first smart contract platform based on UTXO and MPoS It has pioneered the integration of the advantages of both BTC and ETH ecosystem It has proposed and implemented the following core technology innovation \xe2\x80\xa2 Qtum uses efficient and secure MPoS consensus As compared to Proof ofWork(PoW) that is widely adopted by other blockchain technologies MPoS consumes less energy and has no requirements of high end hardwares MPoS allows any coin holder to be able to mine the coin without wasting much electricity by staking them in the wallet More importantly MPoS can provide a more secure consensus and subsequently raising the cost of cyber attacking by adjusting the height of block rewards and the allocation of transaction fees \x0cPage 22 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 Qtum combines the strengths of both Bitcoin and Ethereum making it more stable in terms of code structure In addition its adaptability towards third party applications gives it extra edge over other blockchain technologies \xe2\x80\xa2 Qtum extends the UTXO technology of Bitcoin and enhances the scalability of its network It supports technologies such as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) and Lightning Network as well as smart contracts that utilizes EVM virtual machines Qtum designed and implemented Account Abstract Layer (AAL) technology realizes conversion of UTXO model and EVM smart contract account model Then developers can use EVM to develop smart contract without paying too much attention to the details of conversion of UTXO model \xe2\x80\xa2 Qtum invented Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP) Through the smart contract embedded in the genesis block DGP is able to govern the blockchain network and achieve autonomous distributed processing This allows for faster updating of the network The current changeable parameters that Qtum supports include Block size Gas limite Gas dispatch and lowest Gas price \xe2\x80\xa2 Qtum is currently researching on high performance virtual machine of new infrastructure The innovative X86 virtual machine will tackle some problems existing in Ethereum EVM for example the lack of support for standard libraries and floating points byte code of excessive size etc Also it will focus on building an efficient smart contract system built upon the UTXO model Qtum is an open source project see https //Qtum org for more information\xef\xbf\xbd Qtum SpaceChain System library layer includes \xe2\x80\xa2 Open source software library support including basic library libboost libdb libsnappy libcyrpto+ etc \xe2\x80\xa2 Library provides services to the blockchain application layer through standard interfaces such as Posix and BSD sockets \xe2\x80\xa2 System library software is all open source project \xe2\x80\xa2 Operating system layer includes \xe2\x80\xa2 Standard interface support such as POSIX/BSD Socket/IO \xe2\x80\xa2 SylixOS kernel \xe2\x80\xa2 Hardware driver \x0cPage 23 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 3 2 SpaceChain Application Layer Possibilities of Distributed Application (Dapp) The SpaceChain application layer presents many blockchain use cases For example a cloud computing app use case is backup nodes for data recovery for the most important encrypted data\xef\xbf\xbd The encryption and cryptography is performed on the satellite itself\xef\xbf\xbd In this case the satellite is a first class actor where the satellite decrypts data payload This makes the data extremely secure\xef\xbf\xbd In a \xe2\x80\x9ctrusted execution environment \xe2\x80\x9d we provide software code and data that we digitally sign here on earth and upload to the satellite The satellite checks digital signatures before adding anything in the application sandbox before executing the program This system provides authentication and blockchain capability For developers and businesses this allows a \xe2\x80\x9cfail fast\xe2\x80\x9d make a change and try again approach or rapid iteration in contrast to the old world approach of launching a satellite per app We are part of the NewSpace trend of commercialization of space In the old world model there were only large governments deploying big satellites in space and big rockets costing billions of dollars to build government led and government funded with very little opportunity for private space companies to form to offer these services at a competitive cost In the new model led in part by China we have a new space race where commercial companies from China US Russia EU are competing to commercialize low earth orbit and driving the development of space technology This is creating new markets and brings new funding into the space industry creating possibilities for new economic models instead of one dominated by few owners and few operators Decentralization keeps power distributed and access open for everyone 3 3 How the SpaceChain Token Works on SpaceChain OS In the SpaceChain economic model the token will connect to our SpaceChain OS and allow developers to upload apps onto the SpaceChain network and thus store data and execute programs on SpaceChain satellites SpaceChain tokens must be bought in order to execute these SpaceChain apps much like a ticket to use a SpaceChain app for a duration of time or store one megabyte on a satellite We are essentially building a market for space applications where a token will be a way for apps to be priced For example if one app is more popular than another then there will be more demand for that specific space application and thus more tokens used\xef\xbf\xbd This new economic model is what led us to evolve a space app model within a broad vision of developing an inner space application and communication network first In the private space agency model where we wire the solar system for networking after many years and many networks we will see satellite constellations around the moon as well as remote data centers around planets and other celestial bodies These constellations will communicate with each other and form a backup This will enable human and robotic settlement of space in the long term\xef\xbf\xbd This mission to wire the solar system for networking will help realise a model called the Pony Network in Space The Pony Network is an economic model in space for payloads and propellant technology systems whereby people and cargo travel to the moon and mars quickly and cheaply by taking a point to point transit approach over shorter distances For example a satellite being launched to the moon will not travel on a single a rocket going all the way to the moon instead it will be launched to low earth orbit and transfer to another vehicle using software on satellites along its path rather than having every single application running on its system The entire network will be powered by and built on this token economic model \x0cPage 24 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 3 4 Community Evolution of Collaboration in Space Exploration Spacechain is based on a whole of mankind space exploration paradigm The vision of Spacechain is to find a mechanism in the field of space exploration that can effectively mobilize the power of all mankind to meet this challenge in the face of great challenges SpaceChain tries to solve the following three problems 1 International space cooperation is relatively closed and there is an urgent need in the aeronautical field for a space cooperation alliance that is open and democratic 2 The aerospace industry is currently closed to the public and space exploration does not harness the strength of all fields 3 The current space project has not found a balance between government and commercial enterprise\xef\xbf\xbd At present international space cooperation is relatively closed The reason is that security is the biggest barrier to cooperation among most countries The other is the question of interests which is the tension between commercial companies and state owned companies Therefore establishing a cross border safe space security alliance that can protect the interests of participants in the field of aerospace will be the key to promoting deep cooperation in the field of space To establish this alliance a collaborative mechanism must be established with other companies and blockchains The mission of SpaceChain is to break through the existing internal barriers of the world aerospace industry by establishing such collaborative mechanisms and give us full play to existing capabilities and enable optimal integration of available resources SpaceChain aims to reach a consensus on security and common interests\xef\xbf\xbd For this purpose SpaceChain developed SpaceChain OS an operating system designed to create a true network in space SpaceChain OS uses blockchain technology to encrypt the transmitted information to ensure the absolute security of information transmission and the use of blockchain technology in the operating system and sandbox management so that each satellite can run safely While achieving its security SpaceChain OS hardware adaptability is enhanced to meet the different needs of different spacecraft Efforts are being made to promote its compatibility with different spacecraft such as satellite systems communications navigation and remote sensing satellite ground systems space stations spacecraft space probes and other applications in order to achieve a seamless network In addition to international cooperation the aerospace industry should not remain closed to the general public Aerospace has always been a mysterious and opaque industry with a high barrier to entry because of its small market high cost and small number of qualified personnel However as we said before the move towards space is a whole of mankind endeavour It cannot be accomplished solely in the aerospace industry and requires widespread collaboration There is a need to explore a model that will allow more people and more companies in other industries take part in human space exploration Today the 5G era in mobile data has brought about a thriving development in the satellite communications industry The aerospace market has been growing The mission of the SpaceChain Foundation is to solve the remaining two problems of high cost and limited qualified personnel so that more people can by part of a global endeavor to explore space\xef\xbf\xbd \x0cPage 25 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Data and research show that the effective way to reduce the cost of satellite applications is to increase the number of applications of a satellite Just as a mobile phone has changed from a smartphone like Nokia to a smart phone today the shift is based on a strong and stable operating system \xe2\x80\xa2 SpaceChain OS is the operating system that can solve this problem Developers can develop satellite applications based on the software development environment provided by SpaceChain OS and upload the program code to the satellite via terrestrial data transfer stations in a manner that is extremely simple and extremely efficient to develop \xe2\x80\xa2 SpaceChain OS can therefore greatly reduce the cost of space applications Reducing access barriers in the aerospace field and upgrading the average airspace technology are the most important ways to solve the problem of imited space personnel \xe2\x80\xa2 SpaceChain OS reduces the barriers to use and simplifies the use of space At the same time the Foundation of Space Chain Trust will popularize the foundation of aerospace technology in higher education and increase the potential talent pool pursuing a space exploration career\xef\xbf\xbd In contrast purely commercial space projects focus on economics but regrettably it is very difficult for space projects to make profits in space using conventional models Therefore the issue of broad based participation in the construction of space projects needs to be solved The mission of the SpaceChain is to solve the above problems establish a socio economic model and explore a strong collaborative and win win model in the aerospace field that can support a global collaborative and sustainable commercial space program On the basis of the collaboration mechanism if the journey of mankind to explore space is to be sustained and the cognitive boundary of mankind to expand continuously we must stimulate the power of a free society This requires a more open and cooperative commercial space socio economic and technological development model Most current space projects cover both the government and the commercial sectors The funds and policies of the governmentled space project will be guaranteed but at the same time they will be constrained by the government budget and government efficiency and may be hijacked by powerful interest groups In contrast purely commercial space projects focus on economics but regrettably it is very difficult for space projects to make profits in space using conventional models Therefore the issue of broad based participation in the construction of space projects needs to be solved The mission of the SpaceChain is to solve the above problems establish a socio economic model and explore a strong collaborative and win win model in the aerospace field that can support a global collaborative and sustainable commercial space program The new commercial space model is already being realized by billionaires who invested in mega rocket and orbit giant constellations to colonise space and its potential\xef\xbf\xbd The SpaceChain Foundation hopes to use the community incentive model to establish the ecological chain production chain and distribution chain of aerospace wealth so that every participant and contributor will get a fair return and attract more resources to participate in the aerospace\xef\xbf\xbd We aim to partner with organizations pursuing this same approach We will build participate in the exploration of human space and extend human cognitive boundaries indefinitely The new commercial space model is already being realized by billionaires who invested in mega rocket and orbit giant constellations to colonise space and its potential\xef\xbf\xbd The SpaceChain Foundation hopes to use the community incentive model to establish the ecological chain production chain and distribution chain of aerospace wealth so that every participant and contributor will get a fair return and attract more resources to participate in the aerospace We aim to partner with organizations pursuing this same approach We will build participate in the exploration of human space and extend human cognitive boundaries indefinitely \x0cPage 26 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 3 5 SpaceChain Ecosystem Build up Blockchain enables new open economic models that enable new businesses and especially for the first time ever new space based business SpaceChain is similar to mobile app store you can pay a small amount of money and access a space app\xef\xbf\xbd This system is much cheaper than ten years ago when you needed to buy and operate an entire satellite Now a few cryptocurrencies units can develop and put an app on a satellite this enables whole new markets that were not possible before Before blockchain and cryptocurrencies there was a large capital cost of operating a large satellite\xef\xbf\xbd SpaceChain already has deployed an app platform based in space fully tested and will be launching satellites in 2018 to achieve the base layer of a new structure Because the SpaceChain system cost is 100x of investment versus 1000x compared to the old satellite launch mode the economics enables many new use cases The most important use case are the ones we have not thought of Comparing the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s earliest iteration few of us could predict global apps that would given everyone multiple choices to share a car Opening app stores and the creativity of developers allowed ride share to begin as a viable business model that disrupted transportation Today we question if anyone will ever own a car in the future solely for personal use SpaceChain will allow this new creativity for use cases that we have no ability to predict Another opportunity is the ability to bring a Linux software model to space Imagine a physically untouchable data center in space with a higher level of security because the data centre cannot be accessed without very high cost Physical remoteness is attractive to security conscious customers With a non terrestrial network we have a better diversity of nodes like Internet nodes blockchain nodes and other application nodes Remote nodes operating in space give us network redundancy satellite backup and autonomy of data and software Autonomous software and software automation will allow us to communicate with sensors operating in the ocean engaging climate change research among other smart contracts Satellites will be Internet repeaters remote sensors for telecommunications while communicating with and tracking planes and ships around the globe all powered on blockchain In 2016 the satellite industry generated more than $260 billion in revenues according to an annual report by the Satellite Industry Association (SIA) This was a 2% growth compared to 3% in 2015 Imagine the growth when this wealth can be redistributed to developers on a mesh network of a constellation of satellites\xef\xbf\xbd There are currently only 6 companies the \xe2\x80\x9clarge satellites\xe2\x80\x9d and 16 in the \xe2\x80\x9csmall satellite\xe2\x80\x9d observation categories With SpaceChain OS satellite capabilities will be increased and this sector will flourish alongside communication data storage and collection capabilities with many new companies and partnerships\xef\xbf\xbd In less than a few years the numbers will be totally different with the revolutionary capabilities of SpaceChain\xe2\x80\x99s potential in expanding commercial interests\xef\xbf\xbd 3 6 incubator & Commercial Opportunities The Spacechain Foundation will also launch an open source hardware development board and a development tutorial that runs SpaceChain OS and promote it freely in colleges and universities all over the world to increase the number of space personnel produced by the education sector The increase of the number of talents will greatly enhance the vitality of the industry and provide a continuous momentum of development for space exploration SpaceChain Foundation has been supporting startups in the space industry around the world

smart control system\xef\xbf\xbd \x0cPage 27 SpaceChain White Paper V 1 0 Summary In short SpaceChain aims to accomplish the following three goals 1 break down barriers to cooperation and integrate the existing space resources so that space can better serve the earth and serve humankind 2 lower the industry access threshold and costs vigorously develop education and involve more people in space exploration 3 establish a socio economic model to support a sustainable commercial space decentralized distributed program that will continuously grow knowledge and expand the cognitive boundaries of humanity The SpaceChain Foundation hopes to take on the responsibility of pushing the boundaries of space and exploring the cosmos in which we live SpaceChain hopes to attract more talent and resources pool the power of all mankind and join togEthereum protocoler in advancing space technology We believe that the wisdom of bringing togEthereum protocoler a large number of talented people in
