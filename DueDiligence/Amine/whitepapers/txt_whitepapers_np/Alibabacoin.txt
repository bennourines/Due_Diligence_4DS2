are anxious if the crypto currency is able to displace traditional money from the market Of course it is impossible now due to the lack of a full fledged infrastructure but in the nearest future the embodiment of this theory will become real and we will probably become not only witnesses but also the participants of this process Cryptocurrencies become full fledged money (a means of exchange of values) We believe that the creation of services focused on working with cryptocurrencies today is a successful business ABBC Project is an open platform that works on distributed ledger technology which makes it open and transparent to all participants It is designed to develop digital crypto currency markets and objects for various purposes with their subsequent launch and integration into a unique ecosystem ABBC Foundation will create an e commerce platform (online shopping platform) while providing a payment solution for user\xe2\x80\x99s convenience Basically it is a platform whereby consumers can pay using ABBC Coins and buy other major online shopping mall products through our online shopping mall This will allow users to avoid exchange rates or transaction fees which occur when they use credit card or PayPal if consumers are from different countries other than the currency the shopping mall supports Rather than signing up in different online shopping malls if you are an ABBC holder you can simply visit ABBC online shopping mall and buy products through our platform Online Shopping platform will receive reward points according to the total spending on their purchases These reward points can be accumulate to exchange for selected products on our platform These days the issue that users face is that their points are separately accounted for as they made purchases on different online shopping platform However with our reward point system it solves the inflexibility that allow user to accumulate their rewards points in one platform ABBC Foundation gives the world a new solution thanks to which the use and storage of crypto currency will become safe ABBC solution acts as a P2P platform connecting different businesses and consumers by integrating with our blockchain Our mission Building a system of e commerce business is quite a sophisticated problem The company has to spend a lot of resources on creating a team and channels of distribution In addition one should know how to promote a product in light of trends and specificity of a particular market Providing users with a flexible fast and secure platform with an efficient system based on the latest developments We create a service and an app that is freely integrated into any Internet marketplace and allows any entrepreneurs to make transactions with each other remotely A B B C \x0c1 1 For

Purpose of the project The ABBC platform will allow users to send and receive funds make online purchases using their own ABBC wallet exchange ABBC coins at profitable rates as well as trade and manage funds It is important for us to provide users with simple safe and high tech ways of using crypto currency For example when paying for purchases the shop will use the face control in addition to the password Thus the company plans to create a global online marketplace based on the ABBC blockchain solution I I S U M M A R Y The history of crypto currency appearance has started with the creation of the bitcoin network in 2009 and continues until now Crypto currencies are penetrating deeper into the life of the modern society Successful bitcoin introduction and subsequent success became the impetus to the further development of cryptosystems as well as of whole ecosystems which are based on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain) technologies and use their own crypto currencies Over time the improved formats of coding algorithms began to appear on the blockchain giving the new crypto currencies excellent characteristics We have chosen the best algorithm X13 for our payment system The X13 algorithm involves the use of 13 rounds of hashing with 13 different hashing functions such as bmw blake groestl jh keccak skein luffa cubhash and others This unique feature allows the X13 algorithm to be the embodiment of the most reliable and secure crypto currency in the world III A B B C E C O S Y S T E M We give entrepreneurs an opportunity to make transactions in

companies and enterprises in the field of digital crypto currency market give business the opportunity to gain profit in their online services Often these companies do not even have real (physical) offices Crypto currency technologies allow virtualization of your offices giving potential users the opportunity to visit them Regardless of whether you are looking for a partner or trying to choose an exchange crypto currency thinking about starting trading with ABBC Coin transferring or ordering we will help you create any type of service with a smart security system A B B C \x0cIV About Technology 4 1 Opportunities Today Our already existing platform is based on the decentralized architecture of the crypto currency It can automatically determine the price ratio day by day The use of built in accelerometers allows the system processing information from the digital crypto currency market in order to improve user navigation on the trading site or in the exchange space Section recognition technology allows the user to transfer crypto currency from one wallet to other using secret keys The existing interface of the platform applies as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript / JSON + SMX \xe2\x80\xa2 Back end written in Perl Python Java Node js PHP \xe2\x80\xa2 The algorithm used is X13 It provides complete security and awareness of the facility hacking Standards used \xe2\x80\xa2 ISO 21500 for any type of project regardless of complexity size and duration \xe2\x80\xa2 GAPPS Global Alliance for Project Standards \xe2\x80\xa2 ISO standard 9000 Quality management system 4 2 Opportunities in the future We did not create ABBC Coin on the Ethereum platform (which is now popular with new blockchain projects) The operation of our platform requires more functionality than just Ethereum smart contracts ABBC is a powerful platform with its own trading system a wallet and a full blockchain service which is also known as the Peer to Peer network allowing development of a set of applications in its own script language (similar to Java) 4 3 Smart Platform Feature The identification system is implemented on the basis of three keys \xe2\x80\xa2 Customer\xe2\x80\x99s opening key is used to open access to user information \xe2\x80\xa2 Customer\xe2\x80\x99s private key is the base for each user It is saved in the local browser storage and is used to create operations with account means and carries the function of the basic user ID when working with the interface \xe2\x80\xa2 Fingerprint is a smart security feature that requests a PIN or fingerprint when creating transactions The user can choose full identification or anonymity mode In addition to the existing ID system we will apply the key database and other identification systems as soon as they become available Wallet of simple tokens (ST) 1 The user can send/receive and buy/purchase ST 2 The user links the accounting record of the company with the simple Coins (ST) wallet 3 The user enters the application and pays in BT 4 BT is converted into ST in the real time mode and ST is written off from the user\xe2\x80\x99s wallet A B B C \x0c4 4 Face Recognition Technology Face recognition is a program that compares the biometric features of a person\xe2\x80\x99s face to identity and recognizes them The software uses deep learning algorithms to compare a real or digital image with a saved original screenshot to verify a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity Insert image Face recognition File creation \xe2\x80\x93 Identity comparison Confirmation Data 1 face coincidence (data 1 data 2) limit Data 2 Yes \xe2\x80\x93 Permitted No Rejected The face recognition system works by searching for two different images with subsequent matching of files in order to search for similarities Product Features \xe2\x80\xa2 99 99% of the recognition \xe2\x80\xa2 cannot be hacked \xe2\x80\xa2 interlink with several patents \xe2\x80\xa2 Already used in the work of many companies around the world \xe2\x80\xa2 was tested at the governmental level in a number of countries 4 5 Results Now you can use your face to make transactions and payments to buy any goods you want No passwords and keys anymore Your face will open and close access to assets keeping them safe Algorithm X13 allows you to instantly execute transactions transaction fees provide security which will be distributed to all coin holders thanks to POW and POS methods A new model of P2P nodes implementing face recognition will make the security process more secure Having its own crypto currency its own platform with broad interaction capabilities and a payment solution we will provide the largest fastest and most convenient platform for work Each function of the ABBC platform which gives financial value to users implies commission payment Due to this the development of financial value flow in the network and the involvement of users in the system will be even more effective A B B C \x0cV Token Description ABBC Coins are issued for internal and external payments of the ABBC Foundation system and are the only payment instrument when you need to pay fees or pay for marketplace services ABBC Coin are deeply integrated into the system to ensure maximum trade flow \xe2\x80\x94 as the number of agents using the system grows the value of any cryptocurrency usually increases Purchase of ABBC Coins is a prepayment for services provided on our platform by both the platform itself and by independent partners who develop their services on it At the same time the purchase of Coins allows for the selection of a specific service that the buyer will receive not at the moment of payment (i e purchasing Coins) but at the moment when it requires this service Use of ABBC tokens Goods placement fee Every month of items hosted in the marketplace shall be paid for with ABBC Coins by each store At the moment of the project launch the fee is going to be 10 times lower than placement offered by our competitors and will always remain low because the nominal fee size will decrease with the increase in the ABBC Coins rate However a user does not have to have any Coins or be an expert on cryptocurrency exchange \xe2\x80\x94 they can pay the fee using their bank card or a payment service and the platform will automatically buy Coins with this money and will pay the fee The absolute purchase of ABBC Coins every time a customer uses the platform is extremely important because it ensures quotes liquidity for ABBC First Purchasers and permanent demand for Coins on the part of stores which is the basic principle of the increase in Coin quotes There will also be a demand on the part of buyers as numerous stores will offer a bigger cash back and special prices to their clients that pay for goods with ABBC Coins However this system won\xe2\x80\x99t show considerable surplus as the buyers will be expectedly using earned ABBC Coins in fiat money transactions with their contractors Therefore this method will raise the liquidity for ABBC First Purchasers but the influence on the market rate will be insignificant Promotion services ABBC Foundation will offer online shops a wide range of services (prioritizing in search results rating systems and appearance on the main page) allowing to attract more buyers All these services can be paid for with Coins Referral programs and rewards The platform members will be able to additionally earn ABBC Coins by taking part in referral programs and getting awards for CPA offers Internal transactions of the members To make promotion of goods in the global market more convenient we will create an integrated freelance exchange where you will be able to get services of localization prepared items description photos and videos at a fixed price Besides the payments are made with ABBC Coins and no fee is charged If the payment is made outside the platform the members will lose their opportunity to resolve potential disputes in ABBC Foundation arbitration as well as price and quality guarantee A B B C \x0cMaking purchases in ABBC Foundation stores using ABBC tokens Purchasing goods through the platform with Coins the buyer can count on a bigger cash back and better offers It\xe2\x80\x99s important to mention that all the transactions in cryptocurrency will be seen in the blockchain By paying for an item using the platform the buyer gets an additional protection of the transaction because of the smart contracts and the ABBC Foundation warranty Consequently to carry out a deal outside the platform is less profitable for both of the parties as they get a number of advantages when using the system Payment service for external users Any external user can start using the ABBC Coins payment system and count on increasing buyers\xe2\x80\x99 demand service of the highest quality and system guarantees Transaction transparency ensured by the blockchain technology Honest customer reviews \xe2\x80\x93 only customers who actually bought an item (with a confirmed transaction) will be able to comment on their customer experience Coin holders will get an access to the open source statistics with real time publication of important metrics of business processes and the platform development dynamics purchases the number of active stores and visitors average receipt amount etc This is the simplest and the most open way to monitor the platform development and forecast the increase of one\xe2\x80\x99s bonuses due to ABBC holding A platform wide blockchain based CPA network that guarantees transaction transparency across all open offers and no holds \xe2\x80\x93 any webmaster will be able to see all purchases made through a referral link as recorded by the blockchain VI Token specification
