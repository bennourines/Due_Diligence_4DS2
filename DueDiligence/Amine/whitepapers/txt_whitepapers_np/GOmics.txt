webtoon market has a promising future Gomics plans to create a blockchain based entertainment platform using blockchain technology They aim to create an ecosystem using the platform also to enable users (readers) to subscribe webtoons or for creators (publishers) to publish their works On the platform users and creators can interact efficiently using GOM token and get profits from them We also plan to solve the problems in the comics industry by utilizing good contents of Gomics platform with blockchain technology In Data stage of Gomics the data of creator and user is protected and copyright issues also can be solved GOM Token GOM Token V W Voting System Webtoon Production Vo t i n g f o r p o p u l a r content and stories Voting System GOM Token A Webtoon Production Producing

the service that enables to build a community by containing many components or to extend components for developers Gomics platform is growing rapidly and already has a large user base around the world In combination with blockchain technology we hope that Gomics\xe2\x80\x99service and user base will be taken to the next level 4 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform 2 Continuous Growth of Market 2 1 Analysis on Comics Industry 2 1 1 Comics Industry in Korea According to the report released by KT Economic Management Research Institute the sales from the Direct Service for the webtoon market in 2018 increased to KRW 590 9 billion totaling KRW 805 billion including profits from derivative works and the export of contents However Korean webtoons are only known to some Asian countries and haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet entered the comics markets of other countries such as Central Asia West Asia South America North America and Europe Therefore the possibility of expansion into other Asian countries is still very high and the size of the Korean webtoon market has already reached KRW 1 trillion According to the 2018 Content Industry Outlook report prepared by the Korea Creative Content Agency the Korean comics industry sales have increased 6 3% compared to the previous year in 2017 and now reached to KRW 1 trillion The export value of comics in 2018 is estimated at about KRW 43 3 billion (about $40 million) and the one in 2019 is expected to be about KRW 46 6 billion (about $4 300) As more people are interested in webtoons the webtoon publishing market is growing bigger If a popular webtoon is made into a movie it will be easy 5 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform to attract 10 million viewers and get positive responses from overseas subscribers By creating webtoons into movies dramas or online games the webtoon market will be expanded worldwide The Korean content industry is making great achievements in the Asia Content Market and already has succeeded in creating contents for the top entertainment companies such as Big Hit Entertainment (BTS) YG Entertainment (BLACKPINK) SM Entertainment (EXO) and for the top broadcasters such as MBC KBS and SBS for famous K POP songwriters such as Ryan Jhun Brave Brothers Shinsadong Tiger and Teddy etc Korean content also known as K Contents has already successfully entered North and South America and Europe 2 1 2 Comics Industry in China The output value of the Chinese comics industry (comics and animation) has increased more than 10% for the eighth consecutive years and has reached 150 billion yuan ($22 2 billion) in 2018 The number of people who watch animation online has exceeded 200 million as well In the comics industry according to the data released by several platforms the total number of people watching Chinese webtoon is 100 million and the annual output value has exceeded 5 billion yuan ($772 1 million) Also the average annual revenue from paid webtoons is 500 million yuan ($71 million) The export rate of Korean comics continues to increase but the rate of Korean comics exported to the Chinese market has fallen at the average of 4 3% annually for the three consecutive years However the Chinese market only accounted for 4% of total overseas exports Since Korean comics earned less than 100 billion yuan in 2017 the potential for Korean comics is expected to be positive in the future 6 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform 2 1 3 Global Comics Market The expanded global market is one of the important factors for the growth of the Korean content industry With the increase in the usage of smart devices such as smartphones and the advent of 5G era the global comics market will grow faster and webtoons will become one of the important trends The top publishing companies in the US and Japan holding the largest market share in the comics publishing industry are producing their own comic books into webtoons and the number of webtoon platforms is also increasing 2 2 Webtoon Market and Smart Device Development Before 2010 people used to read comic books but people have begun to read webtoons due to the development of smartphones having portability and various functions since 2010 On the other hand comic books are uncomfortable to carry with and found to have environmental issues and people s interest in webtoons continues to increase Along with the increase of online consumption we hope that more people enjoy webtoons through online payment and the issues of comic books will be resolved in the near future Also with the features of webtoon new lucrative and diverse more creators will join the community and expand the community for 7 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform the young generation The details below show the rapid growth of webtoons since 2016 Among several industries including comic book publishing webtoon production/ distribution and comic book sales/rental comic book publishing is the core industry of the Korean comics industry accounting for 58% of the entire comic industry The comic book sales and rental industry with the largest human resources and businesses accounts for 40% of the total sales Webtoon Market Growth (Based on Million USD) 1 177 1200 1 016 900 920 814 600 300 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 However the problem is that the worker s average income is low and production efficiency is also low Even if the number of webtoon companies and workers is small the average turnover per company is close to $131 152 million comparable to that of the comic book publishing industry The webtoon companies that work primarily on the Internet can lower the labor cost and increase productivity significantly The data from 2015 to 2017 shows that the comic book sales and rental industry are in decline In contrast with the increase in the number of webtoon subscribers and companies increased by 14% in 2017 and the average sales also rapidly increased by 28% 8 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform Average

users and making global partnerships with Korean idols and entertainers If commercial products can be linked to other secondary works such as webtoons web dramas and web movies the revenue is expected to exceed over KRW 100 billion ($82 000) However there are still thousands problems in the industry under the current situations 2 3 1 Copyright Issues Although creators and producers publish their works on the platform many works are still illegally distributed on the market due to some copyright issues As a result many creators experience economic loss According to the data the loss of top 6 webtoon platforms in 2018 amounted to about KRW 66 1 billion As of April 2018 the webtoon industry announced that the loss of 61 companies including Naver Daum and Lezhin Comics exceeded KRW 200 billion In addition the data from July shows that 39 600 webtoons are illegally copied from 39 webtoon platforms and the loss of creators and platforms is estimated to be worth KRW 143 3 billion ($117 8 million) 2 3 2 Profit for Creators and Subscribers Since the existing platform takes a certain amount of profit from creators the creators earn a small amount of income As the platform manages plenty of resources creators can barely take the opportunity to give their opinions The platform runs its business using the profit from advertising or subscription fees and creators take only a small portion of the profits When creators are not motivated 10 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform they might have difficulty making better contents Therefore there will be eventually negative impacts on their subscribers as well The subscribers do not get any benefit though they subscribe the service from the platform Of course the main purpose of them is to enjoy comics but it would be much better to create an ecosystem where creators and subscribers coexist through the platform The works of the creators will not be just translated into foreign languages but they may become the original source of the contents which influencers produce At the same time through webtoons created with Gomics mass production system influencers around the world will be able to communicate within the network of our platform Adding some commercial features influencers can make extra income through subscribers and they will get paid with GOM token Furthermore it will allow Gomics to build a transparent ecosystem There are unique features of Gomics platform that differentiate it from the existing comics platforms One of the features is that GOM token payment can be used to promote the platform 365 days all the year Even if a comic is already published on another platform it can still be republished at a 50% discount price on Gomics platform using GOM token There will be more subscribers who want to enjoy webtoons at a lower price 2 3 3 Debut as a creator Gomics has been striving to build a stable ecosystem for creators to make their debut in the comics industry In Gomics project GOM token users will vote comics and verify the quality of them After that the list of creators who received positive evaluation will be made through the second verification Thus creators will be able to make their debut without any problems 11 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform 3 Gomics 3 1 Solution 3 1 1 Technical Structure Gomics technical structure is divided into three stages Contract stage which is the most basic level of blockchain Business stage Application stage Gomics is improved and developed based on Polkadot it uses Polkadot+IPFS framework Business layer adopts the form of block chain + artificial intelligence auditing to reward users for content auditing At the application level a community based on the Gomics content public chain is developed through packaged business layer APIs to encapsulate the various components and extensions developed by developers Introduction of Polkadot Polkadot consists of multiple side chains each of which can have its own business goals and mechanisms while the side chains can interact Polkadot enables communication between different blockchains and can take advantage of Polkadot the identification mechanism of Polkadot maintains the security of cross chain communication (excluding the malicious side chain) The Relay chain Parachain and Bridgechain in the Polkadot network can help independent blockchains exchange information with each other so that each side chain can guarantee each other on the basis of security communicate with each other and exchange data or assets Such features are especially suitable for content development platforms 12 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) has been influenced by internet data transfer area and widely applied on it since 1991 when the first contract of HTTP was settled The IPFS development team thought \xe2\x80\x98In HTTP based structure the centralized Internet is inefficient and expensive It s also difficult to provide the speed or information what people really want \xe2\x80\x99P2P data transmission allows people to transfer the data at higher speeds IPFS is the distributed file system founded by Juan Benet in May 2014 Protocol Labs helped to develop it It has several features Content Addressing Versioning P2P transmission The blueprint of it has become the basis for the decentralized Internet around the world After four years of development its module has achieved high quality and has been used in a wide variety of projects IPFS modifies and combines previous P2P system technology It includes distributed hash table (DHT) BitTorrent P2P File Sharing System Git version control system and Self Certifying File System (SFS) etc \xe2\x80\xa2 Content Addressing Unlike Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) IPFS uses the way of looking for the information by data rather than by IP address In the case of searching by IP address the web browser looks for an IP address based on the domain what users have typed and then the information data will be found out inside the domain 13 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform On the other hand in the case of searching by the data of IPFS when all documents are input to the system calculated hash value will be given to each data It is calculated based on the data Therefore the same document has the same hash value and if the contents of the document have been changed the hash value will be also changed accordingly When a user needs a document the user has only to request the hash value of the document IPFS automatically searches the distributed hash index and finds the node to retrieve the document and verify the data of it \xe2\x80\xa2 Version Cont IPFS uses Merkle DAG based data structure and Git Version Control system By combining these two technologies and data search methods IPFS file systems can be inspected and unnecessary accumulated data can be eliminated It improves efficiency without wasting storage At the same time IPFS provides file history with the function to run back to old version Its logic of file storage makes it possible to store data for longer periods and to enhance the stability of Internet data \xe2\x80\xa2 P2P transmission IPFS file system is the data transfer method similar to BitTorrent the users of IPFS file system do not need to download data from a central server with P2P data transfer method They can get the data from other users who already have the one Thus data transfer rate will no longer be affected by the bandwidth and the accessibility of centralized servers Under the many circumstances the data transfer rate and the response time will be better than the ones in centralized servers 14 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform Therefore Gomics selected IPFS as its file transfer system and built a platform to create and to share content by complementing STEEM IPFS cross chain Gomics technical structure is divided into three stages Contract stage which is the most basic level of blockchain Business stage Application stage Application Stage Gomics Decentralized Entertainment Contents Ecosystem Other Community Digital wallet Business Stage Personalized Account Transaction Search Unit Distribution Verification Like and Share Copyright Search unit Trust based recommendation IPFS Crosschain Mechanism 15 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform Contract Stage Gomics is developed based on STEEM blockchain and combines IPFS storage technology \xe3\x85\xa1Continuously learning the base and design structure of other good blockchains such as Ethereum and EOS At the same time the features of the cross chain and sidechain were added In the Retrieval stage this is combined with IPFS and changes the online data disperser which can reliably prevent data loss In the State stage the contents itself become assets in the blockchain so they cannot be illegally distributed By combining sidechain and crosschain technology Gomics allows contents from different kinds of chains to cross each other Business Stage Evaluation and verification are conducted using blockchain artificial intelligence and big data Except for technical verification or content management the evaluation is based on a system that rewards community users The reward system allows users to participate more actively and to have a sense of responsibility In the Business stage a credit system is established and details about users\xe2\x80\x99 subscriptions for contents and consumption patterns are recorded in various ways Application Stage Through the Business stage API a content community based on Gomics is created users can communicate in different communities depending on their interest Gomics aims to provide more services to everyone in the community by combining more components or extending the developer s components 3 1 2 Gomics\xe2\x80\x99 Solution \xe2\x9c\x93 To solve the issue of income distribution by the features of blockchain transparency Webtoon creators will take the largest share of the profits In the existing platform with a centralized operating model creators barely have the opportunity to meet their consumer or the advertiser even though they are the ones who create contents (not only including cartoons but also including video clips and other products The cost for content and advertisement have never been 16 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform disclosed to the public and most of the profits made through advertising channels or other rewards are taken from the centralized platform The creators only get very small amount from it On the other hand users on all the nodes can see the details of blocks through blockchain technology and transparent and traceable features of it enable all creators to clearly see the value of their works Producers consumers and advertisers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to distribute or publish content on a centralized platform due to the P2P \xe2\x9c\x93 Users who actually provided data can make profits by enjoying webtoons in P2P network Although users increase the amount of data and provide it to the platforms they cannot expect any income from the existing centralized platform Based on blockchain Gomics allows users to become actual platform users and to have the ownership with the platform by getting profits in accordance with their activities The platform cannot exclusively take all of the advertising revenue which is produced by users enjoying webtoons users will receive most of the revenue As the number of subscribers watching the ad increases the revenue will naturally be risen with the higher contribution on the platform One Source 17 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform \xe2\x9c\x93 To create a virtuous cycle of the system through big data analysis Gomics stores users\xe2\x80\x99preferences and makes the best recommendations for them in the smartest way using big data In this way users get what they want and the efficiency for advertisement will be increased In addition users can use GOM token to support their favorite creators or purchase their favorite works Sponsoring creators who create great works will motivate creators it will allow them to create better contents and eventually to maintain a virtuous cycle of the system \xe2\x9c\x93 Reliable unmodifiable blockchain data solves the copyright issue and ultimately resolves disputes Although users increase the amount of data and provide it to the platforms they cannot expect any income from the existing centralized platform Based on blockchain Gomics allows users to become actual platform users and to have the ownership with the platform by getting profits in accordance with their activities The platform cannot exclusively take all of the advertising revenue which is produced by users enjoying webtoons users will receive most of the revenue As the number of subscribers watching the ad increases the revenue will naturally be risen with the higher contribution on the platform Synopsis/Scripts proven to be popular Popular Webtoons & Web novels Webtoons Production & Distribution Derivative works (Secondary Works) Produces and distributes movies/TV shows 18 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform 3 2 Gomics Operations 3 2 1 Gomics\xe2\x80\x99Influence Gomics is the platform project for distributing contents created by ContentHub Singapore based corporation and Coinplanet Coinplanet is a large online community specialized in cryptocurrencies in Korea and it has partnerships with numerous exchanges and media around the world Coinplanet has been successful in many ICO projects such as Tezos Eos Gnosis Status and so on and has recently become an official alliance partner for marketing with Huobi Korea Gomics has already made partnerships with many popular comics platforms in Korea and China it has currently been publishing on Korea\xe2\x80\x99s platform Toptoon Toomics Anytoon Me Wowcomics and on Chinese platform MangaX and Manhuaren The subscribers from many countries including Korea China Hong Kong USA Brazil and Malaysia visit the platform at the average of 2 million times a month \xe2\x80\xa2 Gomics has made a partnership with Toomics one of the top webtoon platforms and about 1 000 creators of Toomics naturally became the partners with Gomics Gomics is striving to create about 300 comics in the future and they will be published within Gomics Toomics founded in 2015 and it currently has 8 5 million users and 800 comics It has 100 million clicks and 40 million visitors in a month In the early stages of the business adult webtoons will stabilize earnings collect more external capital and grow more stable in the future After that Gomics will increase the number of webtoons for all ages The proven operating system is exactly the same as Gomics recent business plan The former CEO of Toomics Jeong Jae won is now Gomics COO we believe that he will contribute to making 19 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform a big success as he did for the previous company and will stabilize the finance \xe2\x80\xa2 There are certainly many partnerships between the comics industry and the cryptocurrency industry which have already had a big impact on the number of subscribers of Gomics and its comics Besides Gomics will be the driving force for the entire Asian culture and the project will be expanded to the webtoon markets in Southeast Asian such as Vietnam Indonesia and Thailand 3 2 2 Foundation of Creators and Comics Gomics currently has 12 comics and they got positive responses from subscribers after publishing on the popular webtoon platform Each of them got an average of 100K clicks and the average cost per a user is KRW 10 000 In addition to the comics being published Gomics is planning and preparing for mass production of webtoons for all ages and for adults Two types of webtoons will attract users of all ages and community members from other countries Also the confidence and assurance of this alternative strategy comes from three main factors below 20 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform 1 The Gomics platform serves as a reference for over 10 000 active creators to determine the volume of the comics 2 Tt is important to determine the quality by voting the comics based on the blockchain technology 3 The trust mechanism established by the Gomics platform through a high proportion of component mechanisms and blockchain technology motivates existing and potential writers to upload content freely and voluntarily enabling Gomics acquires massive content in low cost and then getting high paid and a quick return on investment through user fees 3 2 3 Copyright and Derivative Work Copyright What we need to know is that Gomics plans to make huge profits focusing on the strategies for the overall development of the copyright industry Gomics does not intend to own a large number of copyrights on its own but rather to make a profit through Derivative Work Right by developing a new work derived from original For example by producing movies or TV shows Gomics can own the derivative work rights for the creation of animation or games and electronic copyrights and get profit from them In addition to the derivative work projects mentioned above Gomics also aims to create a better commerce ecosystem by focusing on the influencer and idol economy Celebs and influencers combined with comics can lead to embedded marketing promotion and branding in the ecosystem The idols\xe2\x80\x99influence and recognition allow Gomics to make profit from users and copyrights In addition through reward system based on blockchain technology Gomics will be able to bring a lot of profits to the idols 21 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform 3 3 Roadmap 22 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform 4 Token Economy 4 1 GOM Token One of the key responsibilities of Gomics is to revitalize the entire ecosystem by efficiently using the GOM the cryptocurrency of the Gomics platform and to increase token values steadily Blockchain technology is a part of the system to activate distributed ledgers and economy which is the important factor in keeping the Internet stable and being operated normally User Using GOM token users can participate in the production of comics the vote on their favorite comics the evaluation of them and the selection of what they want to watch later Creator With the features of blockchain transparency and decentralization creators will be rewarded with GOM token which will allow them to make more profit It means that creators are able to make more money when they create good works In the existing platforms creators used to share their profit with the platforms but creators can take most of the profit now The virtuous cycle makes creators to create better contents and provide them for users Platform The platform can motivate users with GOM token Managing the circulation of GOM token in Gomics ecosystem helps to keep balancing supply and demand of GOM By lowering the operating costs of the platform it motivates the comics or animation creators to provide better works to platform users 23 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform Advertisement Advertisers advertise in Gomics ecosystem and pay in GOM token Users pick advertisements and watch them and then receive GOM Token It allows the advertiser to collect the data of the users\xe2\x80\x99 viewing habits and their tastes and it will lead to a decrease in advertising costs in the future 4 2 Issuing GOM token GOM is a token of Gomics platform in the form of Ethereum and total 75million will be issued Gomics will regularly burn a portion of the GOM token from the profit of platform with GOM token deflation structure Gomics plans to burn GOM token from 75 million to 21 million by 2025 to make it equivalent to the maximum supply of Bitcoin Total 75 Millions Platform Ethereum Type ERC 20 Mechanism Deflation Mechanism Plan for Burn Burn the profit of platform limit 21 million til 2025 Function Utility 4 3 Plans for Token Burn Gomics has designed two types of GOM token burn plans which are to collect and burn GOM token in circulation In this way the amount of GOM token distributed in the market can be reduced which can continuously increase the value of the token 24 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform The important point here is to unlock the token that individual investors hold and decide what to burn again As soon as the GOM token are partially burned the token held by individual investors are also burned at the same amount \xe2\x80\xa2 Plan 1 Burn Regularly The first plan is to burn token regularly Gomics will burn GOM token in circulation every month The quantity to burn each time varies from 4 million to 16 million depending on the selling price Gomics will use a portion of the total transaction amount each month as POT for burning GOM token 1 With monthly sales of 0 to 2 million GOM token Gomics will burn 1 6 million tokens each month the remaining 400 000 of which will be the platform s revenue 2 With monthly sales of 2 to 5 million GOM token Gomics will use 3 million tokens as POT to burn 60% of the tokens which is 1 8 million will be burned immediately and the remaining 1 2 million will be the final profit 3 With monthly sales of 5 to 8 million GOM token Gomics will use 3 million tokens as POT to burn 40% of the tokens which is 1 2 million will be burned and the remaining 60% 1 8 million will be the final profit 4 With monthly sales of 8 to 10 million GOM token Gomics will use 2 million tokens as POT to burn 400 000 of them are burned and the remaining 1 6 million are the platform s profit 5 With monthly sales of over 10 million GOM token Gomics will use 2 million tokens as POT to burn 1 6 million of them are burned and the remaining 400 000 are the platform s profit 6 Through the repeated process 21 million GOM Token will be remained at last 25 \x0cBlockchain

Every time Gomics platform generates profits it is considered as actual profit according to the fixed percentage Some part of it will be burned The specific rate for burn is determined according to the status of Gomics platform Through the two types of burn plans described above Gomics ensures that the value of GOM token will steadily increase and that users holding GOM token get profit from it Increasing the value of GOM token is one of the main roles that Gomics has The higher value of GOM token held by the user the more service and goods user will be able to get in Gomics In addition they will be able to enjoy comics and animations with excellent quality 26 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform If users no longer need GOM token they can sell their tokens to the exchange and get equivalent income As the value of GOM token increases comic creators can also get significant profit In addition as the value of the GOM token increases the creators will be motivated to create better works GOM Token Burn Long term 4 4 GOM Token Functions 4 4 1 Payment Method The basic function of GOM token in Gomics ecosystem is payment Since it is impossible to alter or manipulate information in the blockchain the payment method using GOM token has a big advantage The payment method is efficient safe and transparent In Gomics ecosystem users can purchase comics by GOM token Most of GOM token paid by users goes into the creators and the platform takes some of profits as commissions GOM token can be used to purchase other products and services on the platform (such as comic goods) The efficient payment method will give users great experience 27 \x0cBlockchain Entertainment Platform When advertisers will also spend GOM token to put ads on the platform While watching webtoons the user may select and watch some advertisements they want When users select and watch them they will be rewarded with a certain amount of GOM token 4 4 2 Voting & Operating Another important feature of GOM token is operation of the platform Users with GOM token can get the right to vote users can be the real owners of the platform within the right Through the voting system users can select their favorite comics and then ask the creator to publish other works Creators will be able to know what kind of comics users want the most so the creators can make more profit by creating the contents what users want Gomics platform will manage GOM token that users hold and allow community users to participate in the ecosystem Gomics wants users to be part of the ecosystem We expect that all community users will contribute to the growth of Gomics ecosystem 4 4 3 Support for Creators Except for the above features GOM token allow creators to create great works In general the cost of producing good comics or animation products is high which is not beneficial for creators For example if you invest in comics that is not well known to many people it is difficult to predict the reaction of market Therefore if a comic creator has to spend a lot of production costs it generally will not be easy to make a good work Gomics created the platform enabling comics creators to quickly create their works in order to resolve these issues Creators can pay the production costs using legal tender as well as GOM token under the support of the platform Details of the production costs are specified in the
