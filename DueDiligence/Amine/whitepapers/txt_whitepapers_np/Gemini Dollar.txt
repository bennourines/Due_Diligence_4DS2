b The Gemini Dollar A Regulated Stable Value Coin Gemini Trust Company LLC dollar@gemini com Abstract\xe2\x80\x8b The Gemini dollar is a cryptographic token that is (i) issued by a New York trust company (ii) strictly pegged 1 1 to the U S dollar and (iii) built on the Ethereum network [1] according to the ERC20 standard for tokens The Gemini dollar is a stable value coin that combines the creditworthiness and price stability of the U S dollar with the technological advantages of a cryptocurrency and the oversight of U S regulators As an ERC20 compliant token the Gemini dollar can be transferred on the Ethereum network Gemini dollars are created at the time of withdrawal from the Gemini platform and redeemed or \xe2\x80\x9cdestroyed\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of deposit into the Gemini platform 1 Introduction Cryptocurrencies have recently surged in popularity and investor interest While they bear a promise perhaps as profound as the Internet itself they suffer from substantial price volatility thereby hindering their use as a medium of exchange and unit of account (two of the three functions of money) One proposed solution is the creation of a stable value coin (often called a \xe2\x80\x9cstablecoin\xe2\x80\x9d) whereby an issuer distributes a cryptographic token to customers in exchange for a specified fiat currency like the U S dollar at a fixed 1 1 exchange rate Because the U S dollar is a highly desirable medium of exchange as well as a globally accepted unit of account it is a desirable peg for a stablecoin Several implementations of fiat pegged stablecoins have been proposed however they all lack some combination of \xe2\x80\x8bsupervision\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8btransparency\xe2\x80\x8b and \xe2\x80\x8bexamination \xe2\x80\x8b[3] As a result doubts surrounding their solvency persist as do concerns regarding the systemic risks they pose [4] What is needed is a stablecoin that people can trust In this paper we propose the Gemini dollar a regulated \xe2\x80\x8bstablecoin that combines the creditworthiness and price stability of the U S dollar with the technological advantages of a cryptocurrency and the oversight of U S regulators 2 Trust Building a viable stablecoin is as much of a \xe2\x80\x8btrust\xe2\x80\x8b problem as it is a computer science one While Bitcoin [4] created a system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust a fiat pegged stablecoin requires both due to its reliance on a centralized issuer Desirable outcomes in a system that relies (at least in part) on trust requires \xe2\x80\x8boversight\xe2\x80\x8b In the context of a stablecoin we submit that the issuer must be licensed and subject to regulatory supervision From this transparency and examination become requirements of the system ensuring its integrity and 1 \x0cengendering market confidence We propose Gemini Trust Company LLC (Gemini) a New York trust company as the issuer of the Gemini dollar Gemini operates under the direct supervision and regulatory authority of the New York State Department of Financial Services and is subject to the New York Banking Law and other applicable U S laws and regulations Gemini maintains the necessary licenses and registrations to lawfully issue Gemini dollars 3 Proof of Solvency One desirable outcome of a stablecoin is convergence between the tokens issued and the U S dollars exchanged for their creation The amount of tokens issued and in circulation can be observed on the blockchain however verifying the underlying U S dollar balance to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x8bproof of solvency requires examination by a trusted party For assurance we propose that the audit committee of the board of directors of Gemini engage an independent registered public accounting firm to regularly examine and attest to the underlying U S dollar balance in accordance with the attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 4 Creation Redemption and Transfer A simple and elegant mechanism for creation and redemption is necessary to promote useability and encourage adoption We achieve this by allowing Gemini customers to create and redeem Gemini dollars on the Gemini platform Gemini dollars are created at the time of withdrawal from the Gemini platform Gemini customers may exchange U S dollars for Gemini dollars at a 1 1 exchange rate by initiating a withdrawal of Gemini dollars from their Gemini account to any Ethereum address they specify The U S dollar amount of Gemini dollars is debited from a customer\xe2\x80\x99s Gemini account balance at the time of withdrawal Gemini dollars are redeemed or \xe2\x80\x9cdestroyed\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of deposit into the Gemini platform Gemini customers may exchange Gemini dollars for U S dollars at a 1 1 exchange rate by depositing Gemini dollars into their Gemini account The U S dollar amount of Gemini dollars is credited to a customer\xe2\x80\x99s Gemini account balance at the time of deposit The Gemini dollar can be transferred on the Ethereum network 5 Contract Specification The specifications of the Gemini dollar require a network that allows for the development of decentralized applications (including smart contracts) that may be used to store and transfer value according to certain conditions set by the developer The Ethereum network fulfills this criteria and has a technical standard for tokens the \xe2\x80\x98ERC20\xe2\x80\x99 standard [4] which has experienced widespread global adoption As a result there already exists a plethora of software and services that support ERC20 compliant tokens and provide access to and usability for end users (cf Tether as originally built on Omni Layer a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain [5]) Alternatively if the Gemini dollar were built as the native token of its own blockchain it would take time for a similarly vibrant ecosystem of third party developers and software to emerge As a result we have built the Gemini dollar as an ERC20 compliant token on the Ethereum 2 \x0cnetwork Consequently the Gemini dollar can be transferred on the Ethereum network and stored in any Ethereum address 6 Contract Separation As a regulated issuer we need a technical design and implementation that gives us the ability to upgrade the Gemini dollar token so we can 1) 2) 3) 4) Resolve vulnerabilities Extend the system with new features Improve the system and optimize its operational efficiency and Pause block or reverse token transfers in response to a security incident (i e catastrophic event) or if legally obligated or compelled to do so by a court of law or other governmental body We enable upgrades (the mechanism for which we describe in more detail below) by building a system of smart contracts that cooperate with each other The core components of the Gemini dollar system are three smart contracts that we refer to as \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x98Proxy \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x98Impl \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b and \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x98Store \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b The smart contract known as \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 is the public face of the Gemini dollar \xe2\x80\x94 it is the Gemini dollar\xe2\x80\x99s permanent address on the Ethereum blockchain There is and will only ever be one instance of \xe2\x80\x98Proxy \xe2\x80\x99 It provides the interface with which token holders can interact and perform operations such as transferring tokens and viewing token balances however \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 contains neither the code nor the data that comprises the behavior and state of the Gemini dollar Instead \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 delegates the right to execute the logic that governs token transfers issuance and other core features to the smart contract known as \xe2\x80\x98Impl \xe2\x80\x99 In turn \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99 does not directly control the data that constitutes the ledger of the Gemini dollar (i e the mapping of token holders to their balances) instead it delegates ownership of the ledger to the smart contract known as \xe2\x80\x98Store\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 the external and eternal Gemini dollar ledger 7 Contract Custodianship For certain high risk actions in the Gemini dollar system we need an offline approval mechanism We therefore require each smart contract in the Gemini dollar system to look to a custodian for approval A custodian may be another smart contract or a keyset (online or offline) A custodian may look to another custodian which may look to another custodian and so forth thereby creating a chain of custody or \xe2\x80\x9ccustodianship \xe2\x80\x9d For instance a smart contract may look to another smart contract which ultimately looks 3 \x0cto a keyset for approval If a smart contract\xe2\x80\x99s custodianship terminates to an offline keyset an offline approval mechanism for its actions has been created For example \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 looks to a smart contract called \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x98Custodian \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b which ultimately looks to an offline keyset for approval Likewise \xe2\x80\x98Store\xe2\x80\x99 looks to \xe2\x80\x98Custodian \xe2\x80\x99 which ultimately looks to an offline keyset for approval 8 Contract Upgrades Upgrading the Gemini dollar token is a high risk action that utilizes the Gemini dollar system\xe2\x80\x99s offline approval mechanism To do this we replace the current instance of \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99 by instructing \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 (via \xe2\x80\x98Custodian\xe2\x80\x99) to delegate active token implementation to a new instance of \xe2\x80\x98Impl \xe2\x80\x99 and instructing \xe2\x80\x98Store\xe2\x80\x99 (via \xe2\x80\x98Custodian\xe2\x80\x99) to treat this new instance of \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99 as its single trusted source when accepting updates to the Gemini dollar ledger 4 \x0cThe above diagram reflects a post upgrade state of the world whereby the previous instance of \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b(1)\xe2\x80\x8b has been replaced by a new instance of \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b(2)\xe2\x80\x8b The instance of \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 now delegates to \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b(2)\xe2\x80\x8b Similarly the instance of \xe2\x80\x98Store\xe2\x80\x99 now only accepts calls from \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b(2)\xe2\x80\x8b The previous instance of \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99 remains but has become inert because it is now unlinked from the system Taken together the custodianship of \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Store\xe2\x80\x99 makes Gemini dollar system upgrades possible In addition custodianship itself can be upgraded For example if we need to change our offline keyset we can instruct \xe2\x80\x98Custodian\xe2\x80\x99 to instruct \xe2\x80\x98Proxy\xe2\x80\x99 to look to a new instance of \xe2\x80\x98Custodian\xe2\x80\x99 that looks to a new offline keyset 9 Printing Tokens Printing tokens is a high risk action \xe2\x80\x94 the amount of Gemini dollars issued and in circulation must never exceed the underlying U S dollar balance We need a solution that provides the security of an offline approval mechanism yet the flexibility of an online approval mechanism We propose a hybrid solution whereby the custodianship of \xe2\x80\x98Impl \xe2\x80\x99 the smart contract that controls increases to supply of Gemini dollar tokens involves both an online and offline approval mechanism To implement this unique approach we insert a smart contract called \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x98PrintLimiter\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b into the \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99 chain of custody 5 \x0cWith the approval of an \xe2\x80\x8bonline\xe2\x80\x8b key \xe2\x80\x98Impl\xe2\x80\x99 may print Gemini dollars up to an amount or \xe2\x80\x9climit\xe2\x80\x9d as specified by \xe2\x80\x98PrintLimiter \xe2\x80\x99 This limit may be increased with approval of an \xe2\x80\x8boffline\xe2\x80\x8b keyset (or decreased with approval of an \xe2\x80\x8bonline\xe2\x80\x8b key) This solution gives the Gemini dollar system the desired level of security and flexibility with respect to token issuance 10 Contract Security The Gemini dollar system implements the following security features 1) Offline Keys Keys that approve high risk actions are stored offline in Gemini s proprietary Cold Storage System 2) Key Generation Keys are generated stored and managed onboard hardware security modules (HSMs) We only use HSMs each a \xe2\x80\x9csigner \xe2\x80\x9d that have achieved a rating of FIPS PUB 140 2 Level 3 or higher [7] 3) Dual Control (Multisignature) High risk actions require approval (i e digital signatures) from at least two signers We utilize an \xe2\x80\x8bM\xe2\x80\x8b of \xe2\x80\x8bN\xe2\x80\x8b signing design whereby \xe2\x80\x8bM=2 \xe2\x80\x8b This provides both security and fault tolerance 4) Time Lock Even after approval high risk actions are locked for a minimum period of time before being executed This provides a grace period to detect \xe2\x80\x94 and preemptively respond to \xe2\x80\x94 potential security incidents 5) Revocation Pending actions can be revoked allowing for the nullification of erroneous or malicious actions before being executed 11 Conclusion We have proposed a solution for a stablecoin that establishes trust through cryptographic proof and regulatory oversight Our technical design is implemented on the Ethereum network It includes an upgrade feature an offline approval mechanism for high risk actions and a hybrid online offline approval mechanism for token issuance that provides the desired level of security and flexibility Our trust implementation involves linking licensed financial institutions and examiners to form a network of trust Together these implementations form the Gemini dollar a regulated stablecoin that can serve as a viable medium of exchange and unit of account for centralized and decentralized applications References [1] V Buterin et al \xe2\x80\x9cA next generation smart
