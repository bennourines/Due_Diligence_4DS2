b \x0cBrahma OS Technical White Paper Version 1 0 March 14 2018 Abstract Brahma OS is an operating system that supports decentralized networks with the deconstruction of existing services and the use of various decentralized services and components which ensures that users can make use of services and applications on the blockchain safely and easily 1 \x0cContents 1 Background 3 2 Requirements of

bitcoin in 2008 Since then developers and entrepreneurs have been experimenting with this technology in hopes of using it in a broader range of products to solve the technical pain points in di\xe2\x86\xb5erent area of industry However blockchain technology is not a technology that solves technical pain points in the existing corporate structures Instead it works on a self governing and noncentral value network to sustain a safe continuous operation of the network through incentives mechanism Ethernet brings the potential for non stop applications with the smart contract architecture In a short year of 2017 revolutionary solutions and implementations such as the Kyber Network 0x Protocol and Radian Network emerged over the Ethernet bringing the prospects and expectations of non center application to the future At the same time other public chains which can carry applications is also emerging such as EOS or ADA However electronic devices such as the mobile phone which has the most signi\xef\xac\x81cant number of users and which takes most time of the users still runs on an OS that relies on a central server from user account systems to personal data backups then to building application logic on OS Apparently the existing OS does not provide a foundation for the future application of the blockchain 2 Requirements of decentralized OS Unlike iOS and Android OS decentralized OS requires complete removal of the architecture design of the central server at the beginning from basic services to upper level 4 \x0capplication achitecture While ensuring the usage habits on the UI / UX level as much as possible we pay more attention to the function and the value that central services can play in the OS 2 1 Data privacy When using an OS it is valuable whether the data is intentionally generated by the user or by an inadvertent operation Such data forms the basis of arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence analysis and is called factual data With the same factual data di\xe2\x86\xb5erent user portraits can be generated when data mining algorithms are optimized Moreover all the personalized services we know today such as online shopping recommendations friend recommendations or voice recognition rely on user portraits generated by factual data These factual data of billions of users made it possible for the commercial empire like Facebook or Google to be established However in the commercial closed loop of centralized services users contribute their actions and factual data but do not get \xef\xac\x81nancial reward These data can be sold again and again In a way business models for systems and App vendors are now mainly based on the user privacy data without giving \xef\xac\x81nancial rewards to the user In Brahma OS privacy issues could be fundamentally solved Stealing and exploiting user privacy data would become very dicult to perform 2 2 Accessible network communication Whether in the blockchain \xef\xac\x81eld or the current Internet economy \xef\xac\x81eld network communication connections are issues that need to be solved \xef\xac\x81rst How to access to data on the web at any time becomes a crucial issue When we talk about network communications most of the time we are talking about 5 \x0chow the terminal connects to a wide area network In the current architecture the terminal device connects to the meta network (i e the local area network to which it can connect directly) Then meta network connects to di\xe2\x86\xb5erent meta network or the upper network through the router and switch Most of the connections between di\xe2\x86\xb5erent meta networks are current operators From this we can have two layers network and router The end nodes in the meta network can form a peer to peer network that is the nodes in any meta network are o\xe2\x9c\x8fine and should not cause unreachable communication in the meta network This is not the core of our concern as its connectivity problems are not hard to solve The critical problem goes to the router In current network communications we must trust and can only trust the router In fact the router not only can completely intercept and spy on the data protocol and trend of communication between meta networks but also act on it such as tampering the service and denying the service In currently available network communications OS end users face two major problems privacy exposure unprotected accessibility Therefore in the Brahma OS we expect to build a peer to peer OS network to ensure the encryption of the communication data and the non identi\xef\xac\x81ability of communication data through protocol confusion at the data transport level and to build an autonomous connected network based on the con\xef\xac\x81guration of the routing 2 3 Decentralized Storage Today most of the OS provides users with the fonction of cloud storage Users in di\xe2\x86\xb5erent devices only need to log in to the same account to access the same data Cloud storage brings users personal conveniences At the same time there are some potential problems with personal data security 6 \x0cDropbox loopholes lead to loss of personal data Nude photos of some celebrities were leaked when their iCloud accounts were attacked by hackers Issues like th se reveal an apparent problem in the current centralized cloud storage architecture It is only a matter of time before the security problem is revealed Decentralized chain storage avoids this kind of problem from the very beginning of the design Taking IPFS as an example the decentralized storage has no server that can be attacked or be traced All data are divided into multiple parts randomly stored in di\xe2\x86\xb5erent nodes of the network The entire network is safe and ecient for storage and transmission thanks to miners in storage networks When building storage services Brahma OS uses directly decentralized web services For now we do not guarantee the use of IPFS We would compare other potential decentralized storage services like Sia Storj and MaidSafe as well 2 4 Cryptographic assets management Asset management is a function need to be completed at the wallet application layer We consider this demand from the OS\xe2\x80\x99s perspective In the foreseeable future cryptographic assets would be less dependent on centralized exchanges The role of centralized exchanges transforms from the current speculative trading into connecting blockchain assets and legal assets Cryptographic assets exchange can be ful\xef\xac\x81lled with decentralized services Now based on the backbone of Ethereum we can provide service by building transaction relayer with the 0x protocol This protocol can connect all the other built replayer That is this protocol does not only provide liquidity within a single application but the asset liquidity among all replayer Another possible way is through Kyber Network Unlike Ox Kyber Network it 7 \x0cself can serve as a decentralized exchange An exchange or convert request can be executed immediately within a single transaction without a relayer Compared with available options of exchange service it is necessary to construct exchange service from the OS level Brahma OS can be the carrier of many D Apps All consumption in D App should be on chain (rapid transactions o\xe2\x86\xb5 chain would be on chain eventually) In the process of a transaction a payment request can be initiated by a D App and can go directly to an end user 2 5 Autonomous economic system From last year there have been signi\xef\xac\x81cant technological breakthroughs on Ethereum These breakthroughs bring closer the distance between the blockchain and users In the initial stage Brahma OS provided autonomous unobstructed network communication service and foundation of the upper application services by integrating technical solutions such as IPFS Kyber Network and 0x With the cross link technology and Brahma OS backbones we will build a complete ecosystem based on the Brahma OS chain that connects other backbones such as ETH EOS and ADA 8 \x0c3 3 1 Architecture Layered design Brahma OS uses a layered design scheme to stratify Chain Runtime and Framework Taking into account the Android native application compatibility issues we separate the Virtual Machine so that Android App runtime environment and D App runtime environment are entirely isolated and to ensure that even if there is dangerous behavior Android App cannot get any information from D App Brahma Virtual Machine (BVM) is specially designed for D App in Brahma OS for its op ration and for the operation of its associated framework and Libraries 9 \x0cBrahma\xe2\x80\x99s independant chain works as a Chain Context It is expected to serve as an intermediary role to connect other application chains (such as Ethereum EOS etc ) through Chain Relayer 3 2 Consensus algorithm As an independent blockchain Brahma OS Chain\xe2\x80\x99s consensus algorithm is crucial to data security Currently we mainly consider two possible projects DPoS and DAG DPoS was originally proposed by Bytemaster and used in BitShares Steemit and EOS Its main features are higher TPS (TX per second) and at lower consensus maintenance costs In contrast to the PoW consensus competition mechanism DPoS tends to reach a consensus with the collaboration of Witness node DAG is a graph in graph theory In the beginning IOTA attempted to replace the existing blockchain structure with DAG to provide a value delivery network through mathematical proof rather than through consensus mechanism After IOTA there are other projects such as Byteball which proposed improvements of DAG The main feature of DAG is the ability to deal with transaction requests at higher concurrency without block structure and therefore no limit to TPS 3 3 Compatibility and security We believe that decentralized OS will eventually replace the current centralized OS That requires not only time and e\xe2\x86\xb5ort of users but also their learning process That is why at the beginning of the design we take both compatibility and security into consideration The existing Android OS is relatively complete Therefore we consider providing a runtime environment with Dalvik Virtual Machine for the existing Android App while working on the related products of Brahma OS (such as Brahma Virtual Ma10 \x0cchine and Brahma Chain) In this way we guarantee the compatibility of our product and at the same time we isolate the interaction between the Android App and the D App at the runtime level thereby avoiding the possibility that the Android App steals the key and information from the D App 11 \x0c4 Identity Identity is the primary element in any system and the premise of logical interaction and functional interaction between man and machine In Brahma OS the identity is no longer dependent on the centralized service account system but directly use the blockchain public key as the the user identity to connect to the entire decentralized service system 4 1 About \xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d The reason why we will give up the centralized service account system is mainly based on our understanding of the identity of \xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d in the entire network architecture In current centralized account system end users need to register to get a distributed identity from a centralized service provider This identity authorizes the user to log in to the system for the follow up operation which brings several problems \xe2\x80\xa2 When switching between di\xe2\x86\xb5erent account systems the data of \xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d do not interwork with each other \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d is redundant in di\xe2\x86\xb5erent accounts and not mutually exclusive \xe2\x80\xa2 All factual data and user portrait generate by \xe2\x80\x9dmy\xe2\x80\x9d act can be easily obtained at no cost by a centralized service provider In summary \xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d is authorized to access in current centralized network and its factual data is unconditionally deprived When the password of an account is leaked or the service provider is hacked or user\xe2\x80\x99s personal data \xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d becomes powerless 12 \x0c4 2 Role and value of identity Based on our perception of \xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x9d i e identity we know that identity as an access token to the system is linked to a set of business logic The identities built on the central service providers are isolated redundant non cross linked and insecure However user\xe2\x80\x99s identity is a valuable resource and barrier in the current Internet economy Therefore returning the value of identity to the user is important for Brahma OS Through the above description we can see that identity in a complete system plays two roles \xe2\x80\xa2 get account system authorization \xe2\x80\xa2 access and operate the account system In Brahma OS identities plays other roles \xe2\x80\xa2 asset identi\xef\xac\x81cation \xe2\x80\xa2 user portrait \xe2\x80\xa2 user portrait D App match Brahma OS expects to o\xe2\x86\xb5er users the opportunity to collect user factual data at the OS level and to train their AI for the perfection of user portraits When D App needs to use these user portraits it pays directly to the user to ensure that the \xef\xac\x81nal revenue belongs to the owner of the OS not to any intermediate role 4 3 Signi\xef\xac\x81cance of decentralized storage Decentralized storage of user related data can be more valuable than other centralized cloud storage We talk about several disadvantages of centralized cloud storage 13 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 It exists systemic security risks in centralized systems \xe2\x80\xa2 Cloud storage service providers do not share identity information \xe2\x80\xa2 Any centralized cloud storage service providers\xe2\x80\x99 compromising will threaten other service providers At the beginning of designing the decentralized storage we avoid such kind of problems Even if the key is stolen due to personal or other reasons the leakage of personal data will not cause the loss of other user data in the system At the same time the user\xe2\x80\x99s identity is no longer the source for commercial companies to get user\xe2\x80\x99s personal information All fees will go back to the user himself The problem of requiring centralized storage and processing of user\xe2\x80\x99s data was circumvented from the very beginning Everyone holds their own data which distributed discretely in a decentralized storage network No one (organization) can monitor the whereabouts and content of personal data or hijack user data This will bring a lot of possibilities for protecting personal data privacy the behavior freedom and the value return It is the basis for reshaping the existing business model 14 \x0c5 Network Network connectivity will eventually be accessible without barrier 5 1 Role of network In Brahma OS\xe2\x80\x99s network we can ensure network connectivity and autonomous economic construction in di\xe2\x86\xb5erent ways Here we distinguish the way of meta network nodes and routing network nodes 5 2 Construction of meta network Meta network is the smallest unit of a local area network In the meta network di\xe2\x86\xb5erent nodes are peer to peer with each other and do not need additional trac costs Therefore the construction of meta networks mainly occurs in a small area The interconnection between devices at a short distance can be achieved directly through Bluetooth and other protocols Brahma OS can be interconnected to build a meta network and di\xe2\x86\xb5use as a minimum unit When sending data in the meta network the application layer protocol itself will do many obfuscation measures the data will be fragmented encrypted to ensure that the data transmission in the meta network will not leak data content 5 3 Routing Routing can connect to di\xe2\x86\xb5erent meta networks and the upper WAN Multiple routing can form a meta network structure They provide data exchange services between di\xe2\x86\xb5erent meta networks to form a non central trac market 15 \x0cIn Brahma OS routing nodes which connect to di\xe2\x86\xb5erent meta networks can provide trac exchange between di\xe2\x86\xb5erent meta networks or between meta networks and wide area networks Thus a device as a routing node can obtain some economic return as well 6 Application basis The purpose of Brahma OS with decentralized services is to provide a foundation for applications D App developers do not need to put too much e\xe2\x86\xb5ort into how to get decentralized services but to focus on how to construct application logic 6 1 Runtime environment The Brahma OS runtime environment runs as a sandbox environment for Native D App We should ensure \xe2\x80\xa2 complete isolation \xe2\x80\xa2 executive eciency \xe2\x80\xa2 decentralized component of the calling environment Complete isolation provides safe running space for D App \xe2\x80\x9dSecurity\xe2\x80\x9d in this context means not only that the data of a App itself cannot be infringed but also that the operation with other App is isolated from each other As a Native App the eciency of execution is crucial which is directly related to the quality of the user experience At the system\xe2\x80\x99s priority level Brahma OS preempts transactions related to user interaction while network IO related execution runs in parallel in the background 16 \x0c6 2 Application structure The D App above Brahma OS should include two key components Brahma OS services components UI components 6 3 Decentralized service components As mentioned above many decentralized services above Ethereum are being introduced For developers how to interface with best practices is crucial It a\xe2\x86\xb5ects not only development progress of D App but also user\xe2\x80\x99s asset security or other issues Therefore Brahma OS is expected to provide developers with \xe2\x80\xa2 components SDK for quick integration \xe2\x80\xa2 rich documentation \xe2\x80\xa2 best practice access sample \xe2\x80\xa2 actively involved developer community For example when a user in a D App needs to purchase an item using ETH he no longer needs to go to the wallet to start a transaction Instead he use Brahma OS\xe2\x80\x99s payment component in the game to show the payment request information to the user User\xe2\x80\x99s perspective will also change from the transaction logic in the past to the payment logic It brings possibilities for a wider use of cryptographic assets 6 4 D App store In addition to bringing a lot of technological breakthroughs Brahma OS brings a huge possibility for next new ecology D App Store Unlike App Store or Google Play we expect D App not to be a centralized operator but a decentralized market where users are directly involved in operations New business models can build on it For example the revenue from D App can 17 \x0cdirectly go to the rating users or recommended users without any intermediate role to deprive D App\xe2\x80\x99s revenue 18 \x0c7 Conclusion Brahma OS is stepping into a whole new area which cryptocurrency has never touched before It will act as the central role in connecting end users to the blockchain network It not only integrates many of the existing decentralized services but also provides its developers with an infrastructure and a complete ecosystem to quickly build applications It shows an important advance in the exploration of blockchain technology Moreover since user identity data is no longer divided into di\xe2\x86\xb5erent central systems di\xe2\x86\xb5erent D Apps can be more personalized based on the same user identity Developers can \xef\xac\x81nd users that meet their target audience by paying the D App Store\xe2\x80\x99s recommender system These users can receive payment directly At the same time it could promote a higher conversion rate of D App 19 \x0c8 Roadmap
