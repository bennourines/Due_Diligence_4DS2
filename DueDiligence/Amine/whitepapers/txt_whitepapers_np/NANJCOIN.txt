b \x0c1 ABOUT NANJCOIN What is NANJCOIN NANJCOIN is an Ethereum token developed and managed by the users of 2ch sc\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNandemo Jikkyou\xe2\x80\x9d message board or NanJ for short The Nandemo Jikkyou board is a place where passionate sports fans (also known as Nanjinians or J Boys) gather and engage in sublimely trivial banter day and night Shortly after its creation the NANJCOIN Discord community quickly gained momentum attracting a variety of members from all walks of life and continues to grow by the day NANJCOIN was conceived with the mission of better enjoying sports and aims to expand by working together with business partners in the sports industry By making transactions with NANJCOIN you will reap greater and more unique bene\xef\xac\x81ts unobtainable through regular payment methods In addition NANJCOIN will also provide a system for conveniently making donations to sports organizations in need of \xef\xac\x81nancial support be they individual players teams niche domestic sports with little backing or even regional sports clubs (From Stage 3) NANJ plans to implement a voting system through which members can use tokens to nominate various sports teams to be managed directly by the community *NANJCOIN is a fan community and is in no way af\xef\xac\x81liated with 2ch sc or 5ch NANJCOIN WHITE PAPER 2018 \x0c2 The Fans\xe2\x80\x99 Wishes Fans wanting to make an impact One day in January of 2018 after seeing a message a community member known as Icchi (said to be the primordial user) posted to the board reading \xe2\x80\x9cI made a cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\x9d the community sprung to action Having acquired the \xe2\x80\x9cmeans\xe2\x80\x9d of a cryptocurrency for days we discussed how to make the most of it eventually coming to a consensus that we might as well use it to try to make a system with which we can contribute to our favorite sports teams Following a round of surveys conducted within the community and on social media to hammer out a more concrete course of action it was discovered that most people within the community wanted to make a more tangible impact on their favorite sports 90% of fans who have never been to a game in person say that they would consider purchasing tickets with NANJCOIN 90% of fans who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to a sports game in the last year have responded to surveys saying that they would gladly use or at least consider using NANJCOIN to purchase tickets if the option is available Some people also said that they would like to reserve seats where they can enjoy the game with fellow community members while others 90% would like a way to go to sports games that isn\xe2\x80\x99t so intimidating The percentage of people who said they would consider using NANJCOIN to purchase tickets Over half of sports fans wish to be more proactive in donating to players Over half of fans who have been to a sports game in the last year responded to surveys saying they would like to take more action in the form of making donations to players and teams Core fans who already purchase tickets and merchandise would like even more ways to contribute be it to individual players who made a fantastic play teams or retired players looking to start a new life NANJCOIN WHITE PAPER 2018 \x0cThe future of NANJCOIN A world realized by NANJCOIN In junction with publicly developed applications NANJCOIN plans to provide various features to the userbase essential for enjoying sports as well as proactively work with business partners to allow NANJCOIN to be used with various sports related organizations and facilities both domestic and international For example let\xe2\x80\x99s say someone who has never been to a baseball game before suddenly gets the urge to one day Having made the decision they\xe2\x80\x99re then confronted with various dilemmas Who do I go with Where should I buy tickets What should I do at the stadium They may be overwhelmed and intimidated to the point where they give up on going altogether But what if someday tickets and entrance fees could be paid for through services provided by NANJCOIN On top of that if they had the option to look for members within the NANJCOIN community to go with or purchase seats in a section reserved for NANJCOIN users it would drastically reduce the hurdles and mental stress involved NANJCOIN provides the perfect opportunity for those looking to get into the joy of watching sports games in person There are also many obstacles that arise when one decides that they want to donate to an individual player or team It\xe2\x80\x99s dif\xef\xac\x81cult enough \xef\xac\x81nding the right place to send your donation and even if you do it\ s hard to be sure your money is going to where you intend Those of you who have made any sort of application form before may be familiar but the strong disconnect between end user and client can severely hinder a process from working as it should But if fans could simply use the aforementioned application to pick their player or organization of choice to donate to directly it would provide the means to support the sports industry easier than ever before Users would be able to check if their donation was received by simply looking at the blockchain all while making a difference from the comfort of their own homes This framework will allow the sports industry to become more self suf\xef\xac\x81cient effectively overturning the industry\xe2\x80\x99s conventional revenue models NANJCOIN WHITE PAPER 2018 3 \x0c4 The world realized by NANJCOIN ETC The Road to Becoming the Number One Cryptocurrency With the motto of becoming the number one used cryptocurrency NANJCOIN plans to remain proactive in seeking out collaborations and developing systems in the interest of building an economic bloc within the sports industry We hope to aim for a world where the Blockchain platform is ready for use in everyday life We strive to create an ideal environment in which anyone is free to participate and contribute to the NANJCOIN project As passionate lovers of baseball we \xef\xac\x81rst intend to form business relationships with various organizations within the industry to pave the way for NANJCOIN to be used for baseball related goods and services However purchasing a baseball team (as seen on the roadmap) is not our end goal What sports teams require to become truly independent is a self sustaining revenue system Our goal is to develop a scheme to make that dream a reality across every sport Sports move and inspire fans and fans in turn fuel the sports industry with their appreciation\xe2\x80\x94that is the kind of world we wish to create NANJCOIN WHITE PAPER 2018 \x0c5 NANJCOIN The Merits of ERC223 Tokens NANJCOIN is an Ethereum token based on the ERC223 standard and is the \xef\xac\x81rst TokenName\xef\xbc\x9a NANJCOIN cryptocurrency developed in Japan While TokenSymbol\xef\xbc\x9a NANJ ERC20 is currently the most popularized PublishNumber\xef\xbc\x9a 30 billion form of Et h ereu m t oken s ERC2 3 3 is gaining E R C 223 attention as an upwardly compatible standard that revises on ERC20\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x82aws such as \xef\xac\x81xing the issue in which tokens can no longer be transferred in the event one sends funds to an incorrect or invalid contact address Additionally with the speci\xef\xac\x81cation change tokens can also be transferred at half the cost of the ERC20 ERC223 is backwards compatible with ERC20 making it available for use in ERC20 supported service tools and wallets such as MyEtherWallet MetaMask and Mist ERC233 also carries the big plus of being scheduled for used with revolutionary services like Raiden and Plasma in the near future Using the ERC233 standard as a base NANJCOIN comes mounted with many features For example using the Airdrop feature included users can distribute tokens to multiple people simultaneously via Airdrop while keeping transfer fees low Furthermore since this feature is available to everyone NANJCOIN holders can user Airdrop at any time On top of that account freeze and lockup features are also included The ability to freeze the addresses of malicious users and temporarily lock management held tokens allows us to both maintain and increase NANJCOIN\xe2\x80\x99s value Additionally the number of tokens in circulation can be adjusted through the Burn (decrease) and Mint (increase) features The Mint feature can also be turned off forever Token Allocation 10 Pre Season 60\xef\xbc\x85 % 15 % 60 15 % % marketing Fee 15\xef\xbc\x85 Development Fee 15\xef\xbc\x85 organization 10\xef\xbc\x85 Most of the virtual currencies thus far have vague de\xef\xac\x81nitions of the requirements such as possessing a majority to become the management team Therefore for clarity the minimum required possession percentage of NANJCOIN to function as the aforementioned management team is set to be 10% of the total The bene\xef\xac\x81t of declaring this percentage is that even if the management team sells out the market will not collapse because the managing team does not hold the majority Certainly there will be a secondary countermeasure of requiring the holder to clearly state that it is not their intent to disturb the market by undercutting or overselling Following the opening game we plan to sell 18 billion NANJ which is 60% of the total issued volume Likewise after the opening burns and lockups will be implemented for unsold tokens NANJCOIN WHITE PAPER 2018 \x0c6 Roadmap Do you want to see new stage for the Fun and Sports
