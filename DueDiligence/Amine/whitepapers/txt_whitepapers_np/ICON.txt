 In the initial stage of the network verification nodes transfer the transactions that need to be executed executed to the leader node The leader node then creates a block from collected transactions and transfers the to the leader node The leader node then creates a block from collected transactions and transfers the block to all the other verification nodes with its own signature When each verification node receives the block to all the other verification nodes with its own signature When each verification node receives the block they 1) confirm the creation block they 1) confirm the creation of the block 2) check if the block level and the prior block hash are of the block 2) check if the block level and the prior block hash are correct and 3) validate the block data If step 1 to 3 are correct ‘vote data’ is generated and shared to correct and 3) validate the block data If step 1 to 3 are correct ‘vote data’ is generated and shared to all nodes It is important to transmit vote data to every node If leader nodall nodes It is important to transmit vote data to every node If leader node is Byzantine it is possible e is Byzantine it is possible to separate certain nodes from the network by transmitting blocks only to the nodes that is above the to separate certain nodes from the network by transmitting blocks only to the nodes that is above the quorum To prohibit this sort of problem vote data is transmitted to every node A node without any quorum To prohibit this sort of problem vote data is transmitted to every node A node without any block can know if the block can know if the block is created or not and also request the block to the others block is created or not and also request the block to the others 
 To create blocks leader receives vote data from nodes more than quorum Leader creates new blocks
 To create blocks leader receives vote data from nodes more than quorum Leader creates new blocks with vote data and transmits to every node This saves the need to transmit every data oncewith vote data and transmits to every node This saves the need to transmit every data once again to again to guarantee that nodes more than the quorum have finished the same vote It also allows to confirm the guarantee that nodes more than the quorum have finished the same vote It also allows to confirm the block by verifying the vote of new blocks If transmitted block is not the initial one validated node block by verifying the vote of new blocks If transmitted block is not the initial one validated node performs verification of vote data more thperforms verification of vote data more than quorum when verifying blocks This is when every node an quorum when verifying blocks This is when every node final commits prior blocks final commits prior blocks
