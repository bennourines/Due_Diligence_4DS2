www wetrust io Abstract WeTrust is a collaborative savings lending and insurance platform that is autonomous agnostic frictionless and decentralized WeTrust utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create a full stack alternative financial system that leverages existing social capital and trust networks eliminating the need for a \xe2\x80\x9ctrusted third party\xe2\x80\x9d allowing for lower fees improved incentive structures decentralized risks allowing a greater amount of capital to reside among the participants and ultimately improving financial inclusion on a global scale WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s first product is a Trusted Lending Circle (TLC) platform inspired by the ~1 billion people around the world who are using informal TLCs or Rotating and Saving Credit Associations (ROSCAs) to lend/ borrow and support each other financially within their communities On top of Trusted Lending Circles WeTrust plans to build future products that include sovereign credit identities trusted direct lending mutual insurance and more Vision WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s vision is to leverage social capital trust networks and blockchain technology to create a financial system that has aligned interests with all of it\xe2\x80\x99s participants 2 billion adults1 in this world do not have a bank account and the existing financial system has many contradictions One cannot get an affordable loan without having well paying job and good \xe2\x80\x8bDemirguc Kunt A Leora K Dorothe S and Van Oudheusden P \xe2\x80\x9cThe Global Findex Database 2014 Measuring Financial Inclusion around the World\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x9d (2015) 1 \x0ccredit while legitimate insurance claims directly reduce an insurance firm\xe2\x80\x99s profits The un banked and un insured are most hurt from this lack of access and misalignment of interests and are always in search of alternative financial solutions We believe that today\xe2\x80\x99s banks and insurance companies play an important role in society However in contrast to other industries where undifferentiated products result in low margins they thrive because of their important role as a \xe2\x80\x9ctrusted third party\xe2\x80\x9d Yet our research shows that there is an alternative to this dependency on a \xe2\x80\x9ctrusted third party\xe2\x80\x9d one which can help reduce the friction necessitated by centralized intermediaries and result in a more inclusive financial system where everyone has access to fair market priced credit and insurance A fundamental building block we plan to use in creating an alternative already exists via a tradition used globally by over 1 billion people Trusted Lending Circles (aka Rotating and Saving Credit Association or ROSCA) This grassroots organization leverages personal reputation and social ties and draws upon 2 000 years[1] of resilience and effectiveness in offering credit and insurance to communities around the world Our first product is a Trusted Lending Circle platform powered by the blockchain one which enables the creation of social safety nets that address economic uncertainty and provides opportunity for growth It is the first of a series of products that include credit identities and scores lending mutual insurance and much more all of which leverage the untapped social capital and trust networks that already exist In this whitepaper we propose a plan to implement our vision to amplify the strengths of social capital and reputation based networks while addressing their weaknesses scalability fraud and lack of innovation Naturally our products and research are always a work in progress We welcome comments questions and ideas for improvement from our community Please contact us \xe2\x80\x8bhere\xe2\x80\x8b with you thoughts Market Review Social safety nets have functioned among humans for millennia since prehistoric times starting from hunter gatherer societies[2] In modern times there are three primary forms of social safety nets Government Commercial and Reciprocal Government aid can come in the form of Social Security Unemployment Medicare etc Unavailable for most global citizens government aid is also underfunded where currently \x0coffered (US countries in the EU Japan etc\xe2\x80\xa6) according to leading economists2 While most people in developing countries already experience the lacking nature of Government Aid many in the developed countries are starting to realize that as well Commercial aid comes in the form of purchased insurance or emergency loans and is often laden with high operating costs especially for those who need it the most More importantly commercial aid has a shareholder first mentality often to the detriment of policyholders/ borrowers and has a precedent of taking risks that endanger the financial system (see AIG bailouts in 2008[3]) Lastly this form of safety net is simply inaccessible to two billion adults and their dependents ~40% of the global population The third option is Reciprocal Aid Simply put it is any organization where voluntary participants play the role of both aid giver and receiver depending on the circumstance They exist in many forms around the world including Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (referred to as Trusted Lending Circle from here on in this document also known by different local names globally) mutual insurance groups fraternal organizations religious groups and professional societies In these organizations participants receive by average what they contribute over the life of their membership and self reliance is a core attribute Their decline in recent years is due to inability to scale efficiently lack of transparency relative to Commercial aid and the increased role of Governmental Aid While these organizations play an important role in their respective communities and are currently used by billions of people globally across developing and developed economies Reciprocal Aid is \xe2\x80\x8bnot a panacea Instead WeTrust views reciprocal aid as a critical leg to the three legged stool of protection against uncertainty and serves a complementary role along with Government and Commercial aid Furthermore WeTrust believes that the Social Capital and Trust Networks found in traditional Reciprocal Aid organizations can be leveraged and blended with characteristics found in Commercial organizations to create entities that result in lower default rates better rates for both savers and borrowers lower expense ratios and lower fraudulent claims for insurance Lastly while many countries that rely upon Reciprocal Aid have low rates of financial inclusion some institutions have attempted to address the lack of financial inclusion by facilitating access to outside capital via peer to peer lending (P2P)[4] such as those offered by \xe2\x80\x8bKiva org\xe2\x80\x8b Kiva org is a well known non profit that has brought P2P loans to developing countries but it\xe2\x80\x99s penetration and usage has been limited and is in some cases controversial[5] due to high fees multiple transaction steps and lack of transparency WeTrust believes there is a way to improve financial inclusion via a reciprocal aid approach that is transparent requires low fees and promotes sustainable growth \xe2\x80\x8bFischer W and Sard B \xe2\x80\x9cChart Book Federal Housing Spending is Poorly Matched to

organization Savings and lending is a foundational building block of modern society serving as both funds in times of financial need and fuel for funding economic growth Access to capital can have impact of historical proportions Without access to capital Columbus\xe2\x80\x99s expeditions to the Americas may not have occurred and perhaps nor would the subsequent explorations of the \xe2\x80\x9cNew World\xe2\x80\x9d Without proper financing mechanisms neither the Industrial Revolution nor the tech boom in Silicon Valley would have spread at such rapid speed Both national and local economies are affected by the ease or difficulty to access capital For thousands of years people around the world have created mechanisms within the communities to save money lend and borrow from each other and create financial safety nets One of the most widespread communal financial institutions in the developing world are Trusted Lending Circles A Trusted Lending Circle is \xe2\x80\x9ca group of individuals who agree to meet for a defined period in order to save and borrow together a form of combined peer to peer banking and peer to peer lending \xe2\x80\x9d[6] Trusted Lending Circles are commonly built along clan geographical social or professional networks In countries around the world these organizations have a variety of different names such as \xe2\x80\x8bsusus \xe2\x80\x8b(Ghana/ Caribbean Islands) \xe2\x80\x8btandas (Latin America) \xe2\x80\x8bhui (China) \xe2\x80\x8bchit funds (India) \xe2\x80\x8bcundinas (Mexico) etc [7] Here is an example of the detailed mechanics of a Trusted Lending Circle in action\xe2\x80\x8b \x0cFigure1 1 Trusted Lending Circle mechanics in a single round Here is an example of the detailed mechanics of a Trusted Lending Circle running through a full epoch \x0cFigure1 2 Trusted Lending Circle mechanics in a full Epoch In a Trusted Lending Circle i\xe2\x80\x8bndividuals contribute a fixed amount for a set duration at regular intervals and the money is distributed each interval to individuals via a lottery a bidding process or other method as decided by participants (the example above shows bidding whereas a lottery is a random selection) Some researchers3 claim that these groups produce results where all participants are individually better off[8] (or no more worse off) than not participating in the group (pareto efficient[9]) Each Trusted Lending Circle has a foreperson who is organizing the Circle and is responsible to collect funds from all participants Trusted lending Circles are created among people with close and trusting relationships and social capital is the driving force for continuous participation 3 \xe2\x80\x8bAgegnehu B Karantininis \xe2\x80\x8bK and \xe2\x80\x8bLi

\xe2\x80\x8b229 238 (2012) \x0cTrusted Lending Circles have their own set of pros and cons compared to modern banking institutions Some advantages include \xe2\x97\x8f Reduced interest rates that are spread between savers and borrowers \xe2\x97\x8f Communal proprietorship \xe2\x80\x93 a financial institution that\xe2\x80\x99s owned by its users \xe2\x97\x8f Group saving has been shown to be more effective in achieving individual savings goals due to accountability akin to group exercise programs \xe2\x97\x8f Lack of bureaucracy less fraud lower default rates and non profit motive for the platform Community benefits from using Trusted Lending Circles \xe2\x97\x8f Facilitates reciprocation of credit disbursal The give and take interaction helps increase social bonds as borrowing and returning money is a significant sign of trust \xe2\x97\x8f Avoids exorbitant interest and fees that are funneled towards fragile centralized institutions thousands of miles away and keeps capital within the community encouraging growth in the local economy \xe2\x97\x8f Encourages community participation in other fields of development \xe2\x80\x93 the participatory approach of informal initiatives is easily replicable to a wide range of community development issues Disadvantages of Trusted Lending Circles \xe2\x97\x8f Informal groups are sub scale and difficult to increase in size due to the need for in person interaction resulting in less efficient lending supply/demand matching \xe2\x97\x8f Informal groups have zero tracking or credit building outside the immediate organization therefore no additional financial products can be built on top of one\xe2\x80\x99s successful credit history interacting with a siloed Lending Circle \xe2\x97\x8f High setup and handling fees charged by state run Lending Circles (e g 5% flat fee plus additional interest to access credit is typical in India Kerala State Company employs thousands and has billions in operational costs[10]) WeTrust Product Ecosystem WeTrust is developing a novel financial platform powered by social capital trust networks blockchain technology and includes Trusted Lending Circles Trusted direct lending mutual insurance and community based building of credit history WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s first product\xe2\x80\x8b is the Trusted Lending Circle a platform for Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA) which consists of a smart contract which automates the savings and lending process This encompasses contributions bidding assigning funds at the end of \x0ceach round and withdrawing funds We plan to package this within a mobile web application which an individual can use to manage their participation in one or multiple Trusted Lending Circles The product has built in network effects and incentivizes users to invite trusted associates which helps seed the network We believe group based borrowing and lending provides greater social incentives for all participants[11] and a customizable framework allows groups to operate according to their particular needs and circumstances A Trusted Lending Circle uses technology to \xe2\x80\x8bamplify the strengths and address the shortcomings of traditional ROSCAs by enabling scalability automating record keeping and reducing the potential for fraud In parallel\xe2\x80\x8b with developing Trusted Lending Circles we will also integrate the use of stablecoins These tokens have the transactional qualities of cryptocurrencies and are critical for widespread adoption as they are pegged one to one with fiat currencies and resistant to day to day volatility Our end goal is to have users be able to use our platform without having to understand the underlying complexity WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s second product \xe2\x80\x8bis distributed sovereign credit identities Credit identities will be created based on several factors adherence to Lending Circle terms and the quality of tethered social media accounts Responsible individuals will be able to build up a strong credit identity which will enable greater trustworthiness and eventually more powerful features such as the ability to vouch for other members and potentially build trust with individuals formerly outside their social circle In addition upon request credit identities could be shared with external entities (such as traditional banks) to show proof of credit history Identity is a critical component that enables Lending Circles to scale and become larger savings groups thus enabling improved credit supply/demand matching and better interest rates for the marketplace WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s third product\xe2\x80\x8b is a Trust Network Powered Lending and Borrowing platform that connects borrowers and savers and allows for direct loans with minimal fees This product is different from existing market solutions due to our ability to leverage the credit identities created previously the concept of trust inference (social graph) legal contracts and deterrents and loan guarantees where trusted members vouch and earn fees for taking on reputation risk and partial responsibility for others\xe2\x80\x99 loans While this concept is in the early stages of development prior WeTrust products form the foundation that enables a more insightful way to quantify risk and create proper checks/ balances that deter against potential fraud so that lending and borrowing can extend beyond one\xe2\x80\x99s immediate social circle in a safe and efficient manner WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s fourth product \xe2\x80\x8bis a Mutual Insurance platform which involves smart contracts that evaluate whether or not a set of non subjective criteria was met (i e a drought or low rainfall) and pay out accordingly As all criteria for payouts would be public and governed by smart contracts the process will require minimal fees However there are many forms of insurance that do require detailed auditing and reviews For these WeTrust plans to create a mechanism \x0cthat enables a decentralized process flow which incentivizes both policyholders and auditors to arrive at fair outcomes and payouts with significantly reduced friction Although the insurance platform benefits from the existence of large Trusted Lending Circles participation in those groups will not be required for individuals to join a mutual insurance pool WeTrust People Ecosystem \xe2\x80\x8b(added after Daniel Z review) There are four essential parties in the WeTrust ecosystem General Users Sponsors and Forepersons We want to ensure Trustcoins is used properly to incentivise these actors to behave in a way that fosters growth and integrity on the system These roles are not mutually exclusive and one can wear any or all of these hats \xe2\x97\x8f General Users use any of our services such as ROSCAs credit scoring products or insurance services Users are WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s number one focus as they determine the success of the platform They provide feedback on how to improve and help understand how to improve the product They evangelize and help create the network effect to help the platform grow cost efficiently \xe2\x97\x8f Sponsors support the overall development of the platform by participating in the initial crowdsale bug bounties and provide feedback on how the product can be improved \xe2\x97\x8f Forepersons The organizer evangelist advocate and product expert on the ground working with users of the WeTrust Platform We depend on the Foreperson to educate recruit enforce and coordinate groups In the ROSCA context forepersons are allowed to set their fee rate for the ROSCAs they organize App Token In the spirit of crowdfunding Trustcoin (TRST) tokens are the currency for services performed by WeTrust as well as other service providers in the WeTrust ecosystem The coin is a reward to any actor that \xe2\x80\x8bfacilitates trust and is paid by any actor that \xe2\x80\x8buses the Trust Network Market forces and Supply and Demand will dictate the amount of \xe2\x80\x9cTrustcoin\xe2\x80\x9d per transaction \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bWeTrust plans to generate fees in TRST from products such as Trusted Lending Circles Trusted Direct Lending and Mutual Insurance in order to support development costs App Token usage within Trusted Lending Circles In the case of our first product Trusted Lending Circle while the lending circle itself may be managed in any currency the group chooses (e g ETH BTC stablecoins Trustcoin etc ) the services rendered by the foreperson are paid for using TRST tokens While creating a Trusted Lending Circle the foreperson defines the fee in [% of total pot] that \x0cthey want to charge and they get remunerated in TRST Here is how it\xe2\x80\x99s done Consider the following example a 5 participant $100 contribution per person Trusted Lending Circle a 2% fee (defined by the foreperson) + 0 3% platform fees4 would come down to 5 * $100 * 2 3% = $11 5 per round The platform fees are to support WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s operations and future product development At the end of every round when fees are secured from the contributions TRST coins will be automatically bought in the exchanges and be held in escrow by the Trusted Lending Circle contract When the epoch ends the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s fees as well as WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s are released to them in TRST Note that while participants will be able to use the cryptocoin of their choice to run Trusted Lending Circles WeTrust will charge a significantly lower fee for Circles that use TRST as the unit of value due to the operations being more streamlined Future products such as credit scores mutual insurance and direct lending will also involve fees that are represented in TRST TRST as collateral in the absence of reputation In a Trusted Lending Circle the foreperson receives their full fees only if there were no delinquencies When some participants are delinquent the foreperson gets penalized by reducing the fees that they earn To increase the the participants\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s abilities to gather a group of trusted associates the foreperson may put down a collateral in TRST that will be distributed to good standing participants in case of delinquencies As WeTrust builds additional products that involve other roles in the network they may also be incentivized to put down collateral in order to perform services (e g insurance claims agent) Trusted Lending Circle fee schedule The preliminary Trusted Lending Circle Fee schedule for Forepersons and WeTrust is as follows \xe2\x97\x8f Forepersons set a fee quoted in Trustcoin (equivalent to 0 5% of distributions) \xe2\x97\x8b In every round fees are deducted for contributions already secure (adjusting for delinquencies) converted to TRST (by buying from the market) and reserved for foreperson This further incentivizes the foreperson to collect all contributions \xe2\x97\x8b At end of an Epoch (i e after everyone wins a round) the contract releases the TRST reserved to the foreperson \xe2\x97\x8b To further increase the the participants\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in the foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s abilities (e g in the case they don\xe2\x80\x99t know her well beforehand) the foreperson may \xe2\x80\x8bNote that in the future WeTrust may offer forepersons the ability to select an alternative fee structure where only those who receive interest payments in excess of their deposits are charged a fee on the interests received 4 \x0cchoose to put down a collateral in TRST that will be distributed to good standing participants in case of delinquencies \xe2\x97\x8f WeTrust plans to charge 0% fees for small Trusted Lending Circle groups of 5 people or less \xe2\x97\x8b For groups larger than 5 people a tier based fee schedule will be used Initial fees start at 0 3% for running operations and future product development 5 The 0 3% fee will be reduced for a given foreperson\xe2\x80\x99s Trusted Lending Circles as cumulative transaction volumes increase on the Trusted Lending Circles they manage \xe2\x97\x8b WeTrust is also exploring other fee structures that forepersons can select such as charging fees on the amount of distribution that is in excess of contributions Scaling up Trusted Lending Circles Trusted Lending Circles are built on trust and familiarity A mechanism to scale up an existing Trusted Lending Circle while maintaining trust between its participants is suggested in this scenario Suppose a group of people run successful Trusted Lending Circles multiple times and have trust in one another Another person they know less and thus trust less wants to join and benefit from this existing group WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s product will allow the new participant to join in a \xe2\x80\x9csaver only\xe2\x80\x9d mode where they will be able to collect their funds only in the last round (with any additional interest received during the running of the Trusted Lending Circle) In this case the group gets a guarantee that the newcomer will pay on time whereas the newcomer relies on the group past reputation of paying on time Trustcoins allocation Prior to reaching a steady state where platform resources can be supported through fees a token sale may be utilized to acquire necessary funds to build out the platform Subsequently the WeTrust team expects to utilize funds in the following areas 5 \xe2\x97\x8f Research \xe2\x80\x8b This includes research in mathematics game theory statistical and actuarial models and computational simulations that will ensure that the proper incentives are in line for all parties \xe2\x97\x8f Software Development \xe2\x80\x8b This includes budgets for software development smart contract development security reviews and developing a seamless user experience \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bThis number was determined according to current models WeTrust may change this later depending on market conditions \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Business Development\xe2\x80\x8b This includes expenses for building partnerships with NGOs forming and growing Trusted Lending Circle communities and hiring community managers to help evangelize around the world \xe2\x97\x8f Marketing\xe2\x80\x8b This includes all expenses related to Educating the public about our platform travel and admission expenses to blockchain conventions sponsoring blockchain events / conferences / hackathons driving users to our platform developing the WeTrust brand and relaying our message to Trusted Lending Circle users \xe2\x97\x8f External Costs \xe2\x80\x8b This includes the token sale structure security audits tax/ legal advisory regulatory compliance bug bounties and other fixed costs (office spaces telecommuting equipment) associated with technology and development 100 Million Trustcoins (TRST) will be issued once the crowdsale is concluded Of the 100 Million Trustcoins \xe2\x97\x8f 80 Million Trustcoins will be sold to the token sale participants \xe2\x97\x8f 10 Million Trustcoins will be reserved for the WeTrust team (vesting over 2 years) \xe2\x97\x8f 8 Million Trustcoins will be used to future expenses marketing additional team members \xe2\x97\x8f 2 Million Trustcoins will be used for token sale bounties WeTrust Challenges and Solutions WeTrust offers a novel and innovative product and faces diverse challenges WeTrust platform\xe2\x80\x99s first product is a Trusted Lending Circle on the blockchain and this will help bootstrap the community and social graph Next WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s credit scoring algorithm will allow basic Trusted Lending Circles to scale and grow/merge with Trusted Lending Circles that have common connections/trust circles As such a large and growing user base is the foundation for future WeTrust products such as lending and mutual insurance \xe2\x80\x8bKey challenges to growth include accessibility usability and cryptocurrency volatility anti fraud measures and defensibility of the platform Addressing accessibility and cryptocurrency volatility through Stablecoins The MVP version of Trusted Lending Circles currently supports usage of Ether and is built on Ethereum as it is currently the most mature blockchain to implement smart contracts Trustcoin and additional tokens such as stablecoin will be supported in the future as well Stablecoins are crypto tokens whose value is tied to a fiat currency which we believe is required to gain mass adoption In addition users do not want to deal with cryptocurrency \x0cvolatility Several stablecoins are under development or are in active usage including MakerDAI\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bString Labs Phi\xe2\x80\x8b and T \xe2\x80\x8b ether\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bColu and \xe2\x80\x8bWaves also are working on projects that enable the support of digital tokens that are linked to fiat value WeTrust will integrate stablecoins into its platform as it is critical for large scale adoption and is an important step in abstracting blockchain/ cryptocurrency from customers\xe2\x80\x8b Addressing fraud through incentives and legal measures A critical foundation of security and well designed incentives are required in any financial ecosystem that intends to deter bad actors Governance tools such as legal contracts collateral risk loan guarantees mediation and more will be available for each organization to utilize as they see fit See more information here\xe2\x80\x8b Addressing defensibility through open and close source strategy WeTrust operates in an open source and decentralized economy where much of the technology stack is public and auditable by the community In this spirit advantages developed within businesses and technology will be openly shared with the community However in order to ensure sustainability in our ability to continue dedicating resources to improving the platform we will open source the smart contract to keep WeTrust products transparent and secure and close source the frontend to create a barrier to simply forking the project Product Road Map/ Budget The BTC and ETH raised during crowdfunding will be used by Finclusion Labs to build out the WeTrust Platform products Trusted Lending Circles Credit Identity and Reputation Trusted Direct Lending and Mutual Insurance The amount of financing received would vary significantly between the minimum and the maximum financing (cap) The roadmap is a full vision to be completed if the cap is reached WeTrust should be considered an R&D project involving bleeding edge technologies Although the progress we have already made while developing the Trusted Lending Circle MVP proves the validity of utilizing blockchain to create decentralized and scalable digitized financial entities there is significant work ahead The WeTrust team is fully committed but the roadmap and pace of development is also dependant upon the level of success achieved from the crowdfunding \x0cIn the minimum financing scenario basic versions of Trusted Lending Circles Credit Identity and Direct Lending/ Borrowing will be created The ultimate deliverable is enabling users to create and find \xe2\x80\x98circles of trust\xe2\x80\x99 that can be relied upon as a fair marketplace for access to credit The maximum financing scenario enables delivery of a much more advanced version of the above products and also enables creation of more sophisticated payout terms that resemble insurance Close integrations with ongoing blockchain efforts and investment into global partnerships will also enable maximum distribution of the services we create This then enables a virtuous cycle where the fees generated on the platform will be expected to support the efforts made by Finclusion Labs as well as our ability to make grants to organizations that have a similar vision Finally if the funding cap is reached in the crowdfunding the WeTrust team will also be able to create specific integrations useful to the entire community WeTrust Roadmap is the following however the timing will depend on the amount of funds that are raised in the crowdsale The Roadmap below assumes a

savvy yet also know of the traditions back home and most of their parents have participated in these lending circles before Concurrently we will also be incorporating the use of other tokens (various stablecoins under development) to alleviate concerns regarding volatility After refining our product after collaborating with NGOs in the US we plan to expand globally and work with their overseas branches in India Africa etc\xe2\x80\xa6 Partnering with NGOs such as Gates Foundation will provide credibility to our product due to brand equity of NGOs who have built a strong presence in our target communities Michael Casey (advisor at MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Digital Currency Initiative) is on our team and has strong ties to NGOS specifically Financial Inclusion organizations globally and we will collaborate with his organization to accelerate development Blockchain Benefits Why choose the blockchain as infrastructure A blockchain based financial social platform reduces the friction (high fees low liquidity accounting records potential fraud from organizers) and automates an existing concept already \x0cproven in communities worldwide We foresee that blockchain technology will impact the financial sectors in the following core areas 1 Efficiency and Automation\xe2\x80\x8b Smart contract technology enables end to end automation of payments efficient risk model estimation and decentralized claims processing This substantially lowers operating costs 2 Greater Access for the Underbanked/Underserved A more connected world will enable those in developing markets low income businesses and new product verticals to leapfrog into cutting edge technology For example in Kenya M PESA[12] has created a simple banking system on feature phones completely bypassing the need for brick and mortar bank branches 3 All Inclusive Digital Identity Digital identities on Blockchains create opportunities for individuals to transact across international borders without the hassles of conflicting governance 4 Transparency \xe2\x80\x8bOn most blockchains transparency is a platform level feature All data in a smart contract based system is publicly auditable and can be freely analyzed by third parties while preserving privacy as required 5 Experimentation \xe2\x80\x8bWith open source code permission less usage wide array of customization options and ease of accounting groups of trusted associates can experiment and create unique structures/rules according to their circumstances Groups with a common cause ranging from university alumni groups volunteer groups veterans associations social activists political groups religious groups etc\xe2\x80\xa6 can use a simple app to leverage and engage their respective communities with tangible financial impact Rotating Savings and Credit projects outside of the blockchain Several companies have tried to create tools and software similar to a Trusted Lending Circle including eMoneyPool Puddle Monk and Savemates However these solutions integrate with the traditional banking system and require the use of bank accounts which are typically only usable within a single jurisdiction Some other drawbacks include \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Most current participants of Trusted Lending Circles do not have access to banking services which are a prerequisite to these tools and software Existing software providers prevent savers from earning a return on their deposit This shortcoming takes away from the spirit of the Rotating Savings and Credit group which thrives on the supply/demand dynamic that benefits both savers and borrowers Smaller markets and jurisdictions suffer from lack of attention and do not benefit from \x0cthese apps that are being developed By building a decentralized application on the blockchain we are able to eliminate costs associated with transfers to/from bank accounts and can reach populations who do not have access to bank accounts The application can be used in any jurisdiction and Trusted Lending Circles can be formed among trusted associates across borders This enables the creation of a more accurate social graph and trust inference data that can be used for a safer and rewarding experience for users Lastly unlike existing solutions the WeTrust dApp is decentralized funds are controlled by the users and each Trusted Lending Circle can determine their own rules for distribution maximum interest rates and policies according to their local needs and traditions Potential Market Size To estimate the potential market size for a financial social platform one needs to take into account the different community based financial infrastructure in play globally today and future demands that might arise due to the emergence of WeTrust as an alternative financial solution The global ROSCA \xe2\x80\x8band informal banking industry is responsible for money flows over 10% of GDP in many countries despite significant handling/transaction costs An estimated >$500B flow through Trusted Lending Circle type groups each year \xe2\x80\x8bas detailed below\xe2\x80\x8b In addition social capital powered Trusted Lending Circles have potential compete in consumer loans where the US market represents over $3 2 Trillion in outstanding consumer credit[13] Globally the P2P Lending market is growing rapidly and has a market size of over $70B/ year (also d \xe2\x80\x8b etailed below\xe2\x80\x8b) Finally WeTrust plans to deliver insurance services built on the Trusted Lending Circles which can be seen as the foundation for a mutual insurance framework The insurance industry[14] generated over $1 1 Trillion in premiums in the United States in 2015 \x0cFigure 2 A conservative estimate of the ROSCA Trusted Lending Circles and P2P lending markets size globally India \xe2\x80\x8bFormal banking institutions reach only ~15% of the population and over $200 B is distributed via regulated and unregulated ROSCAs known as Chit Funds where over 15 000 are registered entities with a significantly larger unregulated Chit Fund sector[15] Fees range from 5 10% of distribution with thousands employed in the industry[16] and scams costing over $10B in recent years[17] P2P lending is still in its infancy with over 30 companies[18] currently offering competing services China \xe2\x80\x8bA vast amount of lending is conducted via informal networks with tech enabled P2P lending exceeding $60B/ yr[19] and conservative estimates of overall unregulated lending at over $2T/ year with at least 5% going through ROSCA like entities and Lending Circles[20] Latin America \xe2\x80\x8bTrusted Lending Circles are used across Mexico (\xe2\x80\x8bcundinas) Brazil (\xe2\x80\x8bpandeiros) Peru and Argentina Estimates of informal bank lending volumes exceed $150B/ yr[21] USA \xe2\x80\x8bwhile accurate estimates are not available anecdotal evidence shows 50 80% of recent immigrants from Latin America[22] Asian and West Indies communities participate in some form \x0cof informal lending and Trusted Lending Circle type arrangements[23] ROSCAs and Trusted Lending Circles have transaction volume exceeding $30 B/ yr and online P2P lending exceeds ~$10 B / yr[24] According to the 2015 \xe2\x80\x8bFDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households [25] 7 0% of households in the United States were unbanked in 2015 This proportion represents approximately 9 0 million households An additional 19 9% of U S households (24 5 million) were underbanked meaning that the household had a checking or savings account but also obtained financial products and services outside of the banking system In general there is increasing interest in alternative financial companies in the United States as evidenced by Lemonade Insurance company in New York City (\xe2\x80\x8blemonade com\xe2\x80\x8b) a P2P insurance company that recently raised $13m in Aug 2016 and an additional $34m in Dec 2016[26] Technical Aspects WeTrust is characterized by three key operational pillars \xe2\x80\x8bautonomous frictionless and decentralized Autonomous\xe2\x80\x8b Smart contracts run the business logic autonomously and we will utilize these features for fast secure and reliable processing of the detailed product processes This will reduce the friction currently observed due to the numerous fees and operation costs imposed by middlemen such as financial institutions Unlike existing centralized platforms and services WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s transactions are publicly verifiable viewable self operated and not subject to the risk of mishandling by organizers Our system is a finite state machine Each transaction (i e create a fund contribute bid and disburse ) will transform the system to a defined and predictable state Our smart contract functions do not produce non deterministic behaviors Frictionless\xe2\x80\x8b Traditional Trusted Lending Circle processes have been cumbersome and manual resulting in high fees and occasional fraud in the Lending Circle industry The WeTrust platform focuses on delivering good and friendly experiences to our end users and developers We design and build an abstraction layer on top of the underlying blockchain so that developers and customers do not even know they are running on decentralized servers and blockchain technology Furthermore we introduce SDK\ s in different programming languages to help users integrate with our platform create and manage funds easily Here is an example of how one could create a Trusted Lending Circle fund in JavaScript \x0cvar\xe2\x80\x8b

further described in the diagram below Figure 3 Trusted Lending Circle (TLC) dApp Architecture \xe2\x80\x8b ser \xe2\x80\x8b A smart contract that stores the user\xe2\x80\x99s information and history of Trusted Lending Circle the user participates U in These records will help determine the credit score of the user and/or match him/her with available public Trusted Lending Circle funds \xe2\x80\x8bProxy Controller \xe2\x80\x8b A smart contract to manage users of the Trusted Lending Circle platform and their interactions with the Funds This contract mostly contains authentication and authorization logic as well as permissions management \xe2\x80\x8bTLC Fund \xe2\x80\x8b A smart contract that store all the states of a Trusted Lending Circle fund (e g Foreperson members term conditions status contributions) and contain business logic to operate the fund (e g manage the contribution bidding and disbursement) Security Since users\xe2\x80\x99 hard earned money is at stake security is treated with the highest priority at WeTrust In order to ensure that underlying smart contracts that move funds are secure and working as intended the WeTrust team commits to subjecting its platform to a comprehensive security audit and bounty programs prior to launching the platform to the public We will hire the \x0cmost reputable security experts to conduct security audits prior to our public launch release all results of the audit and fix any flaws that are identified In addition WeTrust will build a dedicated server to monitor all transactions on our platform anonymously This server will detect and address suspect behaviors and fraudulent activities Alert notifications will be automatically set up and will alert developers around the world to fix any known incidents Sybil Attack Prevention Because WeTrust is a community based platform that relies on its users\ performance in products such as Trusted Lending Circles and P2P lending to generate credit scores it is important for us to preserve the integrity of the scores by thwarting Sybil Attacks from automatically created fraudulent accounts It would be detrimental to our platform if one person created fake profiles and Trusted Lending Circles to generate a legitimate credit score WeTrust offers some potential solutions 1 Require users to provide identity information from off blockchain sources such as Facebook Twitter or Cell Phone (activated through two factor authentication) 2 For each account we will allow a limited number of \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d Trusted Lending Circle funds Any additional Trusted Lending Circles will require a small fee Further Trusted Lending Circles will be required to be of a minimum size This would require individuals with malicious intent to actually contribute into a fund and pay the service fees The first dApp Trusted Lending Circle (aka ROSCA) The WeTrust Trusted Lending Circle is powered by smart contracts and blockchain technology This savings and credit platform allows users to lend and borrow from each other at self determined interest rates with minimal friction The immediate purposes that the WeTrust Trusted Lending Circle will serve \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f As an affordable path for the two billion \xe2\x80\x9cunbanked\xe2\x80\x9d to obtain and track savings & credit Create a competitive alternative asset class for savers Facilitate group savings as a more effective way to reach individual saving goals[27] This product will serve multiple audiences The main audiences are a) the unbanked who need access to credit and b) those who do have access to formal financial institutions but desire alternative solutions to saving and credit \x0cWhy start with Trusted Lending Circle as WeTrust\xe2\x80\x99s first dApp Marketplaces can succeed if there is a balance between supply and demand and critical mass is required from day one if users are to find usefulness in the WeTrust Platform This begs the inevitable \xe2\x80\x9cchicken and egg problem\xe2\x80\x9d in which a strong network is essential before users join and vice versa To overcome this problem we believe a Trusted Lending Circle product is the ideal vanguard dApp as it facilitates network effects and leverages existing networks/ behavior norms Product design high level summary When users first visit the Trusted Lending Circle (ROSCA) dApp they would be prompted to create an account After this they can create a ROSCA in which they are the foreperson and invite participants (e g via whatsapp email) or join a ROSCA they were invited to Invitees are also required to create an account before they can join a ROSCA and become active participants It should be noted that both parties (forepersons and participants) must access the dApp using a compatible browser which is connected to funded Ethereum accounts Once a ROSCA has been created and participants have joined the foreperson can deploy the ROSCA smart contract onto the blockchain This action solidifies the details of the ROSCA and no further edits can be made after this point Once the smart contract has been deployed the foreperson can begin the ROSCA on or after the predefined start date Both participants and foreperson participate in the ROSCA by submitting transactions to the contract These transactions take the form of starting the round (foreperson only) contributions bids and withdrawals Each transaction must originate from the address with which the user joined or created the ROSCA ROSCA participants are able to see a complete list of these transactions up to and after the end of the Trusted Lending Circle ROSCA epoch Deposits and Withdrawals Users will deposit from their own wallet to the unique address of the ROSCA smart contract during each round Any withdrawals are initiated with a transaction and sent to the address which originated said transaction Trusted Lending Circle ROSCA dApp walkthrough The following is a walkthrough of the Trusted Lending Circle ROSCA MVP as of whitepaper publication date and will be updated in the future This represents a proof of concept and the UI/ UX will undergo continuous improvement based on community feedback and input \x0cThe current Trusted Lending Circle product will be accessible through the web Upon visiting the site users will be presented with an explanation about what a Trusted Lending Circle is and how the blockchain brings advantages to traditional Trusted Lending Circles Once logged in users are presented with their dashboard which consists of three

Trusted Lending Circle allows the foreperson to specify the terms of the Trusted Lending Circle detailed as follows 1 ROSCA \xe2\x80\x8bName This is a name given to identify the Trusted Lending Circle for ease of use 2 Number of Participants The number of other participants that the foreperson is going to invite After entering this number fields appear where the user can enter the email addresses of the other participants \x0c3 Payment Frequency The frequency of the payments made by all participants In the future we plan to open this up to be more flexible Each round lasts for the amount of time specified here (e g a weekly payment frequency would result in week long rounds) 4 Payment Amount The amount in Ether which all participants must contribute each round The MVP supports only Ether WeTrust is planning to enable use of other tokens in the future 5 Start Date The date on and after which the ROSCA can be started It should be noted the ROSCA must be deployed at least three full days before this date to protect against blockchain timestamp discrepancies Figure 5 Trusted Lending Circle Creation Form After clicking \xe2\x80\x98Create\xe2\x80\x99 the user is prompted to select one of

Rotating Credit and Savings Association (ROSCA) Also known as a Trusted Lending Circle a ROSCA is a group of individuals who act as an alternative financing institution through regular contributions and withdrawals from a common fund The name Rotating Credit and Savings Association comes from the type of transactions that occur in these associations in which members contribute on a regular basis (e g once a month) and are allowed a chance at the pot each contribution period Epoch \xe2\x80\x8bA full cycle of contributions where the Epoch timeframe is equal to \xe2\x97\x8b [# of participants ]* [regular contribution interval] For example if there are 6 members and the contribution is weekly then one Epoch is equal to 6 weeks Typically a member wins the pot once in each Epoch Foreperson\xe2\x80\x8b The Foreperson is the individual who initiates the \xe2\x80\x98ROSCA Fund\xe2\x80\x99 It is this person who will input the fund\xe2\x80\x99s specifications input contact information and be responsible for educating participants about the process and eventually make sure the contributions are made Foreperson Fee\xe2\x80\x8b This is the agreed upon rate that the group wants to pay the Foreperson for organizing the group Platform Fee \xe2\x80\x8bThis is the fee that will be collected by the platform to cover operational costs and development costs with excess fees going to grants scholarships and other non profit pursuits Appendix ROSCAs Around the World Trusted Lending Circles ROSCAs have existed for many years now In Japan the earliest records of ROSCA with contributions in money date back as far as 1275[28] in Korea they may even go back to the 9th century[29] ROSCAs are currently popular in regions where there are a lack of sophisticated investment options and where there is difficulty in accessing loans through formal institutions typically because credit scores either do not exist or do not play a meaningful role in an individual\xe2\x80\x99s financial health In India and China for example it is common for alumni from a common university colleagues from the same company or simply friends from the same city to create informal ROSCAs as a way to save and invest Research indicates that informal ROSCAs have similar or lower default rates for loans when compared to formal institutions and offer competitive returns on investment for savers ROSCAs are increasingly also being used to \x0caddress the continuing phenomenon of low interest rates and uncertain strength of centralized institutions Trusted Lending Circles exist in various incarnations around the world Here are some examples \xe2\x97\x8f As \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bChit Funds\xe2\x80\x9d In \xe2\x80\x8bIndia\xe2\x80\x8b each State has a regulatory agency for \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bChit Funds\xe2\x80\x9d that are responsible for setting rules such as maximum fees capital reserve requirements fund registration insurance/ bonded requirements etc K \xe2\x80\x8b erala State Financial Enterprise is a government owned ROSCA fund of Kerala State and is one of the largest funds in India They employ over 6 000 employees and in fiscal 2015 have substantial operational costs Currently financial enterprises in India are large and sophisticated however WeTrust believes our technology can reduce costs yet still preserve transparency compliance with regulators and safety \xe2\x80\x8b[5 10] \xe2\x97\x8f As \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bTanda\xe2\x80\x9d In Latin America and \xe2\x80\x8bUnited States\xe2\x80\x8b particularly amongst the migrant worker community from Latin America workers are employing this group saving concept to help save for their retirement According to Jeffrey Cheung President and CEO of OneCalifornia Bank \xe2\x80\x9c[\xe2\x80\x8bTandas] really does hit on the fundamental of lending Is the person you are lending money to someone you can trust Someone who is honorable someone who you think will pay you back [30] [\xe2\x80\x8bTandas] are a worldwide phenomenon for poor people whose access to capital is limited [\xe2\x80\x8bIt] easiest way to do it is to pool your resources said C \xe2\x80\x8b arlos V\xc3\xa9lez Ib\xc3\xa1\xc3\xb1ez\xe2\x80\x8b Anthropologist at Arizona State University[31] \xe2\x97\x8f As \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bHui\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8bShadow Banks\xe2\x80\x9d Earliest mention of Hui is found in the Han Dynasty[1] Since the Tang Dynasty in \xe2\x80\x8bChina during the spread of Buddhism the Chit fund tradition also spread from India Currently there is a booming \xe2\x80\x9cshadow banking\xe2\x80\x9d sector in which over $14 5 trillion yuan ($2 2 trillion dollars) are managed informally This equates to roughly a quarter of all total loans originating in China and is worrying regulators because these loans are often highly leveraged and borrowers are typically less credit worthy Again similar to the case in India China is another huge market that will benefit from the transparency auditability and safety the Blockchain can provide[32 33] Risk Disclosure for Trustcoin crowdsale Last Updated Feb 22 2017 WeTrust RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH Trustcoin AND THE WeTrust NETWORK This document does not constitute an offer or solicitation to sell shares or securities in Finclusion Labs Inc or any related or associated company Any such offer or solicitation would be made only by means of a confidential offering memorandum which this is not and in accordance with the terms of all applicable securities \x0cand other laws None of the information or analyses presented are intended to form the basis for any investment decision and no specific recommendations are intended Accordingly this document does not constitute investment advice or counsel or solicitation for investment in any security This document does not constitute or form part of and should not be construed as any offer for sale or subscription of or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for any securities Finclusion Labs Inc expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from (i) reliance on any information contained in this document (ii) any error omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information WeTrust Token ( Trustcoin ) is a cryptographic token used by the WeTrust network operated by Finclusion Labs Inc (the Company ) Trustcoin IS NOT A SECURITY AND THIS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL A SECURITY Trustcoin IS NOT AN INVESTMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED AS AN INVESTMENT If you purchase Trustcoin you certify that you are doing so out of a desire to use or consume Trustcoin on the WeTrust network to participate in the WeTrust community or to attempt to personally generate any consideration by using Trustcoin on the network or in the community You certify that you are not purchasing Trustcoin for any speculative investment or other financial reasons Trustcoin is not a cryptocurrency of value At the time of this writing Trustcoin (i) cannot be exchanged for goods or services (ii) has no known uses outside the WeTrust network and (iii) cannot be traded on any known exchanges There is no guarantee \xe2\x80\x93 indeed there is no reason to believe \xe2\x80\x93 that the Trustcoin you purchase will increase in value Trustcoin MAY \xe2\x80\x93 AND LIKELY WILL \xe2\x80\x93 DECREASE IN VALUE Trustcoin is not evidence of ownership in or right to control the Company or the WeTrust network Holding or using Trustcoin does not grant you ownership or equity in the Company or the WeTrust network Trustcoin does not grant any right to participate in the control direction or decision making of the Company or the WeTrust network 1) Risk of Losing Access to Trustcoin Due to Loss of Credentials The purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s Trustcoin may be associated with a WeTrust account until it is distributed to the purchaser The WeTrust account can only be accessed with login credentials selected by the purchaser The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of Trustcoin Loss of credentials associated with any third party and or digital wallet containing and or controlling Trustcoin will result in loss of Trustcoin Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one or more backup locations geographically separated from the working location 2) Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol Trustcoin and the WeTrust network are based on the Ethereum protocol As such any malfunction unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause \x0cthe WeTrust network or Trustcoin to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner Ether the native unit of account of the Ethereum Protocol may itself lose value which could have a negative impact on the functioning of the WeTrust network More information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http //www ethereum org 3) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials Any third party that gains access to the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of or misappropriate the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s Trustcoin To minimize this risk the purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices 4) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world The functioning of the WeTrust network and Trustcoin could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like Trustcoin which could impede or limit the development of the WeTrust network ROSCAs and facilitating Trusted Lending Circles is a core business of the Company have been and will likely continue to be the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world The legal ability for the Company to operate the WeTrust network in some or all jurisdictions could be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions In the event that it is not legal for the WeTrust network to operate in a jurisdiction the Company will cease operations in that jurisdiction There is a serious risk that the Company will be unable to operate if regulation makes it difficult to do so 5) Risk of Alternative Unofficial WeTrust Networks Following the presale and the development of the initial version of the Trustcoin platform and WeTrust network it is possible that alternative networks could be established which utilize the same open source code and open source protocol underlying the WeTrust network The official WeTrust network may compete with these alternative unofficial Trustcoin based networks which could potentially negatively impact the WeTrust network and Trustcoin 6) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the WeTrust Network or Distributed Applications It is possible that the WeTrust network will not be used by a large number of businesses individuals and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the WeTrust network and therefore the potential uses or utility of Trustcoin 7) Risk that the WeTrust Network As Developed Will Not Meet the Expectations of the Purchaser The WeTrust network is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release Any expectations regarding the form and functionality of Trustcoin or the WeTrust network held by the purchaser may not be met upon release for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the \x0cWeTrust network 8) Risk of Theft and Hacking Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the WeTrust network or the availability of Trustcoin in any number of ways including but not limited to denial of service attacks Sybil attacks spoofing smurfing malware attacks or consensus based attacks 9) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Trustcoin network Core Infrastructure Software The WeTrust network consists of open source software that is itself based on open source software There is a risk that the Company team or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the WeTrust network interfering with the use of or causing the loss of Trustcoin 10) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography Advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers could present risks to cryptographic tokens and the WeTrust platform which could result in the theft or loss of Trustcoin 11) Risk of Trustcoin Mining Attacks As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens the blockchain used for the WeTrust network is susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks selfish mining attacks and race condition attacks Any successful attacks present a risk to the WeTrust network including but not limited to expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations and the WeTrust network Despite the efforts of the Company the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists 12) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the WeTrust Network While Trustcoin should not be viewed as an investment it may potentially (but likely will not) have utility value over time That value may be limited or nonexistent if the WeTrust network lacks use and adoption 13) Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ethereum Ether ( ETH ) and Other Currency Value The Company team intends to use the proceeds of the Trustcoin presale to fund development of the WeTrust network The proceeds of the Trustcoin presale will be denominated in BTC and ETH and converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies If the value of BTC ETH or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the presale the Company team may not be able to fund development or may not be able to develop the Trustcoin network in the manner that it intended or promised 14) Risk of an Illiquid Market for Trustcoin There are currently no exchanges upon which Trustcoin might be resold and such exchanges may never exist If ever exchanges do develop they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight They may therefore be more exposed to fraud and \x0cfailure than established regulated exchanges for other products 15) Risk of Uninsured Losses Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions Trustcoins associated with a WeTrust account are uninsured In the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or private insurer to offer recourse to the purchaser 16) Risk of Dissolution of the WeTrust Project It is possible that due to any number of reasons including without limitation an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies) decrease in the utility value of Trustcoin the failure of business relationships or competing intellectual property claims the WeTrust network may no longer be a viable business and the Company may dissolve or the WeTrust network may fail to launch 17) Risk of Malfunction in the WeTrust Network It is possible that the WeTrust network malfunctions in an unfavorable way including but not limited to one that results in the loss of Trustcoin confidential information or personal data 18) Unanticipated Risks Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology In addition to the risks included in this Risk Disclosure there are other risks including those that the Company cannot anticipate Risks may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks References [1] Simon W K \xe2\x80\x9cCivil Society in China The Legal Framework from Ancient
