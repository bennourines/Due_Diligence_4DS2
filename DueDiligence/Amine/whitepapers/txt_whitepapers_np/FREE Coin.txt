2017 was the year of the public breakthrough of cryptocurrencies We saw An explosive increase of prices of the different cryptocurrencies An abundance of cryptocurrency projects being launched As a result cryptocurrency became a hot news item and even governments and central banks started studying cryptocurrency as a disruptive transformation of the worldwide financial system By the end of 2017 more than 2500 different cryptocurrencies were officially listed at the different Exchanges and many more were being traded without official listing (EG via address trading on decentralized exchanges) However the number of persons that participate actively in the cryptocurrency trade was still very limited less than 1 percent of the world population was actively investing in cryptocurrency As from 2018 \xe2\x80\x93 Mass acceptance starts Different studies indicate that as from 2018 there will be a start of the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies This acceptance of cryptocurrencies will vary in function of Age Bloomberg studies estimates that soon up to 33% of the Millennials will use cryptocurrencies Location Cryptocurrency usage is currently concentrated in specific geographical areas other areas are underrepresented Income the popular cryptocurrencies have reached high price levels bringing them out of reach of the persons that are in a financial weak position Education currently the trading of cryptocurrencies at exchanges seems complex and this is an obstruction for some people to start using crypto Technology Access About 60 % of the world population has access to a PC or Smartphone and can thus invest in cryptocurrencies As from 2018 we will see a massive inflow of capital to invest in cryptocurrencies The number of persons that invest in cryptocurrency will be multiplied by 10 Especially Millennials \xe2\x80\x93 with less trust in banks and economic stability \xe2\x80\x93 will look at alternative ways to invest to safeguard their financial future even after

Central Banks and Governments start studying the possibility to create their own cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\xa6 The challenge for the FREE project The demand for cryptocurrency will explode billion(s) of persons will want to invest in cryptocurrencies A d the a ks a d o pa ies ill also a t to i est \xe2\x80\xa6 However the current cryptocurrencies are not suited for mass adoption Look at Bitcoin

and support to people worldwide to adopt cryptocurrency at the most easy and lost low cost way We decided to deliver this solution using the Ethereum Blockchain Wallets and Exchanges are widely available Proven technology that is sufficient fast and reliable to be used for storage and exchange of value Mining is guaranteed also in the future due to the many altcoins that run on top of Ethereum www FREEcoin technology FREEcoin@outlook be page 6 \x0cWHITEPAPER The FREE project The FREE coin 24/11/2018 Make cryptocurrency inclusive Currently the crypto market is reserved for the wealthy that have enough knowledge to know how to use wallets and exchanges The majority of the people is excluded because crypto is too expensive for them or because it looks too complicated to work with Exchanges and Wallets or because there is no active community in their language to help them in their first steps To make sure that as much people as possible get access to the cryptocurrency market (and wealth that is being generated on these markets) the FREE project will Launch a coin at extreme low price The FREE coin will be distributed during the first 3 months o 50 % via exchanges at the price of only 0 0000000001 Ether (about 0 00000006 dollar in April 2018) o 50 % free of cost via targeted donations giveways and airdrops Launch a coin which has sufficient supply to survive the mass adoption without an immediate price explosion P o ote the i itiati e ia B a d A assado s a d so ial edia o ld ide Simplify the purchase of cryptocurrency to the maximum (EG for starters who are still confused about how Exchanges work offer the possibility to buy the FREE coin via a classical webshop and pay via Paypal) Create Global Wealth Cryptocurrencies will become worldwide the standard sto age of alue a d ill epla e u e t methods to store value (fiat money bank accounts pension funds precious metals derivates \xe2\x80\xa6) Because of the laws of Supply and Demand the value of cryptocurrencies will increase fast for some coins the value will really explode Lots of new wealth will be created during this process (and existing wealth will be transferred from the old storage of value items to cryptocurrency) People that will be early adopters of cryptocurrencies will profit from these price increase and will generate a lot of wealth The FREE p oje t a ts to allo e e o e

worldwide to use it 2) Enough coins have to be available so that price is less volatile and can be use for exchange of value We decided to create 10 000 Billion FREE coins Is this not too much No this is only about 1 400 FREE coins per person on earth Fu the o e the e a e toda Billio dolla e ui ale t sto ed i a k a ou ts a d a k otes/ oi s o ld ide A d e e a highe alue is sto ed i de i ates a d p e ious etals So there is only 1 FREE coin for every 8 Dollar equivalent that exists today in banknotes/coins and bank accounts This means that the FREE coin cannot become the only worldwide cryptocurrency but can take a leading position between the few cryptocurrencies that will be adopted worldwide Let\xe2\x80\x99s o pa e the u e of FREE oi also ith the alue of EURO\xe2\x80\x99s i the

Billion people worldwide seems correct The distribution of the FREE coin will be done in 2 phase PHASE 1 distribute 4 000 Billion FREE Coins during 2018 PHASE 2 distribute gradually the remaining 6 000 Billion FREE coins in function of market needs Why will the FREE coin increase in value it is not backed by gold The EURO is not backed by gold the Dollar is since 1971 no longer backed gold so h do the ha e alue Because there is a general TRUST in these currencies When people trust that they can use something to exchange in a trade then this object develops value The Bitcoin developed a high value because the first darknet users agreed it was useful as nontraceble way to transfer value to pay for transactions And once the value of the Bitcoin started to increase other people saw additional usage high return investment hiding value for Taxes transferring value worldwide ultrafast and at low cost 100 % availability and uptime of the support IT i f ast u tu e \xe2\x80\xa6 www

Core Team evolves in function of the project phase skills needed and workload to be done We do not consider ourselves as the long term owner of the FREE coin but simply as the persons that are doing the start up and that will guide the FREE coin to maturity Once ALL coins are distributed the FREE coin will be a self regulation eco system exact as what we see with the Bitcoin Question what happens with the financial earnings that result from the initial sale of the FREE coins by the project team These earnings will be used to pay the listing of the FREE Coins on Exchanges to finance the give away actions (gas usage coin distribution) and to promote the FREE coin initiative Exchanges and Webshop The FREE coin will be distributed via Exchanges and via a webshop The number of exchanges that offer the FREE coin will continue to increase We advise you to check our website www FREEcoin technology to have the latest list available During the first month of the project the FREE coins were
