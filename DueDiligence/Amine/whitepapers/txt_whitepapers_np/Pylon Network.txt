developers\xe2\x80\x99 community What brought us together in the first place and shall keep us bonded is the impact that our actions have on our planet and the impact that decentralised technologies can have on our lifestyle and our evolution We have managed to make some steps towards a more sustainable future and we have made climate change a central perspective point in our decision making However we still see so many antitheses between words visions roadmaps hopes and actions Two years ago Jim Kim the President of the World Bank urged governments to remove global subsidies of USD 1 9 trillion for fossil fuels and redirect funds to fight climate change The same year the IMF calculated that fossil fuel subsidies amount to USD 10 million per minute including the health and environmental degradation costs At the same time subsidies for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are approximately 50 times lower Pylon is a network structured with only one purpose to create the first open renewable energy exchange community which will provide the energy markets with the signals and financial incentives that current energy policies and governance systems are failing or delaying to provide Users of Pylon can exchange green energy bought directly from the RES producer and without need for intervention of intermediaries throughout the process this is achieved through the application of blockchain technology and smart contracts At the same time our PylonCoin which will be used for payment of all green energy transactions is utilized within the financial eco system that we are proposing (the Pylon Network) in order to reward the production of sustainable energy and financially support projects on sustainable technologies The technology to achieve our 100% sustainable development vision is out there and it works Pylon is here to accelerate its implementation The following sections will go through the definition of Renewable Energy Cooperatives with their values and role in local energy policies following this the document goes through the presentation of the pro TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 3 \x0cducts developed by Klenergy and an explanation of how they interact in relation to Pylon furthermore the Pylon Network is introduced with its various types of participants (players) their role and how they interact through the platform along with an explanation of how Pylon Coin can accommodate for the acceleration of RES investments finally the roadmap regarding the pilot project and commercialization implementation plans is presented for different budget scenarios 1 1 Structure of the power sector and decentralization of electricity markets The liberalisation of electricity markets didn\xe2\x80\x99t result in the creation of a truly competitive market since pre liberalisation positions are substantially intact investments in production capacity are capital intensive wholesale electricity markets are typically characterized by a small number of players with their market share protected by high barriers to entry and sunk costs In addition due to inefficient governance and decision making combined with high lobbying efforts the climate change remains a problem of critical importance while the rate of RES implementation meets legislative barriers The solutions proposed in the past to subsidize renewable energy production such as generous feed in tariffs public tenders and mandatory renewable portfolio standards turned out to be ineffective if not counterproductive at all However in the last years technology costs dropped making renewable energy sources truly competitive with traditional fossil fuel based technologies This contrast has led conscientious citizens \xe2\x80\x93 especially in EU \xe2\x80\x93 to respond to this inertia by taking a stand and participating directly in the energy markets under renewable energy cooperatives TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 4 \x0c2 RENE \xc2\xad WA B L E E NE RGY COOP E RAT IVE S AS MA R K E T AGE NT S \xe2\x80\x9cUser owned and controlled business from which benefits are derived and distributed on the basis of use\xe2\x80\x9d Dunn 1988 The Renewable Energy Cooperatives (RECs) represent a business model where citizens jointly own and participate in renewable energy projects In this type of organization both producers and consumers are involved as members RECs represent a response of citizens to the market power exerted by incumbents in the electricity markets They promote participation economic and social development of communities by allowing the participants to engage in the decision making of local energy policies They represent a decentralised business model operating in a concentrated market Their core values can be summarized as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 Voluntary and open membership \xe2\x80\xa2 Democratic member control \xe2\x80\xa2 Education training and information of the members to participate in decisions While responding to the centralised structure of the electricity markets RECs operate in a field in which the stakes are collective production and supply of renewable energy lead to social acceptance of renewable energy production facilities This is achieved through the positive environmental effects the community ownership and the participation to the decision making process In this scenario citizens are more likely to engage in the collective efforts because other actors such as stakeholders of private companies will not monetize these efforts 2 1 The RECs Landscape in Europe During recent years the conscious choice of consumers for green energy as well as the tradition in the European organisation has led many consumers to join energy cooperatives There are 2 397 EU RECs located mainly in Western Europe (Figure 1) There are very few RECs in Central and Eastern Europe due to unfavourable support mechanisms TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 5 \x0cfor renewables The most successful implementations of such cooperatives in Europe can be found in

initiatives and 650 000 participating citizens willing to take action and support the use of renewable energy sources Ever since their start up its members have jointly invested 2 billion euro in renewable energy power plant projects for a total installed capacity of 1GW The combined annual turnover is as high as 950 million euro and they provide sustainable jobs for more than 1 100 European citizens The focus of our efforts starts in Spain due to the proximity to our laboratories and our familiarity with the market and its players There are currently about 20 RECs operating in Spain One of the most representative of these energy cooperatives is GoiENER who is a qualified and certified player in the wholesale Spanish energy market \xe2\x80\x93 and who is supporting the project by being the first adaptors during the pilot demonstration stage through the development of the project (Section 5) 2 2 Pylon Network and Energy Cooperatives a resonance of positive externalities As explained in the previous sections RECs have been identified as the perfect market agent that can benefit from the synergy between TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 6 \x0cblockchain technologies and renewable energy systems The reasons are summarized below \xe2\x80\xa2 Gain legitimacy as market player as of today RECs are not yet perceived as a legitimate market player by other market agents by implementing a blockchain P2P network for the energy trading and distributed governance they will represent the technological forefront in the energy sector \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralised consensus mechanism Pylon will offer the possibility of taking democratic investment decisions for expanding the generation or storage capacity of green energy \xe2\x80\xa2 Shared asset management Pylon Network will offer tools to simplify the processes of shared ownership through transparent safe and real time monitoring of assets This includes the distribution of profits or costs associated with the co owned assets \xe2\x80\xa2 Real time energy consumption (or smart metering) users will be able to constantly monitor their energy consumption and be charged based on a \xe2\x80\x9clive\xe2\x80\x9d electricity price this enables them to modify their energy habits in order to avoid consuming during periods with high electricity prices and hence reduce the cost of electricity for the cooperative \xe2\x80\xa2 Simplify the operations of the cooperative with the implementation of smart metering (Metron) and Pylon wallets it will be possible for the cooperatives to reduce the risk of their financial day to day operations by employing a customized billing scheme In this way Pylon offers to cooperatives an additional sustainability factor the financial one \xe2\x80\xa2 Empowerment of the sharing economy through creation of trust the levels of trust that blokchain technology offers can be a catalyst for unlocking more flexible sharing economy models for the energy sector and especially the energy cooperative model We believe that with the given structure as well as the values manifested by the renewable energy cooperatives the Pylon P2P Network could harness the development of a decentralised and international cooperative model with mechanisms of distributed consensus and governance at its foundation TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 7 \x0c3 K L E N E RG Y P RODUCT S P ORT F OL IO For the last three years the Klenergy team has focused its efforts in the development of a portfolio of products with very specific goals \xe2\x80\xa2 Push for a paradigm shift in the energy sector by exploiting only renewable energy sources for power production \xe2\x80\x93 which is more and more feasible as costs are dropping in order to take care of the most important commodity we have on our planet the environment \xe2\x80\xa2 Enhance the potential of energy storage the intermittent nature of sources like the sun and the wind makes energy storage fundamental to harness the potential of renewables in our energy systems we developed a hydrogen storage solution \xe2\x80\x93 Klenergy Helios \xe2\x80\x93 combining existing technologies in a very efficient way to generate electricity heating and clean fuel \xe2\x80\xa2 User empowerment through information as the cooperative model shows there are many people willing to take a stand and participate actively to influence local energy policies we want to give them the technological instruments to do it in an efficient way both financially and energy wise \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralization of business decisions and governance empowering people to take decisions on their use of energy means also allowing them to participate to the decision of allocation of resources Klenergy sees sustainable technologies as a pathway not only to a greener and less polluted planet which is still a huge deal but also as a pathway to a fairer and more democratic society with equal access to resources and therefore opportunities We offer two products which allow us to have a large impact towards this belief our flagship hydrogen battery Klenergy HELIOS and the first available smart meter based on blockchain technology Klenergy METRON 3 1

flagship of our products is our hydrogen storage solution HELIOS2 It taps on the competitive advantages of the most sustainable and most accessible fuel It produces hydrogen thanks to the electrolysis reaction without emitting any pollutant at all In that way it can store excess electricity in the form of compressible hydrogen which renders it a unique solution for seasonal storage applications (up to months) In the process of splitting water molecules and later using the produced hydrogen to produce electricity HELIOS exploits the heat waste through this process by heating up water that can later be used for space heating or domestic hot water applications Electricity Heat Fuel *(FCV) Figure 3 HELIOS unit energy flows 2 www klenergy tech es TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 10 \x0cHeating and cooling of buildings and industry is responsible for half of the EU\xe2\x80\x99s energy consumption In EU households for example it makes up about 79% of energy use On average heat demand represents

WHITEPAPER 11 \x0c4 PY LO N N E TWORK 4 1 Introduction to the Pylon Network There is no doubt in our days that blockchain technology is a decentralisation tool that can disrupt many industries other that the financial one Energy is one of them since typically it is a network with many actors intermediaries and transactions both physical and digital And with continuously reducing prices of renewables the production of electricity will shift towards a more decentralised base Blockchain technology can cover an obvious gap by offering incomparable advantages in terms of security and trust We see blockchain technology as a disruptive tool that can be used for the complete liberalization and decentralisation of the energy market Pylon Network has the potential to reduce the energy costs for the consumer increase the profits for the producer/investor and make the grid operation more efficient and less demanding At the same time Proof Of Work (P o W) based consensus algorithms (e g Bitcoin) have a downside they require big amounts of electricity to reach consensus on the state of the network The Bitcoin community relies on miners for its operation which in turn require electricity to run In fact according to a study that attempted to quantify the amount of electricity spent for the bitcoin community alone the annual electrical consumption for the bitcoin network operation is way above that of Ireland Pylon Network combines the aforementioned advantages and at the same time tackles the energy consumption burden that comes with P o W by minimizing the energy required for the validation of the transactions and heavily depending on excess renewable electricity which would otherwise be wasted Pylon Network brings together stand alone RES facilities (not connected to the electrical grid) with all the current actors of the traditional electricity market This is achieved through Pylon\xe2\x80\x99s Green Miners which rewards renewable energy no matter where it was produced (on or offgrid) A simple representation is shown in Figure 4 TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 12 \x0cFigure 4 Flow of energy and Pylon Coin The next sub sections will focus on various special aspects of Pylon Network regarding its users and its operation the Pylon Coin and the Green Mining reward system 4 2 Pylon Network value proposition The development of the Pylon network has the goal of creating a user friendly platform in which energy cooperatives and consumer can interact in an efficient way While achieving this renewable energy production is rewarded and smart metering technology is used to give users an instrument to monitor their consumption hence allowing them to optimize their consumption profiles while offering an efficient tool to pay their bills At the same time investors are given more incentives to invest in them with the advantage of more attractive ROIs due to the use of Pylon Ne TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 13 \x0ctwork They receive an additional reward for the production of RE in the form of Pylon Coin The goal of the upcoming development phase (pilot phase) will be the formulation of consensus rules and mechanisms to give a solid structure to the network while encouraging self consumption rather than investment in energy intensive mining equipment The following sections will go through the presentation of the different actors involved in energy data and token flows 4 3 Pylon Coin value proposition Pylon Coins are designed to represent the most valuable energy source for the future of our societies renewable energy This is achieved by associating excess RE generation with Pylon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Green Miners\xe2\x80\x99 which are the backbone of The Platform (Section 4 4 1) Pylon Network is designed to create a prosperous environment regarding \xe2\x80\xa2 The provision of financial incentives for green energy investment growth \xe2\x80\xa2 Decreasing payback time for RES installations \xe2\x80\xa2 Guarantee extra revenues for existing installations \xe2\x80\xa2 The direct exchange of cheap and certified green energy Pylon Coin will demonstrate the potential value creation that comes with decentralisation of energy supply chain investment decisions and policies 4 4 Green Miners The basis of Pylon Network The Green Miners constitute the pillar of the reward system implemented in The Network It is therefore the vehicle that adds value to the generation of green energy without additional burden to the energy demand The correct incentives are in place in order for \xe2\x80\xa2 The miners to prioritize own consumption over consumption for \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d With the proposed reward system and Green Mining model we ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d only occurs with electricity that would otherwise be wasted and does not add to the total energy consumption as shown in Figure 5 TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 14 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Encouraging investments in RES Give to investors (of all scales) an additional investment security by receiving an extra reward while using Pylon Network This reward which is received in Pylon Coins offers a reduction of the ROI 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 KW PV

value for isolated customers Our belief is that \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d by itself does not need to be profitable but investment in real value creation should be In Pylon Network Green Mining only helps to decrease the payback of the renewable installations \xe2\x80\x93 whether grid connected or not in other words incentives for additional electrical consumption or waste are avoided The following sections explain the concept of Green Mining in more detail 4 4 1 Creating a Non Competitive Green Mining Environment The early stages of the development will be focused on testing different consensus protocols alternatives The goal is to define a set of consensus rules easily verifiable by the nodes but not as energy intensive as the traditional Proof of Work we will initially achieve that by using federal nodes based on a hybrid model between Proof of Cooperation (to validate transactions) / Proof of Work (which certifies and reads the consumption of surplus energy on which the mining reward is based) TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 15 \x0cThe Proof of Cooperation allows us not only to eliminate the competitive nature of the miners but also to eliminate high cost of computing equipment This is achieved by replacing them with a certified Metron node able to absorb and monitor all the excess electricity available Based on this rationale the reward given to the Green Miners is distributed in a way that all of them (Section 4 5) receive the same electricity price per kWh of generated renewable energy This price is determined by taking as a reference the hourly electricity price in the national wholesale market In that way Green Miners receive the reward as a complement to the wholesale price and get compensated for any discrepancies in legislation 4 4 2 The Players of Pylon Network\xe2\x80\x99s Green Mining Pylon Network\xe2\x80\x99s Green Miners can be divided in categories \xe2\x80\xa2 RES Investor Will finance new plants for clients unable to afford it Clients will pay him in Pylon Coins for the electricity they receive from the RES plants By participating to the Pylon Network the investor has the opportunity to maximize the revenues from the RES plant by getting Pylon Coins as reward for the energy that the clients are not using They might monetize this value or store it to maximize benefits from increased value With this model the investor would have an extra benefit on a 25% in the form of Pylon Coin that could either be exchanged for FIAT currencies or maintained as Pylon Coin for future use in Pylon Network As in all cases METRON is the gateway to Pylon Network \xe2\x80\xa2 Standalone Producer They represent the pillar of the network the surplus electricity at their disposal is often wasted (since they are not connected to the grid) by participating in the Pylon Network they have the opportunity to monetize the surplus and reduce payback time of the RES installation up to 25% The reward system will be designed in order to emulate a feed in tariff as if they were connected to the grid providing a more secure investment environment for stand alone applications METRON will allow to keep track of the (excess) energy and Green Mining reward flows \xe2\x80\xa2 Large Scale RES facilities Producers of renewable energy that TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 16 \x0care connected to the grid and are authorized agents on the wholesale energy market will also get rewarded for the energy injected into the grid Their participation in the Pylon network will be rewarded to harmonize renewable energy incentives wherever this is not provided by the (inter)national legislative framework METRON will allow to keep track of the energy and reward flows \xe2\x80\xa2 Grid connected RES prosumers The reward is calculated in the same as in the previous cases i e in order to compensate for any difference between purchase and sale of electricity by the prosumer METRON will allow to keep track of the energy and reward flows \xe2\x80\xa2 Metron Nodes any type of consumer or network participant equipped with a Metron energy monitoring system will take part in the implementation of the consensus rules by confirming blocks of transactions Due to their minimal electrical consumption no reward will be given to Metron nodes By running a Metron node you can contribute to make the Pylon Network transparent while improving your energy consumption

the energy sold \xe2\x80\xa2 Standalone producer gets a reward in Pylon Coins for surplus electricity he/she is not consuming \xe2\x80\xa2 Large scale RES producer sells electricity to the energy cooperative via bilateral contracts in FIAT at the same time he/she receives a reward in Pylon Coins \xe2\x80\xa2 Energy Cooperative in charge of distribution of electricity to its members accepts

Pylon Coins for the energy surplus that is not consumed in order to decrease investment payback time Some example cases regarding the reward distribution and investment return from Green Mining can be found in Appendix A & B Figure 7 Flows of Pylon Coin energy and FIAT TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 19 \x0c5 ROA D MA P\xc2\xad Pylon will reach the commercialization readiness level after the pilot demonstration stage is completed successfully through the support and collaboration with GoiEner Since GoiEner has also the right to buy/sell electricity to the wholesale market the blockchain algorithm will be developed in such a way to integrate both areas of electricity trading buying/selling from/to the wholesale market but also the transactions with its customers (the consumers) In particular our pilot and commercialization validation efforts will be focusing on the following two tasks \xe2\x80\xa2 Development and testing of procedures to certify green miners and test innovative consensus mechanisms \xe2\x80\xa2 Study and simulate Prove different reward mechanisms to sustain investments in renewable storage technology and participation in the platform while scaling up This will enable it to be applicable on all scales and to integrate all players of existing market structures in a decentralised energy exchange platform We want to offer an open energy exchange market in which all technologies can participate and compete on equal terms Figure 9 shows the roadmap for achieving the most important milestones in various budget scenarios as represented in Figure 8 Figure 8

L U S I O N\xc2\xad With this token sale we are putting an open call for the initiation of an ambitious project We have presented how Pylon Network can become a tool for the empowerment of sustainable technologies and the acceleration of their deployment We have also described what steps will be taken in order to demonstrate the operation of Pylon Network This token sale is special not only because it is the first one that offers a digital crypto coin (token) with real value it is also unique in the sense that its development is associated with hardware installations (PV energy storage etc ) and management of a valuable commodity \xe2\x80\x93 renewable energy This makes its investment value more apparent and substantial when compared to most token sales We want to demonstrate the advantages of blockchain technology combined with decentralised energy generation through an implementation of our products portfolio We will start by demonstrating it within energy cooperatives with whom we share the same values and are already supporting us in this project Our aim will be to present a successful validated model with the ability to scale it up and apply it to various branches of the energy sector and all places of the world We offer a new disruptive model for the transaction of energy incorporated within a financial eco system Pylon Network is governed by a set of trust creation mechanisms that promote/reward the expansion of sustainable decentralised energy generation and management Pylon Network will be the nexus of the energy and the crypto currency markets an open platform based on the first sustainable decentralised currency designed to nourish the de centralisation of the global energy markets TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 26 \x0c8 APPENDIX Example case 1 Standalone Photovoltaic Plant A standalone PV plant of 6 kWp produces 24 kWh/day 3 (Valencian region) It is a common phenomenon that \xe2\x80\x93 especially during summer batteries are fully charged and they store only 10kWh of the 24kWh produced this means that the remaining 14kWh simply go to waste By participating to the Pylon Network this surplus can be monetized by receiving Pylon Coins as part of the Green Mining reward program The amount of rewarded Pylons is determined instantaneously depending on (i) the wholesale electricity price of the national market at every moment and (ii) the exchange rate between Pylon Coins and FIAT currencies (e g \xe2\x82\xac/PYLON) The goal is to maintain an equal \xe2\x80\x9cuniversal\xe2\x80\x9d reward within each energy market even for the stand alone decentralised energy producers For the Spanish example electricity prices in the free market are around 0 05 euro/kWh4 This means that the standalone plant owner with an estimated production cost of 0 30euro/kWh will always prefer to consume this energy rather than using it for feeding power hungry computers (traditional miners) on a 24/7 basis with the Green Mining of the Pylon Network there is no additional electrical load added as burden to the stand alone user while he/she gets rewarded for the \xe2\x80\x93inevitable\xe2\x80\x93 excess electricity that goes to waste Let us consider the following example conversion formula kWh/PYLON \xe2\x80\xa2 Number of kWh of energy surplus N \xe2\x80\xa2 Real time Pylon price P \xe2\x80\xa2 Electricity market price in the national market pool for 1 kWh e \xe2\x80\xa2 Correction factor dependent on country legislation and type of installation K In this example K is equal to 1 under the hypothesis that no other contribution is given for this energy (e g green energy subsidies) Assuming the price of Pylon to be \xe2\x82\xac1 5 at the moment of the energy transaction and the price of kWh in the market pool at 0 05 \xe2\x82\xac/kWh the plant owner will earn (0 333 PYLON) which correspond to 50\xe2\x82\xaccent In few words the standalone producer is able to\xe2\x80\x9dsell\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93virtually\xe2\x80\x93 excess generated electricity on the wholesale market 3 4 http //re jrc ec europa eu/pvgis/ http //www omie es/inicio/mercados y productos/mercado electricidad/ TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 27 \x0cThe formula is the following If the price of Pylon changes the reward will be fixed in \xe2\x82\xac per kWh to represent the hourly wholesale market price Let\xe2\x80\x99s suppose that for the same installation the cost of kWh is \xe2\x82\xac0 05 and the price of Pylon is \xe2\x82\xac5 by applying the previous formula we get Is this case the reward in Pylon is lower for the same amount of energy but the change in \\euro s makes it possible to maintain a constant reward for each kWh Payback time for a standalone PV plant participating in Pylon Network \xe2\x80\xa2

plant owner could save up to 23 3 % If this installation was financed by a private investor this percentage is considered as a direct investment return for him TOKEN SALE WHITEPAPER 28 \x0cExample case 2 Grid Connected Photovoltaic plant A grid connected PV plant of 100 kWp installed produces 400kWh/day (Valencian region) The lifespan of such installation is typically 25 years Since we are now considering a grid connected installation all the energy produced can be utilized (injected to the grid) In this case if the plant owner chooses to participate to the Pylon Network he/she will get a reward as well This reward will decrease the payback time of the plant and make the investment more attractive The objective is to build a system of incentives for investments in renewable energy and speed up full RES penetration in the grid The following paragraph deals with preliminary calculations for the second example case Conversion formula kWh/PYLON \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Number of kWh of energy surplus N Real time Pylon price P Electricity market price in the national market pool for 1 kWh e Correction factor dependent on country legislation and type of installation K In this example K is equal to 0 2 assuming that the plant is already receiving a payment from an energy cooperative for the energy sold via bilateral contract let\xe2\x80\x99s assume that the electricity price agreed in the contract is 0 04 \xe2\x82\xac/kWh according to the current prices in Spain Therefore to compensate for the difference between the bilateral contract price and prices in the market pool the producer will receive Pylons as a reward Assuming a price of Pylon of \xe2\x82\xac1 5 at the time of the energy transaction and a cost per kWh in the Spanish market pool of 0 05 \xe2\x82\xac/kWh the owner of the grid connected facility will get (2 6667 PYLON) corresponding to \xe2\x82\xac 4 hence 0 01 \xe2\x82\xac/kWh extra per kWh injected to the grid This situation is equivalent to selling energy in the wholesale market at 0 05 \xe2\x82\xac/kWh the formula is the following Payback time for a grid connected PV plant participating in Pylon Network TOKEN SALE
