 Cardstack is the experience layer of the decentralized 
 Internet We believe that orchestrating cohesive user 
 experiences across the blockchain and the cloud is 
 essential to bringing decentralization to the mass market 
 
 FOR MAKERS FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF REWARDS 
 
 We propose a new economic model for funding and sustaining the software 
 that runs the world This model distributes rewards fairly among the 
 creators of the software and the open source communities supporting 
 them In this decentralized software market a buyer of applications enters 
 into a direct deal via smart contracts which coordinate a diverse network of 
 software development teams cloud hosting providers and app coin backed 
 protocols The buyer offers to cover all the material costs of running the 
 app as long as the cost is directly linked to the usage The buyer will also pay 
 a royalty that is split between those who developed the software as a reward 
 for initially creating and continuously supporting all the components making 
 up that particular application In this arrangement the application software 
 can be considered economically sustainable since every buyer covers his or 
 her costs and the software does not deplete the limited resources (like 
 venture capital or token sale proceeds) The software developers are 
 rewarded through a reward pool based on properly designed incentives 
 that lead to improvements of the software over time 
 
 FOR USERS COHESIVE USER EXPERIENCES 
 
 Our model is based on blockchain technology which presents us with a rare 
 opportunity We can break down the silos of apps defining the tech world 
 today in order to produce a Cohesive User Experience (CUE) which 
 establishes a flexible design paradigm that can orchestrate all the moving 
 parts in the users digital life With the fluidity of token backed applications 
 we can move beyond the one icon per app business arrangement of the 
 current mobile and cloud world Yet for blockchain backed applications to 
 gain mass market adoption we need to bridge the gap between the power 
 of blockchains and the convenience of the cloud Cardstacks application 
 framework and token mechanisms combine the new possibilities provided by 
 smart contracts while leveraging the incredible global scale and cost 
 efficiency of cloud computing to deliver this user experience Our 
 technology puts the power of decentralization into real world use and 
 demonstrates how a crypto driven economy backed by current blockchain 
 protocols can enrich the world in an equitable manner Blockchain needs a 
 full stack application framework to reach mainstream users Cardstack 
 
 Our mission is to build an economically sustainable 
 software ecosystem that fights back against the 
 rampant lock in mechanisms of centralized platforms

 The App Store era turns software features into standalone 
 native apps which usually do not communicate with each 
 other and require users to choose between multiple 
 overlapping features to form their workflows 
 
 MOBILE SILOS ONE APP PER SCREEN 
 
 Today there is an app for everything More than 
 USD 70 billion have been paid out to developers of 
 iOS apps in the last decade When the iPhone was 
 first introduced there were 15 apps iPhone Mail 
 Web iPod Calendar Camera Maps Photos 
 Stocks Clock Notes Calculator Weather Text 
 and Settings It allowed people to manage their 
 lives on the go facilitating communication and 
 even giving directions while their music collection 
 served as the soundtrack to their new iLife 
 
 But alls not well in todays app world Outside the 
 category of games and entertainment most users 
 refuse to pay for apps which is why nearly all of 
 todays apps are free Additionally the sequence 
 of steps needed to use a native app search 
 download find the icon launch skip tour register 
 
 has severely hampered the adoption of new 
 apps The result is that most iPhone users settle on 
 a small number of apps (< 5) for daily habitual use 
 Many of these apps are supported by advertising 
 For a majority of development teams working 
 outside of FAMGA (Facebook Apple Microsoft 
 Google Amazon) the original business model for 
 apps users pay money to buy app is 
 effectively dead

 As software moves to the cloud users need to manage 
 multiple subscriptions to cloud based software as aservice 
 (SaaS) products and choose the right plan to 
 optimize cost across all the needed features 
 
 CLOUD SILOS ONE SUBSCRIPTION PER APP 
 
 The monthly subscription model has taken over as 
 the revenue from subscriptions aligns well with the 
 ongoing cost of developing and maintaining the 
 software Most small businesses need 5 10 apps to 
 operate large businesses need many more 
 
 Each app requires a separate credit card admin 
 login and password which causes problems 
 Cards expire logins must be reset when the 
 employee who signed up leaves the company or 
 customer support has to be called Not to mention 
 how costly these apps are And there is always the 
 risk of the team behind an app suddenly being 
 acquired by a bigger player or shutting down 
 because the funding has run out Then you have 
 60 days to download all the data you and your 
 team painstakingly entered into the app as one 
 giant zip file 
 
 Many of these apps have duplicative feature sets 
 just to remain competitive and be able to retain 
 customers This is a natural result of 
 uncoordinated yet competitive markets For end 
 users this is expensive and painful

 The emergence of blockchain and decentralized apps 
 (dApps) exasperated the situation by requiring users to 
 acquire and manage the supply of utility tokens for each 
 of the functions making up their software stack 
 
 EMERGING BLOCKCHAIN SILOS ONE TOKEN PER APP 
 
 Most of the first generation user interfaces for 
 dApps are built as standalone web applications 
 that interact with a blockchain via browser plugins 
 a system tray or a menu bar program The 
 user opens one app at a time in a series of 
 familiar browser tabs most likely 
 
 Each dApp works independently looks distinctive 
 and moves assets on its preferred blockchain 
 decisively We get a glimpse of the power of 
 decentralized permissionless innovation 
 
 We also see the perils of fragmentation where the 
 simple ideal of dApps all powered by Ethereum 
 
 turns into a complex web of different app coins 
 on different smart contract platforms with 
 different approaches to user interfaces and 
 different levels of peer to peer requirements 
 Even for a savvy web app user this is certainly 
 more challenging than managing 15 different SaaS 
 subscriptions This is more like setting ones own 
 Linux desktop to host everything from ones 
 own blog to ones email account chat server key 
 management server and so on This complexity

 The reorientation of the vertical silos to horizontal layers 
 allows native apps cloud apps and blockchain dApps to 
 form a future software stack combining the best qualities 
 of each of the software eras approaches 
 
 THE PARTS KEEP GETTING BETTER 
 
 The problems of silos are actually a consequence 
 of the bounty of technological progress funded 
 by the growth in the global Internet enabled 
 marketplace 
 
 In the users pocket every new generation of 
 mobile phones provides a new baseline of 
 capabilities that begs to be incorporated into the 
 users workflow The competitive landscape of 
 mobile operating systems means that last years 
 striking innovations become this years 
 commodity features 
 
 On the cloud all SaaS vendors want to add 
 features in order to attract a new segment of 
 customers or simply keep current customers from 
 migrating to a competing suite that is starting to 
 encroach on their feature set 
 
 While the blockchain based dApps vendors are all 
 new to the game most of them not having 
 shipped any working code yet the land grab for 
 mindshare and potential use cases is already in full 
 force With each white paper and smart contract 
 design published we see the potential for 
 blockchain dApps to compete or to augment the 
 powerful tools that are available on the market as 
 native apps or cloud subscriptions

 Savvy users are already learning to work with multiple 
 apps across their devices cloud and blockchain to fulfill 
 their needs Human ingenuity will continue to close any 
 gaps left between the technologies 
 
 PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT WORK 
 
 Early adopters of blockchain technologies know 
 how difficult it is to make a basic transaction to 
 send bitcoins or ether to someone let alone 
 transact with smart contracts and handle app 
 tokens Yet the ever growing volume of daily 
 transactions in the cryptocurrency space shows 
 that people are finding their way around wallets 
 like Coinbase or TREZOR exchanges like Kraken 
 social networks like Reddit and centralized 
 messaging systems like Slack to participate in this 
 exciting new world 
 
 The largely manual workflows pioneered by these 
 early adopters (see dotted lines on the diagrams 
 on the right) criss cross the boundaries between 
 their devices various cloud hosted apps and the 
 many blockchains For them the theoretical 
 debates about the merits of purely decentralized 
 systems give way to practical concerns of getting 
 the deal or the trade done These trails left by the 
 pioneering users should deliver inspiration and 
 guidelines for designers and developers of the 
 next generation of user experiences They should 
 serve to make these steps easier and quicker or if 
 possible eliminate them altogether through a 
 streamlined process

 Cardstack is building a new experience layer that helps 
 users orchestrate their interactions across the (d)Apps 
 they use ushering in the age of mass market adoption of 
 decentralized technologies in an open ecosystem 
 
 BUILD IT OPEN KEEP IT OPEN 
 
 The World Wide Web was architected by Sir Tim 
 Berners Lee as a decentralized network of 
 individually operated web servers It was built with 
 open source tools and brought forth the era of 
 home pages under construction But building it 
 open in 1989 was not enough to keep the Web 
 from falling back into an uncomfortably 
 centralized architecture in 2017 To search the 
 Web we still rely on the relentless crawlers from 
 Google To stay informed we submit to the 
 algorithms of Facebook trying to find things that 
 may trigger our interests The crypto community 
 is not immune to these recentralization vectors 
 hosted closed sourced wallets like Coinbase have 
 captured a big portion of recent crypto converts 
 
 The nascent movement towards blockchainenabled 
 decentralization is a great opportunity 
 Builders can learn from the past and lay a more 
 resilient technical social and economic 
 foundation ensuring that a powerful beautiful 
 and convenient layer of great user experience is 
 kept open as forkable open source software 
 coordinated via open governance of 
 decentralized protocols and available for open 
 participation from all around the globe

 DECENTRALIZED USER EXPERIENCES 
 
 Decentralization can be thought of more 
 concretely as the recentralization of 
 workflows around a user The user can 
 initiate orchestrate and make decisions 
 about transactions that are coordinated 
 locally (i e over the counter) via cloudbased 
 market makers or through the 
 logic and consensus mechanisms of 
 various blockchains Parity with 
 traditional single function apps is not 
 enough The vision of multiple apps and 
 dApps working in harmony demands a 
 generational leap in user experience in 
 terms of composeability and 
 interoperability 
 
 As the use cases expand beyond crypto 
 trading and finance this general pattern 
 of user orchestration can be used to 
 redecentralize the data locked behind 
 cloud based subscriptions through 
 integration hooks With the right 
 architecture and design system a usercentric 
 decentralized UX can exhibit the 
 fluidity of a consumer social network 
 while facilitating structured transactions 
 like a line of business system

 THE RISE OF CARD BASED UI 
 
 To enable this breakthrough we need to 
 break the problem space of complex user 
 interfaces and workflows into 
 manageable pieces Each piece is bitesized 
 encapsulated and happens to look 
 like a physical card which can be 
 embedded chained auto filled 
 attached triggered expanded 
 versioned cloned rescinded and 
 approved as part of a cohesive user 
 experience it floats effortlessly on top of 
 multiple cloud environments and 
 blockchains 
 
 At the same time we also need to zoom 
 out and establish a new set of rules 
 working out how these cards can stand 
 on their own be embedded in other 
 apps and act as hosts for other cards 
 when called upon to do so We can then 
 use the rewarding power of the 
 blockchain streamlined through a cardbased 
 ecosystem to make features that 
 were previously offered in proprietary 
 and expensive silos pervasively available 
 to millions of people around the world as 
 bona fide open source software

 blockchain technologies data in the

 24/7 solely on your behalf or let a thirdparty 
 website do it for you in a multitenant

 mobile devices or the open Web and invite them to 
 participate as peers with greater sovereignty 
 
 SAME CODE ACROSS ON RAMPS 
 
 The software tools developers use to 
 build peer to peer apps are different 
 from the ones used for hosted web 
 apps While there are web apps that 
 speak with blockchains (e g cloud 
 wallets like Coinbase) and peer topeer 
 apps that connect to the cloud 
 
 
 (e g secure chat apps that depend on 
 cloud based identity graphs) apps 
 that are flexible enough to run in both 
 topologies are rare 
 To reach new users the open Web is a 
 great place to start as it bypasses the 
 friction of an app install through an 
 app store or a direct download and 
 allows users to begin interacting and 
 gaining value immediately With this 
 user adoption pathway in mind 
 Cardstacks software and protocols 
 are architected to enable developers 
 to deploy their card based 
 experiences to the Web and reach 
 users where they are today In 
 
 More Control 
 
 
 More Convenient 
 
 addition developers learn to package 
 that same code as a peer to peer app 
 for users who are ready to take full 
 ownership of their digital life

 YOU OWN YOUR OWN HUB 
 
 There are services on the Web like IFTTT 
 that will help you wire up the different 
 services of your digital life based on rules 
 and conditions you set In the crypto space 
 there are exchanges that will process limit 
 orders automatically when you are asleep 
 Looking ahead dApps promise to reallocate 
 your digital tokens continuously to minimize 
 risk and maximize portfolio value The 
 question is Are you in command of these 
 agents and do you know what they are 
 doing on your behalf at all times 
 
 Inside the Cardstack architecture especially 
 in peer to peer mode all users remain in 
 complete control of their data orchestration 
 layer called Cardstack Hub which sits 
 between the user experiences they use and 
 the data sources that persist and process the 
 interactions Even in a hosted model where 
 the plug ins run inside the Hub in a multitenant 
 configuration the users are 
 represented as themselves through welldefined 
 boundaries of their commands and 
 queries of their aggregated data collections

 DATA AND CODE LIVE TOGETHER 
 
 Cardstack is a pluggable event sourcing 
 search first open sourced application 
 framework for building distributed as well as 
 decentralized application networks At the 
 core of Cardstack is the idea that data 
 content and code in modern applications 
 evolve and change in lockstep When a 
 social network introduces a new feature call 
 it InstaStories the data schema content 
 authoring tool mobile app templates 
 recommendation algorithms and API 
 endpoints all have to be updated to reflect 
 this capability On the code front Git the 
 distributed version control system created 
 by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for developing the 
 Linux kernel provides the foundation for 
 rapid parallel branching to test new ideas 
 and merge them again when the time is 
 right We believe The Git Way deserved to 
 be extended beyond code and become the 
 standard way to manage the tracking and 
 propagation of data and content When 
 combined with the consensus making 
 power of blockchains a Git based workflow 
 realized through Cardstack Hub represents 
 a return to local control without sacrificing 
 value creation through network effects

 BUILDING WORKFLOWS ACROSS APPS 
 
 With a unified orchestration layer provided by 
 Cardstack Hub (d)Apps that are built on this 
 common foundation can work seamlessly to 
 serve the users 
 
 Networks are formed solely based on group 
 affiliation and market participation not 
 because everyone uses the same application 
 
 e g Slack 
 Queues aggregate and coordinate the flow of 
 data and actions of multiple (d)Apps within the 
 network without needing to log in to multiple 
 dashboards to check up on them 
 
 Environments define the boundaries of what is 
 a public forum a private workspace and an 
 invite only channel Within that chosen 
 context all (d)Apps inherit the visibility and 
 privacy controls so there is no need for 
 repetitive permission tweaks 
 
 Configurations across dApps and the data and 
 content they manage can now be made 
 consistent since the Hub is schema aware and 
 can offer reusable controls for fields 
 
 Libraries provide a user centric searchable 
 view of the collection of cards sitting inside 
 each (d)App It serves as the ubiquitous 
 camera roll of the Cardstack experience

 DESIGNING AROUND THE FOUR EDGES 
 
 There are enough open source repositories 
 on GitHub to provoke ones imagination 
 regarding the possibility of a composeable 
 software ecosystem Yet if you want to quickly 
 assemble even a simple web app youll find 
 there arent many ready made features you 
 can fork and include in your app without a 
 significant amount of custom coding 
 
 Looking at the success in the SaaS world a 
 dominant example being Salesforce com 
 we realize that the key is a consistent 
 application structure so that new features and 
 third party extensions can be added to an 
 existing installation by an end user with little to 
 no code 
 
 We created our design system code named 
 Four Edges based on a similar theory If we 
 extract the common functionalities from web 
 apps and provide them as part of the overall 
 Cardstack operating environment new apps 
 built as a collection of cards can be created 
 received saved modified published remixed 
 and reused by end users all within the user 
 interface paradigm they have internalized 
 Developers and designers can focus their 
 efforts within the edges of the card to make it 
 the best card of its kind in this open catalog

 The unique advantage of cards as a user

 the four edges of the modern smartphone

 They can move into or out of view with the flick

 Most successful platforms in the cloud era 
 initially did one thing well and then expanded 
 to copy competitors features when those use 
 cases gained traction with users Facebook is 
 the most famous example of a hypercompetitive 
 fast following copier 
 
 In an open ecosystem like the one Cardstack 
 is building every new network can reuse the 
 tools in the shared card and container 
 catalog so that the duplication of effort is 
 reduced at the macro level and the time to 
 market is improved at the micro level 
 
 Considering the entrenched network effects 
 of the digital superpowers in their dominant 
 position the only way to unseat them is to 
 fight back with even greater network effects 
 The decentralized challengers sharing of

 BUILDING UP SPEED WITH THE FLYWHEEL 
 
 The evolution of the software ecosystem behind Bitcoin 
 and Ethereum shows that open sourced software 
 development can be fueled by a growing token backed 
 economy where any person or organization is free to 
 join and participate As the overall network value grows 
 
 which is often measured by metrics like 
 CoinMarketCap there is an ever growing incentive for 
 new developers to build upon this codebase or 
 architecture and then deploy the new innovation as a 
 piece connected to the existing network instead of 
 starting a new network from scratch in a lonely corner 
 Each if you cant beat them join them decision made 
 by an independent participant adds momentum to the 
 flywheel a term coined by Jim Collins in the book 
 Good to Great Decentralized organizations rely on a 
 gradual build up of speed when it comes to the flywheel 
 effect aiming to gain sustainable momentum to 
 compete with incumbents and challengers alike 
 Looking beyond the specialized software for 
 cryptocurrency mining and trading is there a way for

 When every user is a paying customer the 
 relationship between the user and the team 
 behind the app changes for the better With 
 the introduction of a wallet containing 
 various crypto tokens the users can now 
 pay for software and services directly 
 through their wallet And they know that the 
 teams behind the scenes will like to keep 
 this revenue flowing by providing new 
 features upgrades attentive support etc 
 
 Cardstacks open source framework and 
 token mechanism help development teams 
 tap into this new source of revenue they 
 generate the smart contracts needed for a 
 new app using simple configuration files 
 checked in to the apps GitHub repository 
 These smart contracts can be deployed to a 
 public blockchain starting with the 
 Ethereum network and upgraded with

 Behind the Scenes 
 Competing Apps 
 Since any distribution of tokens on a public 
 blockchain incurs transactional fees (known 
 as gas in the Ethereum network) the 
 reward pool is designed to accumulate 
 tokens for a defined period of time and then 
 disperse them to the makers and miners in 
 an aggregated manner For dApps requiring 
 their own native tokens to function the 
 reward pool can initiate an external 
 exchange acting on the users behalf to 
 acquire and deposit the needed tokens to 
 fund the transactional activities In essence 
 it is simply a piece of software providing a 
 custodial token exchange service

 them to use that app and any of its dependent services 
 When the app is used and the service redeemed the 
 makers and miners are compensated with tokens 
 
 HOW IT WORKS 
 
 End users and contributors can register their 
 interest in acquiring Cardstack Tokens (CARD) by 
 depositing ether from their wallet during the 
 Token Generating Event (TGE) or afterwards 
 through peer to peer transactions 
 
 As needed CARD can be converted into Software 
 & Services Coupons (SSC) which are in turn sent 
 to an app contract to establish the retainer 
 agreement Converted CARD are locked in a 
 reward pool until the next reward allocation 
 cycle which is triggered by a block based timer 
 
 When a user starts using the app(s) usage data 
 on and off chain are collected and periodically 
 reported to the app contract as proof that this 
 particular user has redeemed a portion of the 
 balance of the retainer 
 
 The history of redemption events combined with 
 other aggregated data sets and statistical 
 analyses helps the network wide reward pool 
 smart contract determine a fair attribution and 
 allocation of rewards to makers and miners in the 
 Cardstack ecosystem These cover material costs 
 as well as fees and royalties owed to the teams 
 who helped deliver the cohesive user experience

 as part of a scheme we call Proof of Analytics (See 
 section 6 5) The outputs of these off chain oracles 
 are sampled by the reward contract The dispersion

 It all started with the idea of composeability which was 
 synthesized from the fields of design technology and 
 social sciences We have since translated it into an opensourced 
 platform where the next million makers can 
 work together to reshape our digital future 
 
 STATEMENT FROM CHRIS TSE FOUNDING DIRECTOR 
 
 I founded the Cardstack project in 2014 when I first noticed the increased 
 level of lock in imposed on users by the large apps and dominant networks 
 that people rely on in everyday life In my prior roles leading research & 
 development and digital product teams inside a Fortune 500 media company 
 in New York it became obvious to me that the power center had shifted to 
 Silicon Valley Our millions in R&D budgets cant compete with their billions 
 The cards are stacked The fight has to be taken out into the open I vowed to 
 use the power of open source software and collaboration tools guided by 
 the ethos of the open Web to organize the creation of a decentralized 
 alternative to the centralized clouds that are looming over our heads 
 
 As a technologist by trade a designer in practice and an entrepreneur at 
 heart I knew that I had to recruit experts and makers from many subject 
 areas to work together in order to design and build something this 
 ambitious and contrarian So I put a team together and got to work I 
 bootstrapped the development of open source with revenue generating 
 projects These projects aligned with our overall goals and allowed us to 
 iterate on the design technical and economic ideas that shaped the 
 constitution of this new open decentralized and composeable stack 
 
 Time passed and Cardstack grew along with our partners clients investors 
 and the open source communities that we supported and that supported us 
 We were fortunate to be introduced to the blockchain pioneers which gave 
 us the chance to get on chain early and sharpen our understanding of what 
 blockchains do well I am proud of how our team made this work getting real 
 users to use our tools daily and give us feedback while we sketched our 
 project and determined how the whole stack should come together 
 
 CARD BASED 
 ASSEMBLY 
 COMPOSEABLE 
 TECH STACK 
 Make no mistake Decentralization of the software ecosystem means 
 revisiting many of the basic assumptions about the way in which the software 
 that runs the world is architected designed developed secured distributed 
 deployed orchestrated bundled unbundled priced analyzed monetized 
 financed adopted supported upgraded decommissioned and preserved 
 Any substantial change to one of the aforementioned factors could shake up 
 the market and lead to a rise or fall of fortunes and power dynamics 
 
 Cardstacks approach for layering a composeable user experience and data 
 orchestration hub on top of both the centralized and the decentralized 
 infrastructures allows this shift to happen progressively but assuredly You 
 can build an ambitious networked ecosystem with our card based assembly 
 and composeable tech stack today When the underpinning of the 
 decentralized Internet is ready for prime time just flip the switch inside 
 Cardstack and your network will be fully updated for the world of tomorrow

 FRAMEWORK EXTRACTED FROM 
 REAL WORLD USE 
 
 After we announced the public mission 
 of Cardstack to build an open 
 ecosystem with a card based 
 architecture and design system we 
 knew that a vision as expansive as ours 
 would need continuous validation 
 against real world use cases to stay on 
 track This is why we narrowed our 
 focus to a subset of the problem which 
 led to the creation of a contentcentric 
 search first and plug in based 
 application framework that looks and 
 feels like a next generation CMS 
 (content management system) but is 
 actually a whole lot more 
 
 This core orchestration architecture 
 was then extracted and refactored in 
 late 2016 to add support for a Git style 
 branching and merging of a mix of 
 data content and code This 
 distributed versioning approach allows 
 the framework to quickly plug in to 
 various blockchains private or public 
 as a means to synchronize state across 
 a set of participating peers

 GETTING A RUNNING START 
 
 Since our team works at the interesting 
 intersection of the blockchain and the 
 cloud we have met many talented 
 makers who are intrigued by the 
 promise of decentralization but do not 
 know where to start their journey They 
 are developers designers product 
 managers writers storytellers 
 videographers data scientists and 
 digital strategists For many of them 
 there is no clear path from their 
 current positions within the firms that 
 employ them to the blockchain We 
 see this as a great opportunity for 
 Cardstack to become the on ramp to 
 the blockchain world for these makers 
 We want them to join the Cardstack 
 movement and offer their expertise 
 energy idealism and practical 
 knowledge to move the project 
 forward We will recruit hire 
 subcontract partner educate 
 promote and collaborate in any way 
 we can to channel the work of these 
 makers into the base of the ecosystem 
 that in turn rewards them through a 
 virtuous cycle

 A EARLY CONTRIBUTORS B PRE ALLOCATION 
 TOKEN DISTRIBUTION 
 
 The Foundation will distribute 40% of the total of Cardstack Tokens (CARD) 
 that will be generated at the Token Generating Event (TGE) to the public 
 These tokens will be distributed through a series of batches to ensure a fair 
 allocation to our community of contributors while maintaining compliance 
 to applicable laws and regulations 
 
 Early Contributors (Batch A) The first batch of tokens will be distributed to 
 teams and individuals who have been active in the Cardstack community and 
 have plans to continue to support and grow the ecosystem This process is 
 conducted manually and is subjected to KYC/AML (Know Your Customer / 
 Anti Money Laundering) rules during on boarding processes Contributors 
 in this batch will be offered a bonus of 20% 
 
 Pre Allocation (Batch B) The second batch of tokens is available on a firstcome 
 first serve basis to members of the Cardstack community who wish to 
 obtain an allocation of up to $50 000 USD equivalent of CARD and receive a 
 10% bonus Interested parties will need to complete an on boarding process 
 operated by our pre allocation partner Bitcoin Suisse prior to the start of 
 the pre allocation period Approved participants will be able to contribute 
 Ether or another cryptocurrency or fiat currency supported by the Bitcoin 
 Suisse platform For further details please visit www bitcoinsuisse ch 
 
 C CROWD FUNDRAISER D AIRDROP AWARDS 
 COMMUNITY BUILDING 
 
 To encourage the adoption of Cardstack software architecture and 
 protocols the Foundation aims to distribute the remaining tokens to the 
 broadest network of participants possible 
 
 Crowd Fundraiser (Batch C) The next batch of the tokens will be distributed 
 directly through an open registration process on cardstack com where 
 contributors who fulfill the KYC/AML requirements can contribute from a 
 whitelisted Ethereum address up to an individual cap For the first 6 hours of 
 the crowd fundraiser period the cap will be set at a relatively low number 
 ensuring that all approved contributors will have enough tokens to redeem 
 Cardstack based software and services 
 
 To show our appreciation for those community members who have joined 
 our community in its early days contributors with validated email addresses 
 showing early participation will be granted a higher cap during these first 6 
 hours See Section 6 3 for more details 
 
 After these first 6 hours all contribution caps will be raised 
 
 Airdrop Awards (Batch D) Following the TGE the Foundation will announce 
 and conduct a series of airdrops that will further distribute tokens to 
 potential interested and active participants of the Cardstack ecosystem

 analytic miners early in the Projects adoption cycle especially before a 
 meaningful number of paying customers arrive the Cardstack Token smart 
 contract will mint and allocate 4 000 000 000 additional tokens over 10 
 years whereafter the smart contract will automatically stake newly minted 
 tokens in reward pools and then allocate them to makers and miners that are 
 actively offering software and services During the first year 1 000 000 000 
 tokens will be distributed incrementally over the course of the year In 
 subsequent years the amount of distribution will be diminished with 
 cumulative distribution at the end of each year capped by this formula

 REGISTRATION PROCESS 
 
 While the pre allocation is done through a process conducted manually the 
 registration for the main crowd fundraiser is conducted directly on 
 cardstack com Please check our website and our Telegram group 
 periodically to learn when the registration process begins 
 
 In order to comply with KYC/AML regulations in the various jurisdictions we 
 ask each potential contributor to create a unique user login and provide 
 some basic level of identification information which will be analyzed and 
 scored through a risk management system operated by Bitcoin Suisse AG 
 and/or IdentityMind Global under vendor contracts with the Cardstack 
 Foundation with strict confidentiality provisions 
 
 Potential contributors will also need to provide an Ethereum address under 
 their direct control so that the Cardstack Token ledger and the smart 
 contract can whitelist those addresses during the contribution period 
 
 The Ethereum address for sending funds to the Cardstack Token ledger is 
 viewable only after a secure user login on cardstack com once the crowd 
 fundraising period has started Along with the Ethereum address all 
 registered and approved users will see the contributor specific data field for 
 linking the user login with the contributors Ethereum address as well as 
 instructions on how to use an approved ether wallet to send funds 
 
 Do not send funds to any Ethereum address you find elsewhere that claims 
 to be from Cardstack Not in any Telegram channel or DMs not via email 
 text message or social posts on Facebook Twitter or Reddit basically not 
 through any other apps or websites You need to come to cardstack com to 
 contribute funds We will not actively reach out to you 
 
 INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMITS 
 
 Before the contribution period All potential contributors must register on 
 cardstack com to take part in our KYC/AML compliance process at least 72 
 hours prior to the start of the crowd fundraising period No contributor will 
 be able to join and participate after the registration is closed We will publicly 
 post the exact Target Proceed Amount in Ether and the Individual 
 Contribution Limit once the registration is closed These two factors will be 
 determined based on a statistical analysis of the registration data crossreferenced 
 with patterns in similar token generation events 
 
 Start of the contribution period When the crowd fundraising period 
 officially begins registered and approved contributors will have the 
 opportunity to send funds to the Cardstack Token ledger The amount must 
 be within the Per Address Contribution Limit which is implemented as a 
 smart contract enforced quota on all whitelisted Ethereum addresses 
 Transactions that are above either the contribution limit or the gas limit will 
 be rejected by the smart contract or the Ethereum network respectively 
 
 Individual contribution caps will start out low during the crowd fundraising 
 period to ensure broad participation Contributors who have been a part of 
 community early on may be given a higher contribution cap during this initial 
 period Caps will be raised for all contributors as the fundraiser progresses 
 
 End of the contribution period The fundraiser ends when the amount of 
 ether contributed reaches the Target Proceed Amount in Ether or when 30 
 days have elapsed whichever is earlier At this point funds will no longer be 
 accepted Cardstack Tokens will be allocated and they will be unlocked

 TOKEN FUNCTIONALITIES 
 
 For end users the project token is a utility token that allows them to mix 
 and match multiple dApps and cloud apps When users spend a project 
 token the smart contract forms a retainer agreement between the users and 
 their chosen apps before the token is staked in a reward pool 
 
 Software developers and service providers whom we collectively call 
 makers can offer their dApps or cloud apps to users as part of the projects 
 ecosystem they register their apps by paying a fee thus using the project 
 token as a work token The fees to be paid by makers are determined by the 
 smart contract so as to balance the goals of inviting new entrants and 
 maintaining quality Maker fees once paid are locked in a toll pool and taken 
 out of active circulation 
 
 Tokens staked in the reward pool by users are periodically distributed to 
 makers as reward tokens according to a decentralized algorithmic payment 
 and governance model that rests in the hands of the community This model 
 is driven by anonymized usage data which is aggregated and tracked by an 
 on and off chain protocol called Tally Analytic miners help calculate the 
 reward function that determines who gets paid out what while sifting out 
 spam therefore making the system fair and resilient The miners results 
 compete in a sortition scheme we call Proof of Analytics ensuring that the 
 reward algorithms are never under a single partys control 
 
 Analytic miners can register to participate in the Proof of Analytics scheme 
 in order to determine how the reward pool is split by paying a fee for every 
 life cycle of the reward pool These fees are paid as work tokens and locked 
 in a toll pool as well If a miner is selected to report the final payment splits 
 that miner receives a portion of the tokens in the reward pool as mining 
 reward for doing the useful work of number crunching and enforcing the 
 communitys payment and governance model 
 
 The percentage of tokens in the reward pool to be paid to miners is determined 
 by the same decentralized algorithms that aim to minimize on chain 
 transactional fees in aggregate for end users and makers yet ensuring protocol 
 security by giving a critical mass of analytic miners incentives to compete 
 
 To increase their chance of being selected analytic miners can stake additional 
 project tokens in a long term stake pool called the voting pool The odds of 
 being selected through the sortition scheme are proportional to the size of a 
 miners long term stake Miners who have tokens locked in this long term pool 
 can however have their stake slashed by the smart contract if the results of 
 their analytics are deemed to be fraudulent or out of consensus with the 
 community 
 
 Users and makers can also stake project tokens in the voting pool to influence 
 the allocation parameters smart contract upgrades analytic algorithm 
 changes etc For the purpose of allowing project token holders to influence the 
 governance of the ecosystem a variant of quadratic coin lock voting which 
 was proposed by Vitalik Buterin is implemented in the smart contract This way 
 voters who want to wield power through voting must live with their decisions 
 for longer and align their interests with the long term value of the ecosystem 
 Staked tokens in the voting pool can be retrieved after the lock up period has 
 elapsed 
 
 Early on in the project ecosystems growth newly minted tokens are 
 automatically staked by the smart contract in order to bootstrap the reward 
 pools with a meaningful number of project tokens so as to attract makers and 
 miners to participate As more end users arrive the new revenue these paying 
 customers bring in becomes a major portion of these reward pools allowing 
 the ecosystem to transition into a sustainable marketplace

 PROPORTIONAL INFLUENCE 
 BASED ON STAKE TIME 
 
 The Foundation will periodically offer 
 ballot propositions which the 
 participants of the voting pool can 
 vote on to guide the evolution of the 
 Cardstack ecosystem Some of these 
 ballots are non binding and serve as 
 forum for stakeholder feedback But 
 some will trigger the automatic 
 upgrade of smart contracts or change 
 the key parameters governing the 
 reward functions and other on chain 
 code upon approval by the voters 
 
 Participants need to stake a portion of 
 their tokens by adding them to the 
 voting pool to gain influence over 
 ballot outcomes Staked tokens are 
 locked for a period of time during 
 which they cannot be converted to 
 SSC circulated through the reward 
 cycle or traded The longer the 
 tokens are locked voluntarily the 
 more influence the long term holder 
 gains However voting power is 
 progressive This means that every 
 incremental token from larger holders 
 has less voting power giving smaller 
 stakeholders more say in aggregate

 reward 
 given 
 to 
 a 
 node 
 in 
 
 
 open source 
 communities 
 such 
 as 
 Github 
 where 
 soft particular 
 channel 
 receives 
 is 
 proportional 
 to 
 the 
 cost 
 ware 
 code 
 is 
 easily 
 accessed 
 and 
 shared 
 Our 
 objective 
 in 
 of 
 delivering 
 a 
 packet 
 therefore 
 cheaper 
 packets 
 are 
 
 
 
 a 
 function 
 of 
 the 
 node 
 located 
 in 
 a 
 tree 
 For 
 the 
 local 
 scope 
 as 
 a 
 result 
 of 
 incoming 
 wealth 
 to 
 simplicity 
 this 
 parameter 
 is 
 fixed 
 for 
 all 
 nodes 
 in 
 the 
 root 
 node 
 Because 
 rewards 
 are 
 passed 
 down 
 
 
 building 
 this 
 framework 
 is 
 to 
 ensure 
 that 
 if 
 a 
 particular

 What 
 we 
 need

 is

 Members of the Cardstack team have given a series of 
 talks on the Cardstack software architecture design 
 systems and project mission See for yourself how our 
 
 RESOURCES 
 
 views and our software have evolved since 2014 
 
 CARDSTACK TALKS & PRESENTATIONS 
 
 You can view our videos and slide shows under the Media tab at 
 cardstack com Here are some of the highlights 
 
 Cardstack Overview Chris Tse the founding director of the Cardstack 
 Project walks you through a series of animations that build up to the 
 information graphics included in this white paper He shows how the 
 concepts across technical design market and crypto economics are 
 connected to maximize the ongoing value creation in this new software 
 ecosystem 
 Cardstack Principles This talk is co presented by Chris Tse and Ed 
 Faulkner (Lead Developer of Cardstack) It presents the 10 core principles 
 of the Cardstack architecture and explains why we need to uphold and 
 embrace those principles which are derived from the open Web 
 architecture and open source ethos in order to create a successful 
 blockchain backed world that is an improvement on the centralized cloud 
 regimes This talk is technical in nature and recommended for those who 
 want to get a deeper understanding of the stack of Cardstack

 RESOURCES 
 
 Developers contribute to open source to do good 
 With Cardstack we hope that open source contributors 
 can do well economically too Lets get started 
 
 OPEN SOURCE CODE 
 
 Cardstack Hub Our core open source repository contains the key 
 components of Cardstack Hub as well as plug ins to various components 
 that connect the Cardstack driven experience to different data sources 
 running on the cloud or as blockchains 
 Cardstack UX Add ons The front end components of the cohesive user 
 experience are available for developers to use fork or enhance While the 
 Cardstack Hub infrastructure can be used stand alone with our UX 
 components we believe that successful market adoption of this 
 infrastructure will offer both a powerful (d)App integration and a 
 consistent polished on ramp for users 
 Cardstack Token This repository contains all the Solidity source code of 
 the Ethereum smart contract that governs the Cardstack ecosystem We 
 will release this codebase to the open source community after it has been 
 reviewed by multiple external security auditors to ensure that the 
 propagation of robust code incorporates the security best practices We 
 hope to collaborate with other blockchain developers so we can improve 
 on the features efficiency and security of Cardstack smart contracts
