IS CRYPTO CURRENCY ALL ABOUT Each Blockchain is associated with a cryptocurrency (also called a token) The most well known is the Bitcoin a currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 Today there are several hundred different digital currencies They all share the common trait of being a virtual means of exchange not based in any single state as opposed to the Dollar or the Euro They circulate via peerto peer networks based on cryptographic algorithms and are not necessarily intended as a payment system between users The number of units in circulation and the maximum money supply are defined in advance and visible to all Until proven otherwise cryptocurrency cannot be counterfeited or stolen It is possible today to define several separate families of cryptocurrency which are adapted to the objectives of the communities who use them \xe2\x96\xaa \xe2\x80\x9cInfrastructure\xe2\x80\x9d currency the type of currency likely to bring about the most profound changes whose ambition goes far beyond being a simple means of payment and which has the objective of offering a real alternative to the existing financial system Examples Ethereum NXT Ripple \xe2\x96\xaa \xe2\x80\x9cSocial\xe2\x80\x9d currency currency created to allow the easy exchange of small financial amounts between web users (\xe2\x80\x9csocial tipping\xe2\x80\x9d) on existing social networks in particular \xe2\x96\xaa Alternative currency broadly inspired by Bitcoin these currencies attempt via technical innovation to function either more easily more securely or more rapidly for example by reducing transaction verification times o Examples Litecoin Digibyte \xe2\x96\xaa Anonymous currency currency created solely to serve as a purely anonymous means of payment protecting both the user\xe2\x80\x99s identity as well as their transactions o Examples Monero Bytecoin\xe2\x80\xa6 BIONIC WHITEPAPER Copyrights \xc2\xa9 2018 3 \x0cBIONIC \xe2\x9e\xa2 BLOCKCHAIN The blockchain is a software innovation for establishing digital trust between users facilitating transactions of value over a network The blockchain enables trust to be distributed throughout a network without the need for a central intermediary to track verify and approve the digital exchange of value The notion of authorizing trust from a central intermediary currently underpins both private and government institutional structures however this is proving to be costly slow and also vulnerable to attack The blockchain overcomes these issues by operating as a decentralized distributed database maintaining a continuously growing list of records called blocks \xe2\x9e\xa2 Smart Contracts On chain computer code or Smart Contracts are computer protocols that facilitate verify and enforce the performance of a contract making a contractual clause unnecessary Smart contracts often emulate the logic of contractual clauses Smart contracts can exchange money property shares or anything of value in a transparent conflict free way while avoiding the services of a middleman Ordinarily a process would require payment to a middleman government agency bank lawyer or a notary and then a processing time before the receipt of goods or services However with smart contract technology it can all be automated Smart contract technology can be compared to an automated vending machine With a vending machine money is deposited into the machine and the desired item drops for collection if the correct amount is deposited In comparison with a smart contract the money is deposited into escrow on the blockchain for a receipt of a transfer of a token (e g a digital certificate of title for a house) which is instantaneously transferred into a counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s control once the conditions are met Smart contracts not only define the terms and conditions around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does but it also provides enforcement of those obligations BIONIC WHITEPAPER Copyrights \xc2\xa9 2018 4 \x0cBIONIC \xe2\x9e\xa2 WHY BLOCKCHAIN IT WAS ADOPTED FOR BIONIC BIONIC is built to operate on blockchain technology and it will be available on a blockchain BIONIC will be accessed as a DApp (Distributed Application) Our core reason of adopting blockchain technology in the development of BIONIC is to provide a decentralized infrastructure that is stable secure and completely scam free for all the involving parties This also helps in achieving our set goal of community based system which builds community spirit and make them the chief controller of the market environment These are the reasons why BIONIC (BNC) is built on blockchain technologies are i Third party interference It enables two participating parties to make a secured exchange without the oversight or intermediation of a third party therefore reducing or totally eliminating counterparty risk ii Empower the BIONIC community of users Users are in control of all their information and transactions therefore the market environment is totally determined by the community and not by one central entity iii Durability Reliability and Longevity Thanks to the decentralized networks blockchain does not have a central point of failure and is better able to withstand malicious attacks iv Clearness and immutability \xe2\x80\x93 Nothing hidden Any alterations made to public blockchains are viewable by all parties this creates transparency and all transactions are immutable this means that it cannot be altered or deleted BIONIC WHITEPAPER Copyrights \xc2\xa9 2018 5 \x0cBIONIC WHAT MAKES BIONIC UNIQUE BIONIC provides a secured platform for storing and processing digital transactions in a secure and transparent way \xe2\x80\x93 absolutely SCAM FREE Our system is based on the Ethereum blockchain application platform implemented by Private Instant Verified Transaction Our protocol does what Bitcoin cannot do it converts publicly viewable PIV into anonymous PIV therefore whenever users want to spend his/her token i e sending from User A to User the token will be received without history of where the PIV originated from BIONIC GOALS BIONIC is aimed at building a formidable and stable digital currency platform whereby the transactions between electronic companies can be simplified Electronic companies can buy any electronic device using BIONIC Creating new electronic market Simplify the financial transactions between electronic companies Make any electronic device able to buy using BIONIC Lead the electronic world market BIONIC WHITEPAPER
