 Chapter 1 Background of Project
 1 1 Market Demand and Prospect
 1 1 1 Size of Global Payment Industrial Market
 It is expected in the “2017 World Payment Report” (WPR 2017) that global digital payment transactions will grow by an average of 10 9% per year since now to 2020 with 726 billion transactions in 2020[2 The Report estimates that the volume of transactions in emerging economics will increase by 19 6% which is three times that of mature economies[3] For example the volume of transactions in Asia especially China and India the leading emerging markets is expected to increase by 30 9% It is estimated that from 2015 to 2020 CAGR of the volume of transactions of non cash wholesale business all over the world of large enterprises medium sized enterprises and public institutions has reached 6 5% with the volume of transactions exceeding 122 billion Capgemini a consulting service company and BNP Paribas jointly released a report that global digital payment will be up to USD 726 billion by 2020[5] 
 Figure 1 1 Global payment size
 Page 6 of 40
 From 2014 to 2015 global non cash business volume has increased by 11 2% to 433 1 billion transactions the largest increase in a decade The developing markets boosted this increase with a growth rate of 21 6% In 2015 the non cash transactions increased by 21 6% in developing countries while the developed countries only grew by 6 8%[7] With the rapid growth of cross border payment transactions the demand for cross border payment services in emerging countries such as Southeast Asia the Middle East and Africa is on the obvious rise 
 1 1 2 The Trend of Cross border Payment Industry
 In the past seven years the number of overseas visitors has increased And in 2016 this figure reached 1 235 billion an increase of 3 9%[8] This means that as the number increases the demand for global cross border payments will continue to rise 
 With the development of global economic integration more and more people are going abroad to work forming a huge demand for cross border exchange As a result there are more foreign workers in the developed countries year by year For example in Japan the number of foreign workers had reached 788 000 in 2014 What’s more this figure had increased to 908 000 by 2015 It is reported that more than 50% of foreign workers send money home twice a quarter or more 
 It is indicated by the study of KPMG in 2016 only 27% of 655 million households in Southeast Asia have accounts of financial institutions Robert B Zoellick (r ) the 11th president of the World Bank Group said “The economy of world’s poor people will increase by providing financial services to 2 5 billion people without accounts of financial institutions ”
 Technological advancement will drive cross border payments to move faster and more efficiently and future cross border payments will be easier faster and less expensive In order to realize this purpose the core is the unification of technological upgrades and payment standards The payment system is based on the account system of financial institutions and closely related to the local laws and regulations financial supervision system and credit system The expansion of cross border payment business will be affected by market differences But the blockchain and other new technologies are expected to change traditional payment methods which have been actively explored by traditional institutions and startups at present

 1 2 Industrial Pain Points and Solutions
 1 2 1 Industrial Pain Points
 Compared with the past information flow the current prosperous global payment ecology has made great progress However in the traditional centralized payment ecological operation system there are still dilemmas people are facing as follows 
  Residents in developing countries need to pay high cost to swap foreign exchange and make remittances to the foreign countries According to statistics of “2016 Remittance Service Survey” from Japan Fund Payment and Settlement Association 84 5% of customers are not satisfied with the high commission for overseas remittances[12] 
  When cross border payment is made people usually convert the local income into US dollars and then convert the US dollars into their home currency It takes 5 to 7 days to wait the conversion which may also produce a 5% 19% exchange balance during this period 
  Some regions of Asia and countries such as the Middle East and Africa have weak infrastructures especially their payment and settlement system and relevant laws and regulations For example they have no check settlement which results to slow payment of checks their ATM system is backward there is no integrity institution etc 
 1 2 2 Solutions of Blockchain
 Traditional cross border requires a large number of manual to carry out account checking operations but the financial institutions can only process transactions in batches within a limited hours per day However if the blockchain is available for cross border payment theoretically 7×24 uninterrupted services can be provided and it reduces the manual processing in the process and shortens the clearing and settlement time in addition it can reduce the cost of payment processing receiving financial operation and account checking and enhance the liquidity and financial profitability 
 As one of the fastest growing financial technologies in the financial industry the data blockchain is a support for virtual currency and is regarded as one of the most transformative innovations to date Essentially the data blockchain is a digital ledger that records data and merges them into “blocks” which are then securely encrypted and chronologically bound into a “chain” The ledgers are distributed across the various components of the network and all components must agree to certify the transaction Therefore the data blockchain is a form of distributed ledger which can eliminate the need for agency at runtime compared with traditional ledgers that are maintained by centralized organizations 
 Page 8 of 40
 Four major advantages of solutions of data blockchain payment transactions 
 High security Funds transfer data is recorded in a digitized ledger and cannot be modified or tampered once encrypted In this regard it keeps transaction information private and secure and reduces the risk of fraud 
 Shortening the turnover cycle After removing the payment agency and manual processing in the traditional payment transaction the transfer transaction based on the data blockchain technology can be directly carried out in the remittance financial institutions and the receiving financial institution which effectively reduces the processing time For example SFT based on NoFake’s blockchain technology is able to complete the remittance among international financial institutions in a few seconds 
 Improving transaction transparency With the removal of the transaction platforms of traditional mode the transaction flow between the payer and the receiver is more transparent and clear which make the tracking of the transaction more convenient 
 Reducing costs The digital ledger of blockchain technology is characterized as distribution which eliminates the need for centralized organizations (the transaction agency in the traditional mode) and manual treatment and in turn reduces costs 
 1 3 Conflicts between Blockchain and Cross border Payment Market
 When a technology is able to permeate to various industries and generate huge value in these industries we usually say that the technology will tremendously change human kinds In the past year blockchain an epoch making technology has attracted people’s attention and it is considered to be a technology that is most likely to bring about subversive changes 
 The core of the blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed Internet database technology solution In terms of its using process blockchain establishes a public ledger within a certain scope of the Internet which allows all participants to record and check the ledger so as to ensure the authentication and unrepeatability of the records of the processing information From a technical point of view in order to ensure the smooth implementation of blockchain technology the four technologies of P2P cryptography smart contract and consensus algorithms are indispensable The most important application of blockchain technology is the possibility of solving problems involving credit data security and reduction of costs 
 The blockchain + payment industry with the trustworthiness security and irresistible modification of the blockchain enables financial institutions individuals and enterprises around the world to achieve low cost secure and real time payment of funds In addition through blockchain technology more payment data is liberated and thus the payment data massively grows which gives the global payment market huge opportunities and then vigorously promotes another revolutionary drastic change in the global payment market

 Figure 3 1 SFT payment and settlement system
 3 2 Information Track
 The distributed function of blockchain protects the integrity of the data by building a distributed database system and a consensus agreement between the parties of the payment The blockchain timestamp function forms unforgeable data by generating information blocks of a certain period of time and the data links connected between the blocks Each payment participant should be time stamped when he is distributing blocks so that he can prove the authenticity and ownership of the payment which is favorable for protecting the privacy of the payment transactions 
 Through the use of distributed ledgers SFT can provide deposit evidence of payment transaction data support the evidence of payment transaction behavior and record the behavior tracks of a lot of payment transaction information That is the data request data matching data retrieval data use etc of each payment transaction are recorded in the ledger forming a record of the whole process of the data to ensure the security reliability and confidentiality of payment transaction data For example the design of SFT abnormal payment transaction behavior monitoring and analysis system and the use of compliance method to monitor the transactions on distributed ledgers are helpful for tracking various payment behavior trajectories and carrying out anti money laundering and anti fraud 
 Page 14 of 40
 3 3 Honest Mechanism
 The blockchain technology can help solve more synergistic problems with payment transactions SFT provides a platform based trust service that replaces the middle person trust that was previously costly The SFT honest mechanism constructs a distributed payment integrity mechanism that cooperates with the problems of all parties in the transaction under an integrated agreement system integrates distributed multidimensional entity authentication systems and various blockchain system and information system includes identity authentication and information exchange agreement provides open basic module of distributed application scenarios achieves distributed peer to peer honest system and builds a distributed honest basic system of cross chain cross system cross industry cross application and cross terminal 
 On the basis of distribution and data SFT honest mechanism proposes further development of ecology and application extending the application of trust to more dimensions from entity authentication to data exchange and from the distributed transactions to distributed reputation The SFT honest mechanism combines the distributed ledger system of the bottom level blockchain and cooperates with various services partners to provide diversified trust services in different countries regions and fields forming a part of a new generation of global trust network infrastructure 
 3 4 Ecological Open System
 The future will be a huge multi chain coexistence value network era In this value network the wider the distribution of valid network the greater the value stack that can be generated Therefore SFT is required to create itself to a free and open ecosystem for all users enterprises and merchants who can freely pay for their transactions through the platform 
 SFT ecological open system takes users as the core and create an ecological open system with multiple portals multiple platforms multiple channels multiple industries multiple fields and diversified driving consumption Relying on a strong ecosystem SFT is expected to open up users needs entries online and offline channels and merchants making it a truly complete and open global cross border payment ecosystem 
  Multiple portals rich payment and consumption scenarios drive the payment 
  Multiple channels integrating online and offline channels 
  Multiple industries various merchants and products including diversified products and markets

 Chapter 4 Application Scenario and Future Value
 4 1 Application Scenario
 At present the peer to peer value transmission of blockchain subverts people’s imagination of the Internet and the application of blockchain has extended to all areas of society Currently the most mature areas of SFT are cross border payment (individuals/ enterprises) financial areas (trading finance digital currency financial derivatives credit and loans risk control etc ) and payment of cross border e commerce platform 
 With the operation and development of SFT its applications at other industries such as Internet of Things medical beauty pension eco tourism sharing economy and the like also develop In the future the application of SFT blockchain will penetrate into all aspects of society and there are also a wide range of application scenarios in economic financial and social systems 
 4 2 Future Value
 According to World Bank statistics the scale of global cross border payment has grown at an average rate of 5% annually It reached USD 601 billion in 2016 However current cross border remittance is extremely high with the commission rate of per remitter being 7 68% on average The main cost comes from the remittance fee of financial institutions and telegraph fee of SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecom) 
 In addition according to a report released by Santander Spain’s largest bank if blockchain technology is used internally by financial institutions around the world around 2020 it will save costs about USD 20 billion a year Such data is sufficient to show that “blockchain” combines with the tremendous breakthroughs brought about by the traditional financial sector 
 SFT which combines payment finance with blockchain technology shows its most obvious advantage of the payment and settlement field in the cross border payment field To be specific it can not only reduce the cost among financial institutions and improve the treatment speed and efficiency of payment business but also open up room for development of “small cross border payment” that did not meet the actual condition What’s more the use of digital wallet can change the payment of SFT and cost of cross border remittance into zero So far digital wallet offers new settlement system for small payment as well as financial institutions Furthermore some emerging organizations that are based on distributed ledgers also depend on the public blockchain operational system Although system operating causes costs there is no
 Page 16 of 40
 additional cost of cross border remittance or small payment by means of the powerful computing capacity of blockchain Not only that SFT based on NoFake blockchain technology SFT is preponderant in the speed into one’s account of payment Accurately speaking it takes only a few seconds to complete an international financial institution’s remittance And the operation can be done on the mobile app 
 In the future SFT will cover dozens of countries including countries in Southeast Asia the Middle East Africa Japan Singapore etc containing more than one billion users tens of millions of merchants (or enterprises) with large application value 
 Chapter 5 SFT Blockchain Technology Scheme
 5 1 Application of NoFake Blockchain Technology
 Adopting NoFake blockchain technology SFT sets up blockchain infrastructure and opens up API interfaces so as to connect and share with other enterprises and institutions commonly promote the development of global cross border payment market and create the win win ecology of SFT cross border payment blockchain 
 Figure 5 1 NoFake blockchain technology solutions
 Page 17 of 40
 5 2 Overview of SFT Basic Structure
 The basic structure of blockchian can be simply divided into core service smart contract and blockchain infrastructure 
 Figure 5 2 NoFake blockchain technology solutions
  Core service refers to products that ordinary people can use directly including mobile APP Web smart devices etc 
  Smart contract refers to “programmable contract” or “comtract intelligence” where “smart” is the intelligence of execution that is to say when a certain condition is met the contract is automatically executed such as automatic transaction automatic payment etc 
  Blockchain infrastructures mainly include distributed algorithms cryptographic signatures data storage technology etc a total of four aspects 
 In the logic of SFT system architecture due to the combination of blockchain and features of payment industry the overall logic of its design also combines the relevant characteristics of the blockchain industry SFT’s infrastructures chiefly include storage layer transmission layer consensus layer virtual machine and interface The specific contents are shown as following Figure 5 3 
 Figure 5 3 SFT’s infrastructures map
 Page 18 of 40
 Page 19 of 40
 5 2 1 Interface
 In order to facilitate the connection of business SFT system provides independent API application development interface which externally shows the business function provided by SFT system in the form of RESTful API In this regard the enterprise customers can quickly access SFT system and integrate with other systems in the companies At present SFT API interface is available for docking mobile APPs DAPP Web and other extended APPs 
 5 2 2 Virtual Machine
 The virtual machine supports programmable technologies such as smart contract At present SFT system adopts mainstream virtual machine mechanism in the support of the chain business Currently it supports the EVM virtual machine compatible with Ethereum The EVM virtual machine can directly deploy and run solidity smart contract The Solidity based on Ethereum is a good language choice for blockchain applications It is a fully deterministic programming language rather than some other factors and supportable for programmable technologies such as smart contract specifically including Java C++ Python and Go In addition we will actively develop other virtual machines that are closer to financial grade applications to facilitate rapid development/ customization of business logic on the chain 
 5 2 3 Consensus Layer
 The consensus layer mainly refers to consensus calculation At present most of the current blockchain applications choose the consensus algorithm based on PBFT algorithm And SFT blockchain project mainly takes advantage of NoFake NoFake chain PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm and NFFT (NoFake Fault Tolerance) algorithm 
 NoFake chain NFFT (NoFake Fault Tolerance) consensus algorithm is improved by the Paxos algorithm and pays more attention to the intelligibility and grounding of the protocol The specificity is that there is at most one legal leader at any time with the number of fault tolerant nodes is N/2 1 NoFake chain NFFT consensus algorithm is a simplified implementation of the Paxos algorithm so its complance supervision performance resource consumption and fault tolerance are similar to Paxos NoFake chain NFFT consensus algorithm can be applied to the coalition chain so it is more effective than Paxos and PBFT algorithms However the industry will be able to apply the NoFake NFFT consensus algorithm to the blockchain mainly to elect a consensus node and keep billing by nodes But the biggest disadvantage of the scheme is that it cannot prevent Byzantine nodes A Byzantine leader node with a strong network configuration will bring a devastating blow to the consensus of the NFFT algorithm Since the nodes in the coalition are all subject to strict approval and the provider is an economically ecological entity and a stakeholder there will no cheat node Even with the cheat node the entire blockchain system is able to respond rapidly to take punishment measures 
 Page 20 of 40
 The PBFT algorithm (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) widely used in the industry means Byzantine Fault Tolerance which is more advanced For example some reliable nodes are called verifiers who have the opportunity to become leaders In the process of generating blockchain a new verifer will default to be the leader of the round who is responsible for packaging new block and broadcasts the block that he thinks is reasonable to all the verifers The new block will be recognized after two rounds of votes being confirmed by more than 2/3 of all verifiers This consensus method greatly increases the speed of choosing blocks What’s more these blocks can be continuously produced as long as less than 1/3 of the verifiers are guaranteed to be not Byzantine nodes 
 It is undeniable that the Byzantine node fault tolerant nodes used by PBFT is able to ensure the network security of less than 1/3 of Byzantine nodes However in practical applications especially when it comes to economic interests even if the verifier is a reliable node that has been selected we cannot rely solely on one third of the security without a penalty mechanism In order to prevent from faults we must guarantee that these verifiers will be persuaded quickly after being rewarded and be punished quickly after being fined and the award and punishment must be directly related to economic interests Therefore we have modified the original consensus mechanism so that the power of the verifiers’ vote corresponds to the digital asset equity of the chain that is mortgaged 
 As a result more than two thirds of the voters were required to confirm that the mechanism for generating blocks was modified to more than two thirds of the total equity In addition in the PBFT consensus algorithm the ordinary node only synchronizes the new block sent from the leader node and does not participate in the consensus And the security of consensus algorithm only depends on the number of verification nodes As a result the growth of the number of ordinary nodes cannot improve the security of Byzantine fault tolerance New consensus mechanism increases the participation of non verification nodes A verification node corresponds to a verifier’s account and a non verifier can entrust its interests to verifier so that it can authorize the verifier to vote in order to earn its own interests Because of the relationship of interests the non verifier will carefully choose the proxy verifier so that everyone is involved in the consensus and there is no defect that all nodes participate in the consensus and the efficiency is reduced

 Figure 5 4 SFT adopts NoFake PBFT consensus mechanism
 5 2 4 Transmission Layer
 A P2P network refers to a peer to peer network that performs task assignment and workload among networking nodes The nodes have the same status the same function and no differentiation between priority and others Because there is no central node each node is both a requester and responder for the service There are a lot of resources stored so the failure of some nodes does not affect the opeation of the whole network 
 The P2P network is a natural distributed and decentralized network for information storage and query and standard solution of blockchain network layer The data synchronization status updating and massage broadcasting of the blockchain network are all carried out through the P2P network Mojorityof blockchain P2P is favorable for minor improvement of the existing P2P network so as to accommodate the characteristics of the blockchain itself 
 SFT’s P2P blockchain network consists of two parts network discovery module and data transmission module 
 1 Network Discovery Module
 The network discovery module mainly include following four methods ping/pong/findNode/sendNeighbours 
  ping/pong are used for node discovery 
  findNode is used for querying nearby nodes 
  sendNeighbours is used to return nearby nodes and the details of network discovery refer to the Kademlia protocol 
 Page 22 of 40
 The overall structure is a binary tree with each node a leaf node of the binary tree The leaf node is a 256 bit binary value calculated by a 512 bit public key The distance between two leaf nodes is obtained by XORing of the leaf nodes Each node has a routing table of 32 buckets And table has stored from near to far the nodes that have been discovered and each bucket stores up to 16 nodes 
 Figure 5 5 Network discovery module
 When node A joins the network it obtains the initial routing table firstly through external mechanism A sends a ping message to the node B closest to itself in the routing table and there is a node B it will return pong message to A A sends a request of find Node for B to query the nearby nodes and B returns 16 nodes that are nearest to B from its own routing table Among the returned nodes if there is C is closer to A than B then A will sent ping request for C And above steps will be repeated until a node closer to A is found (see Figure 5 5) In a network with 2^n nodes then it takes up to n times to find the list of nodes closest to A 
 2 Data Transmission Module
 The data transmission module is responsible for data exchange with the discovered nodes The A node sends a hi message to the B node defining the rules for data interaction between each other Later they exchange the encrypted data through send and receive After the data is obtained it is decrypted and then stored in the local database 
 When a node needs to broadcast a message it takes out nearby nodes and sends a message to nearby nodes who will find that this is a broadcasting message and sends it to other nearby nodes until it is transmitted throughout the network 
 Page 23 of 40
 5 2 5 Storage Layer
 The blockchain is a decentralized database as well as distributed storage database and chained storage database The original blockchain is a decentralized database which contains a list that called block that are continuously growing and aligned Each block includes a timestample so that it can link with the previous block The design of blockchain makes the data untamperable that is once the data is recorded it will be irreversible in the block 
 SFT adopts IPFS (a peer to peer distributed hypermedia distribution protocol that connects all computing devices with the same document management mode) and perfectly cooperates with blockchain The users can use IPFS to process large amounts of data and store the corresponding cryptographic hash in the blockchain and time stamp it In this regard it is unnecessary to put the data itself on the chain which can not only save the network broadband of the blockchain but also effectively protect it Regarding the security of files on the one hand the files can be encrypted and then stored them in IPFS and on the other hand we can take advantage of IPFS to achieve distributed file sharing 
 5 3 Safety of Smart Contract
 A smart contract is essentially a piece of code that runs in a blockchain network and cannot be modified after it is released If a serious vulnerability is discovered after the release only we can do is to redeploy a new contract which obviously is costly Moreover once a smart contract has hoophole it is also vulnerable to be attacked by hackers causing irreparable damage Therefore before the release of smart contract it is not only necessary to audit the code through a third party but also the team should test the code to improve the security of the smart contract during the development process 
 The SFT team should test the contents of the smart contract as shown in Figure 5 1

 5 4 Safety of Mobile Wallet
 In 2014 Mt Gox the world’s largest bitcoin exchange was hacked and more than 850 000 bitcoins were stolen which directly led to the bankruptcy of the company At that time these bitcoins value more than USD 450 million On April 23 2018 BEC (US chain) broke the ERC20 protocol security vulnerability The attacker used the integer overflow BUG to generate tokens indefinitely which directly caused the BEC currency value to dive to almost zero 
 In summary as a bottom level platform for value circulation security is the top priority of the blockchain and also one of the cornerstones that the blockchain can be widely accepted by society To this end SFT will set up security testing group to sort out the common security question list of wallet system in the industry and conduct security audits of the released mobile wallet etc so as to enhance the reliability of the wallet system and reduce the risk of mobile wallet risks 
 The testing contents of the security testing group are as follows
