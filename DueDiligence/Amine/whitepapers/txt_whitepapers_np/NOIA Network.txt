b A Blockchain backed Inter Provider Segment Routing WAN v1 3 A Blockchain backed Internet Segment Routing WAN (SR WAN) Whitepaper by NOIA Network William B Norton wbn@noia network Jonas Simanavicius jonas@noia network than 20%1 These types of latency anomalies appeared almost every day (see graph in Figure 1 for an example) Abstract\xe2\x80\x94 Barely a day goes by without a news report of some Internet infrastructure failure that impacted end users across the Internet There is often nothing affected users can do but wait for the storm to pass and resume when connectivity is restored Segment Routing has emerged from the IETF as a source routing RFC that can force network traffic to and then through a pre defined sequence of relays called segment routers Each segment router replaces the destination address with the address of the next segment to visit on towards the destination This enables end systems to force traffic along a network path that bypasses areas of network degradation Figure 1 Example of latency anomalies common on the Internet Research with the cloud network operators identified the cause of this variability to be a MPLS traffic engineering technique called \xe2\x80\x9cauto optimization \xe2\x80\x9d This is a router configuration instructing the MPLS underlayment to balance the router load evenly across the underlying transport links When end system traffic traverses these paths the latency can vary by up to 100ms for minutes or hours This variability of course is detrimental to latency sensitive applications but also leads to variability in connection time and effective thruput This paper is divided into two halves The first half presents a model for an inter provider public Segment Routing WAN (SR WAN) that provides hosts (Mac PC Linux) with additional paths through the Internet This is done using segment routing across network paths shared by the others connected to the SR WAN Blockchain is used as the distributed ledger for providers and consumers of spare compute and bandwidth The second half of the paper focuses on private SR WANs with commercially operated segment routers operating in well connected Internet colocation centers Both the public and the private SR WANs share a common distributed database of segments available for use or purchase Internet performance variability also comes from the Internet inter domain routing system The Internet Society reported 14 000 routing outages leaks and hijacks in 2017 Most recently (June 2019) Allegheny Technologies Inc a metals manufacturer misconfigured its router leading to widespread partial and complete Internet connectivity failures 1 INTERNET VARIABILITY The public Internet is composed of autonomous Internet Service Providers (ISPs) interconnected in arms length distance relationships called \xe2\x80\x9cInternet Transit\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cInternet Peering \xe2\x80\x9d Both of these relationships provide connectivity to the public Internet or portions of it respectively Importantly packets are exchanged between these networks without consideration of the quality of the network paths enabled As a result routers will blindly forward traffic across lossy congested links All three of these examples led to Internet end users routinely experience periods of poor performance for minutes or hours When connectivity is lost or crippled there is no general recourse but to complain to your provider and wait for the connectivity to recover accepting that the public Internet has periods of intermittent network degradation Until now Beyond occasional packet loss the public Internet is increasingly experiences latency fluctuations To illustrate one of the authors conducted inter cloud measurements between 25 cloud instances across the AWS Google and Azure clouds in 2017 This study quantified the variability in packet delivery between the clouds spotlighting latencies that deviated from the median latency measurement by more 2 A PUBLIC SEGMENT ROUTING SYSTEM A public segment routing system brings the wisdom of crowds and a technology called \xe2\x80\x9cSegment Routing\xe2\x80\x9d to the public Internet The Segment Routing WAN (SR WAN) continually measures and enumerates a list of alternative 1 https //www linkedin com/pulse/internet service providedcloud premium william b norton/ 1 \x0cA Blockchain backed Inter Provider Segment Routing WAN v1 3 The docker provides an isolated environment for the segment routing software and supporting systems network paths through the public Internet using segment routers operated by the SR WAN community of users This \xe2\x80\x9csharing economy\xe2\x80\x9d model enables connectivity for partially isolated users to leverage the better connectivity of other users Network traffic is relayed through a path of participating segment routers (called a \xe2\x80\x9cSegment Router Path \xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cSRPath\xe2\x80\x9d) 2 2 2 The SR WAN Controller The SR WAN controller kick starts off the segment routing system with the assignment of segment routers into segment router groups The block chain provides accounting for the community rewarding utility tokens to those who relay the traffic for others which can be applied when connectivity is problematic for the segment router operator Segment router groups scale to up to 100 One segment router in each group periodically communicates the group\xe2\x80\x99s collective network state to the controller 2 1 Overview The nodes of the SR WAN operate segment routers In the public SR WAN the segment router is software (opensource virtual router that runs in a container on your host ) The controller converts the performance matrices into a database of available network segments and their recently measured network performance characteristics This authoritative decentralized database is called the Distributed Transit Exchange (DITEX) Each segment router packet contains the addresses of segment routers to visit before delivering the packet to the final destination This source routing system \xe2\x80\x9droutes around\xe2\x80\x9d congested paths as shown in Figure 2 2 2 3 Segment Router Pulse All segment routers are assigned to groups that \xe2\x80\x9cpulse\xe2\x80\x9d one another with their state information This accomplishes two things First it provides the payload to measure one way latency between all segment routers in the group Secondly each segment router can then construct a full matrix of one way latency measurements which can be used to determine if there is a better path towards the destination through the segment router system Note that round trip measurements (i e ping) are too inaccurate as they conflate the performance of two distinct network paths and are therefore not an accurate reflection of the performance of packets directed one way through the segment routing system Figure 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Routing Internet traffic around a congested path Much like MPLS is called a network underlayment acting as \xe2\x80\x9cLayer 2 5 \xe2\x80\x9d the SR WAN can be thought of as a network veneer acting as \xe2\x80\x9cLayer 3 5 \xe2\x80\x9d Both plug into routers and apply hardware to optimize either utilization of links or utilization of transit bandwidth respectively 2 2 3 To match the destination addresses to nearby segment routers for ingress and egress the segment routers and destination addresses are tagged to a geolocation ASN tuple This enables an Internet packet to be directed to an appropriate egress segment router when the SR WAN provides a better performing path 2 2 Components of the Public SR WAN System There are five main elements to the public SR WAN system 2 2 1 First and Last Hops Ingress/Egress Segment Router When an egress router receives the segment routing packet it forwards the original packet on to the destination During each transfer each segment router calculates the one way latency and thruput observed through the segment routing path This path is called an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary path\xe2\x80\x9d and becomes part of the state information propagated across the group This also allows the system to autonomously compare the calculated latency expected against the actual latency Traffic enters the segment routing system via an \xe2\x80\x9cIngress Segment Router\xe2\x80\x9d and sent out to the final destination via an \xe2\x80\x9cEgress Segment Router \xe2\x80\x9d For the purposes of this part of the paper a \xe2\x80\x9csegment router\xe2\x80\x9d refers collectively to the segment router and support systems running in a docker on your host (PC Mac Linux) Figure 3 Public SR WAN Segment Router on the host 2 \x0cA Blockchain backed Inter Provider Segment Routing WAN v1 3 The validators (Master Nodes) earn tokens for validating transactions in the DITEX There are two sources of tokens for rewarding validators First every transaction on the ledger generates a small transaction fee This transaction fee pool is also subsidized systematically for the first three years Transaction fees are allocated to a validator pool (25%) and a dividend pool (75%) Figure 4 The SR WAN Controller assimilates segment performance measurements The DITEX holds the SR WAN segment state and supports several uses First the DITEX provides data for group assignment Secondly the DITEX provides some network accounting data for validators and for smart contracts Thirdly the DITEX holds the data for path performance validation to identify \xe2\x80\x9cbad actor\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpoor performer\xe2\x80\x9d segment routers and quarantine them into groups Fourth the DITEX provides the global perspective required to optimize inter group traffic across the global SR WAN ecosystem Figure 6 Transaction Fees allocation The dividend pool is rewarded to the top voted NOIA wallets This approach provides an incentive for large token holders to get and share dividend yields while maintaining a healthy token velocity Coin holders can \xe2\x80\x9cvote\xe2\x80\x9d their coins with others to form groups to increase their chances of being part of one of the reward wallets and receive a portion of the dividend pool These \xe2\x80\x9cvotes\xe2\x80\x9d have no impact on the holders\xe2\x80\x99 wallet but rather provide a means for smaller wallets to participate in the dividend pool reward 2 2 5 Blockchain For reference please see the NOIA Paper \xe2\x80\x9cEconomics of Decentralized Internet Transit Exchange Utilization of Transit Capacity \xe2\x80\x9d Blockchain is the distributed ledger technology used to settle between suppliers and consumers of the collective resources of the SR WAN Utility tokens (aka \xe2\x80\x9cNOIA coins\xe2\x80\x9d) are earned for traffic relayed for others and utilized when they themselves wish to utilize the SR WAN (i e its default Internet path is congested ) 2 3 The Public SR WAN Supports the Sharing Economy There are many concepts such as collaborative consumption peer to peer markets (i e BitTorrent) and access based consumption (i e airBnB) which can all be put under the umbrella term of sharing economy The public SR WAN brings forward a new example of a sharing economy that satisfies all seven criteria enumerated by Hawlitchek et al 2 Network data is continuously collected by the segment router and presented to the controller in the form of a \xe2\x80\x98ticket\xe2\x80\x99 along with group statistics Validators verify the network statistics that accompany the claim for reward and add the transaction to the blockchain so coins are transferred to the NOIA wallet of the bandwidth supplier as shown in Figure 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 Increasing utilization rates The Internet has spare capacity Peer to peer principle Transactions are between buyer and seller Existence of reimbursement Coins are rewarded for use of resources No transfer of ownership The resource is used and then is available for others Resource tangibility To participate one shares part of their computer The location of that computer makes it more or less attractive to the community of users Leveraging of information systems Machine learning systems are applied to the data to optimize 2 Florian Hawlitschek Benedikt Notheisen and Timm Teubner The limits of trust free systems A literature review on blockchain technology and trust in the sharing economy Electronic commerce research and applications 29 50\xe2\x80\x9363 2018 Figure 5 Blockchain and Segment Routing System 3 \x0cA Blockchain backed Inter Provider Segment Routing WAN v1 3 7 the routing system and settlement is done via modern block chain Temporariness Access to infrastructure is granted for the short period of time 3 3 Detection Most of the time the system operates in pass through mode forwarding traffic on to the default gateway The system looks up the geolocation ISP tuple to find the best egress segment router for target destinations A list of alternative routes is calculated and compared to default Internet routing performance The public SR WAN demonstrates all of these characteristics and so meets the definition of a sharing economy Network segments provided by a segment router are the commodities with intrinsic value the seller grants access and the buyer consumes the resource after which the buyer and seller settle with blockchain 3 4 Reroute through the Public SR WAN When congestion is detected in the form of packet loss or latency variance etc a segment router packet is constructed with the original packet as payload and with the segment routers to visit listed in the segment router packet 3 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SR WAN SEGMENT ROUTER This segment router packet is sent to the first segment router in the path Every router along the path forwards to the next segment router hop Along the path each segment router counts the amount of traffic sent and received by each other segment router To illustrate the system let\xe2\x80\x99s follow the money for a 1GB use Assume each NOIA coin has a nominal price of $0 05 USD Further assume that the cost to relay traffic through the public SR WAN is $0 50 per GB Each segment router earns a share of the $0 50 proportionate to the number of relays in the path3 as shown in Figure 7 3 5 Delivery of original packet to the destination When the egress router receives the packet it unpacks the original packet and sends it onto the destination Note that this packet originated elsewhere in the Internet so may be filtered by ISPs implementing BCP 38 A variety of techniques can be used to address this 3 5 Blockchain settlement After relaying 1GB each segment router sends a claim \xe2\x80\x98ticket\xe2\x80\x99 to the controller with its state (including counter values like bootTime totalTrafficIn totalTrafficOut and InOctets/OutOctets from each segment router) Validators review the group accounting data and transfer the coins from consumer\xe2\x80\x99s escrow to the provider\xe2\x80\x99s NOIA wallet The egress router also stores the performance statistics of these \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional paths\xe2\x80\x9d as part of its state Each segment router provides a portal (Web page) to provide feedback to the operator such as coins earned coins applied and traffic relayed The dashboard also shows a live latency matrix of the SR WAN from the perspective of the operator segment router Figure 7 Segment Routers earn tokens to the proportion of their participation in the path After the software is downloaded and installed in the docker there are six interactions For most users the SR WAN is a set it and forget it docker appliance By participation they earn the right to use the segment router paths of others NOIA Coins/Tokens ensure fair sharing 3 1 Initialization The segment router connects to the controller to receive its configuration (including geolocation ISP tuple) and its group number Coins are deposited in escrow for use when traffic is sent to the SR WAN 4 SR WAN INCENTIVES 3 2 Pulse Each segment router periodically (every 10 seconds for example) pulses their state information to all others in the group so every member of the group knows each other\xe2\x80\x99s geolocation ISP and one way latency for traffic sent to them This full matrix enables each segment router to calculate aggregate path latency that can be compared against the default Internet path latency This public SR WAN provides three powerful incentives 1 It encourage operators to leave their segment routers running all the time to garner more coin 2 It supports good networks Segment routers on good networks attract more packets to relay and therefore earn more coin 3 Its value grows as the network grows As the network grows the number and diversity of quality paths increases and therefore increases the value derived by the community 3 The allocation formula is a bit more complicated than this each node earns proportionate to how many segment routers are in the path modulo a piece allocated to the operation of the shared infrastructure 4 \x0cA Blockchain backed Inter Provider Segment Routing WAN v1 3 5 SR WAN LEVERAGES MARKET FORCES segment routing in hardware While the public SR WAN virtual router only leverages a small subset of features documented in the specifications the marketing and technical support from major hardware vendors improves the chances of broader adoption of segment routing systems such as this The SR WAN leverages several current market forces 5 1 Universality of fixed price Internet Transit Internet Transit provides connectivity to any endpoint on the Internet The SR WAN leverages this fact to reach the segment routers on other Internet transit services 5 6 The First Mover Advantage The SR WAN demonstrates network externality properties the value of the SR WAN is proportional to the number of nodes in the network and the quality of the paths they bring Therefore late entrants into the market will have to compete for users against an established and growing network that is generating coins of increasing value for them This provides a sustainable competitive advantage for the first SR WAN with a critical mass of segment routers Since these services imbue customers with a fixed price for all the Internet traffic they can consume or produce (up to a limit) there is no additional cost to participate in the SR WAN Participation in the SR WAN utilizes spare compute and bandwidth And since the price of Internet Transit historically drops every year from about 20 30%4 the cost of participation in the SR WAN is expected to drop every year 5 2 Acceptance of open source distributed systems software The world is shifting to open source In particular the popularity and acceptance of open source software today facilitates the acceptance of distributed systems such as this Containers provide isolation between the client environment and the segment router Frameworks like NodeJS ease the development of distributed systems Express externalizes instrumentation as web pages and RESTful APIs All of these open source components are widely accepted and deployed today providing the project with production ready off the shelf building blocks to build a cooperative networked system 8 SR WAN USE CASES There are several use cases envisioned for the SR WAN 8 1 Route Around Congestion This is the normative case On the public Internet routers continue to send traffic along a congested path shown in red in Figure 8 5 3 Desire to participate in Crypto Currency The rise in Bitcoin value to over $13 0005 in 2019 has propelled cryptocurrency into the limelight and fueled speculative investment into digital assets This SR WAN automatically rewards NOIA coins for participation in the network so provides a free and easy way to participate in the cryptocurrency market system One can simply run some code and obtain crypto currency in return While not the intent of the system we acknowledge this strong allure 5 4 Machine Learning is now accessible and applicable The SR WAN generates real time network segment performance data that enables machine learning systems to identify patterns in the data for use in dynamic routing Machine learning is utilized to automatically identify trends and optimally group to shift collectives of traffic along better segment routed paths dynamically Figure 8 Detection and bypassing congested network paths 5 5 Emergence of Segment Routing from the IETF About a dozen draft and full standards surrounding segment routing have emerged from the IETF driven largely by Cisco Systems Cisco enables routers to execute As described earlier the SR WAN paths are constantly being compared and the SR WAN path is used when better When the regular Internet path returns to normalcy the default Internet path is once again preferred 8 2 Buy cheap network bandwidth but use a better network Since the Internet transit service provides access to any attached Internet device there is nothing stopping one from simply forcing all of their traffic to a segment router sitting on an empirically better network This traffic will be received by the segment router on the premium network and 4 https //drpeering net/FAQ/What are the historical transitpricing trends php 5 https //www google com/search q=price+of+bitcoin&rlz=1

the premium network path Additional segments and paths can be listed on the DITEX with coin premiums associated with them For example commercial operators can sell premium segments with automated smart contracts The blockchain is used for settlement between the buyer and seller with a micro transaction fee allocated to the DITEX operations 8 3 A Cost Effective Intranet A cost competitive alternative to MPLS can be constructed for small and medium sized businesses over other peoples segment routers This could deliver encrypted network segments between offices Since Internet transit is always dropping in price one can construct a private network solution at a fraction of the cost of current MPLS solutions and the costs are expected to drop 20% 30% per year from there 9 10 1 Use case Monetize spare capacity To illustrate a DITEX premium bandwidth use case consider the Spread Network link between Chicago and New York Spread Networks spent a lot of money to tunnel through the mountains to build a fiber path with the lowest possible latency This exceptionally low latency path is expensive to lease but is critical for automated trading during business hours The demand curve for this circuit is shown in the graph highlighting six hours of unused capacity before and after the workday Improve Security Control and Visibility The future of cyber security is adaptive and responsive something the SR WAN is particularly well suited to do State sponsored cyber attacks leverage automated attack systems so detection mitigation and data collection systems must be automated as well The SR WAN system provides greater control and visibility than sending traffic over the public Internet alone Control The SR WAN is driven by a constant flow of performance data fed into an AI/machine learning system This system dynamically re groups segment routers based empirically on network performance reported by the receiving routers This enables the re routing of traffic dynamically based on current measurements and training models This data collection and feedback mechanism enables the controller to adjust groupings based on measured one way latency between ingress and egress systems Figure 9 Off hours bandwidth available and monetized as network segments Visibility Each segment router provides the operator with visibility into the segment routing paths available The segment routing instrumentation is a constantly updated web page run from within the segment router docker Here the system shows uptime coins earned the traffic relayed and a matrix of real time performance data This off hours capacity can be monetized by simply running segment routers on either side of the link and listing them on the DITEX With its empirically measured lower latency this link will attract traffic and its operator will receive coins for its use during those off hours The listing of the bandwidth can be anonymous and can be time delineated so there is no market cannibalization or impact on mostfavored nation termed contracts The matrix provides users with current network state as seen by the segment router highlighting paths where improved traffic performance brings opportunities for better connectivity 10 2 Use case Network as a Service Setting up a traditional network is both time and capital intensive Shifting from networking physical routers to networking virtual routers only gets you half way there The DITEX provides the missing piece the directory of available resources that can be stitched together to create virtual network required Since this virtual network rides on top of the Internet it has maximal reach Since it rides on the Internet it also inherits the path diversity across many networks 10 DITEX PREMIUM BANDWIDTH USE CASES \xe2\x80\x9cThe most powerful asset in the digital age is data6 \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Don Tascott As introduced earlier the Distributed Internet Transit Exchange (DITEX) holds the repository of available network segments and their performance characteristics prepopulated from the segments available on the public SRWAN 10 3 Use case Purchase Better Internet On Demand Some enterprises may want to leverage the path diversity during times of crisis but not forward segment routing 6 \xe2\x80\x9cHow the blockchain is changing money and business \xe2\x80\x9d TEDSummit June 2016 6 \x0cA Blockchain backed Inter Provider Segment Routing WAN v1 3 traffic on behalf of others The DITEX enables the purchase of coins for use if and when the segment routing path is used This mode of operation is implemented by setting the price of the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s segment links to infinity in the DITEX This will in effect make these segments unavailable for others to use but still allow it to participate in the latency measurements so it knows when the SR WAN provides an empirically better path This configuration will generate no coins for the enterprise but still allow the enterprise to participate in the group pulse and engage better paths with purchased coins when desired 11 A PRIVATE SEGMENT ROUTING WAN The Private Segment Routing WAN (Private SR WAN) leverages the same technology as the public SR WAN but utilizes professionally operated segment routers in native IPv6 Segment Routers (SRv6) collocated in well populated Internet colocation centers The operators of the infrastructure purchase Internet Transit from ISPs that have peering with the regional eyeball networks to produce the lowest latency paths While these deployments are expensive the performance characteristics are perfect for emerging latency sensitive and business critical edge applications A single regional deployment can provide direct reach to 80% of the market within 25ms This brings premium performance segments into the DITEX Deployments will match the eight interconnection regions across the U S Seattle Bay Area Los Angeles Chicago Dallas Ashburn Newark and Atlanta as shown in Figure 10 Figure 11 Proposed European Deployments (reach 80% of market within 25ms) Each deployment also leverages market competition for transit Historically transit is 10 20% cheaper in a popular colocation center as compared with a corporate data center Since the colocation centers house the transit providers core routers the segment router operator is really only depending on and paying for its Internet traffic to travel across a single router backplane Each professional deployment provides multi homed segment routers This brings a richer selection of paths than the average public SR WAN has access to Peering at the dominant IXP enables peering for additional direct reach It is important to note that the cost of Internet transit services is borne by the segment router operator There are usually volume discounts and minimum traffic volume commitments with Internet Transit purchases so the professional operator will have spare capacity if they fail to meet their traffic commitments In this case the operator has purchased spare capacity and is compensated in NOIA coins While NOIA is prepared to roll out a private SR WAN as a proof of concept its preference is to engage with and coordinate other with interested parties 12 FUTURE USE CASES Several future use cases are interesting to consider Figure 10 Proposed US deployments (reach 80% of market within 25ms) MPLS Supplement or Replacement Current network operators can supplement MPLS offerings to enterprises with a lower cost private SR WAN over the public Internet This solution rides on top of a plethora of diverse Internet transit paths This solution replaces partially utilized MPLS links with more efficiently utilized Internet bandwidth In Europe to reach 80% of a region within 25 milliseconds one needs good connectivity to 5 8 eyeball networks Here again transit from well peered ISPs can be used to reach these regional eyeballs in London Amsterdam Frankfurt and Paris Network Last Mile Many network operators do not have an inventory of last mile transport to bring customers onto 7 \x0cA Blockchain backed Inter Provider Segment Routing WAN v1 3 their network This segment routing system could be used to construct a public Internet on ramp onto any physical network Service Level Agreement Token Escrow An ISP may escrow coins for customers to use in the event of congestion or packet loss across their network This form of SLA goes beyond credits for downtime it pays for tokens to bypass congestion or faults in the provider\xe2\x80\x99s network if at all possible Virtual Circuits One could construct heuristics that spread the offered load across multiple SR Paths with the same performance characteristics By sending the traffic in roundrobin pattern the system learns more about the path characteristics and more users are rewarded with coin In this way last mile capacity can be aggregated into larger capacity bandwidth chunks Content Distribution Systems A CDN can leverage the SR WAN to populate caches deep in the last mile networks Operators of the segment routers receive coin for the traffic exchanged so caching provides one more reason why their segment routers receive traffic 13 CONCLUSION The Segment Routing WAN brings together buyers and sellers of spare Internet connectivity using rewards for participation and relaying and a community block chain for settlement The public SR WAN involves installing free open source software in a docker container on a host system Coins are earned and used by the host to gain access to a better Internet The private SR WAN brings professional operators running hardware SRv6 nodes at well populated colocation environments to enterprises seeking optimized connectivity for business critical applications 8 \x0c
