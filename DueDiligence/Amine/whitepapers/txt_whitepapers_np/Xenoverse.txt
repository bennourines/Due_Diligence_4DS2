used luxury online transactions to help you effectively cash in on your chattel loan services The second hand luxury industry and pawnbroker market cannot be separated from each other To collateralize the goods for chattel securitized loans they must be either luxury goods or valuable collateral including jewelry collectibles and high end electronics On average 30% of the agreements forfeits and pawnshops need to resell the collaterals to keep their business afloat The issue of reselling these products(forfeited pawns) at pawn shops is issues related to authentication valuation and marketing Xeno Auction is a ground breaking auction e commerce company that legally distributes these outstanding collateral at low and fast rates providing customers with a much lower price than the market price Xenoverse pawn makes it easy to get a chattel collateralized loan under optimal conditions by using valuable products they currently own as collateral for those who need a loan service that does not affect their credit When a user uploads the product information with photos Xenoverse experts conduct an appraisal of the product and pass the information to pawnshops in the area close to the user to present the loanable amount and interest rate for each company The user will then decide where he or she wants to trade and receive a chattel collateralized loan All of these product registration processes bidding processes appraisers and auditors appraisal details and contracts for lending are all recorded within the blockchain for transparency and decentralization All transactions and investments in Xenoverse ecosystem are possible through Xeno and we will provide maximum access to multiple users through listing Xeno tokens on numerous exchanges Xeno Foundation

4 / 12 \r \x0c02 Introduction & Concept of the Platform 1 Problem The market for pawnshops and second hand luxury goods generally suffers from Lack of expertise to authenticate and evaluate the value of collaterals and knowledge to market the services and products Lack of network with capital companies and information for wholesale loans (additional collection of funds) that are essential to the owners of pawnshop operations 30% of the average pawnbroker s loans fails to redeem and pawnshops suffer from the disposal of the forfeited pawns Illegal disposal of forfeited pawns to save taxes and labor causing social problems in the market Lack of standard regulations management circulation and distribution of second hand luxury goods creates confusion in the market Prevalence of duplicated data data loss counterfeiting tax avoidance and illegal import and export in the market Lack of expertise network and professionals to authenticate evaluate certify and guarantee used luxury goods Qualified experts exist to conduct an appraisal but their qualifications are limited to those of jewelry Difficulty in determining proper retail prices for used luxury goods 2 Introducing Xenoverse

Collateralized Loan Investment Service) is a service that enables you to invest in safety asset called collateral confidently The big difference between typical P2P loan investments and Xeno Loan is that highly exchangeable chattels are collateralized to ensure liquidity and safety Stable collateralized investment is an investment method in acquiring bonds and collateral as safe assets to implement loans to pawn shops second hand luxury boutiques and Jewelry shops with certain inventory and cryptocurrency investors by collateralizing items such as art collectibles antiques luxury goods precious metals rare kidult works rare cars and etc Xeno Loan using valuable chattels as collateral is the safest P2P loan investment service among existing P2P loan investment products with a purchase guarantee from strategic partner and other third parties which significantly increases liquidity in the event of insolvency For example to receive a real estate P2P loan investment the P2P market generally offers project financing (PF) based on the credit of the developer and a stake of the property while Xenoverse P2P chattel collateralized loan investment service significantly reduces the risk of non performing accidents due to the builder s guarantee of a loan investment in part of the credit and property Currently 170+ pawnbrokers are members of the Xenoverse platform in South

million people 260 million use the Internet making it the world s fourth largest Internet market Due to Indonesia and others the world s fastest spreading Internet usage 480 million people are expected to use the Internet by 2020 The growth is also attributed to a large number of young people whose 70 percent of the population is known to be under 40 years of age (57 percent in China) and only 27 percent in Southeast Asia have bank accounts In developing countries like Cambodia bank account ownership drops to 5% That means about 438 million people in the region are unbanked The Philippines is one of Asia s lowest bank using country with more than 70 percent of adults over the age of 15 remaining unbanked According to a central bank study more than 80 percent of the population in downtown Manila is unbanked with only three million households using credit cards As a result about 72 percent of the population more than 100 million people rely on about 18 000 pawnshops to play the role of banks Ninety percent of pawnshops are unbanked and unlike the United States developing countries like the Philippines are in a similar situation The latest data shows that as many as 56 million Filipinos are using mobile devices with 99 percent using social media This means that most Filipinos are unbanked but are technology sensitive digital native and are ready
