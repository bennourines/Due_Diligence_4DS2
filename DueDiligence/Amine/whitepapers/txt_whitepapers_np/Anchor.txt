and predictable growth trend of the global economy Leveraging the power of an algorithmic currency system combined with a stable value peg Anchor offers token users \xe2\x97\x8f Long term price stability \xe2\x97\x8f Protection from inflation \xe2\x97\x8f Preservation of purchasing power \xe2\x97\x8f A hedging tool against daily market volatility As a viable alternative to fiat pegged stablecoins which are consistently depreciating in value Anchor aims to remain stable regardless of any fiat currency\xe2\x80\x99s strength and is non correlated to market conditions Anchor pegs itself to the sustainable and predictable growth trend of global GDP via a non flationary financial index known as the Monetary Measurement Unit (MMU) We have historically seen global GDP increase by 2 5% on average annually over the last quarter century despite regular crises www theanchor io 5 \x0cThe Anchor token (ANCT) is a safe store of value stable unit of account and a fast and affordable medium of exchange for borderless transactions as a global currency Its underlying infrastructure is designed to develop stable fast cost effective secure transparent and scalable financial products and services for individuals businesses organizations and governments The Monetary Measurement Unit (MMU) has the potential to become a financial standard that any digital or traditional currency can utilize as a value peg to attain long term stability and preservation of purchasing power Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s core mission is to be a driver of global economic stability digital currency adoption and financial inclusivity as a global currency and financial standard in the age of decentralized finance (DeFi) II MARKET ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIVE ISSUE Both traditional monetary systems and cryptocurrencies have yet to resolve the issues of economic instability inflation currency manipulation and price fluctuations Fiat Currencies Fiat currencies are consistently depreciating in value due to inflation market fluctuations political biases and other dynamic economic scenarios According to \xe2\x80\x8brecent research conducted by the Bank of International Settlements\xe2\x80\x8b the top 10 most traded currencies by value are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 US dollar (USD) Euro (EUR) Japanese yen (JPY) Pound sterling (GBP) Australian dollar (AUD) Canadian dollar (CAD) Swiss franc (CHF) Chinese renminbi (CNH) Swedish krona (SEK) www theanchor io 6 \x0c10 New Zealand dollar (NZD) Below are statistics demonstrating how each of the top 10 most traded currencies have depreciated in value over the last 25 years (beginning in 1994) The following data is based on end of year annual inflation rates for the period 1994 through 2018 1 US dollar (USD)\xe2\x80\x8b has lost more than \xe2\x80\x8b55%\xe2\x80\x8b of its purchasing power 2 Euro (EUR)\xe2\x80\x8b has lost approximately \xe2\x80\x8b44%\xe2\x80\x8b of its purchasing power 3 Japanese yen (JPY)\xe2\x80\x8b has lost more

Swedish krona (SEK)\xe2\x80\x8b has lost more than \xe2\x80\x8b38%\xe2\x80\x8b of its purchasing power 10 New Zealand dollar (NZD)\xe2\x80\x8b has lost about \xe2\x80\x8b50%\xe2\x80\x8b of its purchasing power Due to fiat price fluctuations a majority of the currencies we use on a daily basis have significantly decreased in purchasing power and are a mere fraction of what they were in value a quarter century ago www theanchor io 7 \x0cUS DOLLAR PURCHASING POWER 1800 PRESENT The value of the US dollar across time measured against the $100 USD benchmark in 1800 Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies are inherently speculative volatile and not a reliable option for use as a daily currency for conservative portfolio diversification or as a dependable store of value thus discouraging usage of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange There are many obstacles facing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies with the main culprit being high volatility and fluctuation in token value For instance \xe2\x80\x8b b\xe2\x80\x8bitcoin is liable to show volatility with 10x more changes in price versus the U S dollar\xe2\x80\x8b in a relatively short period of time www theanchor io 8 \x0cBitcoin (BTC) Price Changes from 2009 to 2019 One of the most common critiques of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x8b from central bankers and economists is that bitcoin is not a currency because it lacks price stability Typically the mandate of central bankers is to optimize for relatively stable purchasing power (although currency depreciation at roughly 2 5% per year is considered tolerable) Lacking any mechanism to manage exchange rates bitcoin is considered \xe2\x80\x8ba priori\xe2\x80\x8b not a currency Implicit in the conventional view of what constitutes a sovereign currency is some notion of management A day to day medium of exchange cannot be as volatile as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies there must be stabilization mechanisms in place to create a reliable currency Stablecoins As a response to the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies stablecoins have carved out a market niche with high demand due to their promise of price stability practical usage and secure convenient transactions Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to maintain a stable value and prevent fluctuations dependent on market changes while offering the benefits of cryptocurrencies Stablecoins generally fall into one of three main categories Collateralized Crypto Collateralized and Algorithmic www theanchor io 9 \x0c1 Collateralized Stablecoins\xe2\x80\x8b such as True USD Gemini Paxos and Digix are backed 1 to 1 by a fiat currency or commodity Here a centralized company holds assets in a bank account or vault and issues tokens that represent a claim on the underlying assets The digital token has value because it represents a claim on another asset with some defined value ensuring liquidity The problem with this model is that the stablecoin will be as stable or as volatile as its underlying asset Any market dynamics that affect the asset will destabilize the stablecoin Another problem with this approach is that it is centralized These tokens require trust in the issuing party\xe2\x80\x93 that they actually own the assets being represented This model imposes serious counterparty risk on holders of the token The most controversial stablecoin Tether claimed to be 1 1 with USD only later to admit they are actually only 74% backed by USD Yet Tether continues to dominate the market demonstrating a high demand for something new trustless and viable 2 Crypto Collateralized Stablecoins\xe2\x80\x8b such as MakerDao Havven and WrappedBTC are backed by a decentralized cryptoasset In the case of MakerDao for example the Dai stablecoin is backed by ETH held as collateral in an Ethereum smart contract This approach has the benefit of being decentralized The collateral is held trustlessly in a smart contract so users do not have to rely on any third party to redeem it The problem is that the collateral backing the stablecoin is often a volatile cryptoasset such as BTC or ETH If the value of this asset drops too quickly the stablecoins issued could become undercollateralized For this reason most of the projects using this model require that the stablecoins be overcollateralized enough to protect against sharp price movements While this can provide some degree of certainty there always exists the possibility of a black swan event that causes collateral prices to drop so quickly that the stablecoins become undercollateralized 3 Algorithmic Stablecoins\xe2\x80\x8b are the most disruptive model that many believe to be the future of the financial system Algorithmic Stablecoins are non collateralized How can something achieve a stable price while being non collateralized The answer is seigniorage shares a concept developed by Robert Sams in 2014 Seigniorage shares use a smart contract to mimic a central bank in which the monetary policy has only one obligation issue a currency with a value that maintains long term price stability in equilibrium with its value peg In other words the network issues new coins if the price of the stablecoin is too high and burns coins if the price is too low As the network grows so too does demand for the stablecoins Given fixed supply an increase in demand will cause the price to increase In the seigniorage shares model however increased demand causes the system to issue new stablecoins thus increasing supply and ultimately lowering price to the target level This works conversely using a second utility token as a stabilizing mechanism to remove coins from circulation www theanchor io 10 \x0cConclusive Issue Most major fiat currencies are declining in value and losing purchasing power year after year Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile with daily price swings that do not offer practical use as a day to day payment currency Stablecoins offer the greatest potential to drive widespread adoption for digital currencies as a stable and global medium of exchange store of value and unit of account The seigniorage shares model is the most exciting most experimental and most \xe2\x80\x9ccrypto native\xe2\x80\x9d approach to creating a trustless decentralized stablecoin This fluctuating supply concept while seemingly complicated at first is rooted in a well known theory of economics The \xe2\x80\x8bQuantity Theory of Money\xe2\x80\x8b (QTM) QTM states that the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation or money supply The theory was originally formulated by Polish mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus in 1517 and was restated by philosophers John Locke David Hume Jean Bodin and by economists Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States published in 1963 It is also the method used by the Federal Reserve to maintain the stability of the US dollar The crypto projects adopting the seigniorage shares model are attempting to do what the Federal Reserve does but in a decentralized algorithmic way Anchor is one of those algorithmic stablecoin projects leading the way A successful non collateralized stablecoin could radically change financial technology consumer trade and how society views both value and money Advantages of the algorithmic model include absence of direct collateral allowing for ease of scalability autonomous not influenced by external markets decentralized and trustless stable and programmatically adjusts based on supply and demand and supported by many financial technology experts \xe2\x80\x9cIf executed well this type of stablecoin will unlock rich possibilities for crypto holders since it will be decentralized efficient and free of counterparty risk The approach is promising albeit in need of testing \xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x8bNat\xe2\x80\x8b Wittayatanaseth Investment Manager of Beacon Venture Capital on her \xe2\x80\x8bMedium \xe2\x80\x8bPublication\xe2\x80\x8b www theanchor io 11 \x0cAnchor is unique and different from competitors because we offer an essential element that is missing from both the digital and traditional monetary systems a non flationary baseline a stable financial standard that is based on real GDP which has a reliable and steady growth pattern In order to be stable a currency must be pegged to a secure unit of value that has proven to be sustainable and predictable while also having the capability to act as a buffer against inflation and maintain purchasing power over time III ANCHOR AS A SOLUTION Anchor is a two token algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the sustainable and predictable growth trend of the global economy Anchor offers token users long term price stability protection against inflation and preservation of purchasing power all while hedging against market volatility Stablecoins backed by fiat and real world assets are susceptible to the same market fluctuations depreciation and loss of purchasing power as the real world assets to which they are pegged The global economy on the other hand has a sustainable and predictable growth trend with global GDP steadily increasing over time Data from the World Bank shows that since 1960 global GDP has expanded from $1 3trn to $8\xe2\x80\x8b5 9trn today www theanchor io 12 \x0cBy leveraging the sustainable growth trend of the global economy Anchor offers stable financial solutions to individuals businesses organizations and governments Anchor is a next generation stablecoin leveraging the power of technology and algorithms with the aim of creating an objective measure of value that is resilient to currency manipulation recessions and other market fluctuations Anchor (ANCT) achieves and maintains stability and preservation of purchasing power via four core pillars of stabilizing architecture designed to make the system inherently stable \xe2\x97\x8f Pillar #1 A Stable Value Peg \xe2\x80\x94 The Monetary Measurement Unit (MMU) Anchor is pegged to global economic growth via a non flationary financial index known as the Monetary Measurement Unit (MMU) that t\xe2\x80\x8b akes into account numerous macroeconomic indicators from more than 190 countries to create the most accurate measure of value that exists in the world today The MMU is further stabilized by incorporating forex indicators from a basket of currencies and premium sovereign bond yields from 10 of the world s strongest economies (based on annual GDP and participation in the global economy) www theanchor io 13 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Pillar #2 Price Correction Mechanism \xe2\x80\x94 Two Token Algorithmic Model An algorithmically governed approach to expanding and contracting Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s money supply leveraging a secondary utility token called the Dock token (DOCT) Anchor uses Ethereum smart contracts to automatically increase or decrease the supply of Anchor tokens in circulation Dock tokens cannot be traded on exchanges and exist for the sole purpose of being converted into Anchor tokens during Expansion Phases when demand is high and new Anchors need to be minted for circulation Dock tokens can only be exchanged for Anchor tokens during Contraction and Expansion phases on the Anchor platform \xe2\x97\x8f Pillar #3 Revenue Streams \xe2\x80\x94 The Anchor Economy Profit and revenue from Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem of products and services will be distributed back into the Anchor system to contribute to the stability strength and liquidity of the Anchor currency Current products include the Anchor currency itself being used and traded on exchanges the Anchor Wallet and will include Anchor Pay a solution for global payments and money transfer catering to verticals such as remittances and e commerce In addition our infrastructure and the MMU can be adopted by and/or whitelabeled by another entity such as a business or government seeking a stable value peg and/or digital currency T \xe2\x80\x8b he limitless potential and growing demand for Anchor will self perpetuate its expansion and success \xe2\x97\x8f Pillar #4 Decentralized Governing Body \xe2\x80\x94 Validators and an Advisory Body The Anchor System will be governed by up to 21 established institutions enterprises and organizations across multiple industries and geographies with competing priorities to minimize the risk of collusion with one slot reserved for parent company Anchor AG Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s governance model protects its token holders by guaranteeing the integrity of Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s price and its stability in maintaining equilibrium with the MMU as well as ensuring the value of the MMU accurately reflects the growth trend of the global economy As part of our longer term strategy our decentralized governance model will also include partnerships with representatives from up to 195 countries that will act as Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s Advisory Body www theanchor io 14 \x0cIV A DEEPER LOOK INTO ANCHOR\xe2\x80\x99S TOKENOMICS \xe2\x80\x8bFOUR PILLARS OF STABILIZING ARCHITECTURE Pillar #1 Monetary Measurement Unit (MMU) The MMU is a financial index created by an algorithm that takes into account the GDP of more than 190 countries from the last 25 years further stabilized with forex indicators from a basket of currencies and premium sovereign bond yields from 10 of the world s strongest economies By developin\xe2\x80\x8bg an algorithmically calculated fin\xe2\x80\x8bancial i\xe2\x80\x8b ndex\xe2\x80\x8b based on global GDP Anchor has created what is intended to be the first reliable financial standard and measure of value since the International Monetary Fund\xe2\x80\x99s (IMF) \xe2\x80\x8bSpecial Drawing Rights\xe2\x80\x8b (SDR) circa 1969 The SDR is exclusive only to \xe2\x80\x8bIMF\xe2\x80\x8b member countries and based on a basket of five currencies whereas the MMU is decentralized inclusive and based on a dynamic currency basket of 10 of the strongest economies based on their GDP and participation in the global economy each year Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s MMU basket is dynamic in that each year it will contain currencies from 10 of the strongest national economies based on annual GDP and participation in the global economy At the beginning of each fiscal year the system will re evaluate and update the basket to ensure that the 10 strongest and most reliable national currencies are consistently represented to bring stability and real value to the system The basket is designed to ensure the strongest currencies are consistently represented The evaluation is completely objective and based on each country\xe2\x80\x99s performance and participation each year not related to a political agenda or affiliation Factoring in daily fluctuating macroeconomic data from more than 190 countries the MMU\xe2\x80\x99s calculations also include the FX Indicator and the MMU Premium www theanchor io 15 \x0cThe \xe2\x80\x8bFX Indicator\xe2\x80\x8b indexes currencies from 10 of the world\xe2\x80\x99s strongest economies based on their participation in the world economy (> 1%) The FX indicator uses international market exchange rates for the most relevant currencies in the global economy and enables the daily nominal expression of the MMU The \xe2\x80\x8bMMU Premium\xe2\x80\x8b calculates the amount of growth that can be expected based on sovereign bond yields of AAA rated countries as well as the average inflation rates This Premium has been approximately 0 4% annually for the last 25 years The MMU is calculated via the application of a proprietary algorithmic formula conceived by Anchor Founder and CEO Daniel Popa and developed by Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s team of PhD economists including macroeconomics researcher and Professor Dr Zoran Grubisi\xc4\x87 and quantitative finance expert Aleksandar Mani\xc4\x87 Price stability\xe2\x80\x8b is not only about stabilizing the unit of account but also stabilizing the currency\xe2\x80\x99s store of value The MMU\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm is constantly growing in sophistication accumulating more data and macroeconomic indicators over time to reflect the real growth of the global economy with even more accuracy As a result Anchor will be aligned with an ever more precise index with the goal of creating the most stable and predictable value peg in the world Pillar #2 Two Token Model Anchor consists of a two token model composed of Anchor Tokens (ANCT) that serve as the main currency/payment tokens and Dock Tokens (DOCT) the utility tokens that stabilize the currency ensuring ANCT remains pegged to the MMU regardless of external fluctuations DOCT cannot be used as a means of payment or transferred from one token holder to another If the price of the Anchor stablecoin deviates by more than 1% from the value of the MMU the system mints new Anchor tokens and burns coins if the price is too low to ensure equilibrium with its value peg the MMU Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s flexible currency supply is regulated by Contraction and Expansion phases which are stabilizing events through which Anchor\xe2\x80\x99s system programmatically contracts or expands the supply of ANCT in circulation by minting or burning ANCT tokens in response to the token\xe2\x80\x99s price deviations from the MMU The main function of DOCT is to grant the holder access to participate in the Anchor System and to be converted into ANCT during Expansion Phases DOCT can only be exchanged during www theanchor io 16 \x0cContraction and Expansion phases on the Anchor platform for ANCT not traded on exchanges A \xe2\x80\x8bContraction Phase\xe2\x80\x8b is triggered when ANCT\xe2\x80\x99s price falls below the Contraction Threshold (currently 1% below the value of the MMU) due to a decrease in demand When this occurs an open auction with a reward system will be initiated to incentivize token holders to trade their ANCT for DOCT for favorable exchange rates in order to stabilize the currency and maintain equilibrium between ANCT\xe2\x80\x99s price and the value of the MMU ANCT holders choosing to participate in \xe2\x80\x8bContraction Phase Auctions (CPAs) \xe2\x80\x8bwill benefit from DOCT incentives in the form of preferential exchange rates with bonuses for exchanged volume and speed of reaction An\xe2\x80\x8b Expansion Phase\xe2\x80\x8b is triggered when the exchange rate for ANCT rises above the Expansion Threshold in relation to the MMU due to an increase in demand causing a decrease in supply At this time the system will incentivize DOCT owners to convert their tokens into ANCT at a 1 1 ratio after which token holders can trade and sell on exchanges and transfer ANCT between Anchor Wallets If equilibrium is still not met ANCT will be airdropped to holders using a fair distribution model inspired by the NBA draft until its price comes back down and returns to the value of the MMU Breakdown of Contraction Phase If the reported exchange rate for ANCT (ATRPcurrent) is below the current value of the MMU by a margin greater than or equal to the Contraction Phase Threshold (\xe2\x88\x86ATcontraction) with a value that has been agreed upon by the system validators (i e \xe2\x88\x86ATcontraction \xe2\x89\xa4 MMU ATRPcurrent) the system will initiate an open auction for purchasing ANCT from holders in exchange for new DOCT at preferential rates for holders which will be redeemable for ANCT at a 1 1 ratio if and when certain conditions are met in the future The number of ANCT that will be burned to reduce the market cap (\xe2\x88\x86Acirc) will be calculated according to the following formula \xe2\x88\x86Acirc = ((MMU ATRPcurrent) * Acirc)/MMU where \xe2\x88\x86ATcontraction \xe2\x89\xa4 MMU ATRPcurrent Acirc \xe2\x80\x94 circulating supply of Anchor Tokens that has to be reduced by \xe2\x88\x86Acirc to keep the peg \xe2\x88\x86ATcontraction \xe2\x80\x94 Contraction Phase Threshold typically expressed as an agreed upon percentage of the official value of the MMU (e g 0 01 * MMU or 1% of the MMU value) www theanchor io 17 \x0cDuring the Contraction Phase Auction (CPA) all ANCT owners will have an opportunity to sell any number of the coins they own worth more than or equal to $1 000 at the time of sale that is less than or equal to the number of coins that still have to be reclaimed from the users and burned to keep the peg In return they will get more DOCT (NDOCTi) than the amount of ANCT they are selling (NANCTi) according to the following formula NDOCTi = NANCTi/(kVi * kRi) where kVi is the Volume Discount approved to the i th responder kRi is the Quickness of Response Discount approved to the i th responder Token holders can agree to sell any amount of ANCT that still need to be burned at their turn (based on the sale terms and conditions) and obtain more DOCT in return due to a discount belonging to the corresponding range (as outlined in the table below) Terms and Conditions During the Contraction Phase Auction Volume Discount Terms and Conditions During the CPA ANCT to burn [USD worth at the time of sale] Volume

applicable) of each buyer s purchased worth of DOCT will be converted to ANCT after 25 (twenty five) months The Contraction Phase Queue All the issued DOCT are tallied and ordered based on their release dates This ordered sequence of DOCT belonging to their respective holders is referred to as the Contraction Phase Queue (CPQ) DOCT with shorter waiting periods will be exchanged for Anchor Tokens earlier than those with longer waiting periods Consequently the initial ordered sequence in the Contraction Phase Queue (QCP0) is formed as an array QCP0 = QCP(t0) = (tEXPd1 tEXPd2 \xe2\x80\xa6 tEXPk \xe2\x80\xa6 tEXPDcpq0) where t0 represents the time of the creation of the CPQ after the first response to the first Dock Tokens auction tEXPdk represents the k th (k = 1 2 \xe2\x80\xa6 DCPQ0)

burned If there are no more outstanding DOCT any remaining new ANCT are distributed by airdropping them to users or system reserved allocations by means of random selection with pre specified statistical probabilities Fifty percent of the airdropped ANCT will be distributed among the system reserved allocations (see Table 1 below) whereas the remaining 50% of the airdropped ANCT will be

stablecoin Given fixed supply an increase in demand will cause the price to increase In the seigniorage shares model increased demand causes the system to issue new stablecoins thus increasing supply (while ultimately lowering price to the target level) By minting more Anchors due to increase in demand market cap grows and the overall system strengthens and becomes more stable with increased longevity The Anchor Economy consists of revenue streams from various applications of the Anchor stablecoin that powers its liquidity and prosperity for all stakeholders All profits will then be redistributed back into the Anchor system and its development as well as invested into secure assets that will act as collateral for the Anchor token A growing ecosystem of products and services built on top of the Anchor stablecoin to jumpstart the economy currently include \xe2\x97\x8f Stability Fee on Exchanges \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x94 Anchor is currently listed and available for trading on IDEX

automatic monthly expenses \xe2\x97\x8f Global Currency\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 Citizens in developing countries will be able exchange their crashing currency for ANCT quickly before they lose even more of their savings thus protecting them from further drops in value Take for example the hyperinflation that is currently occurring in Venezuela On average prices of goods have been doubling every few weeks Most Venezuelans can no longer afford food because their savings have become increasingly worthless and continue to drop in value by the day www theanchor io 23 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Financial
