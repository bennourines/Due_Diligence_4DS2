market digital Collectible Card Games (CCGs) have been bolstered by major new entrants including Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft More than 37 million people play digital CCGs worldwide accounting for $551 million in digital CCG revenue for Asia alone (2015E) Asia has the highest number of digital CCG players (10 9 million or about 2 5x the number of physical players ) Players who bought booster packs and other CCG in app purchases spent an average of $96 annually 46% of digital CCG players use multiple platforms to play their games and 5% of all players spend $250 or more a year making them the \xe2\x80\x9cwhales\xe2\x80\x9d of the digital CCG world Figure 1 Super Data 2014 Ratio of Digital vs Physical revenue market share 2 1 Opportunity and Feasibility The global digital CCG market is

subject to hacking embezzlement or even confiscation with little recourse for those affected 2 5 The Solution Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 is the first Ethereum based decentralized gaming platform built specifically to give trading card game enthusiasts a fun seamless experience while protecting player ownership of DGAs Smart contracts on the Ethereum network allow Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 to operate in a unique way that has never existed before Participants completely control their funds and DGAs while using the secure Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 user interface Reward payouts are made in accordance with the rules of Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 smart contracts This decentralized model reduces transaction and other operating costs amounting to savings that are passed on to the consumer and adding value that competitors cannot provide 2 6 Future Vision Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 aims to be the preferred blockchain digital collectible trading card game and gaming platform shaping the future of blockchain gaming projects The initial focus of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 project is on digital rewards content transactions and integration of blockchain features for the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 digital gaming platform Ultimately Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 will be a leading brand in competitive blockchain digital CCG gameplay Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 will be the first of many amazing games powered by ELE\xc5\xa6 as the ecosystem currency Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 will also work with other blockchain developers forging relationships to enhance security utility automation and the gaming experience for all players The in app digital wallet will support any ERC20 standard based token with the ability to store send receive and view digital assets through a graphical user interface The Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 team aims to follow the example set by the OpenZeppelin project by creating a high quality open source reusable package of smart contracts that can serve as the foundation for other trading card projects Doing so will encourage a higher level of participation on all parties\xe2\x80\x99 platforms for standardization toolsets and bring cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications one step closer to mainstream Copyright 2017 2018 Elementeum Games LLC \x0cETHER LEGENDS and THE ELEMENTEUM TOKEN 7 3 Licensing Due to transparent nature of smart contracts much of the intellectual property will be open source The Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 team will release a fully open source API of core solidity smart contracts that may be used as the foundation for other digital trading card games 4 App Token The Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 gaming platform is driven by Elementeum (ELE\xc5\xa6) an essential component of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 ecosystem Major functions that require the use of ELE\xc5\xa6 include \xe2\x80\xa2 Playing matches or tournaments \xe2\x80\xa2 Hosting matches or tournaments \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than a game it\xe2\x80\x99s a gaming platform \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa2 Claiming rewards \xe2\x80\xa2 Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 Marketplace transactions \xe2\x80\xa2 Bounty for continued development and design 4 1 Token Acquisition During the Elementeum token presale users may send Ether (ETH) to the Elementeum sale smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain In exchange wallet addresses from which ETH was received are immediately provided with a quantity of ELE\xc5\xa6 based on the sale exchange rate After the release of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 Beta ELE\xc5\xa6 may be acquired either by using the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 user interface by exchanging assets with other players by winning competitive matches against players or by claiming rewards As an additional option the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 interface integrates third party trading solutions such as Shapeshift and Coinbase to allow users who don\xe2\x80\x99t own ETH to purchase ELE\xc5\xa6 4 2 Token Growth and Utilization The long term vision for the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 ecosystem extends beyond the Marketplace The Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 team will work towards making

LLC \xe2\x80\x9cSmart contract design of Ether Legends has enabled Endless scalability\xe2\x80\x9d \x0c8 ETHER LEGENDS and THE ELEMENTEUM TOKEN 4 3 Token Presale The first opportunity to obtain ELE\xc5\xa6 is during the Elementeum token presale during which time ELE\xc5\xa6 is available for purchase at a discounted rate To purchase ELE\xc5\xa6 tokens users send ETH from their Ethereum wallet addresses to the address of the token sale smart contract All participating wallet addresses will automatically receive a limited edition digital trading card shortly before or upon release of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 Beta The token presale will occur in several phases outlined in the following table (all phase begin at 00 00 00 GMT and end at 23 59 59 GMT) The quantity of tokens is capped at 50 000 000 The total supply of ELE\xc5\xa6 will never exceed this quantity Of this amount 70% or 35 000 000 tokens are publicly available during the presale Should the public allocation sell out the token presale ends and no further purchases may be made To ensure that many users have the opportunity to obtain ELE\xc5\xa6 no contributing user may use a single Ethereum wallet address to contribute less than 0 03 ETH or more than 100 ETH The presale smart contract tracks the cumulative total contribution and rejects any contribution made outside this range Should the token presale fail to raise a minimum of 250 ETH the presale smart contract automatically enables refunds that users may claim upon completion of the presale Figure 6 Token Distribution Phase Quintessence Fire

Figure 7 Funding allocation Copyright 2017 2018 Elementeum Games LLC \x0c9 ETHER LEGENDS and THE ELEMENTEUM TOKEN 5 Gameplay and Ecosystem The unique design features of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 ecosystem and gaming platform are purpose built to create a fun engaging experience for players ELE\xc5\xa6 is deeply tied to game play and the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 marketplace as a form of

combination of character level (CLVL) and item level (ILVL) score and is determined by the attributes of characters and items the player takes into the arena CLVL and ILVL ranges are predetermined using mathematical formulas Because MMR is largely determined by the CLVL and ILVL of assets used during individual matches players have the opportunity to play against others at varying skill levels in a way that is balanced and fair Win or lose players gain experience though winning provides experience at an increased rate Players choose how they allocate experience to character cards when creating or joining matches allowing limitless combinations of CLVL Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 is unique because experience is stored in the blockchain as digital assets players own Ownership of experience tied to players instead of characters allows the purchase sale or trade of experience and most importantly prevents loss of experience when players change characters Copyright 2017 2018 Elementeum Gaming LLC \xe2\x80\x9cExperience is a digital asset earned and owned by players \xe2\x80\x9d \x0cETHER LEGENDS and THE ELEMENTEUM TOKEN 10 5 3 Playing Matches Players use the web based

the creator of each match or tournament In addition to other bonuses winners are rewarded with the combined ELE\xc5\xa6 total paid by each player To maintain balance and fairness the MMRs of match participants must be comparable a rule enforced by smart contracts Play is fastpaced and should take about 7 10 minutes per game based on prototype game play Copyright 2017 2018 Elementeum Games LLC

Elementeum Gaming LLC \x0c12 ETHER LEGENDS and THE ELEMENTEUM TOKEN Character cards start at level 0 and players apply experience they earn and own to cards during match play creation to achieve new levels and additional power Character cards have base attributes that give the character virtual hit points defense strike evasion healing and a rate of effectivity At higher levels players allocate additional points to these categories based on their desired playing style and strategy Furthermore each character card has a unique special ability creating strategic advantages or disadvantages based on other cards in play Legendary character cards are more difficult to obtain and have additional special features that make them more strategically desirable The first release will include roughly twenty unique character cards for each elemental type and twenty legendary cards The first set For Glory and Treasure features a theme of beasts and men each of which has been masterfully illustrated and stands on its own as a work of art 5 5 Dynamic Rewards Rewards come in two forms 1 In game content items such as item cards that boost character attributes and items used to customize

to their electronic devices 5) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world The functioning of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network and ELE\xc5\xa6 could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like ELE\xc5\xa6 which could impede or limit the development of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network 6) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 Network or Distributed Applications It is possible that the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network will not be used by a large number of businesses individuals and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network and therefore the potential uses or value of ELE\xc5\xa6 7) Risk that the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 Network As Developed Will Not Meet the Expectations of Purchaser The Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release Any expectations regarding the form and functionality of ELE\xc5\xa6 or the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network held by the purchaser may not be met upon release for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network 8) Risk of Theft and Hacking Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network or the availability of ELE\xc5\xa6 in any number of ways including without limitation denial of service attacks Sybil attacks spoofing smurfing malware attacks or consensus based attacks 9) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network Core Infrastructure Software The Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network consists of opensource software that is itself based on opensource software There is a risk that the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 team or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network interfering with the use of or causing the loss of ELE\xc5\xa6 Copyright 2017 2018 Elementeum Games LLC \x0c19 ETHER LEGENDS and THE ELEMENTEUM TOKEN 10) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography Advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum platform which could result in the theft or loss of ELE\xc5\xa6 11) Risk of Ethereum Mining Attacks As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies the blockchain used for the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network is susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to Double spend attacks majority mining power attacks \xe2\x80\x9cselfishmining\xe2\x80\x9d attacks and race condition attacks Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network expected proper execution and sequencing of Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 markets and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations Despite the efforts of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 Team the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists 12) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 Network While ELE\xc5\xa6 should not be viewed as an investment it may have value over time That value may be limited if the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 network lacks use and adoption If this becomes the case there may be few or no markets upon the launch of the platform limiting the value of ELE\xc5\xa6 13) Risk of an Illiquid Market for ELE\xc5\xa6 There are currently no exchanges upon which ELE\xc5\xa6 might trade If ever exchanges do develop they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight They may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established regulated exchanges for other products To the extent that the exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in ELE\xc5\xa6 trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues such exchanges\xe2\x80\x99 failures may result in a reduction in the value or liquidity of ELE\xc5\xa6 14) Risk of Uninsured Losses Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions funds held using the Ether Legends\xe2\x84\xa2 or Ethereum network are generally uninsured In the event of loss or loss of value there is no public insurer such as the F D I C
