of international currencies In contrast the majority of exchanges (mostly small) specialize in local markets by supporting local currencies 53% of all exchanges support national currencies other than

decentralized marketplace for exchanging cryptocurrencies All exchanges support bitcoin while Ethereum and Litecoin for comparison are listed on only 40% of exchanges Only a minority of exchanges make markets for the exchange of cryptocurrencies other than the above three While 39% of exchanges solely support bitcoin 25% have two listed cryptocurrencies and 36% of all entities enable trading three or more cryptocurrencies Another intriguing observation shows that 72% of large exchanges provide trading support for two or more cryptocurrencies while 73% of small exchanges have only one or two cryptocurrencies listed 6% of survey participants also provide cryptocurrency based derivatives and 16% are offering margin trading ERC 20 Post ICO Tokens gain more momentum on Exchange listings lately Those that offer innovation on Blockchain popularity among investors and consumer utilization are likely to get listed on large exchanges while others tend to show on various smaller platforms Cambridge study also shows that Small exchanges seem to have considerable difficulties with either obtaining or maintaining banking relationships while large exchanges appear to have this risk factor under control Small exchanges are also substantially more concerned about fraud than large exchanges which suggests that they are either targeted more often than large exchanges or simply that fraud has more a more severe financial impact due to the limited scale of their operations and budget This document is strictly private confidential and personal to its recipients and should not be copied

While many Blockchain experts are trying to find more ways to marry CRYPTO with FIAT BQT Team believes in reducing dependency on FIAT altogether Every Crypto Asset has its value and can be used as

negotiated directly by trader peers In addition we believe market now demands for ability to hedge crypto assets for a short period of time to acquire other Crypto holdings While it is difficult to implement margin trades and options in the true P2P environment BQT Team developed innovative and yet more powerful tool to allow traders generate short term Hedge Trades The aim of BQT is to build a community and culture of Crypto Traders utilizing the Platform helping the community and benefiting from the community BQT Exchange Platform provides secure interactive and flexible Social Trading Environment and user friendly interface for its community to manage various types of transactions consisting of many crypto assets BQT platform allows traders globally to negotiate their Crypto Asset

AND SHARE TRADING EXPERIENCE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AMONG TRADERS ANALYTICS AND REPORTING To leverage holdings of various Crypto Assets BQT introducing the revolutionary Hedge Trades system BQT Hedge Trade system is a flexible leverage trade method for Traders of acquiring Crypto Assets for a short term period by means of escrow of their existing Crypto holdings For example Trader A (Hedge Receiver) who has certain BTC holding could post an offer on BQT P2P exchange providing their BTC into BQT Escrow with 20% premium on top inviting other Traders that hold ETH receive his BTC Escrow as collateral for 30 days while allowing him to use their ETH for that period Trader B (Hedge Provider) could respond to the offer and negotiate the terms requesting higher premium and/or shorter term as example Trader C (another Hedge Provider) could respond with a different offer and negotiate better terms for Hedge Receiver For sake of an easier math Trader A would offer 1 BTC (valued $10 000/USD at a time) with 20% premium (1 2 BTC / $12 000) into BQT Escrow inviting other Traders to transfer This document is strictly private confidential and personal to its recipients and should not be copied distributed or reproduced in whole or in part nor passed to any third party \x0cBetter Quick Transparent $10 000 value in ETH (20 ETH / valued $500 USD per ETH at a time) for a period of 30 days Trader B responds to an offer with slightly different terms asking for 1 25 BTC (25% premium) and 20 Days while Trader C responds with better terms asking only 1 22 BTC and agrees to 30 days Trade period Trader A agrees to a Trader C offer and initiates the BQT Escrow and receives 20 ETH from Trader C Escrow is securely stored with BQT as escrow agent so user C can feel secure about his Trade Collateral Trader C feels secure and is in the positive territory due to the 22% Premium received instantly upon consummation of the Hedge Trade At the end of the 30 days period of a Hedge Trade Trader A (Hedge Receiver) would have first option to either transfer back to Trader C (Hedge Provider) 20 ETH with 22% premium (24 4 ETH) or release the escrow Trader A has the first option because he put up a risk of 22% premium to start a Hedge Trade But at the end of the Hedge Trade Trader A might benefit greatly due to significant increase in value of either one of the Crypto Currency (BTC or ETH) and choose to return one that makes most benefits for him For example if ETH price doubled to $1000/ETH Trader A may just choose to release BTC Escrow with Premium to Trader C while retaining $20 000 ETH Holding and making significant upside profit In other words while Hedge Provider gains secure premium Day One of the Hedge Trade \xe2\x80\x93 Hedge Receiver is betting on upside increase of value leveraged from either Crypto Asset This revolutionary approach allows Crypto Traders leverage their Crypto Holdings through risk adversed hedged leverage offers for BQTX community of traders This document is strictly private confidential and personal to its recipients and should not be copied distributed or reproduced in whole or in part nor passed to any third party 21 \x0cBetter Quick Transparent In the same example there could be Trader D responding to same offer but instead of ETH may offer his XRP TRX or any other Crypto Asset and might even give better terms on premium and hedge time period One of the benefits of the BQT Platform is ability to leverage many popular and promising Crypto Assets either as Hedge Receiver Collateral or Hedge Provider Trade offer During the Beta period BQT would list most currently trading Crypto Assets and its Pairs against other Crypto Assets It is important to note that just as Hedge Receivers placing their Collateral offers on BQT P2P Exchange Hedge Providers may also place initial Trade offers inviting Hedge Receivers to participate on their terms For example Hedge Provider Trader E could place an offer to provide 100 XRP to any Hedge Receiver who is willing to place a Hedge Collateral of ETH of the same value with 20% premium and would receive various counter offers from many Traders (Hedge Receivers) In addition BQTX exchange provides Social Trading Channels capability for traders to share their trade success with the community as well as compete with other channels Another important part for BQTX Exchange is
