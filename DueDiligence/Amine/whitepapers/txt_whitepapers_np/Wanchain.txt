Signi\xef\xac\x81cance Friedrich A Hayek the eminent Austrian econ omist believes that if we let currencies com pete in the market by survival of the \xef\xac\x81ttest like away from control by a single institution and move in a more fair and transparent direction other commodities market mechanisms can The concept of Financial Inclusion seeks to give just like it does for those other commodities worldwide better access to the \xef\xac\x81nancial system \xef\xac\x81lter out the most appropriate currency for us In January 2009 the \xef\xac\x81rst Bitcoin block was mined The emergence of Bitcoin transcend ed Hayek\xe2\x80\x99s ideal state where responsibility for controlling the total amount of money in a system is borne by speci\xef\xac\x81c institutions whose self interest keeps the total currency amount at a level acceptable to most users The switch from credit authorization by institu tions to inviolable mathematical laws for recording the exchange of value is another great innovation In essence currency is a consensus It is an agreed upon accounting representation for a more convenient exchange of value Reviewing mankind\xe2\x80\x99 s \xef\xac\x81nancial history from the bartering of one disadvantaged people and small enterprises and low cost \xef\xac\x81nancial services Two and a half billion people in the world are unable to use

relatively low end \xef\xac\x81nancial products from banks and other \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions and can\ t take part in early stage invest ments of technology companies such as Google and Alibaba before they are listed It is also di\xef\xac\x83cult for many small to medium enterprises to obtain loan support from banks despite good credit and outstanding performance because they are not

Ethereum received returns can be created and implemented and where ments Blockchain technology is pushing Inclu protected Of course such banks will be com hundreds of times the size of their initial investsive Finance to brand new heights As of June 2017 there are thousands of digital currencies based on blockchain technology with a total market value of over $100 billion and the number and value of digital currencies continues to grow Digital currency is becoming more acceptable as a form of payment in \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions many organizations are exploring ways to record traditional forms of assets such as commer cial bills and loyalty points into blockchains usually in the form of consortium chains Digital asset exchanges which are similar to traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions have emerged These exchanges perform the banking function of exchanging digital assets They are a platform for buying and trading tokens similar to those of a stock exchange A platform for cross border token transfers performs functions similar to cross border bank remittances However these platforms in various degrees are operating in a centralized manner which not only brings about the security risks of centralization but also blocks the wider adoption of blockchain technology Based on this phenomenon we need a distributed bank where di\xef\xac\x80erent digital currencies and digital assets can be transferred in transferred out and exchanged by blockchains We need a place where \xef\xac\x81nancial products and contracts based on digital currencies and digital assets the transaction privacy can be e\xef\xac\x80ectively pletely di\xef\xac\x80erent from traditional banks except for some functions such as debit and credit remittance settlement and sale of \xef\xac\x81nancial products With corresponding ability and capital strength any organization or individual can set up their own business windows They can provide various services under the guarantee of a distributed blockchain infrastructure to provide more \xef\xac\x81nancial services for more people More accurately this is a future \xef\xac\x81nancial infrastructure based on digital assets and a distributed \xef\xac\x81nancial market 1 2/ Design Background In the early days of traditional banks currency exchange was their main purpose and functions such as currency custody payments settlements and remittances were gradually developed At last modern banks with deposits and loans as their main business were born It can be said that a bank is a ledger recording debtor creditor relationships Every receipt payment and transfer of funds is in fact a change of corresponding assets in a bank ledger that supports more than one asset An exchange settlement among di\xef\xac\x80erent banks is actually an asset record change on di\xef\xac\x80erent ledgers It must be ensured that the assets are not double spent regardless of whether the asset changes are in the same ledger or in di\xef\xac\x80erent ledgers In general the increase or decrease in the amount of an 02 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD asset in a ledger must correspond to an Cross Chain Asset Transfer ledger The block chain provides an excellent networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and equivalent opposite change in another solution to the problem of double spending in the same ledger in di\xef\xac\x80erent accounts Solv ing the problem of transferring assets among di\xef\xac\x80erent blockchain ledgers is key to the wider application of blockchain technology Wanchain requires a distributed approach to support the access of di\xef\xac\x80erent blockchains and the transfer of assets that is to support cross chain transactions E\xef\xac\x80ective protection of users\xe2\x80\x99privacy is one of the foundations of traditional banking Any \xc2\xb7 Connect existing major digital currency completing the asset exchanges without modifying the mechanism of original chains This integrates newly generated digital currency networks with Wanchain at a very low cost \xc2\xb7 Integrate consortium chains with Wanchain This ful\xef\xac\x81lls the functions of transferring assets from original chains to Wanchain transferring assets from Wanchain back to the original chains and trading various assets on Wanchain \xef\xac\x81nancial transaction is needed to

is a distributed \xef\xac\x81nancial market In Transaction Privacy Protection develop and provide their own \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions with privacy protection principle any organization or individual can services based on Wanchain It requires Wanchain a blockchain infrastructure to support the programmable smart contract function In summation Wanchain is designed under such a context \xc2\xb7 Allow trading parties to choose to conduct \xc2\xb7 Provide privacy protection for transfers and exchanges of digital assets \xc2\xb7 Provide anonymous protection of digital asset holders Functional Extensibility \xc2\xb7 Become a distributed platform for the 1 3/ Design Objectives In order to build a more widely spread block chain technology and digital asset applications Wanchain has set the following objectives based on the research on cross chain technolo gy combined with the characteristics of decentralization and its application scenarios exchange of various digital currencies

providing an nisms for smart contract token transactions di\xef\xac\x80erent blockchains the inter ledger transinfrastructure for \xef\xac\x81nancial applications based on digital currencies and digital assets We seek to give full play to the blockchain function of carrying and transferring value and native coins supports smart contracts and has privacy protection mechaAny developer may develop applications on Wanchain in accordance with its application development standards the equal and open concept of blockchain From a blockchain technology development perspective multi party Wanchain applies computation secure threshold secret sharing a ring signature scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography a one time account generation mechanism and many other cutting edge cryptographic technologies Wanchain also solves the privacy protection problem of smart contract token transactions To some extent Wanchain is an advanced cryptographic applica tion that solves the real problems of blockchains and represents the developmental direction of the blockchain technologies Wanchain has a professional cryptography research team to apply cryptography to the blockchain \xef\xac\x81eld and contribute to the industry as a whole From a blockchain application perspective Wanchain is more than just a blockchain project of achieving cross chain transactions and interoperability of multiple blockchains Wanchain is a complete blockchain develop ment platform Wanchain achieves the function of cross chain transactions but it is also a blockchain running independently it 2/ Wanchain Architecture and Technology Wanchain provides an infrastructure for cross chain transfers between di\xef\xac\x80erent blockchain networks Wanchain is a distributed ledger that \xc2\xb7 achieves the interconnection and interoperability between di\xef\xac\x80erent blockchain networks \xc2\xb7 completes records of cross chain transactions \xc2\xb7 maintains cross chain transaction details Wanchain supports cross chain transactions between mainstream public chains between private chains and between public and private chains 04 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD Figure 2 1 Model of Wanchain 2 1/ Architecture 2 1 1 Distributed Ledger and Smart Contract Virtual Machine Wanchain is an Ethereum based generic ledger that runs applications independently with account models and smart contracts that implement various original Ethereum functions On top of those we added cross chain transactions and achieved smart contract token privacy protection 2 1 2 Native Coin Wancoin is the native coin of Wanchain Both cross and intra chain transactions consume a certain amount of Wancoin Wancoin is also used in security deposits for the cross chain veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes 2 1 3 Consensus Mechanism Wanchain adopts a Proof of Stake (POS) consensus mechanism for ordinary transac tions and implements consensus and incentive mechanisms for cross chain transactions These mechanisms are discussed in the following sections 2 1 4 Intra Chain Transactions Common transaction methods in Wanchain are the same as in Ethereum but we have added a privacy protection mechanism that is implemented through a ring signature scheme and a one time account mechanism 2 1 5 Cross Chain Integration Both blockchains and assets that integrate with Wanchain \xef\xac\x81rst need to be registered on Wan chain to make sure that they can be uniquely identi\xef\xac\x81ed These functions are completed via chain and asset registration protocols For cross chain transactions we use secure multi party computing and threshold secret sharing joint anchoring schemes to achieveminimal cost integration through the cross chain communication protocol without 05 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD changing the original chain\xe2\x80\x99s implementation Wanchain is a complete platform that can be applied to broad \xef\xac\x81nancial applica ensure that the original chain assets can still be traded on Wanchain tions with privacy protection for smart In order to describe the transfer of assets private chains What\xe2\x80\x99s more important is illustrate an example using Ethereum contract token transactions of public and that other blockchains developed on Wanchain are equivalent to the homogeneous blockchains of Wanchain and have the same cross chain mechanism and seamless integration with each other 2 1 6 Cross Chain Transactions When an unregistered asset is transferred from the original chain to Wanchain Wan chain will create a new asset using a built in asset template to deploy a new smart contract based on the cross chain transac tion information When a registered asset is transferred from the original chain to Wanchain Wanchain will issue the corresponding equivalent tokens in the existing contracts to between a public chain and Wanchain we\xe2\x80\x99ll Transfer In Process Alice and Bob have accounts on Ethereum and Wanchain respec tively and Alice needs to transfer 10 ETH to Bob Alice makes a cross chain transaction request using the Wanchain wallet and initiates a transfer on Ethereum with the recipient being an Ethereum cross chain Locked Account Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s validator node receives the cross chain transaction request veri\xef\xac\x81es that the transaction has been recorded on Ethereum and creates a new smart contract token ETH\xe2\x80\xb2 (ether prime) on Wanchain which corre sponds to the ETH needing to be cross transferred to Bob on Wanchain Figure 2 2 Cross Chain Transaction From Ethereum to Wanchain 06 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD Transfer Back Process Bob wants to trans fer the 10 ETH he received from Alice to Chris Bob uses his Wanchain wallet to initiate a cross chain transaction with the ETH\xe2\x80\xb2 asset contract Upon receiving the request the validator node locks the corresponding 10 ETH\xe2\x80\xb2 assets After successfully locking the assets the validator node uses the threshold secret sharing mechanism to create an Ethereum transaction with the transferor being the Locked Account that was previ ously locked by Alice\xe2\x80\x99s assets and the transferee being Chris\xe2\x80\x99s account on Ethereum After the validator node veri\xef\xac\x81es the con\xef\xac\x81rmed transaction on Ethereum the 10 ETH\xe2\x80\xb2 locked under Bob\xe2\x80\x99s account will be cleared meaning the equivalent asset is transferred back to the original chain Figure 2 3 Cross Chain Transaction from Wanchain to Ethereum The above describes the asset transfer in and 2 2 1 Fully Decentralized and No Trust and the public chain which is essentially the Currently most cross chain transactions are transfer back processes between Wanchain same as that between Wanchain and the private chain For details of the asset transfer process and data transmission process please refer to Section 3 2 Cross Chain Transaction Data Transmission Process 2 2/ Technology ed Third Party Participation conducted through exchanges and third par ty trading platforms But the blockchain cross chain transaction platforms need the involvement of a third party custodian account This leaves the secure and smooth completion of the entire transaction to the reliability of third party participants The locked account mechanism of Wanchain 07 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD uses fully decentralized multi party computing and threshold secret sharing technology to perform the account management without the need of any third party participation or credit endorsement of any entities 2 2 2 Unmodi\xef\xac\x81ed Original Chain and Low Integration Threshold curve cryptography to ensure the security of the original signature solution Wanchain uses \xc2\xb7 threshold secret sharing technology \xc2\xb7 the locked account management solution based on multi party computing In our cross chain

are automatically network of the original chain after reconstruc and don\xe2\x80\x99t need coordination from transac transaction data is transmitted into the node tion and integration on the Wanchain validator node The format of the validator node is in line with the transaction type requirements This enables certain operations and computations of cross chain transactions to be completed done between validator nodes of Wanchain tion participants after initiating a cross chain transaction This leaves the smooth operation of the entire system to the security of cryptographic algorithms within the Wanchain network without the 2 2 4 Cross Chain Transaction Privacy mechanisms This allows existing public and In Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s cross chain transaction solu need to modify the various original chain private chains based on other platforms to be integrated with Wanchain with a low integra tion threshold thus reducing the cost of cross chain transactions 2 2 3 Cryptography Guarantee Mechanisms used Based by Security many existing cross chain exchanges often use logical security relying on participants to look out for their own self interest In other words the participants will not break the cross chain transactions at the expense of damaging their own interests This can be called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hypothesis of Rational Participants\xe2\x80\x9d In addition to the application of original elliptic Protection tion assets on the original chain exist in the form of smart contract tokens after they are transferred into Wanchain On one hand we hide the initiators of smart contract token transactions in a collection of accounts via ring signature technology so that they are not traceable On the other hand we allow one time use of accounts in smart contracts so the corresponding relationship with the original account on Wanchain cannot be established By using a combination of the above two methods Wanchain achieves the con\xef\xac\x81dentiality of smart contract token transactions allows cross chain transactions of assets under privacy protection expands application scenarios and provides a better user experience 08 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 3/ Cross Chain Communication Protocol The Wanchain cross chain communication The \xef\xac\x81rst function is that the user on the origi transmission between Wanchain and other request to Wanchain This is the starting point protocol de\xef\xac\x81nes the speci\xef\xac\x81cations for data chains allowing interconnections and data \xef\xac\x82ow between chains The following paragraphs describe the module functions and data transmission processes 3 1/ Functional Modules The cross chain communication protocol consists of three functional modules Registration module this module provides two functions The \xef\xac\x81rst is to register the original chain partici pating in cross chain transactions This generates a unique ID through speci\xef\xac\x81c algorithm rules for the original chain maintaining the ID registry of the original chains to avoid fraud caused by false chains The second function is to register the asset to be transferred This generates a unique ID through speci\xef\xac\x81c algorithm rules for the asset to ensure the uniqueness of the assets Cross chain Transaction Data Transmission Module this module provides three functions nal chain makes the cross chain transaction of the Wanchain asset transfer in transaction The second function is the acknowledge ment of receipt of Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s validator node returning success or not The third function is that Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s validator node sends the legal transaction to the original chain to complete the transfer back process Transaction Status Query Module this module mainly provides the function of que rying the con\xef\xac\x81rmation status of the asset transfer in transaction on the original chain to Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s locked account and the trans fer back transaction of Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s locked account to the original chain These are the control marks of the cross chain transaction progress 3 2/ Data Process Transmission Here we take the user Alice who wants to transfer value from an original (Ori) chain to Wanchain as an example to illustrate the asset transfer in data transmission process 09 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD Step1\xef\xbc\x9a Alice initiates a transaction OriTx with her OriAccount on the original chain to send an asset OriAssetID to Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s locked account LockedAccount and broadcasts the cross chain transaction request InterTxReq to Wanchain via the cross chain transaction data transmission module The function takes the transaction data as parameters such that OriTxInfo=(OriBlockNum OriTx) InterTxReq=(OriAccount OriChainID OriAssetID value OriTxInfo sig) Step2\xef\xbc\x9a\xef\xbc\x9aThe cross chain transaction proof node (Voucher) on Wanchain receives a cross chain transaction request and checks whether the transaction has been con\xef\xac\x81rmed on the original chain through the transaction status query module The function Token Locked Flag (TLF) takes OriTxInfo OriChainID and OriAssetID as parameters such that TLF=CheckCommitment(OriChainID OriAssetID OriTxInfo) Step3\xef\xbc\x9a The cross chain transaction proof node (Voucher) gathers consensus on the TLF results and if TLF=true then OriTx has been con\xef\xac\x81rmed The veri\xef\xac\x81cation node (Validator) receives the data TLF=true and then checks the asset registry of the original chain If it is a new asset the asset will be registered and added into the registry The public account WANAccount maintained by the Validator initiates a transaction WANTx deploys a smart contract for the new asset and distributes tokens of Value for OriAccount in the contract If it is a registered asset the transaction WANTx distributes tokens of Value for OriAccount directly into the existing asset contract If WANTx is con\xef\xac\x81rmed the Validator uses the cross chain transaction data transmission module to reply to Alice about the successful receipt of the cross chain transaction response=(WANAccount InterTxReq True addressSC sigvalidator) If WANTx becomes invalid the locked account management node (Storeman) initiates a transaction on the original chain to transfer Alice\xe2\x80\x99s locked asset back to her account OriAccount If the consensus result for TLF is con\xef\xac\x81rmed by the Voucher as false the cross chain transaction is considered invalid

out false TLF Ture and consensus reached Validator Generate UnlockedOriTx (ETH) Step3 InterTxReq Generate WANTx Storeman Timeout False WANTx True WITxReq committed Figure 3 1 Cross Chain Data Process from Ethereum to Wanchain In the next example we have user Bob transferring Value from Wanchain back to the original chain to illustrate the asset transfer back data transmission process Step1\xef\xbc\x9aBob uses BobAccount on Wanchain to send the transaction WANTx which calls the asset transfer back function of the smart contract corresponding to the asset of the original chain Step2\xef\xbc\x9a The Validator calls the smart contract after receiving the transaction The Voucher tests the results of the contract execution and gathers consensus If TLF=true which means that the token value for Bob in the contract has been locked the Storeman then broadcasts the transac tion of Locked Account which transfers Value to BobAccount on the original chain via the cross chain transaction data transmission module OriTx=(LockedAccount BobAccount value sigstoreman) The Voucher checks whether this transfer is con\xef\xac\x81rmed via the transaction status query module and gathers consensus on con\xef\xac\x81rmation \xef\xac\x82ag TL F Step3\xef\xbc\x9a If the Token Unlocked Flag (TUF) = true the Validator will clear the assets locked in the smart contract if TUF=false it means that transaction on the original chain is not con\xef\xac\x81rmed and the Storeman will re initiate the transaction 11 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD Bob WAN Wallet Step 1

2 Cross Chain Data Process from Wanchain to Ethereum 4/ Key Technologies 4 1/ Veri\xef\xac\x81cation Node Consensus Mechanism Wanchain adopts the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm the description of which can be found in a series of papers from Ethereum so it is not detailed here Theoretically the Proof of Work (POW) consensus algorithm is is subject to the threat of 51% power attack while similarly the POS consensus algorithm is theoretically subject to a threat of collusion attack of participants As a result Wanchain introduces this mechanism to increase the opportunity cost of veri\xef\xac\x81cation node collusion allowing Wanchain to record cross chain transactions faithfully and follow cross chain processes objectively the 12 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD In short the veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes on Wanchain are divided into three categories \xc2\xb7Cross chain transaction proof nodes (Vouchers) network i e where the gains for collusion are greater than the opportunity cost the risk of collusion between veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes will increase \xc2\xb7 Locked account management nodes (Store On the contrary when the overall value of the \xc2\xb7 General veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes (Validators) between veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes means giving up men) Vouchers are used to provide proof of transac tions between the original account and the locked account A Voucher is required to pay a certain security deposit The higher the deposit the greater chance the proof if provides will be adopted If the proof is found to be false the security deposit will be deducted from the holding account and the authorization of the Voucher is revoked The Storeman upon receiving a notice is responsible for computing the signature shares according to its own part of the key and merging the signatures parts into a complete signature for the lock account When this is done operations related to the locked account are performed (see the speci\xef\xac\x81c process in section 4 3) The Validator informs the Storeman of opera Wanchain is su\xef\xac\x83ciently high collusion margin held by them that are staked to the tokens on Wanchain greatly increasing the opportunity cost of collusion The nodes will not collude to destroy the entire network for cross chain asset risking their existing interests and long term income thus reducing the risk of collusion Furthermore the more cross chain transactions are involved in the Wanchain the great er the value carried by Wanchain The higher the risk for veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes to collude the more secure the entire network which will attract more and more cross chain transactions This is an interactive process with the value transferring to the Wanchain network Wanchain is bound to become increasingly robust tional actions related to the locked account 4 2/ Incentive Mechanism Wanchain whenever a transaction proof 4 2 1 Veri\xef\xac\x81cation Nodes and complete the record of operations on the reaches a consensus The security of the Wanchain network depends on its overall value When the value of all cross chain transactions is far greater than the overall value of the Wanchain The Vouchers receive transaction fees from the corresponding shares as a security deposit If the proof provided is found to be false the security deposit is deducted from the holding account and the node authority status will be revoked 13 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD A Validator completes the recording of transac Such an incentive mechanism ensures that tion fees lated bene\xef\xac\x81ts while also motivating them to tions on Wanchain to gain a part of the transacA Storeman receives a corresponding key share according to the stake it holds and calcu lates the corresponding signature share to be added into the transaction The Storeman obtains the transaction fee involved in the veri\xef\xac\x81cation transaction according to the key share proportion If the key share information is o\xef\xac\x84ine or lost the transaction fee cannot be claimed Likewise if the nodes sign the error transaction the credentials of the Storeman will also be taken away In summary the veri\xef\xac\x81cation node incentive stakeholders in Wanchain can earn stake re entrust their stakes to trusted veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes This improves the security and stability of Wanchain 4 3/ Locked Account Generation Scheme The Locked Account Generation Scheme is based on secure multi party computation and threshold key sharing mechanism will motivate the Vouchers to 4 3 1 Introduction tors to complete the recording of Wanchain theoretical basis of distributed cryptography provide correct transaction proof the Valida faithfully and the Storemen to stay online and safely keep their own key shares 4 2 2 General Nodes Only those holding a high enough stake in the Wanchain network can become a veri\xef\xac\x81cation node Nodes that fail to be veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes are known as general nodes The general nodes cannot participate in the veri\xef\xac\x81cation Secure multi party computation is both the and a fundamental problem of distributed computing The theory arises from \xe2\x80\x9cYao\xe2\x80\x99s Millionaires\xe2\x80\x99Problem\xe2\x80\x9din 1982 Simply speaking secure multi party computation is about a group of participants referred as P1\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbdPn who work together to compute the function f(x1 \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd xn )=(y1 \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd yn) securely Then inputs of function f are held one each by n participants Pi holds the secret input xi and after process of cross chain transactions but they computation Pi gets output yi In this situa veri\xef\xac\x81cation nodes The entrusted veri\xef\xac\x81cation participants cheat in the computing process can entrust the stakes they hold to the trusted nodes distribute the transaction fees they receive to the general nodes in proportion to the entrusted stakes If the entrusted veri\xef\xac\x81ca tion node is punished general nodes will bear a corresponding loss tion security requires that even if some the correctness of the computing result must be ensured This means that when computa tions are completed every participant must get the correct output yi and all input from participants remain privileged Pi can get no 14 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD extra information except (xi yi) through the computation The threshold key sharing scheme is designed to solve the secure key management problem According to design principles of modern minimum collection of k key shares are needed to reconstruct the key Thus any operation on an account will require at least k participants\xe2\x80\x99participation to ensure the account is secure and trustworthy cryptography the security of cryptography 4 3 2 Design Description mised secure keys will ruin the security of Scheme based on secure multi party compu

parties with di\xef\xac\x80erent interests securely managing the distribution of the keys can be di\xef\xac\x83cult To solve this problem Israeli cryptographer Adi Shamir proposed the Shamir\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Sharing threshold key sharing scheme In this scheme a key is divided into n pieces and distributed to n participants Every participant holds one piece of the key share a We designed the Locked Account Generation tation and threshold key sharing Validators of Wanchain (Storemen) are in charge of maintenance and management of the keys of the Locked Accounts to ensure they are secure and trustworthy In addition this mechanism lowers the risk of losing keys and has strong adaptability and stability in an ad hoc network which has no \xef\xac\x81xed topology The Locked Account Generation Scheme is as follows Step1\xef\xbc\x9aSelect a secure random number There are n validators on Wanchain named as P\xe2\x82\x81\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6Pn Each validator selects a secure random number di and k degree polynomial fi (x)=di+ai 1 x+\xe2\x8b\xaf+ai k 1x The scheme sends fi (j)to other k 1 validators through secure channel and broadcasts di G to every node of the network G being the base point of the elliptic curve Step2\xef\xbc\x9aCheck the correctness of the messages After receiving other validators\xe2\x80\x99messages Pj will check the correctness of the messages \xef\xbf\xbdlag=Check(f\xe2\x82\x81 (j) \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 fn (j)) If \xef\xac\x82ag=true then Pj accepts and saves it locally 15 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD If \xef\xac\x82ag=false then Pj rejects it and requires other validators to resend the messages Step3 Receive key share When all messages are sent and checked out then every validator gets their key share key_sharek=\xe2\x88\x91(j=1) fj (k) \xef\xbc\x8ck=1 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 n Step4 Compute the address of the Locked Account Locked_Account_Address=GenerateAddress(d\xe2\x82\x81 G \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 dn G) n After all the operations above the Locked Account is generated and its key is divided into n key shares and then distributed to n validators of Wanchain Any operation on the Locked Account will require at least k of n validators\xe2\x80\x99participation to complete Figure 4 1 Generating Locked Account\xe2\x80\x99s Address 16 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 4 3 3 Scheme Generation During the generation process of the Locked Account the private key is never generated or reconstructed in the entire network Generating the signature of the Locked Account needs at least k validators\xe2\x80\x99participation They compute the signature shares separately through the key shares they hold and then reconstruct the full signature using signature shares The Locked Account Signature Scheme is as follows Step1\xef\xbc\x9aCompute the Signature Shares A quantity of n Wanchain Validators compute signature shares of the message using key shares they hold signature_sharej=Generate_Sig(m key_sharej) Step2\xef\xbc\x9aSend out the signatures shares Each Validator sends its signature share to other Validators Step3\xef\xbc\x9aReconstruct and broadcast the complete signature When a Validator receives more than k signature shares it will reconstruct the full signature and broadcast it to other Validators signature=Construct_Sig(signature_share\xe2\x82\x81 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 signature_sharek) Step 4 The full signature of Locked Account is generated Figure 4 1 Generating Locked Account\xe2\x80\x99s signature 17 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 4 3 4 Advantages the whole system operates with stability and need a mechanism to lock the assets of the where some part of network paralyzes or lose Almost all cross chain transaction schemes original chain Only when the triggering condition is met will the locked assets be unlocked and returned to the original account or some other account Existing mechanisms use the Hashed security even in unforeseen circumstance some key shares At the same time the key share of every validator is updated periodical ly or when a triggering condition is met in order to eliminate the threat caused by key share exposure TimeLock Contract scheme the Trusted \xc2\xb7 Easy Integration and E\xef\xac\x83cient Data Stor Multi Signature Account scheme Any operation on the Locked Account is done Third Party Escrow Account scheme and the Compared to these mechanisms the Locked Account scheme has several advantages \xc2\xb7 Fully Decentralized without Third Party Participation The Locked Account is generated through secure multi party computation In this process no participation or endorsement of a trusted third party is needed All we need is information interaction and computation by Validators through secure channels Compared to the trusted third party escrow account scheme the Locked Account generation scheme has a lower age by the original transaction of the original chain No new transaction type or veri\xef\xac\x81cation mechanism is added So theoretically any chain can be integrated with Wanchain and the cost is negligible At the same time com pared to the multi signature account scheme that relies on the logic of smart contracts to achieve multiparty management the Locked Account generation scheme achieves multiparty management through principles of cryptography The \xef\xac\x81nal transaction has only one signature not several signatures Thus this mechanism is more e\xef\xac\x83cient on data storage cost and more \xef\xac\x82exibility \xc2\xb7 Secure and stable The key for the Locked Account is distributed to validators of Wanchain through Shamir\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Sharing Scheme (a k a Shamir\xe2\x80\x99s (k 4 4/ Smart Contract Token Transaction Anonymity n) threshold secret sharing scheme) Each On Wanchain ring signature and one time Even when some Validators are o\xef\xac\x84ine or lose nymity in smart contract token transactions Validator holds one piece of the key share their key shares the signature of the Locked Account can still be generated and the trans action can be executed with the participation of at least k validators Therefore the Locked Account generation scheme can ensure that accounts are implemented to achieve ano Ring signature mixes the transaction sender in a set of fake members to make the sender untraceable A one time account is generated for each transaction so it cannot be linked to the true owner 18 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 4 4 1 One Time Account System key To create a one time main account she As a foundation for anonymity the one time generates a new account (B b) The main user has only one main account and lots of (A B) main private key (a b) and scan key account system is especially important Each sub accounts So if anyone wants to keep anonymous in a smart contract token transaction he needs to generate an associated account to create a one time main account together with his original one On Wanchain Alice has an original account (A a) A is the public key and a is the private account is ((A B) (a b)) with main public key (A b) Usually a sub account is generated by a transaction sender for the receiver For exam ple Bob wants to send some tokens to Alice He invokes the function OTA_GenerateAc count( ) with Alice`s main account as a parameter to generate Alice`s sub account (A1 S1) (A\xe2\x82\x81 S\xe2\x82\x81 )=OTA_GenerateAccount((A B)) Alice invokes the function OTA_ScanAccount( ) with her own scan key to scan every sub account (Ai Si) \xef\xbf\xbdlag=OTA_ScanAccount((Ai Si ) (A b)) When it comes to (A\xe2\x82\x81 S\xe2\x82\x81) the \xef\xac\x82ag returns true So (A\xe2\x82\x81 S\xe2\x82\x81) belongs to Alice She invokes the function OTA_GetPrivateKey( ) with her main private key to get the private key of (A\xe2\x82\x81 S\xe2\x82\x81) sk=OTA_GetPrivateKey((A\xe2\x82\x81 S\xe2\x82\x81 ) (a b)) In the One time account system the scan key helps Alice learn which sub account belongs to her and the main private key guarantees that she is the only one who can get the private key No one could change the owner of a sub account without the associated scan key and get the private key without main private key Therefore anonymity and security is guaranteed 19 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD Figure 4 3 One Time Account System 4 4 2 Ring Signature Scheme The Ring Signature scheme was \xef\xac\x81rst provided in 2001 by Rivest and others It is a special kind of Group Signature scheme A Group Signature scheme needs a trusted center and secure setup which would mean that the signer can be traced by the trust center The Ring Signature scheme solves this serious problem by removing the trusted center and secure setup Since the Ring Signature scheme was introduced many practical schemes have been designed based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) such as the trapdoor technique Generally speaking there are four kinds of Ring Signature schemes Trapdoor Ring Signature Linkable Ring Signature Anonymity Revocable Ring Signature and Deniable Ring Signature To provide anonymity in Smart Contract Token transactions the Ring Signature scheme based on ECC is implemented in Wanchain There are three parts to the Ring Signature scheme Details are as below taking the signer (P x) as an example 20 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD GEN\xef\xbc\x9aGet the public parameters The signer generates a public key set including n members from the world state through the function GeneratePublicKeySet( ) with the public key as a parameter publickeyset=GeneratePublicKeySet(P) The signer makes a key image I by invoking GenerateKeyImage( ) with the public key and private key I=GenerateKeyImage((P x)) SIG\xef\xbc\x9aGenerate the ring signature The signer generates the ring signature of message m through GenerateRingSignature( ) with publickeyset I and x ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m publickeyset I x) VER\xef\xbc\x9aVerify the ring signature The signer veri\xef\xac\x81es the ring signature of message m through VerifyRingSignature( ) which returns true or false with publickeyset I and ringsig \xef\xbf\xbdlag=VerifyRingSignature(m publickeyset I ringsig) If the \xef\xac\x82ag is true the ring signature is valid Otherwise it`s invalid In the Ring Signature scheme the key image and ring signature cannot be matched with the signer who is among the publickeyset Anyone can verify whether the signature is valid or not but no one is able to identify the signer Figure 4 4 Ring Signature 21 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD 4 4 3 Privacy Protection Transaction Flow Alice wants to send some tokens to Carl in the smart contract whose address is SCAddress Alice`s main account is (A B) with main private key (a b) Carl`s main account is (C D) with the main private key (c d) Alice has a sub account Onetime_account1 with the private key sk1 in the smart contract The transaction \xef\xac\x82ow is as follows Alice sends a transaction Step1\xef\xbc\x9aAlice generates a one time account for Carl with his main account Onetime_account2=OTA_GenerateAccount((C D)) Step2\xef\xbc\x9aAlice generates the signature for the transaction data in the smart contract through GenerateSignature( ) with sk1 and makes the \xef\xac\x81nal data Payload sig=GenerateSignature(Onetime_account1 Onetime_account2 value nonce) Payload=(Onetime_account1 Onetime_account2 value nonce sig) Step3\xef\xbc\x9aAlice generates the public key set publickeyset\xef\xbc\x9dGeneratePublicKeySet(A) Step4\xef\xbc\x9aAlice generates the key image and makes the transaction message m I=GenerateKeyImage((A a)) m=(publickeyset SC_Address Payload) Step5\xef\xbc\x9aAlice generates the ring signature and makes the \xef\xac\x81nal transaction data ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m publickeyset I a) transaction=(publickeyset SCAddress Payload I ringsig) Step6\xef\xbc\x9aAlice broadcasts transaction on the Wanchain The Validator veri\xef\xac\x81es a transaction Step1\xef\xbc\x9a The Validator receives transaction and makes the transaction data m to verify the ring signature m=(publickeyset SC_Address Payload) \xef\xbf\xbdlag=VerifyRingSignature(m publickeyset I ringsig) 22 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD Step2\xef\xbc\x9aIf \xef\xac\x82ag is true the Validator goes to step 3 Otherwise the transaction is invalid and thrown out Step3\xef\xbc\x9a The Validator invokes the smart contract with Payload as a parameter Then the smart contract veri\xef\xac\x81es the signature in Payload and executes the transfer After step 3 the transaction is committed on Wanchain Carl scans the sub accounts with his scan key and recognizes that Onetime_account2 belongs to himself Then he gets the private key for Onetime_account2 with his main private key Therefore he takes the tokens of Value 5/ Wanchain Applications 5 1/ Borrowing and Lending increase Take Ethereum (ETH) for example A As digital currency becomes an important create a deposit application and set the inter medium of value exchange and a value stor age carrier using it to create new value and generate income is an inevitable trend For example Bitcoin is used to invest in blockchain mining businesses and other ICO projects With the increasing number of applications for digital currency direct investment opportunities increased for digital currency have People who use digital currencies to create value need more digital currencies and people who hold digital currencies want to increase their value so the demand for borrowing and lending digital currencies will service provider uses a smart contract to est rate on Wanchain A user transfers ETH from the Ethereum blockchain to the corresponding Wanchain smart contract address through a cross chain transaction The deposit on Wanchain releases a correspond ing voucher (tokens on Wanchain that are similar to deposit bank receipts) to the user\xe2\x80\x99s account on Wanchain The smart contract then automatically calculates the interest When the user needs to withdraw the depos it the voucher will be transferred back to an intermediary address and a cross chain transaction is executed The ETH corresponding to the voucher is unlocked on the 23 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD original chain and transferred back to the intermediaries can achieve multi currency (the locked assets on the original chain corre tions via smart contracts The privacy protec original user\xe2\x80\x99s account The deposit reserves sponding to the intermediary address) are always transparent auction trading and one to one curb transac tion transaction mechanism on Wanchain provides support for transactions that require privacy protection Wanchain allows for importing digital currency into Wanchain 5 2/ Payment and Settlement More and more businesses accept digital launching private transactions on Wanchain and transferring digital currency back to the original chain To some extent the privacy protection of the original chain is achieved by masking the fund tracking paths assets like Bitcoin as a means of payment In the future there will be more applications in which a variety of digital currencies are used for payments Currently there are many payment methods such as VISA Paypal and Alipay each with their own payment proce 5 4/ Investment and Financing dures and settlement processes Wanchain is There is a trend toward traditional institutions grating di\xef\xac\x80erent banking ledgers into one as commercial bills loyalty points future a distributed multi currency platform inteuni\xef\xac\x81ed ledger Any business or user can install the Wanchain wallet to implement multi currency payments and settlements without having to install multiple digital currency wallets 5 3/ Transaction and Exchange At present the completion of digital currency exchange depends on centralized exchanges to use consortium chains to hold assets such earning rights accounts receivable and so on In the future more \xef\xac\x81nancial assets will be recorded on distributed ledgers based on consortium chains When these consortium chains are linked to Wanchain they become \xef\xac\x81nancial asset providers and the investors can use their digital currencies to buy these assets As in the traditional banking business it\ s akin to buying \xef\xac\x81nancial products in a bank The di\xef\xac\x80erence is that more intermediar ies can participate and that the asset holders can carry out \xef\xac\x81nancing directly and over the counter markets All transac An ICO has become an important means of intermediaries After multiple currencies are trend is spreading into non blockchain areas tions are based on trust of the exchanges and integrated with Wanchain the exchanges or \xef\xac\x81nancing in the blockchain space and this More and more projects especially the ones 24 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD based on Ethereum directly use smart In the \xef\xac\x81eld of digital currency banking busi process more transparent and fair But ICOs ing Blockchains progress in these \xef\xac\x81elds on contracts for ICO which makes the whole that only use Ether cause inconvenience to investors holding other digital currencies On Wanchain the ICO issuer can issue a smart contract that supports multi currency investments More conveniently investors can invest by using Ethereum Bitcoin or any other blockchain tokens integrated with Wanchain and issuers can more easily manage their funds Furthermore when a new blockchain is launched the conversion between the crowdfunded shares and the native currency can be completed via the Wanchain cross chain transactions With Wanchain we are entering an era of digital right issuance fully based on blockchain 5 5/ Other Applications The \xef\xac\x81nancial applications described above are intended to give readers a better understanding of the logic and value of Wanchain From these we can come up with more examples such as multi currency credit cards based on digital currency asset backed securities that package up a variety of assets Peer to Peer lending businesses based on digital currencies crowdfunding and so on Application of blockchain technology is regarded as an important strategy by major banks but they are investigating the technology to transform traditional business ness like currency exchange has been boom two parallel tracks but with the rise of digital assets and their increasing integration into the real economy these two tracks will even tually intersect Digital assets will be included in the banks\ balance sheets (banks that support the loan and deposit of digital assets) and the banks\ balance sheets will be partially transferred to blockchains (\xef\xac\x81at money is represented and accounted by blockchain tokens) Wanchain\xe2\x80\x99s inter ledger technologies will support this future integration 25 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD Conclusion In this paper we put forth the concept of a the traditional industries As the proportion of future\xe2\x80\x9cbank\xe2\x80\x9d The term\xe2\x80\x9cbank\xe2\x80\x9dis an analogy digital currency in the economy increases standing of the concept Abstracting block will \xef\xac\x82ourish Of course given time traditional used to give readers a more intuitive underchain technology from the concept of Bitcoin into a neutral technology greatly improved the global popularization and application of blockchain however it still faces huge obsta cles It\xe2\x80\x99s risky and expensive for traditional new \xef\xac\x81nancial industries based digital currency banks will join the digital currency economy in their own ways and a \xef\xac\x81nancial ecosystem inte grating traditional assets with digital assets will gradually be developed banks to solve existing business problems by Wanchain aims to design a new decentralized unlikely and unwilling to take such a big risk exchange of value among di\xef\xac\x80erent blockchain using blockchains Decision makers are due to investor return expectations and for just one bank to change is not enough The \xef\xac\x81nancial framework based on digital currency is like traditional banking at the busi ness level but is di\xef\xac\x80erent in its nature and organization This is similar to what occured at the inception of ecommerce which did not sprout from traditional industries but generated new commercial modalities that changed \xef\xac\x81nancial infrastructure that allows the networks Based on this new model interme diaries will develop their own \xef\xac\x81nancial services and build a distributed super \xef\xac\x81nancial market via Wanchain We believe that a \xef\xac\x82exible decentralized value exchange system is the future of the \xef\xac\x81nancial infrastructure and will help to promote \xef\xac\x81nancial inclusion and standardize future \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions 26 \x0cWANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD References \xef\xbc\xbb1\xef\xbc\xbd NAKAMOTO S Bitcoin A
