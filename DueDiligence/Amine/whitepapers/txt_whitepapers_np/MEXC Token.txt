medical care and transportation services to hospitals and medical facilities The rise in demand for emergency medical services has led to the growth in the ambulance equipment market This accelerated demand is partly due to the recession which led to a large number of people losing their health insurance coverage As a result many of these individual\xe2\x80\x99s health issues escalated into conditions requiring emergency medical services Another factor driving the growth of this market is the increase in the ageing population and consequently the increase of chronic health issues that require emergency healthcare services The population of people age 65 and older will continue to grow throughout 2018 and will impact the growth of this market in future 1 MEXC Initial Coin O\xef\xac\x80ering (ICO) is a unique creation of forward purchase Utility Token for the users in the EMS industry The players in the industry would use the MEXC Token indirectly to purchase patented and patent pending equipment and services to save lives The MEXC Token has its own eco system from the use of the token to purchase EMS products and services to the exchange of the MEXC Tokens with other tokens or fiat currency in a peer to peer (P2P) marketplace called MX P2P Exchanger P2P Exchanger is a unique P2P exchange system that empowers them to do that between their peers without incurring high cost and other limitations2 The buyers of the MEXC Tokens during this ICO benefit from the low price o\xef\xac\x80erings of the tokens which they can trade later in the marketplace either at participating 1 in verbatim with minor modifications from BCC Research Chapter 2 2 MX p2p Exchanger is pure peer to peer exchanger where participants control their own private keys \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 9 exchangers3 or with EMS players in the industry through MX P2P Exchanger Think of it as buying a low cost airline ticket 1 year in advance where you can enjoy a low price to go from point A to point B This pricing strategy is used by low cost airlines around the world Those who booked closer to the travel date have to pay the full market price for the ticket Unlike the airline industry where the ticket purchased cannot be transferred to other parties MEXC Tokens can be freely transferred to another party at an agreed price prior to purchasing the patented equipments or services from us The price o\xef\xac\x80ered during the ICO is part of the \xe2\x80\x9cDynamic Pricing Strategy\xe2\x80\x9d that we o\xef\xac\x80ered to our MEXC early backers After the ICO has ended the MEXC Tokens can only be purchased from the participating exchangers or MEXC buyers who purchased during the ICO period through MX P2P Exchanger As our EMS products and services are priced in MX the EMS industry players can use the MX P2P Exchanger to convert the MEXC Tokens to MX tokens prior to purchasing our products and services 3 MEXC participating exchangers shall be announced within a month or earlier after the ICO has ended \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 10 EMS Overview Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provides

services by giving crypto holders a chance to be part of this huge market As the patents copyrights and industrial designs belong to us we can lower the cost of EMS products and services from the support of our MEXC backers MEXC Program is created mainly to reduce the price points for EMS products and services by \xe2\x80\xa2 Continuing our R&D trials and acceptance for a\xef\xac\x80ordable

participate in this EMS industry especially during the ICO period by purchasing MEXC Tokens at discounted price The MEXC Tokens can be traded at participating exchangers once the ICO has ended The EMS industry players have to purchase our patent pending EMS products and services only by using MX Token an internal token to be used in Medical industry MX Token can only be obtained by purchasing the MEXC Tokens from the existing token holders and convert them into MX Tokens from MEXC Tokens via our MX P2P Exchanger This is another avenue for our early backers and MEXC Token holders to cash out their MEXC Tokens rather than just relying on the participating exchangers \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 19 Products Pricing All these products have been used

Value Our EMS patent pending products and services are priced in MX MX Token represents Medical Industry de facto standard tokens that is pegged to the US dollar 1MX \xe2\x89\xa1 1USD The fundamental reason for the products to be priced in MX is that MEXC Tokens or any other participating tokens in the future theoretically appreciate in values in the course of time As such if the products are priced in the MEXC Token itself the EMS products and services would be more expensive over time With MX Tokens as the internal tokens the amount of MEXC Tokens to be used to purchase our patented products and services shall decrease (or increase) without a\xef\xac\x80ecting the price to the end users M \xe2\x88\x91 n=0 ME XCn \xe2\x8b\x85 PMEXC = K \xe2\x88\x91 j=0 MXj (1) T PMEXC = \xe2\x88\x91x=0 Px T (2) The conversion from MEXC Tokens to MX Tokens is done at MX P2P Exchanger as per the equations above The total number of MEXC Tokens (ME XCn) multiplied with the price of MEXC token (PMEXC) at the time of exchange would yield the number of MX Tokens (MXj) to be used for further purchases of EMS products and services as per equation 1 The PMEXC is calculated as the average price of all the participating exchangers For a number of T exchangers the price of MEXC Token in each exchanger (Px) are summed up and divided by the number of exchangers (T) as per equation 2 \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 22 MX P2P Exchanger is an online service provided by us whereby the exchange of tokens can be done using fiat money by bank transfer or

US Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 those transactions are considered securities and therefore subject to certain disclosure and registrations requirements Under the Howey Test a transaction is an investment contract if 1 It is an investment of money 2 There is an expectation of profits from the investment 3 The investment of money is in a common enterprise 4 Any profit comes from the e\xef\xac\x80orts of promoter or third party MEXC Token is not an investment contract but just a Utility Token sold in Ether10 as a forward purchase of our EMS products and services It can be transferred to other individuals or entities freely The token holders purchase MEXC Tokens at a discounted price during the ICO period and can resell the MEXC Tokens to EMS players in order for them to purchase our EMS products and services at market price Please refer to Appendix A for a more detailed Howey Test scenarios 9 What Is the Howey Test http //consumer findlaw

PAPER 24 The MEXC Economy The MEXC Economy is a full loop eco system that connects the buyers of MEXC Tokens during ICO as well as post ICO at participating exchangers to the industry players in the EMS industry to purchase our patent pending EMS products and services using MX Tokens It addresses the volatility of the token prices by introducing the internal token MX Token to dampen the e\xef\xac\x80ects on price volatilities when mapping real world products and services to fixed price points It also provides exchange solutions whereby prior to this all tokens have to be converted to Bitcoin or Ethereum before they can be cashed out to fiat currency With the clamp downs on crypto currency especially Bitcoin token holders are limited by available avenues to exchange their tokens from crypto to fiat With MX P2P Exchanger MEXC Token holders can swap or exchange their EMS Tokens directly to fiat currency in a peer to peer fashion This is among the first in ERC20 tokens A blockchain based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform is another novelty It is a decentralised ERP system whereby all processes from the sales to the manufacturing and to the delivery of the products are mapped tracked and monitored to ensure transparent non repudiation process as well as secure traceability on the Ethereum Network through the use of Ethereum Smart Contracts These smart contracts are being queried via DApp that can be accessed via Mobile Application or even through the Chrome Web Browser itself This is also the first in the EMS industry \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 25 With the use of decentralised ERP we can achieve more such as \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralised Manufacturing decentralised manufacturing ensures e\xef\xac\x83cient resources are being used Only the core components should be manufactured directly by us while the rest of the components and assemblies should be done at a location where there is a price advantage over material costs and finishing This should lower the price to the end users by locality \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralised Marketing we can make our marketing e\xef\xac\x80orts more e\xef\xac\x83cient by targeting specific needs and concerns for each geographical location Only the local distributor knows the a\xef\xac\x80ordability of the local market The price point is set by us based on the local a\xef\xac\x80ordability \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralised Distributions we can orchestrate the distribution in a transparent immutable and secure traceability through the use of our Decentralised ERP on Blockchain No single conglomerate can control and manipulate the prices to their advantage These benefits are then plowed back to the community where more e\xef\xac\x83cient cheaper and transparent EMS products and services could be delivered to the masses \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 26 MEXC Economy consists of a few components \xe2\x80\xa2 The MEXC Tokens where

transactions The future ability to trace all actions taken during emergency services is quite vital especially for the non repudiation in the insurance industry Research and Development in this field is expensive and expansive in nature 17 We hope that MEXC Tokens could democratise the usage as well as the development of new products and services at a lower price point than it is now Appreciation of MEXC Token price in the marketplace can ensure that further development of new products and services is not an illusion anymore but could be achieved when everybody is collaborating through decentralisation At a market size of $6 8 billion USD this year we are addressing a huge market potential where no financial institution could facilitate the capital needed to address the industry especially when aiming for a\xef\xac\x80ordable EMS products and services 17 All products are to be tested and certified which are costly in terms of money and time before they are deemed fit to be used in EMS and Medical industry \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 35 References Abad P L (1982) Approach to decentralized marketing production planning International

Our overall risk score is 30 which is unlikely to be considered as a security A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens To estimate how likely a particular blockchain token is be a security under US federal securities law Refer to full legal analysis Instructions Step 1 Copy to a new google sheet (File > Make a copy) or download as xls Step 2 Review each characteristic and determine whether or not it applies to the token Step 3 Select Y or N for each characteristic from the drop down menu Step 4 Review results at the bottom of this page Element 1 Investment of Money Is there an investment of money Characteristic Points Explanation There is no 0 Tokens which are not sold for value do crowdsale New not involve an investment of money tokens are given away for free or are For example if all tokens are distributed earned through for free or are only produced through mining mining then there is no sale for value Tokens are sold for value (crowdsale) 100 Examples There was never any token sale for Bitcoin The only way to acquire new bitcoin is via mining A token which is randomly distributed for free Tokens which are sold in a crowdsale at A token which is sold for bitcoin in a any time regardless of whether sold for crowdsale fiat or digital currency (or anything else of value) involve an investment of money A token which is sold for ether in a crowdsale Total for Element 1 Y or N N Y 100 Element 2 Common Enterprise What is the timing of the sale Characteristic Points Explanation Pre deployment 70 A sale of tokens before any code has been deployed on a blockchain is more likely to result in a common enterprise where the profits arise from the efforts of others This is because the buyers are completely dependent on the actions of the developers and the buyers cannot actually participate in the network until a later time Examples A developer has an idea for a new protocol writes a white paper and does a crowdsale A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Token https //www coinbase com/legal/securities lawframework pdf 18 \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor Y or N N \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER The protocol is operational on a test network 60 Live network is operational 50 If there is a functioning network there is less likely there is to be a common enterprise where the profits arisef rom the efforts of others The closer the sale is to launch of the network the less likley there is to be a common enterprise If the token is sold once there is an operational network using the token or sold immediately before the network goes live it is again less likely to result in a common enterprise 43 A developer has an idea for a new protocol writes a white paper and deploys a working test network before doing a crowdsale N The crowdsale is done at the same time the network is launched N What do token holders have to do in order to get economic benefits from the network Characteristic Points Explanation Examples Y or N All token holders will 25 If returns are paid to all token holders \xe2\x80\x98HodlToken\xe2\x80\x99 holders are automatically always receive the equally (or in proportion to their token paid an amount of ETH each week based same returns holdings) regardless of any action on the on fees generated by other users of the part of the token holder then their network interests are more likely aligned in a N common enterprise \xe2\x80\x98FoldToken\xe2\x80\x99 does not pay any return and there is no way to earn more tokens within the network (but they can be bought sold or traded) There is a possibility 20 If token holders\xe2\x80\x99 returns depend on their \xe2\x80\x98CloudToken\xe2\x80\x99 holders can earn more of varying returns own efforts and can vary depending on tokens by providing data storage on the between token the amount of effort they each put in then network or can spend tokens to access Y holders based on there is less likely to be a common data storage Holders who do not provide their participation or enterprise data storage do not earn any more use of the network tokens Total for Element 2 20 Element 3 Expectation of Profit What function does the token have Characteristic Points Explanation Ownership or equity 100 Tokens which give or purport to give interest in a legal traditional equity debt or other investor entity including a rights are almost certainly securities general partnership Entitlement to a 100 If one or more of these share of profits and/ or losses or assets characteristics apply the token and/or liabilities is almost certainly a security Gives holder status 100 notwithstanding the results of as a creditor or the other elements lender A claim in 100 bankruptcy as equity interest holder or creditor A right to repayment 100 of purchase price and/or payment of interest No function other 100 A token which does not have any real than mere existence function or is used in a network with no real function is very likely to be bought with an expectation of profit from the efforts of others because no real use or participation by token holders is possible Voting rights alone do not constitute real functionality \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor Examples Y or N A developer releases and sells 100 \xe2\x80\x98BakerShares\xe2\x80\x99 tokens Each token entitles N the holder to 1 share in Baker Inc A developer releases and sells 100 \xe2\x80\x98BakerProfit\xe2\x80\x99 tokens Each token entitles the holder to 1% of the profits of Baker Inc for the next year A developer releases and sells 100 \xe2\x80\x98BakerDebt\xe2\x80\x99 tokens Each token entitles the holder to principal and interest repayments based on the initial token sale price N N N N A developer releases and sells 100 000 \xe2\x80\x98SocialCoin\xe2\x80\x99 tokens to fund the development of a new Social Network However SocialCoin is not required to access the network and has no real function after the sale N \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER Specific functionality that is only available to token holders 0 A token which has a specific function that is only available to token holders is more likely to be purchased in order to access that function and less likely to be purchased with an expectation of profit 44 \ CloudToken\xe2\x80\x99 is the only way to access and use a decentralized file storage network Y Does the holder rely on manual off blockchain action to realize the benefit of the token Characteristic Points Explanation Examples Y or N Manual action is 80 A token whose value depends on A developer releases and sells required outside of someone taking specific manual action \xe2\x80\x98FreightCoin\xe2\x80\x99 which will allow the holder the network (e g offoutside of the network means that the to pay FreightCoin to access capacity on blockchain) in order token is not functional in and of itself a new real world freight network The for the holder to get Instead the token relies on a level of trust network relies on legal contractual N the benefit of the in a third party taking action offrelationships and manual actions (This token blockchain This sort of token is more alone does not make FreightCoin a likely to be bought for speculation i e security) the expectation of profits All functionality is 0 A token which is built with all the Holders of \xe2\x80\x98SongVoteToken\xe2\x80\x99 can sign inherent in the token necessary technical permissions means transactions on the network as votes for and occurs that the token holder does not rely on their favorite new songs and earn rewards programmatically manual actions of any third party This for doing so Y means that the buyers are more likely to purchase the token for use rather than with the expectation of profit from the efforts of others What is the timing of the sale Characteristic Points Explanation Pre deployment 20 A sale of tokens before any code has been deployed on a blockchain is more likely to result in buyers purchasing for speculative reasons with the expectation of profit rather than practical use cases The protocol is 10 If the sale occurs after code has been operational on a test deployed and tested the token is closer network to being able to be used Live network is operational 0 If the token is sold once there is an operational network using the token or immediately before the network goes live it is more likely to be purchased with the intention of use rather than profit Can the token holders exercise real and significant control via voting Characteristic Points Explanation Token holders as a 20 If the collective approval of token holders whole are able to is required in order for the development control the team to access the funds raised in the development team\xe2\x80\x99s crowdsale then any value realized by the access to funds token holders is more closely tied to their own decisions and less reliant on the efforts of others Token holders as a whole are able to vote on significant decisions for the protocol 10 If the collective approval of token holders is required in order to make significant changes to the protocol then any value realized by the token holders is more closely tied to their own decisions and less reliant on the efforts of others Examples A developer has an idea for a new protocol writes a white paper and does a crowdsale A developer has an idea for a new protocol writes a white paper and develops a working test network before doing a crowdsale The live network is launched before the crowdsale Y or N Y Y N Examples A development team sells 100 000 Tokens for a total of 100 000 ETH 50 000 ETH will be released from the token contract to the development team immediately but the remainder is only released once milestones are met which requires approval of a majority of the token holders each time If the milestones are never met the remaining ETH will be returned to the token holders Changes to the protocol require a vote by token holders Y or N Y Y Note Voting rights must be in addition to functionality A token with voting rights alone and no other real functionality is very likely \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 45 How is the token sale marketed Characteristic Points Explanation Marketed as an 50 It is not possible to prevent some buyers \ Initial Coin Offering\ from buying a token purely for or similar speculation However marketing the token as an investment leads buyers to believe they can profit from holding or trading the token rather than from using the token in the network Marketed as a Token Sale There is no economic return possible from using the network 0 100 Using terms like \ Initial Coin Offering\ or \ ICO\ and investment related language like \xe2\x80\x98returns\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98profits\xe2\x80\x99 encourages buyers to buy a token for speculation rather than use Marketed as a sale of tokens which give the right to access and use the network If there is genuinely no economic return possible for the token holders then there is unlikely to be a common enterprise This will be rare Examples Y or N \xe2\x80\x98ProfitCoin\xe2\x80\x99 includes potential of

Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 46 Appendix C19 Classification of Ambulance/EMS Equipment ALS and BLS equipment can be categorised based on their functionality \xe2\x80\xa2 Transportation equipment \xe2\x80\xa2 Blood and haemorrhage control \xe2\x80\xa2 Burn care \xe2\x80\xa2 Diagnostics \xe2\x80\xa2 Cardiac and respiratory \xe2\x80\xa2 Infection control \xe2\x80\xa2 Hypothermia TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT Prehospital providers transfer patients to facilities depending on their need for a low or high level of medical care The type of equipment used depends on the nature of the care needed during the transport of patients Hence ambulances must be prepared accordingly and are equipped with transport equipment such as stretchers cots wheelchairs and immobilisation equipment such as cervical collars and splints Transportation equipment also includes a neonatal retrieval system and equipment designed specifically to transfer infants to medical facilities 19 This is taken in verbatim from BCC Research with minor modifications \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 47 Stretchers and Cots Ambulance cots are designed with features that support the patient\xe2\x80\x99s body They help reduce strain and control and maintain proper body mechanics while loading and unloading patients The folding emergency stretchers are simple flat stretchers used for transferring patients They are primarily made of lightweight aluminium frames and heavy duty bacteriostatic vinyl coated nylon covers that are impermeable to blood and bodily fluids Immobilisation Set Immobilisation Set immobilises arms and legs and are used for temporary emergency medical support The immobilisation set provides dependable support for heavy bleeding sprains swelling fractures and broken crushed or burned extremities These sets are designed to be applied and removed painlessly from the injury site as they are equipped with a push pull valve that controls pressure and makes inflating them e\xef\xac\x80ortless The set delivers pain relief immobilises and cushions the injury to prevent further damage to the soft tissue Transparent vinyl plastic splints are also X ray transparent and act as a tool for doctors to use to monitor injuries and the healing process Immobilisation sets are available in a convenient storage/carrying case Various assortment packs include half arm full arm half leg full leg hand/wrist and foot/ankle sized splints Triangular Bandage As the name suggests the triangular bandage is triangular in shape Triangular bandages are made from square cloths that are roughly 40 inches and are usually made of calico or cotton This bandage is cut in half diagonally and used in various ways as a sling for \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 48 immobilisation of broken bones and soft tissue injuries The bandage has a long edge and a short edge and can be tied as a collar and cu\xef\xac\x80 sling elevation sling or reef knot Cervical Collars Cervical spine immobilisation is necessary during acute cervical injury to avoid spinal cord damage The spine needs to be protected at all times when managing patients with multiple injuries There are a numerous types of cervical collars available in the market today These collars are made of rigid or semi rigid materials such as plastic or foam which are reinforced by plastic struts and Velcro straps The collars primarily function to restrict flexion and extension of the middle and lower cervical spine Collapsible or Folding Wheelchair Folding or collapsible wheelchairs are portable and hence more convenient to use than a standard wheelchair during emergency situations The collapsible or folding wheelchairs contain a collapsible frame These chairs are easy to carry around as they are often made from lightweight aluminium Folding wheelchairs are very versatile as they allow easy access and freedom of movement Folding wheelchairs also come with detachable leg rests and a folding back which make them ideal to fold to store in an ambulance Folding wheelchairs are very accessible as they do not require upper body strength to be moved around They are available with two options self propelled and transit options Their attendant handbrakes provide additional safety and control for EMS personnel Due to moving parts and movable joints folding chairs are not as durable as a rigid frame \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 49 wheelchair These chairs therefore require higher maintenance to keep them in good condition Neonatal Transport Equipment Transportation of high risk and critically ill infants requires specialised equipment Neonates generally require urgent transfer to a tertiary care centre often because of medical surgical or postpartum issues There are various commercial products in the market used for the neonatal patients during transportation Most sick neonates require peripheral or central intravascular access during transport and hence the ambulance must be equipped with intravenous (IV) access for these tiny and challenging patients Many neonatal units are equipped to simultaneously transport two or more patients in the event of twins or higher order multiple transport requests Neonatal transport units are mobile intensive care incubators fitted with mechanical ventilators suction equipment warming equipment infusion pumps and physiological monitors capable of being used in a mobile environment BLOOD AND HAEMORRHAGE CONTROL One of the leading causes of death in civilian and military injuries is uncontrolled bleeding Despite new advances in trauma care EMS services and medical devices massive haemorrhaging continues to result in morbidity and mortality Therefore adequate haemorrhage control is required in the prehospital environment EMS equipment contains di\xef\xac\x80erent types of gauze which are compressed and haemostatic to help the medical personnel during haemorrhage related emergencies \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 50 Haemostatic Gauze The combination use of absorbable haemostatic gauze with medical adhesive is an e\xef\xac\x80ective method for achieving haemostasis The gauze is primarily used when massive presacral haemorrhaging occurs Haemostatic gauze helps to stop a range of bleeding from oozing to severe arterial within minutes which minimises blood loss and reduces the risks associated with transfusions Most haemostatic gauzes are intended to end bleeding with three minutes of compression Compressed Gauge Compressed gauze is used during moderate to severe wounds involving heavy blood loss It is usually made of high quality cotton for maximum absorption and stability Although they are available in vacuum packed form for small easy storage they expand to cover large wound areas The compressed gauze is ideal for fast and easy wound packing During prehospital emergency care rolled gauze generally becomes damaged and loses its sterility but compressed gauze maintains its sterility due to its compact vacuum packaging \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 51 BURN CARE Burn injuries require immediate cooling otherwise the heat may continue to destroy the surrounding and underlying tissue The unattended burn may progress to a partial thickness (second degree) burn and later into a full thickness (third degree) burn Such situations could result in serious consequences for the patient and considerable cost to the receiving hospital or burn unit The burn kits in ambulances are assembled to provide immediate first aid for all types of burns The kits contain equipment to relieve the pain rapidly removing the heat and cooling the burn The kits usually contain gel in unit dosage packages sterile burn dressings in various sizes and burn blankets Burn Blankets Burn or fire blankets are designed for emergency use and provide physical protection from heat fire and smoke During transport to a medical facility the blanket soothes the victim by cooling the burn and drawing the heat out to prevent further tissue and nerve damage These blankets help reduce the physiological and psychological trauma of burn victims Burn blankets are usually made of wool woven with a unique interlinking cell construction Burn blankets are specially formulated with gel that is easily removed and does not adhere to the victim\xe2\x80\x99s skin When the gel soaked blanket is placed on a victim\xe2\x80\x99s body it cools the burn and helps to protect against airborne contamination The burn or fire blanket can also be used to extinguish flames on a victim These blankets are conveniently packaged in handy canisters that can be mounted on a wall \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 52 The wrap used for body heat conservation for a newborn is known as sterile foil baby bunting The blanket is made of sterilised metalled polyester film that is latex free and usually has a hood with an opening for the infant\xe2\x80\x99s face Burn Dressings and Masks Burn dressings are a made of gelatinised water mix Due to their gelatinous nature these dressings seal the burn from further contamination cool the burn site and relieve pain The fluids on the burn site cannot soak into the dressing As the burn cools down the dressing warms up which helps prevent hypothermia The burn dressings available today are capable of absorbing temperatures in excess of 2 000\xc2\xb0F Non adherent non toxic and non irritant burn face masks are designed for emergency first aid on first or second degree burns They cool the burn site and ease trauma which reduces the risk of infection These masks are designed with cutouts for the eyes nose and mouth The cuts are designed to keep the nasal passages eyes and mouth clear The dressing brings cooling relief from pain while protecting covered the area from further contamination Burn Gels Burn gels cool the burn sooth the skin and ease pain upon application to the burn site The burn gel draws the heat out of the burn wound which helps relieve pain and prevents infections It acts as an external analgesic provides temporary relief for minor burns cuts and scrapes and may contain aloe vera for cooling \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 53 DIAGNOSTICS The diagnostic equipment found in an ambulance or EMS vehicle includes for example stethoscopes thermometer oximeter and blood pressure kits Stethoscope A stethoscope is used to listen to the respiratory and cardiac sounds in a patient\xe2\x80\x99s chest The stethoscope transmits low volume sounds such as a heartbeat or intestinal venous or fetal heart sounds A stethoscope consists of two earpieces connected by means of flexible tubing that is placed against the skin of the patient Stethoscopes also come with interchangeable chest piece fittings\xe2\x80\x94adult and paediatric diaphragms Thermometer A thermometer is a glass tube with a bulb containing a liquid typically mercury or coloured alcohol The liquid expands and rises in the tube as temperature increases The types of thermometer available on the market are mercury glass electronic digital and infrared thermometers Mercury glass thermometers have been used in past years to measure temperatures in the rectum mouth or under the arm They are not used today because they can break easily and release toxic mercury Electronic digital thermometers have advantages over glass thermometers Digital thermometers record temperature readings faster and the digital display is easy to read \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 54 While using digital thermometers there is no peril of injury caused by broken glass or mercury Infrared thermometers measure heat generated by surfaces and cavities and record temperature reading in seconds Infrared ear thermometers measure the heat generated by the eardrum and surrounding tissue and generate a digital display in a few seconds Infrared skin thermometers measure the heat produced by the skin The sensors in the infrared skin thermometer do not measure the temperature below the skin surface and so their measurements may not record body temperature accurately Blood Pressure Monitor and Sphygmomanometer The sphygmomanometer also called a blood pressure meter is a small piece of equipment found in ambulances It quickly measures blood pressure particularly in arteries The sphygmomanometer primarily consists of a gauge attached to a rubber cu\xef\xac\x80 The rubber cu\xef\xac\x80 is wrapped around the upper arm and is inflated to constrict the arteries There are two types of sphygmomanometers available digital and manual Digital sphygmomanometers are automated They provide a blood pressure reading and do not require medical personnel to operate the cu\xef\xac\x80 or listen to the blood flow sounds Although they are easy to use the digital models are less accurate Healthcare providers often use manual sphygmomanometers to validate digital readings Manual sphygmomanometers consist of either an aneroid dial or a mercury column Although aneroid and mercury devices operate in a similar manner aneroid devices require periodic calibration \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 55 The aneroid sphygmomanometer requires no liquid The absence of a liquid provides mobility and so the aneroid sphygmomanometer can be moved easily from one location to another In addition it can be placed on walls In addition while the mercury sphygmomanometer must be kept in a level location for the mercury to remain in place the aneroid sphygmomanometer can be placed on the wall Transportation of the mercury sphygmomanometer a\xef\xac\x80ects its accuracy due to movement in the level of the mercury column Pulse Oximeter The pulse oximeter is used for indirect measurement of the percentage of oxygenated haemoglobin Pulse oximetry is often used in emergency rooms to evaluate oxygen levels in patients The pulse oximeter is a common piece of EMS monitoring equipment Pulse oximeters measure the light absorption properties of haemoglobin The oximeter uses a red infrared light source to measure oxygenated haemoglobin The quantity of light absorbed by the blood varies with the proportion of oxygenated haemoglobin in the blood This is analysed with an oximeter to generate a numerical saturation reading Most of pulse oximeters provide a digital waveform in a visual display It also generates an audible display of arterial pulsations and heart rate The pulse oximeters come with a variety of sensors to accommodate individuals regardless of age size or weight The latest wireless pulse oximeter generates pulse signal quality assessment and heart rate alarms The oximeter is an important part of ambulance equipment \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 56 Otoscope The otoscope is a valuable piece of device used as a tool for detecting ear problems It can also be used as a light source for examination of the eye and body orifices other than the ear The otoscope contains a magnifying glass with a source of light and a cone shaped speculum at the end of a tube CARDIAC AND RESPIRATORY Sudden death due to cardiac arrest is a global concern today Performing CPR on patients during ambulance transport is crucial for patients undergoing prehospital emergency care The quality of the CPR administered during ambulance transport is the key factor a\xef\xac\x80ecting the probability of survival of patients in cardiac arrest E\xef\xac\x80ective CPR is often a prerequisite for e\xef\xac\x80ective defibrillation Airway Management Systems Airway management is the process that ensures an open airway in a patient Ambulance sta\xef\xac\x80 is trained in advanced airway skills which also include tracheal intubation Tracheal intubation has been used to address prehospital cardiac arrest since the 1970s There are many ways to perform advanced airway management Tracheal intubation is been replaced by other advanced airways such as supraglottic airways Airway management systems include disposable and reusable supraglottic airways bite blocks laryngeal airway devices and video laryngoscopes Separate paediatric supraglottic airway management tools are also available on the market \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 57 Cardiac Monitor and Defibrillators Cardiac monitors are used to monitor heart activity continuously Cardiac monitors are also equipped with external pacing pulse oximetry end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO) 2 capnography non invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and P oximeters During EMS transport the heart rhythms of the cardiac patient are routinely monitored with the cardiac monitor If there is a cardiac emergency during patient transport a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can be performed Performing an ECG allows paramedics in the field to treat a patient\xe2\x80\x99s condition accordingly and speeds up the treatment process when the patient arrives at the treatment facility CPR Mask and CPR Life shield The disposable bag resuscitator is a semi transparent CPR resuscitator used for emergency situations These resuscitators are ideal for adult infants and children as they feature a see through patient valve allowing for visual check of operation The textured surface and support strap facilitate a steady grip and uniform tidal volumes Most EMR resuscitators are fully disposable which eliminates the need for cleaning disinfecting and sterilising as well as the chances of cross contamination Rescue Mask and Non rebreathing Mask Mouth to mouth resuscitation has traditionally been the method used to provide respiration to a patient in an emergency situation Now the rescue mask is used by first responders to provide immediate respiratory support without concerns regarding the transmission of infectious diseases \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 58 These masks are available with and without an oxygen inlet An oxygen tube can be attached to the oxygen inlet for supplemental oxygen In addition the transparent design of these masks allows the rescuer to visually check the patient\xe2\x80\x99s condition The masks are usually equipped with a head strap to a\xef\xac\x83x the device to the patient\xe2\x80\x99s face Oxygen Regulator An oxygen regulator regulates the flow of the oxygen from the tank to administer the correct dose of oxygen to the patient Oxygen regulators are used to adjust litre flow usually starting from 1\xe2\x80\x9325 L/min Paediatric oxygen regulators are for those that need 1/32 L flow in small increments Emergency personnel primarily require 0\xe2\x80\x9325 L/min oxygen regulators to provide high litre flow in emergency situations The two main categories of regulators are \xe2\x80\xa2 Continuous flow oxygen regulators \xe2\x80\xa2 Oxygen conserving regulators Continuous Flow Oxygen Regulators Continuous flow oxygen regulators are attached to the top of the oxygen tank They contain a dial that allows emergency personnel to adjust the litre flow Continuous flow oxygen regulators provide continuous flow settings so they empty the oxygen tank fairly quickly The flow depends on the flow setting and usage frequency of oxygen tank Oxygen Conserving Regulators Oxygen conserving regulators are attached to the top of the oxygen tank They are available in two styles a pneumatic conserver and a battery operated oxygen style Oxygen \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 59 conserving regulators enable oxygen tanks to last five times longer than a continuous oxygen regulator at the same flow rate They provide a pulse dose of oxygen to the patient When the patient breathes it causes back pressure in the oxygen tubing which triggers the regulator to provide oxygen These types of regulators do not work unless the patient breathes deeply enough Nasal Cannula Nasal cannulas are used to deliver oxygen at a low flow where a low concentration of oxygen is required They are used for the patients who are in a stable state Nasal cannulas are advantageous for patients who have chronic respiratory problems Patients can eat and drink while using them Cannulas also reduce the risk of carbon dioxide rebreathing INFECTION CONTROL First aid team members and EMS professionals in the healthcare industry are at risk of exposure to blood borne pathogens and body fluid spills Potential infectious materials include semen vaginal secretions cerebrospinal fluid amniotic fluid saliva or any body fluid visually contaminated with blood any unfixed tissue or organs HIV cells or tissue cultures The emergency cleanup kit for blood or bodily fluids guards caregivers of ill or injured patients and protects during biohazard cleanup The kit usually includes a gown fluid resistant mask nitrile exam gloves hand wipes and cap Ambulances are also equipped with a biohazard lock up container \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 60 Biohazard Lock up Container Medical waste generated during medical emergencies includes dripping liquid or semi liquid blood infectious materials that could release flakes human blood and blood products (including serum plasma and blood components) haemodialysis waste human or animal isolation wastes (from humans or animals that have been isolated to protect others from communicable diseases) sharps waste autopsy tissue organs or body parts also known as pathological wastes autopsy wastes (e g soiled dressings sponges drapes lavage tubes drainage sets under pads and surgical gloves) discarded medical equipment The biohazard lock up container is used to discard such medical waste These containers are leak proof and have a locking translucent top seal that shuts permanently when full They are conveniently placed for quick disposal of medical waste while attending to the patient Germicidal Wipes/Sprays/Sanitisers Germicidal wipes sprays and sanitisers protect against TB (tuberculosis) MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) VRE (vancomycin resistant Enterococcus) HIV 1 (human immunodeficiency virus) Staphylococcus aureus Salmonella choleraesuis They are used to clean disinfect decontaminate and deodorise equipment Germicidal wipes are disposable wipes which are available in containers that allow wipes to be pulled out one at a time for use Disinfectant wipes are an essential disinfecting tool used on the surface of furniture and equipment \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 61 Gloves and Safety Gowns Ambulance personnel are continually at risk while attending to accidents and fatalities as they perform first aid on victims without the availability of medical information or records EMS personnel are at risk of coming into contact with blood while removing injured people from the scene of an accident or providing first aid to victims Therefore EMS providers require personal protection equipment Personal protective equipment for EMS and healthcare providers includes gloves gowns and caps to protect those who are vulnerable to the transmission of disease while providing medical care A wide range of exam gloves is available made of latex vinyl or nitrile Medical gloves serve as protection and help prevent the spread of germs Whereas gloves protect hands gowns protect skin and clothing Gowns and caps are fluid resistant and available in reusable and disposable forms HYPOTHERMIA During hypothermia the body\xe2\x80\x99s core temperature falls below a normal 98 6\xc2\xb0F (37\xc2\xb0C) to 95\xc2\xb0F (35\xc2\xb0C) or cooler Exposure to cold temperatures or cold water dangerously accelerates the onset and progression of hypothermia Hypothermia can a\xef\xac\x80ect the brain heart lungs and other vital organs A mild case of hypothermia may diminish a victim\xe2\x80\x99s physical and mental abilities and a severe case of hypothermia may result in unconsciousness or the death of the victim During hypothermia related emergencies medical providers work to prevent further heat loss rewarming the victim and work to quickly get the patient to a medical facility Hypothermia prevention kits available to EMS personnel contain a reinforced heat reflective shell (HRS) The heat reflective shell is strong flexible \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0cMEXC ICO WHITE PAPER 62 lightweight and resistant to both wind and rain The kit is usually vacuum sealed in a rugged pouch with quick rip tabs that allow easy access and rapid deployment during an emergency Heat Reflective Shells New heat reflective shells are designed to meet the extreme and specific needs of patient warming during causalities The latest high performance heat reflective shell closes toward the underside with hook and loop closures for weather protection during casualty evacuation The heat reflective shells available today contain a built in hood to provide protection for the patient during transportation Along with the HRS the hypothermia prevention kit also contains a self heating four cell shell liner designed to sustain continuous dry heat \xc2\xa9 2018 MEXC Program Executor \x0c
