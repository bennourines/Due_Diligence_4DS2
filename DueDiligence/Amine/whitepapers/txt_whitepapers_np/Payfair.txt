you have been one of the many that has endured the hardship of fraud or heard the horror stories that are prevalent in the cryptocurrency world The most common of these tend to involve one of the parties not meeting all of the requirements or perhaps had vanished without a trace The invention of blockchain technology has offered the world an opportunity to remove this widespread issue Our team has decided to solve this by creating a convenient easy to use decentralised transparent and independent escrow platform to make safe transactions WHAT IS ESCROW SERVICE Escrow is a financial agreement in which a third party regulates all the processes between two exchanging parties It provides a safer transaction as money is held on a secure account and the deposit is only released when all of the requirements have been satisfied In this instance using an escrow service is useful especially if large amounts are involved as it cannot be released until these requirements are met For example a client has instructed an individual to produce a website The client naturally would like to verify the quality of the website before purchasing and a designer doesn t want to share his or her work without any guarantee that he or she receives payment \x0cTHE PAYFAIR PLATFORM PayFair is a decentralized Escrow platform which ensures the paramount security of all cryptocurrency transactions made between two parties These transactions include cryptocurrency FIAT services and digital and physical goods This service is enabled by the PayFair token (PFR) which is an ERC 20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain These PFR tokens create a network of \xe2\x80\x9cNodes\xe2\x80\x9d that create a decentralized environment The cost of using this service is extremely low We provide a highly competitive service that completes all transactions in a safe private and decentralized environment resulting in a trust less experience PayFair is not only designed to provide a safer environment but also save time As no third parties are involved when making a transaction we can avoid the time consuming bureaucracy \x0cTHE PAYFAIR TOKEN (Ethereum ERC 20 token standard) PFR tokens are an essential part of the ecosystem and are designed to fulfill several roles 1 Create nodes of trust in the platform 2 Create escrow nodes that will resolve disputes 3 Enable token holders to receive a commission on fees PAYFAIR GOALS 1 Create trust less guarantees between contractors sellers and buyers 2 Ensure a mutually beneficial relationship between all participants within the platform 3 Create an independent system without outside or developer interference 4 Raise the social interest in cryptocurrencies and provide an easier to use FIAT Gateway for new investors \x0c\x0cWHAT THE PLATFORM SOLVES \xef\x82\xb7 Eliminate the lack of trust between contractors buyers and sellers \xef\x82\xb7 Regulate trade conflicts through the help of a decentralized rating driven escrow service \xef\x82\xb7 Decrease the exorbitant fees that plague the escrow market \xef\x82\xb7 Eliminate the potential for opportunistic and orchestrated fraud INNOVATIONS \xef\x82\xb7 Escrow independence is achieved through anonymity thus does not depend on contractors \xef\x82\xb7 Decentralized escrow meaning those who run the nodes are not linked to any third party but are engaged independently \xef\x82\xb7 An escrow rating system will ensure a high level of customer service and reliance when disputes occur \xef\x82\xb7 A buyer seller and contractor rating system to ensure those who provide a reliable and/or smooth transaction are highlighted \xef\x82\xb7 Full open source API \xef\x82\xb7 The most popular cryptocurrencies will be offered as a means of payment between contractors with more crypto offerings added as the wider market matures \xef\x82\xb7 Self learning neural system for automatic transaction processing \x0cBLOCKCHAIN AND ESCROW MARKETS ANALYSIS (Picture Google Trends when searching \xc2\xabblockchain\xc2\xbb) It has been almost ten years since Bitcoin was introduced and over the years has built an unarguable following resulting in the emerging market we see today This achievement is a testament to blockchain technologies of which grow ever more complex with each improvement we see solve more real world problems through the use of blockchain technologies CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET CAPITALIZATION (Picture Total Market Capitalization by Global Charts https //coinmarketcap com/charts/) \x0c(Picture Analysis of \xc2\xabescrow\xc2\xbb search) The rise of total cryptocurrency capitalization is close to 6000% since 2013 Meaning there is a clear growing global interest New investors who see the definite potential of blockchain technologies are entering the market at an exponential rate Whereas \xc2\xabescrow\xc2\xbb search has been stable for over five years meaning a steady demand POTENTIAL MARKET SHARE \xef\x82\xb7 Trust Nodes that utilise smart contracts resulting in trading without human interaction \xef\x82\xb7 Decentralised anonymous escrow nodes with no driver to defraud the system \xef\x82\xb7 Cryptocurrency to o Fiat exchange service o Domains and websites o Freelance and online services o Physical and digital goods (video games etc ) \x0cPLATFORM FUNDAMENTALS Ecosystem is a platform for completing transactions and deals Fee (commission) is a payment for the transaction made by the buyer and seller (or contractor) Buyer \xe2\x80\x94 a party interested in transaction safety Seller \xe2\x80\x94 a party selling items goods or services Trust node \xe2\x80\x94 PFR token holders Escrow \xe2\x80\x94 an independent and anonymous chain of escrow nodes Escrow settle the differences Escrow node \xe2\x80\x94 PFR token holders in status escrow \x0c\x0cCOMPLETING AN ESCROW TRADE 1 The party(s) deposit cryptocurrency into the decentralised escrow account 2 Buyer and seller confirm the terms of the deal have been met (not relevant if crypto to crypto transaction) 3 3 Consecutive \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d decisions from the escrow nodes 4 Payment is released from the escrow account Person A and Person B are trading Both ask Person C (Escrow node) to hold the fund within a decentralized escrow account Both Person A and Person B are happy with their goods/payment/service and the funds are released However if either of the parties is unhappy the transaction is held in escrow during the dispute process It will be held there until a resolution has been determined The escrow accounts will be able to request additional evidence to support the transaction to further ensure a successful outcome \x0cRATING SYSTEM Rating of escrow nodes \xef\x82\xb7 The rating system will create a self regulating ecosystem with reliable participants of an escrowchain \xef\x82\xb7 Improves competency confidence of trades between parties and open mindedness \xef\x82\xb7 Fair fee distribution between the participants Rating of buyers sellers and contractors \xef\x82\xb7 Improves mutual confidence between the parties even without the use of escrow nodes \xef\x82\xb7 When using the platform for escrow service multiple times rating helps to lower the fees for transactions therefore encouraging clients to use the platform more and more TOKEN HOLDER INCENTIVES Trust nodes are awarded for their passive participation in the system They receive a commission for every successful trade on the platform of which is paid out in the currency that each trade was completed in Escrow nodes are awarded for their active participation in the system They receive a commission for each successful trade they have participated in of which is paid out in the currency that the trade was completed in Payments are automated and enabled by smart contracts \x0cTRUST NODES FURTHER INFORMATION The trust node is a critical element within the network and performs the important job of maintaining updating and securing the PayFair ecosystem Trust Nodes support the price of the token they make it stable and resistant to dramatic changes To set up a trust node you will need 10 000 PFR minimum Trust nodes are weighted meaning additional PFR over 10 000 will multiply the payout value For example 17 000 PFR = 1 7x payout The advantage of Trust Nodes over other master nodes is that there are no hardware requirements or 247 online time Simply use the signing feature within myetherwallet to link your PFR wallet with the PayFair platform then sit back and enjoy your passive income ESCROW NODES FURTHER INFORMATION Escrow nodes ensure the integrity of a trade between parties (buyer and seller) Escrow (or Guarantor) nodes are secured by PFR tokens meaning every decision in the ecosystem is ensured by value and is performed by a real person When this is combined with an Escrow rating system it further supports its ability to rid the platform of bad actors \x0cCurrent masternode systems do not allow participants to connect in any meaningful human to human way PayFair\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Wallet\xe2\x80\x9d technology will allow Escrow node holders to easily connect and communicate with other Escrow node holders (unless they wish to stay anonymous ) This new type of networking gives the PFR token a clear advantage over similar coins because Escrow node holders can more easily organise themselves because they know who each other are Escrow Nodes are an immutable $250 worth of PFR operating an Escrow node will require active participation within the platform This participation comes in the way of resolving disputes between buyers and seller based on the information provided PLATFORM TRADE FEE Every fee on PAYFAIR platform will be distributed
