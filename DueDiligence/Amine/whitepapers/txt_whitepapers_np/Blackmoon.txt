company founded in 2014 The Blackmoon team has extensive experience in setting up and managing investment funds as well as developing automated investment interfaces and asset management tools while effectively working with regulatory authorities Blackmoon\xe2\x80\x99s vision is to create a new standard for tokenized investment vehicles that will bridge the gap between the \xef\xac\x81at* and crypto universes The Blackmoon Platform focuses on all aspects of tokenized investment vehicles from technology and infrastructure to legal compliance and corporate structuring The Blackmoon Platform will be the one stop solution for asset managers to create and manage tokenized funds This white paper outlines the value proposition of the Blackmoon Platform and the company\xe2\x80\x99s business model * BLACKMOON Fiat money is a currency established as money by government regulation or law USD EUR CNY and other similar currencies are \xef\xac\x81at currencies https //en wikipedia org/wiki/Fiat_money PAGE 3 OF 27 WHITEPAPER EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \x0cVISION Blackmoon is part of the Blackmoon Financial Group a \xef\xac\x81nancial technology company incorporated in Ireland with a solid track record since 2014 We bring investment transparency globalization and decentralization to the next level by implementing blockchain technology all with a commitment to sustainable continuous development in cooperation with \xef\xac\x81nancial regulators We combine our ready to use technologies with our deep expertise in structuring investment funds both internally and through our partnerships with external investment teams Working closely with the best investment managers lawyers and \xef\xac\x81nancial authorities we are creating a solid bridge between the blockchain universe and the classic investment world by providing a transparent and legally compliant framework for tokenized fund structuring and operation We are helping to expand the boundaries of investment possibilities and to encourage regulators to recognize blockchain tools as the new reality in classic \xef\xac\x81nancial markets Ultimately Blackmoon aims to set the benchmark for tokenized investment funds and vehicles that invest in traditional investment instruments as well as in emerging distributed economy opportunities BLACKMOON PAGE 4 OF 27 WHITEPAPER VISION \x0cVALUE PROPOSITION Blackmoon addresses the main issues of the current tokenized investment vehicles such as lack of diversi\xef\xac\x81cation non compliance with existing and foreseen regulation and lack of standardization Our goal is to become the industry standard and one stop solution in setting up tokenized funds regardless of whether such funds invest in the \xef\xac\x81at or crypto world Blackmoon bridges the gap between these two worlds while taking advantage of both KEY VALUE PROPOSITIONS Best of both worlds Sustainability Currently the majority of tokenized investment vehicles are either fully crypto oriented (invested in cryptocurrencies) or pegged to some tradable asset (such as the US dollar or gold) Each of these approaches is siloed hindering diversi\xef\xac\x81cation Access to \xef\xac\x81at investment opportunities provides unprecedented diversi\xef\xac\x81cation in terms of income sources while retaining all the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of the crypto universe including decentralization transparency and exchangeability Funds\xe2\x80\x99 legal structure is reviewed and approved by our legal advisors to ensure they are compliant with existing laws and regulations As many current investors in tokenized funds are at best in Terra Incognita this eye toward legal responsibility dramatically decreases legal risks for the investors Blackmoon has vetted the proposed structure with several \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions and has received an indicative approval that it will pass internal procedures enabling funds to be transferred from and into the crypto world By sorting out these risks from the beginning Blackmoon improves investor con\xef\xac\x81dence and provide necessary sustainability of the investment process Standardized platform Setting up the proper investment structure is a costly endeavour Not all tokenized funds set up a proper structure which leads to greater regulatory risk Blackmoon believes that now is the right time to introduce industry standards for setting up tokenized investment vehicles that can attract investments from private individuals and institutional investors of any kind We undertake this effort in order to reduce or remove regulatory risk from investors BLACKMOON Scalable fund creation Using the system put in place by Blackmoon the Blackmoon Platform any approved investment manager is able to set up and run a tokenized investment fund without having to go through the pain and effort of creating the necessary IT and legal infrastructure This effectively eliminates the barriers for tokenized fund creation which is an important milestone toward bringing the \xef\xac\x81at and crypto economies into the same realm Transparency Bringing in new liquidity and users Tokenization of interests in funds (share in pro\xef\xac\x81ts) provides auditability and transparency to the investment process as well as to the results This transparency means the investment funds are no longer \xe2\x80\x9cblack boxes\xe2\x80\x9d for the investors with reporting full of \xef\xac\x81ne print This much needed transparency will substantially improve accountability of the investment managers We believe that the Blackmoon Platform is a turnkey solution that leads to further proliferation of the decentralized economy Investment managers from the \xef\xac\x81at world are now able to easily create compliant tokenized investment funds and offer their existing customers all the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of the blockchain that has been a buzzword among investment managers for several years PAGE 5 OF 27 WHITEPAPER VALUE PROPOSITION \x0cADVANTAGES FOR INVESTORS Tokenized investment funds on the Blackmoon Platform provide any type of investor with important advantages over existing investment opportunities ADVANTAGES FOR CRYPTO INVESTORS ADVANTAGES FOR FIAT INVESTORS \xe2\x80\xa2 New opportunities to access assets from the \xef\xac\x81at world without leaving the crypto universe \xe2\x80\xa2 Higher net return thanks to the cost ef\xef\xac\x81cient structure of tokenized funds (For comparison the setup cost of a structured note is at USD 50 000 to 100 000 plus 2% 5% of the invested assets which is a substantial drag on the net result to investors ) \xe2\x80\xa2 Unparalleled diversi\xef\xac\x81cation opportunities thanks to low correlation between \xef\xac\x81at and crypto assets \xe2\x80\xa2 Access to a wider range of investment opportunities with a lower risk pro\xef\xac\x81le to complement and balance existing speculative exposures \xe2\x80\xa2 Access to new classes of assets thanks to lower barriers for funds set up and administration on the Blackmoon Platform \xe2\x80\xa2 Exchangeability and anonymity as the inherent features of the tokenized assets (KYC process is still required upon deposit and withdrawal of \xef\xac\x81at currencies ) BLACKMOON PAGE 6 OF 27 WHITEPAPER ADVANTAGES FOR THE INVESTORS \x0cMARKET OVERVIEW Blockchain has been a buzzword in the \xef\xac\x81nancial sector since 2009 It has sparked substantial interest in the industry through its advantages of a distributed ledger value transfer and resilience to counterfeiting The creation of Ethereum (ETH) introduced smart contracts to a wide range of business users Application of these smart contracts leads to increasing decentralization and democratization of contractual relationships effectively leaving no place for interpretation of the \xef\xac\x81ne print in the agreements and introducing dramatic cost advantages This has resulted in the proliferation of various tokenized investment vehicles from which we can single out three main types currency trading venture capital funds and tokens pegged to assets (such as gold the US dollar etc ) New entrants to the \xef\xac\x81nancial technology market aim to disrupt the highly concentrated and over regulated \xef\xac\x81nancial industry In this environment incumbents are taking steps to keep up with the pace of technology and with customers\ demands For example in mid 2017 it was unveiled* that Barclays had been in discussion with the British \xef\xac\x81nancial regulator Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) about bringing cryptocurrencies into play Regulators themselves are also moving to embrace blockchain and cryptocurrencies For example Bitcoin** is accepted in Japan and Swiss tax authorities con\xef\xac\x81rmed*** Bitcoin VAT free status Still there is much that needs to be done to make the tokenization of these investment vehicles a seamless transparent and regulatory compliant process Blackmoon is the company to bridge the existing gap Tokenized investment funds are the future of the \xef\xac\x81nancial industry offering compelling advantages such as transparency tradability and cost ef\xef\xac\x81ciency To compare Blackmoon positioning in the existing ecosystem we plotted some of the most notable companies on two axes as shown in the chart in Figure 1 below * https //www cnbc com/2017/06/26/barclays

horizontal axis measures the diversi\xef\xac\x81cation introduced to the crypto world The more investment options are offered the more diversity is brought to the ecosystem New currencies traded new companies created and new asset classes used as a source of income increase the diversity of the crypto world and thus ef\xef\xac\x81ciency Along these axes the quadrants move from the low impact low diversity Scalers to the high impact high diversity Market movers Specialized players contribute to the overall development of the crypto ecosystem but tend to offer only one option to the users Market movers combine high impact to crypto ecosystem development with diversi\xef\xac\x81ed options to the users Scalers exploit existing approaches within already available options inside the crypto ecosystem Broadeners use existing solutions to offer a broad range of opportunities to users THIS CHART SHOWS THAT BLACKMOON PROVIDES INDUSTRY IMPACT WHILE DELIVERING THE GREATEST DIVERSITY OF INVESTMENT OPTIONS BLACKMOON PAGE 8 OF 27 WHITEPAPER MARKET OVERVIEW \x0cNext we compared the features of Blackmoon with other providers of access to the investment vehicles revealing that the approach planned with Blackmoon will consistently provide the best advantages to its investors BLACKMOON Access to \xef\xac\x81at funds Access to crypto funds Fund diversity Distribution of fund management income to the token holders * Focus on compliance ** Team experience in launching and managing funds *** Reserves for tokens buyout * ICONOMI introduced token repurchases in 2Q 2017 Still there is no rule how much money will be allocated each quarter to this program Thus there is no certainty of cash \xef\xac\x82ows as opposed to Blackmoon tokens held by Continuous Contributors (as de\xef\xac\x81ned further) ** It is stated that \xe2\x80\x9cICONOMIs management will be provided by an EU legislation compliant and regulated service operator \xe2\x80\x9dStill it is not clear whether the investment vehicles themselves will be legally compliant or whether the company has such a goal as opposed to Blackmoon\xe2\x80\x99s mission to create a fully legally compliant tokenized funds ecosystem *** Melonport\xe2\x80\x99s CEO has extensive experience in \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions and funds However Blackmoon\xe2\x80\x99s team has the advantage of having set up from scratch and successfully running venture capital and alternative \xef\xac\x81xed income funds BLACKMOON PAGE 9 OF 27 WHITEPAPER MARKET OVERVIEW \x0cBlackmoon is positioned to become the industry standard for

The Blackmoon Platform is a set of technologies techniques interfaces know how legal frameworks and partnerships with banks and other licensed players in the \xef\xac\x81nancial market The resulting platform allows investment advisors to structure promote and maintain tokenized investment funds for their clients FIGURE 3 The structure of the Blackmoon Platform and the distribution of BMC tokens

Distribution of proceeds among Continuous Contributors Management Fee Performance Fee LLP LTD Creation fee Redemption fee \x0cAt the base of the structure is the holding company owned by Blackmoon Financial Group with a subsidiary management company to manage the funds The holding company develops all aspects of the Blackmoon Platform as well as work on attracting and evaluating investment advisors who establish tokenized funds within the Blackmoon Platform These funds are investment vehicles each of which is dedicated to executing a particular investment strategy under the management of its investment advisor The management company and by extension the holding company is responsible for compliance licensing partnering with banks and working with legal advisors Holders of BMC tokens are able to register as Continuous Contributors to the Platform via the Platform\xe2\x80\x99s website Continuous Contributors are able to deposit BMCs in a depository wallet linked to their account To register as a Continuous Contributor the holder of BMC tokens can choose the role that she/he is willing to execute as a contributor to the Platform The list of available roles are publicly available on the blackmooncrypto com website and are updated as needed to re\xef\xac\x82ect the current needs of the Platform\xe2\x80\x99s continuous development One of the main roles will be that of an Investment Advisor Other roles will be platform promoters investment analysts legal advisors public auditors GR advisors etc Each role has a speci\xef\xac\x81c minimum and maximum amount of BMCs that can be deposited by a Continuous Contributor while executing such a role The minimum limit will be mostly applicable to Investment Advisors (please refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cContribution of Investment Advisors\xe2\x80\x9d section below) The majority of roles do not have a minimum deposit limit Continuous Contributors have the right to participate in \xe2\x80\x9cmembers only\xe2\x80\x9d discussions regarding the Platform strategy and development plan At least once a year or as needed the Platform will initiate a vote among the Continuous Contributors to gather opinions of the contributing community on strategic development matters The results of such voting will not be binding but will be strongly considered by the operational management Continuous Contributors from time to time con\xef\xac\x81rm the execution of their roles on the platform to keep their status and depository wallets active The process of the status con\xef\xac\x81rmation will be speci\xef\xac\x81ed for each role BLACKMOON PAGE 14 OF 27 WHITEPAPER THE BLACKMOON PLATFORM \x0cIMPORTANT Because of current regulatory uncertainty and before additional information is publicly released by the Platform on the matter green card holders of the United States or citizens or residents (tax or otherwise) of the United States of America or Singapore or other U S or Singapore Persons are not eligible to register as Continuous Contributors therefore preventing transfer of their BMC tokens to a depository wallet to receive proceeds from them At such time Blackmoon will evaluate the currently applicable legal framework and take all required steps to ensure compliance Continuous Contributors who do not execute their roles or appear to violate the rules applicable for Continuous Contributors (i e appear to be a U S or Singapore Person) may have their status recalled depository wallet closed and their deposited BMCs will be transferred to the holder\xe2\x80\x99s personal wallet without accruing any proceeds It is important to note that Continuous Contributors will receive only proceeds from the funds they contribute to Participants of the Continuous Contributor program do not need to wait for the company to reach breakeven to be awarded All Continuous Contributors regardless of their role will be awarded in BMC tokens Participants of the Continuous Contributor program will have the option to convert accrued BMC tokens to ETH via Bancor Protocol account Roles of Continuous Contributors might differ from fund to fund the roles available will be subject to the funds needs and each role will have its own life span (expiration date) Meaning that not all roles last for the same period of time If in the case a certain role expires (i e fund completed their fundraising stage) redemption fees explained in the section below might accrue for a long term thereafter to other active roles For those roles which expire rewards will be accrued to the initially registered BMC account Important notice If the participant does not redeem BMC tokens within half a year (6 months) the accrual of additional BMC tokens will be suspended and the unredeemed tokens will be repossessed by the platform BLACKMOON PAGE 15 OF 27 WHITEPAPER THE BLACKMOON PLATFORM \x0cSOURCES OF PROCEEDS FOR CONTINUOUS CONTRIBUTORS SOURCES OF INCOME FOR INVESTMENT ADVISORS The Blackmoon Tokens BMCs provide proceeds to Continuous Contributors who deposited BMCs in depository wallets as follows Investment advisors working with the Blackmoon Platform earn income as follows Creation fee Management fee 0 10% from the amount of the issued asset tokens On average 2 5% This fee will be paid by investors of the fund directly The management fee averages 2% per annum paid daily Redemption fee The performance fee is paid either monthly or quarterly or yearly or upon exit from investment based on the fund distribution policy and is on average 20% from the fund\xe2\x80\x99s performance Calculation of the fund\xe2\x80\x99s performance is audited and published on the Blackmoon Platform and cannot be different from the one that is used for income distribution among holders of the asset tokens All investors of a fund who choose to redeem their asset tokens will pay a fee for this type of operation The fee of redemption will depend on the asset token redeemed All redemption fees will be stated in the fund\xe2\x80\x99s info window and might be subject to change Continuous Contributors can hold their BMC tokens in special depository wallets linked to their accounts to receive their share of proceeds in proportion to the amount of BMCs deposited by the Continuous Contributor to the total amount of deposited BMCs Only BMCs held in such a manner receive the proceeds This is to discourage transferring of the proceeds to exchanges holders that do not contribute to the Platform in operational manner or other unrelated parties Tokens stored on exchanges or transferred to other wallets cannot receive proceeds Owners can withdraw BMCs from the depository wallets and sell them to other parties at any time subject to applicable regulations in the jurisdictions of the purchaser and the seller BLACKMOON PAGE 16 OF 27 WHITEPAPER THE BLACKMOON PLATFORM Performance (or success) fee \x0cCONTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENT ADVISORS To be quali\xef\xac\x81ed as an investment advisor on the Blackmoon Platform an asset manager must (a) contribute to the company and (b) hold a speci\xef\xac\x81ed number of BMC tokens in a depository account The amounts of the contribution and deposit will be case speci\xef\xac\x81c but generally vary from 10 000 to 1 000 000 BMCs This increases the level of partnership responsibility for the investment advisor on the Blackmoon Platform and is the \xef\xac\x81nal step of the quali\xef\xac\x81cation process Another bene\xef\xac\x81t of this level of participation and partnership with the investment advisors is that it forms a foundation for future self regulation of the system THE FUND STRUCTURE The fund structure can differ from one case to another While it will evolve as new data becomes available it will be overseen by reputable legal counsel and summaries of such reviews will be published Fully compliant with applicable laws each investment fund is incorporated as a Limited Partnership or another form as is suitable for the speci\xef\xac\x81c case The fund tokenizer domiciled in the Cayman Islands or comparable jurisdiction is the only limited partner of the fund This tokenizer performs distribution of the asset tokens to attract \xef\xac\x81at and/or crypto currencies then the proceeds are transferred to the fund to provide capital for future investments All fund transfers will be transparent and their tokens will be continuously tradable to provide investors with necessary liquidity subject to any applicable legal restrictions in speci\xef\xac\x81c jurisdictions such as the United States and Singapore An example of this process is shown in Figure 4 below FIGURE 4 Example of the \xef\xac\x81at / crypto investment fundraising process Data on amount of tokens to be issued given exchange rate \xe2\x82\xac

income to the asset token holders This process is shown in Figure 5 below and is illustrated as follows 25% 25% of the proceeds are reinvested to multiply the return to the investors via compound interest of the proceeds are paid to the investment advisor in form of a performance fee 50% 50% of the proceeds are distributed among the asset token holders via a buy back process In this way distribution of income provides liquidity of the asset tokens Bought out tokens are burned so that income will continue to increase for the remaining asset tokens FIGURE 5 Example of the distribution
