\x0c4 Lition White Paper KEY HIGHLIGHTS Lition is developing the world\xe2\x80\x99s first scalable public private blockchain with deletable data features made for commercial products This state of the art protocol enables blockchain based applications to step out of their current niche into commercial mainstream deployment Blockchain development is co innovated with SAP whose chief innovation officer Dr J\xc3\xbcrgen M\xc3\xbcller is also an advisor to Lition SAP a company with >400 million users and >10 000 developers is developing the decentralized ledger and smart contract layer while Lition is providing the open consensus layer Lition will run the public mainnet using Lition tokens issued in an ICO for transaction execution staking and sidechain creation Lition is well positioned to design a blockchain infrastructure for business use as it launched the world\xe2\x80\x99s first P2P energy trading dApp that is commercially live in a mass market with real revenues and real customers in over 25 cities In addition to this existing P2P trading dApp there is a second use case in which Lition together with a major Bank and a real estate company has developed an MVP to syndicate loans and later tokenize the loans as Security Tokens (STOs) Beyond this there are many more use cases with the potential to disrupt not only the Energy and Banking spaces but many others as well Furthermore SAP can easily implement this blockchain into their existing products and services for their customer base of >400 000 making them immediately ready for blockchain use cases It is therefore well positioned to become the standard mainnet for business applications LITION HIGHLIGHTS Offering all what businesses need A public private legal and efficient infrastructure Your data kept private Regulation proof & deletable Built with SAP with Lition as their only co innovator Sensitive data is stored on private sidechains Quantumcompute safe Store your private data only as long as you consent Fully compliant with EU data privacy regulations Made possible through the invaluable expertise and support from key industry players Infinitely scalable Every new sidechain increases throughput Cross industry use cases and applications Built on live P2P application Fast and low priced Our blockchain is informed by our own hands on experience of Lition\xe2\x80\x99s live energy trading dApp Smart contract execution for $0 01 and only 3 sec block confirmation time \x0c5 Lition White Paper LITION\xe2\x80\x99S VISION Our aim is to bring blockchain technology from its current hype driven speculation fueled state with mostly pilot projects into mainstream commercial use Blockchain technology should improve the everyday lives of the people \xe2\x80\x9cLition \xe2\x80\x93 bringing standard blockchain technology to business\xe2\x80\x9d Lition\xe2\x80\x99s vision In order to achieve this our objective is to develop an easy to use and easy to develop infrastructure that fulfills the requirements of all businesses from small companies to large corporations Our blockchain should be the number one choice for any developer or company seeking to use blockchain technologies \x0c6 Lition White Paper THE BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE WHY BLOCKCHAINS MISS MAINSTREAM ADOPTION Even though blockchains are regularly praised as a technology with the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries like the internet did 20 years ago we see limited mainstream adoption Very few distributed applications (dApps) have made it into mass market use and large companies continue to shy away from the technology Instead we see many proof of concept or pilot projects that showcase the technology but never make it to the next step Leading tech companies have not begun pushing blockchain into the market The reasons for this are both commercial/legal and technical COMMERCIAL / LEGAL REASONS Large scale adoption of new technical solutions comes primarily from established companies that already own the majority of customer interfaces across industry sectors like technology automotive healthcare finance etc These are typically large corporations that use specific frameworks in order to decide whether or not to roll out a new technology to their customers Blockchains miss mainstream adoption as they do not meet commercial requirements of corporates Global industry players require large established IT partners for blockchain implementation as \xe2\x80\xa2 Current mainnets protocols and dApps fail on compliance \xe2\x80\xa2 Missing large implementations and programming resources \xe2\x80\xa2 Lacking integration with current conglomerate systems \xe2\x80\xa2 No long term stability of blockchain/dApps and the teams Current blockchain companies are mostly startups or foundations with only a few years of track record \xe2\x80\x93 even for large players like Ethereum High personal and company risk for corporate decision makers to use current blockchain solutions No large industry players ensuring adoption of technology Figure 1 Commercial reasons for low mainstream adoption of blockchains Further press outlets are overshadowed by blockchain hacks and scam ICOs which make it more difficult for riskaverse companies to go into this segment Most blockchain dApps and protocols are illegal when used in countries with strict data protection laws like in EU \x0c7 Lition White Paper Current blockchain solutions carry a high risk for corporate decision makers and their organizations with 4 key reasons outlined in Figure 1 There has not been a solution that addressed these issues until now TECHNICAL REASONS With the hands on experience gained as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s few mass market blockchain applications in commercial production Lition has experienced first hand that there is no blockchain infrastructure available that fulfills the technical requirements needed for mainstream adoption outside of very specific niche use cases Instead current blockchain technologies are designed for strengths in specific areas as shown in Figure 2 Blockchains miss mainstream adoption as they do not meet technical requirements Open & permission less \xe2\x80\x93 MISSING PRIVACY AND DELETABILITY No chain fulfills all requirements needed for commercial business use Separate private data storage \xe2\x80\x93 MISSING OPENNESS AND DELETABILITY simultaneously Ready for commercial use in regulated areas like ability to delete data \xe2\x80\x93 MISSING OPENNESS Fast efficient and scalable with (near) infinite sidechains \xe2\x80\x93 MISSING DELETABILITY AND PRIVACY Figure 2 Technical reasons for low mainstream adoption of blockchains These limitations largely explain why mainstream adoption of blockchains has been so slow and why public attention has instead been driven by cryptocurrency price developments and speculative use LITION\xe2\x80\x99S APPROACH TO BRING BLOCKCHAIN INTO MAINSTREAM USE In order to bring blockchains into mainstream use Lition needs to address the commercial and technical issues outlined above As many commercial issues cannot necessarily be solved by innovative but inexperienced players Lition has partnered with SAP The software giant SAP is the worldwide leader in business software with a market capitalization of $150bn over 400mn users from their >400 000 customers and the power of >10 000 developers With Lition\xe2\x80\x99s extensive IT knowledge and experience from launching the world\xe2\x80\x99s first blockchain based peer topeer energy trading application in a mass market we\xe2\x80\x99re working together on a next generation blockchain infrastructure The Lition/SAP blockchain is made specifically to be the standard blockchain infrastructure accepted by big industry players and used by any developer working on a dApp that serves a mainstream market in a legally compliant way \x0c8 Lition White Paper With the backing of a strong company like SAP and innovative privacy and deletability features our new blockchain addresses many commercial issues outlined in Figure 1 making it a lower risk choice for corporate executives \xe2\x80\x93 in turn enabling mainstream adoption A more detailed description on the partnership is outlined in a separate section on page 11 In addition to the commercial purposes the new blockchain is specifically designed to address the technical limitations outlined in Figure 2 in one integrated blockchain infrastructure To be more specific Lition addresses six core infrastructural issues outlined in Figure 3 along the existing live use case as it shows the whole breadth of all improved features within a single customer journey Depending on the use case of the commercial blockchain applications some or all of these features may be needed Figure 3 Improvements of new blockchain infrastructure illustrated along existing peer to peer trading use case Feature 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Light Client That Can Run on IoT Devices Many use cases require IoT devices e g sensors appliances or Smart Meters as used by Lition (see the Smart Metering section on page 40) Today\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain clients which participate in the network as nodes always require significant storage and processing capacity Lition\xe2\x80\x99s current Ethereum client from Parity (parity io) the most popular client in use requires over 300 GB of storage Even special clients like GETH 1 require 80 GB of storage in their fast modes dropping as low as 40 GB for pruned (trimmed) clients if only the most recent blocks are stored Pure light clients that only store block headers can go down to 40 MB but just like remote clients that don\xe2\x80\x99t require any storage light clients do not have access to the data of previous blockchain executions which is needed to execute smart contracts and verify the correct execution of network nodes A blockchain built for widespread commercial use therefore needs clients that can run on thin hardware such as Smart Meters or the control units of the distribution grid\xe2\x80\x99s voltage regulators while still calling and verifying the smart contracts they deploy Other industries face the same barriers with existing blockchains for example banking 1 See https //github com/ethereum/go ethereum/releases \x0c9 Lition White Paper with lightweight Point of Sales (PoS) devices or the automotive sector with connected cars increasing relevance for such features beyond the energy space A promising solution could be provided by Slock it which is piloting a similar light client but so far it is limited to the Ethereum network with its corresponding shortfalls Feature 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Low Transaction Costs High transaction costs caused by low energy efficiency are a common drawback of typical blockchain implementations with Bitcoin as the most prominent example In the existing energy use case before migration to Lition\xe2\x80\x99s own platform smart contract executions can cost up to USD 0 60 depending on Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s network congestion This is caused by the high number of hash computations that are required by the network\xe2\x80\x99s Proof ofWork (PoW) consensus algorithm which results in extremely high energy consumption Bitcoin currently needs 60 TWh 2 annually for its blockchain to operate an amount of energy equivalent to the country of Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s annual energy consumption At Lition a core value is the sustainable use of natural resources and therefore it is pivotal that we operate on the most energy efficient platform available In comparison the Ethereum blockchain consumes 78 kWh/transaction2 thus making it 12 2 times more energy efficient than the Bitcoin network which uses 957 kWh/transaction2 These numbers will further improve once Ethereum developers switch from their current PoW solution into a Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm and Vitalik Buterin\xe2\x80\x99s work on offchain smart contracts with Plasma 3 is released into production state To operate sustainably Lition aims to reduce energy consumption and thus cost per transaction to less than USD 0 01 Almost all modern infrastructure chains like NEM Cardano ZipChain or Hashgraph have developed solutions to solve this issue with the many available open source reference implementations Therefore this issue has been solved However none of these chains are additionally able to solve the other drawbacks that concern businesses like delectability or storage of private data in separate but publicly verifiable sidechains Feature 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Fast Block Confirmation Currently customers need to wait well over a minute before their transactions are successfully executed on the Ethereum blockchain The underlying reason is high block confirmation times of 10 20 seconds along with a block height of several blocks needed for certainty As many use cases require transactions to be finalized in about 1 3 seconds Lition is pursuing a protocol to massively improve the block times for smart contract executions As with the issue of high transaction costs most modern chains have claimed to find solutions to this problem while staying permissionless But as is the case with the transaction cost issue they have not been able to do so while also addressing other shortcomings like private data Feature 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Private Sidechains for Private Data Today typical permissionless blockchains store their data publicly potentially allowing criminals to misuse this information e g bank accounts or social security numbers In the existing use case this could be Smart Meter data e g availability of electrical appliances which could provide an indication of household income a customer 2 3 digiconomist net/bitcoin energy consumption plasma io \x0c10 Lition White Paper possessing 3 TVs an energy efficient dishwasher a dryer and an electric floor heater is obviously wealthier than the average household This is all data that Lition can already detect today with its Smart Meter integration (see the use case section later in this white paper for details) but no customer would want this information to be publicly known This aspect applies to many industries such as (a) banking with personal loans and account transaction data (b) construction with historic property data (c) healthcare with medical patient data (d) supply chain management with product contract and origin data or (e) social media with identity or personal (meta)data Typical solutions propose achieving privacy by putting private data on a public chain and encrypting it as suggested e g by researchers Karla Kvaternik et al 4 Lition is aware that these solutions have fundamental limitations as the encrypted data is still publicly available and is therefore prone to hacking if vulnerabilities in the encryption are found or sufficient processing power is available This is unlikely now but as the data is stored permanently and publicly it will still be there in 5 to 10 years when quantum computing is set to emerge and loopholes may be found This has happened many times so far e g for the widely used WEP encryption which due to faulty design does not give reliable protection against hackers Instead Lition knows private data needs to reside on private sidechains available only to trusted nodes Furthermore public sidechains are still needed for public data such as the current energy prices of power plants that must be publicly available Both the private and the public sidechains need to be embedded in a greater public permissionless network so that new participants can easily join ensuring easy and developer friendly adoption of the chain A solution is the utilization of probabilistic zero knowledge proofs as shown in the technical white paper This would allow public nodes to verify the private transactions inside private sidechains ensuring overall consistency Feature 5 \xe2\x80\x93 API for Chain \xe2\x86\x94 Backend Communication for Easy Developer Access During the development of the energy trading use case Lition developers had to spend a great deal of time and resources to develop an API interface that enables communication between the blockchain and the Lition backend application Blockchain nodes need a simple API interface to allow easy integration into non blockchain applications This is required by business blockchain applications in every industry that require integration into off chain systems This issue needs to be addressed in order to allow a quick and easy rollout of the Lition blockchain solution into mass markets and additional use cases Typical large industry players have a complex legacy IT landscape making an easy and seamless integration even more important These findings are not new as corporate targeted projects like NEM or SAP\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain as a service solutions have also identified this pain point which must now be addressed However neither NEM nor SAP\xe2\x80\x99s current solution is able to also solve the other issues that remain in regulated markets Feature 6 \xe2\x80\x93 Data Can Be Deleted from Blockchain Currently transactions on blockchains are permanently and irreversibly stored on the blockchain While this is a precondition of any public chain it is not necessarily in the customer\ s best interest In an ongoing business relationship a customer might accept that his social security number or bank account is needed but want to make sure this data is deleted once the business relationship ends and the data is no longer needed However once a 4 See Privacy Preserving Platform for Transactive Energy Systems Middleware\xe2\x80\x9917 Las Vegas Nevada USA arxiv org/pdf/1709 09597 pdf \x0c11 Lition White Paper customer terminates his contract there is currently no way to delete this sensitive data \xe2\x80\x93 blockchains are not designed for this Most solutions today that support deletion of data only store the references in the blockchain with the real data stored off block When private data needs to be deleted the on block reference is kept unchanged but the off block data is deleted The problem with this approach is that any smart contract execution requiring private data needs access to the off chain resource defeating the purpose of a blockchain In addition to customer issues there are also legal requirements from the GDPR (General Data Protection Rules) effective throughout the EU and many other national data privacy guidelines They enforce deletion of private data once it is no longer needed In the EU violations of this law can lead to fines of up to 4% of a company\xe2\x80\x99s global annual revenue which can be hundreds of millions of dollars for large corporations This has been the focus of several press articles 5 While this might not be an issue for Proof of Concept blockchain applications it will be once an application launches and is brought to commercial mainstream adoption Therefore any business desiring to share its blockchain application with on block storage of private data to the masses needs to use an infrastructure supporting data deletion THE PARTNERSHIP WITH SAP SAP the world\xe2\x80\x99s business software leader with over 400 000 customers and >10 000 developers has signed a coinnovation contract to work with Lition on solving the limitations of today\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain infrastructure such as privacy speed and transaction costs A summary of this cooperation is outlined by Dr J\xc3\xbcrgen M\xc3\xbcller SAP\xe2\x80\x99s chief technology officer (CTO) in the following interview Watch the interview with SAP\xe2\x80\x99s CTO explaining the cooperation at https //youtu be/lXpBRHptyKk SAP and Lition believe that a technical solution to the issues limiting mainstream use will spur adoption of blockchain and blockchain influenced applications This will benefit SAP\xe2\x80\x99s customers and Lition\xe2\x80\x99s public mainnet users alike SAP and Lition are therefore cooperating to design a permissioned platform that focuses on data storage and exchange with a layer for publicly verifiable claims similar to concepts described commonly as zero knowledge proofs This will allow high throughput and low latency for the majority of private transactions and public validation capabilities for select records 5 See e g https //iapp org/news/a/blockchain technology is on a collision course with eu privacy law/ \x0c12 Lition White Paper Based on this design SAP would leverage their existing database & middleware expertise to explore a platform that incorporates a pluggable verification layer Lition would provide a decentralized consensus and verification mechanism tailor made to hold these publicly verifiable claims extending the capabilities to an identity agnostic audience and thereby turning it into a public blockchain This allows SAP to validate the concept of backing records against a public blockchain Meanwhile Lition can run its ecosystem on the public segment of the solution where miners execute transactions and are compensated by tokens similar to today\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum blockchain SAP can further integrate the blockchain into their existing product portfolio and offer it to their over 400 000 customers COMPARISON WITH EXISTING CHAINS Lition has conducted extensive discussions with leading experts in order to overcome the issues outlined in the previous section After researching dozens of different chains Lition found many solutions to almost every individual issue but no integrated coherent solution Comparison of blockchain infrastructure solutions Lition Ethereum EOS NEM Cardano NEO ICON Hyperledger EWF Polkadot

solutions \x0c13 Lition White Paper To provide a background the six underlying features can be segmented into the following groups \xe2\x80\xa2 Light client (#1) Costs (#2) Speed (#3) Accessibility (#5) As described in the previous section there are many chains or workarounds to address these issues With the currently ongoing Hyperledgerimplementation Lition already addresses many of them As many open source implementations exist with a license allowing code re use for commercial applications these concerns are less critical \xe2\x80\xa2 Private sidechain for private data (#4) Many purely public (e g Ethereum) and purely private (e g Hyperledger) chains exist When both private and public data need to be stored three potentially relevant options exist for a commercial implementation However they all exhibit other concerns (see below) and none of them provides a solution for deleting data (#6) o ICON a chain to connect public and private blockchains was the prime candidate as a foundation for the existing Lition use case but in intense discussions with numerous blockchain specialists including a joint discussion the founders had with ICON\xe2\x80\x99s Lead Blockchain Architect in Seoul (see Lition\xe2\x80\x99s twitter account for pictures and more information) we could not apply the financeoriented nature of the blockchain to the smart contract oriented nature needed by the decentralized applications of the use case o Polkadot is technically not a blockchain but rather a method to connect blockchains The concept is very close to Lition\xe2\x80\x99s as they plan to connect private/consortium chains and public/permissionless networks However due to a faulty implementation by their developer Parity Technologies USD 150m of Ether is frozen forever 6 This is the majority of their funding making it unclear if they have sufficient funds to ever make it to production as planned for Q3 2019 Also reputational risks make it difficult to recommend a solution with this track record to the risk averse companies in regulated markets o Energy Web Foundation is an open source blockchain designed for the energy sector with support for light clients and confidential messages It is driven by large corporations such as E On PG&E and Shell and caters to the needs of these large conglomerates therefore prolonging the shortfalls of these inefficient markets and leading to excess profits and continued market domination by these corporations EWF relies on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism (with authority given to the conglomerates) which defeats the open nature of a blockchain As it is a fork of the Ethereum mainnet it also has many Ethereum related shortcomings such as the inability to have both public and private sidechains and to delete data Also unlike Lition it has no use cases that have been brought to commercial production let alone mass markets 6 https //www trustnodes com/2017/11/07/ethereums parity hacked half million eth frozen \x0c14 Lition White Paper ARCHITECTURE Applications need scalable fast and legal blockchain infrastructures in order to find a context where it makes sense to approach the business arena As of the time of writing such a context does not exist Current solutions are unable to keep data private and lack deletability features The three keywords of our solution are sidechains permissioned nodes and permissionless nodes Lition is developing a solution that will assure data privacy while being permissionless This is made possible by connecting a permissioned sidechain to a public mainchain THE LAYER 2 STRUCTURE Lition\xe2\x80\x99s Layer 2 solution consists of permissioned nodes that run a privileged blockchain network which becomes a sidechain once the mainnet sync happens The nodes run the network with the Lition Proof of Stake (LPoS) consensus algorithm making it an extremely fast chain Every n blocks depending on the industry requirements the side chain will synchronize to the public mainnet Only the hash of the last block is published and saved on the mainnet assuring the integrity of all previously validated transactions At the same time an API is exposed so that public nodes have the opportunity to verify the integrity of a hash within a sidechain As a public network Lition will use the Ethereum blockchain However if technology advances and interoperability between different blockchains becomes feasible it is Lition\xe2\x80\x99s goal to develop a \xe2\x80\x9cuniversal\xe2\x80\x9d layer 2 solution for all Public blockchains The role of a public mainnet is to store sidechains\xe2\x80\x99 hashes as proof of their historical integrity The integrity of recorded blocks is ensured as two thirds of sidechain nodes need to confirm integrity to the mainnet \x0c15 Lition White Paper DATA SEPARATION AND DELETION CONCEPT Separate storage of private and public data is core to Lition\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain architecture In a nutshell we split between \xe2\x80\xa2 Sidechain block hashes and management Stored in the mainnet (currently Ethereum) \xe2\x80\xa2 DApp data and smart contract executions Stored in the sidechains (public or private) The blockchain network\xe2\x80\x99s design covers minimum requirements for a governing agreement among a privileged subset of the nodes\xe2\x80\x99 operators ensuring that private sensitive data can be handled and securely deleted on demand even connected to smart contracts for deletion The guiding design criteria are post quantum security for data integrity a path towards post quantum security for data privacy data minimization under the constraint of providing fault tolerance privacy of sensitive data a provision to delete all occurrences of sensitive data and the freedom to join as a (non privileged) node without any special provisions or legal obligations Technically private data is only stored on privileged nodes that are mining private sidechains The data never leaves the sidechain only the hashes do This allows public nodes to verify the integrity of the sidechain transactions The mainchain therefore acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cnotary\xe2\x80\x9d for the private data stored only in the sidechain 0x000\xe2\x80\xa6 Public Nodes (as miner) \xe2\x80\xa2 Mine the main chain and 0 n side chains \xe2\x80\xa2 Use Proof of Stake consensus \xe2\x80\xa2 Execute Smart Contracts on (public) side chain and receive tokens as reward \xe2\x80\xa2 Open for anyone User \xe2\x80\xa2 Calls smart contracts via REST \xe2\x80\xa2 Pays for gas of SC from a wallet Actor \xe2\x80\xa2 Creates and owns 0n sidechain groups (possibly for private data) \xe2\x80\xa2 Spends tokens depending on sidechain size \xe2\x80\xa2 Pushes new/updated smart contracts to his knowledge group \xe2\x80\xa2 Can be app developer or usecase specific e g power plant grid operator retailer etc Public nodes (any node) Metadata Transaction 0xABC\xe2\x80\xa6 Data content Blockchain Integrity Nodes can verify the integrity of sidechain without knowing private data and thus can trust outcome \xe2\x80\xa2 Integrity of individual TX is verified through endorsements by privileged nodes \xe2\x80\xa2 Integrity of private blockchain is verified through hashchain or 2nd level endorsements Store blinded data (hashes) in side or main blockchain Typical data (main chain) \xe2\x80\xa2 Token balances \xe2\x80\xa2 Sidechain list \xe2\x80\xa2 Staked tokens Sample data (P2P trading) \xe2\x80\xa2 Prices for grid & producers \xe2\x80\xa2 P2P trades (without usage) Privileged nodes (as named in invocation of smart contract) Privileged Nodes \xe2\x80\xa2 Mine and execute 1 n private side chains \xe2\x80\xa2 Need permission by owner of each side chain \xe2\x80\xa2 Have access to private data \xe2\x80\xa2 Sign up to Terms of Service and can delete data \xe2\x80\xa2 Endorse transactions and vouch with staked tokens \xe2\x80\xa2 Vouch for lawful behavior with staked tokens Store data content in a distributed keyvalue store ( unhasher ) Sample data (P2P trading) \xe2\x80\xa2 Billing details \xe2\x80\xa2 Energy consumption \xe2\x80\xa2 Energy appliances in household \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa6 Deleted data is removed \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Store tx hashes and endorse ments in sidechain Allows verification of integrity back to Genesys block of sidechain Endorsements (hash and endorser\xe2\x80\x98s signature) are made public Hashes of deleted data remain Figure 5 Lition blockchain data separation and deletion concept Private sidechains also have the ability to delete data Privileged nodes have to agree to Terms of Service (ToS) upon joining the sidechain which can include a requirement to delete data upon request This gives the sidechain owner (who is legally obliged to guarantee data deletion) the ability to in a legal and contractually confirmed way guarantee that every data holder will delete the data when asked to do so Technically a deletion request is a transaction signed by the original data owner with the data hash that should be deleted Upon receipt all nodes will delete the data of the requested transaction but the transaction hash stays 2 \x0c16 Lition White Paper intact Therefore the Merkle tree of the block remains intact and an unobstructed trail from the most recent block all the way to the sidechain\xe2\x80\x99s genesis block is possible While the functional requirements addressed by this blockchain are derived from the shortcomings described earlier in this chapter Lition provides the technical description in a separate technical whitepaper It caters to the technically interested reader and also provides the fundamentals from current research The technical white paper is available at www lition io in the Downloads section STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION OF CORE PROCESSES In this chapter we provide the reader with detailed step by step explanations on how transactions are processed how nodes can join the network and how they can stake and validate new blocks STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND MINING Observing Lition\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain from a high level we see that six main stages are needed to complete the transaction (=Tx) flow They are in this order Put Gas on Sidechain Create Tx Process Tx Propagation within sidechain New block creation (Sidechain) and Mainnet synchronization For a better understanding of the

(3) Staked Tokens Figure 6 Transaction Flow in Sidechain Step 0 Put Gas on Sidechain In order to guarantee that a certain network user will be able to pay for transactions he or she needs to allocate tokens to the specific Sidechain This process requires a smart contract execution on the mainchain called \x0c17 Lition White Paper AllocToken(sidechainID tokenAmount) As is evident the amount of tokens and the ID of the sidechain are required This ensures that the solution is protected against double spend attacks on multiple sidechains Step 1 Create Tx This step refers to the event in which a given user utilizes Lition\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain and triggers a transaction which implies a cascade of events as described below Transaction deployment is compatible with today\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum blockchain so developers have no migration effort allowing a fast growth of the blockchain Smart Contracts If dApp developers use Truffle for example they just need to pinpoint the deployment to a different network in the Truffle configuration file Solutions allowing upgradability of contracts such as OpenZeppelin can be used Clients The Lition blockchain client is fully compatible with the Web3 js and RPC interconnection capabilities of Geth or Zeplin Users can continue to use plugins such as Metamask and dApp developers can reuse their existing Ethereum applications Step 2 Process Tx During this process the transaction is received from the node which in turn ensures that if enough gas is owned by the user the user\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract containing the following information is triggered Tx The smart contract name For example in the case of energy buy energy() TxHash Transaction data are hashed so that a unique hash is created Gas Gas used for the transaction User User\xe2\x80\x99s wallet Unlike existing blockchain implementations a user gets an instant (<3 seconds) response if a transaction was processed successfully i e if the smart contract code was executed without errors and if the user had sufficient gas This ensures a convenient experience for the customer and meets expectations for mass market use cases Step 3 Propagation within the Sidechain Once the transaction is processed it is propagated throughout the network of nodes in the sidechain previously specified by the user using a gossip protocol At this point the transaction is in a pre validation stage waiting to be mined by Lition\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Stake (LPoS) consensus algorithm Step 4 New Block Creation within the Sidechain During this stage the transaction triggered by the user together with a variable number of other transactions undergoes a process that validates this bundle of data and transfers it to the blockchain in an irreversible way This is similar to existing blockchains but we introduce finality ensuring consistency between sidechains and the anchored mainchain hashes Each new sidechain block contains the following information MerkleRoot The root hash of the merkle tree of the block BlockTX[] The hashes of each transaction needed for the merkle tree Hash_prev Hash of the previous block going back all the way to the genesis Miners[] Pool of miners that were active and contributed to this block The LPoS mining reward is then calculated and transferred by calculations within this mainnet smart contract upon mainnet anchoring The latter three \x0c18 Lition White Paper sets of information (Tokens_N %_active Sec_active) are the core variables of the algorithm which decides the node that is going to be the validator at any given block creation time This process is done by nodes that are therefore not only carrying all the historical sidechain data but also function as authorities that guarantee correct behavior within the network by staking their own tokens as \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that in the case of misbehavior tokens are going to be lost Lition\xe2\x80\x99s consensus mechanism that will assure the integrity of sidechains can be seen as a pure Proof of Stake (Pos) Each and every sidechain has its own network of nodes Each node has to subscribe to a particular chain by filling in some parameters in a sidechain specific smart contract to the backbone mainnet The function to call is StakeTokens() which can be called by any mining node of the sidechain and it is a prerequisite for miners to receive their mining reward The details of the smart contract are described in the process flow for sidechain creation To ensure the ability to delete data within a private sidechain participating privileged nodes need to agree to Terms of Service (ToS) that require them to delete data once the properly signed request arrives However they only delete the data while keeping the corresponding hashes This allows the underlying Merkle tree of the block to stay intact and thereby ensures traceability all the way to the genesis block Step 5 Mainnet Synchronization During this stage the transaction (which is now already an integral part of the sidechain and is therefore irreversible in its specific allocation) will be validated by a public mainnet The communication frequency with the backbone blockchain is industry specific For example energy transactions need to be synced frequently while notary contracts need to be synced less often The synchronization parameters of each sidechain are decided during the sidechain registration process The parameters to set are the number of transactions that must occur before the synchronization happens the time interval between synchronizations or both This particular process will be explained in more depth in the next chapter of this document For the purpose of synchronization only the hash of the last block is required to be stored on the Public Chain as that assures the integrity of the whole interval of blocks For example the tiniest change in the data saved in previous blocks of the given interval will affect and change completely the hash of the last block That occurs because every new block uses the hash from the previous block as part of the data to be hashed with the Merkle tree of the specific block Thus the load of data to be stored on the public chain is almost irrelevant but the results are the same Once the time of synchronization arrives the following smart contract function is called in order to anchor the sidechain data in the mainnet thereby making it immutable Notarize(sidechainID BlockHash TxUsers[] Activity[]) BlockHash The hash of the most recent sidechain block header TxUsers[] The wallets of users indicating aggregate gas costs per wallet based on the transaction usage Activity[] The activity record of mining nodes Together with the LITION tokens staked through the StakeTokens() mainnet smart contract the Notarize() function knows to whom to distribute the users\xe2\x80\x99 gas \x0c19 Lition White Paper STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION SIDECHAIN MANAGEMENT Use the table below to follow and better understand the process by which a new sidechain is created and reported to the mainchain and how nodes are added and removed How Are Sidechains Registered and Expanded Sequence of Processes 1

Sidechain Every developer or company that decides to join the network has to register its sidechain to the mainnet calling the smart contract RegisterSidechain() The following data is required Sidechain_ID This ID is referred to during staking and synchronization Can be set to NULL in which case the mainnet creates an ID and returns it as return value Permissioned Defines the nature of the sidechain (boolean yes/no) Sync_Cond Defines the parameters of mainchain sync interval length MasterHosts Array of IPs and ports of the set of initial sidechain nodes both for miners to connect to and separately a Website URL that users can use to query for information Step 2 Start Node \x0c20 Lition White Paper The owner or initiator needs to run a node on the mainnet as well as on the sidechain On the sidechain a master host will provide new clients with a list of bootnodes to connect to Step 3 Invite Nodes to Join The node that initiated the sidechain can then invite new nodes to join the network Depending on the configuration of the sidechain which can be public for non sensitive data or private for confidential data new nodes must accordingly be either public or privileged To mine a sidechain miners need to become nodes and mine blocks Should they want to be a publicly announced entry point to the sidechain they can advertise themselves to the public using the function RegisterNode() on the mainnet registration contract The more sidechain nodes advertise themselves on the publicly visible mainnet the more nodes a new miner has to initially connect to Technically new hosts are added to the MasterHosts variable initially set during the RegisterSidechain() smart contract call Respectively the following data sets need to be included Register Node Sidechain_ID This is the ID created from the sidechain initiator Node_ID This code makes each node unique & identifiable Challenge (Optional) A challenge that can only be solved by nodes being granted access to the sidechain Only needed for private sidechains Additionally nodes mining the sidechain may want to stake tokens in order to receive mining rewards which they can do using the StakeTokens() smart contract outlined in the upcoming Step by Step description Step 4 Node Leaves the Network At any given point in time nodes can leave the network The user might leave this side and therefore needs to inform the mainnet This is only needed when nodes have previously called the function RegisterNode() on the registering smart contract To cancel a node and therefore leave the sidechain the user needs to call the UnRegisterNode() function Respectively the following data sets need to be included UnRegisterNode Sidechain_ID This is the ID created from the sidechain initiator Node_ID This code makes each node unique & identifiable A call to UnRegisterNode() automatically unstakes any tokens a miner might have staked on this sidechain as staking rewards can only be received when mining STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION STAKING Every blockchain needs a fuel to run Lition\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Stake (LPoS) is the consensus algorithm which validates the blocks and decides which miner receives the reward A step by step explanation is outlined below \x0c21 Lition White Paper How Are Tokens Staked 2 Connect to Sidechain Sequence of Processes Stake your Tokens & Mine Miner Node 3 Miner Node Client

LITION node 0x890\xe2\x80\xa6 Figure 8 Staking of tokens Step 1 Register as Node in Sidechain The first step for a user to join the network is to become a node by connecting the client to a sidechain Once the node is up and running the block verification process starts automatically and the user becomes a functioning validator in the system Since there is little incentive to operate a full node node operators receive mining rewards in the form of tokens The token distribution happens once each time the blocks are synchronized with the mainchain Nodes therefore not only carry all of the historical sidechain data but also function as authorities that guarantee correct behavior within the network by staking their own tokens as \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that in the case of dishonest mining tokens will be lost Step 2 Stake Tokens & Mine Lition\xe2\x80\x99s consensus mechanism will assure the integrity of sidechains and belongs to the family of Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols Each and every sidechain has its own network of nodes Each node must subscribe to one or more particular chains by filling in parameters in a sidechain specific smart contract to the backbone mainnet The function to call is StakeTokens() where the following data needs to be delivered Sidechain_ID Sidechain the tokens should be allocated to Node_ID Identifies the Node mining the sidechain \x0c22 Lition White Paper Miner_Wallet Wallet where rewards for staking are being transferred Tokens_N Amount of tokens to be allocated to specific SC These tokens are then unavailable for transfer to the mainnet until retrieved again using the UnstakeTokens() smart contract %_active Percentage being active since the last block Mining rewards are multiplied by this figure Sec_active Seconds continuously active Nodes mining for a long time receive a mining premium The latter three sets of information (Tokens_N %_active Sec_active) are the core variables of the algorithm which selects the node that will be the validator at any given block creation time Hence the Miner_Wallet that receives the rewards Step 3 Miner Rewards The miners are rewarded every time the sidechains sync with the mainchain The smart contract that handles the transfers of staking tokens from the user wallets to the miner wallets is called Notarize(sidechainID BlockHash TxUsers[] Activity[]) as was described in the first step by step process description Step 4 Node Leaves the Network Once a node decides to stop staking e g because the user wants to use the tokens on a different sidechain or the mainnet the following smart contract needs to be called UnstakeTokens() where the following parameters must be provided to the system Sidechain_ID Identifies the chain where the node will stop staking Miner_Wallet Wallet where rewards for staking were being transferred Tokens_N Amount of tokens to be allocated away from a specific SC NULL for all Now the tokens are available to join other sidechains \x0c23 Lition White Paper LITION\xe2\x80\x99S PROOF OF STAKE CONSENSUS ALGORITHM Necessity for Tokens Lition itself does not charge for the infrastructure in terms of licensing but the actors that are part of the validation system are not doing the validation task for free Therefore the whole system needs a fuel to run an incentive This incentive is achieved by rewarding validators in native tokens At the same time from a developer perspective the system needs to be free from bugs and potential downtimes or destruction of the system must be disincentivized In some cases that is assured by staked tokens that validators would lose in the case of misbehavior Validators\xe2\x80\x99 Consensus Algorithm Types There are several logics/processes (algorithms) to reach a consensus on which participant of the network (node) gets to add/confirm the newest block and at the same time validate the integrity of its contents Blockchains using Proof of Stake (PoS) require nodes to hold a certain amount of native tokens in order to be eligible to participate in the validation system If the validators misbehave some or all of their tokens will be lost In order to determine the validator that will be rewarded with tokens an unpredictable random function is utilized which according to specific variables determines the probability that a validator node will be chosen Blockchains using Proof of Work (PoW) choose their validator as follows the winner of a high energy consuming mathematical task competition is rewarded with native coins In contrast Lition\xe2\x80\x99s layer 2 solution uses a selfdeveloped Proof of Stake protocol The Lition Proof of Stake (LPoS) mechanism functions as a consensus algorithm with three variables to determine which is the next block to be added to Lition\xe2\x80\x99s private or public sidechains The first variable is the number of tokens that are owned by the node The second variable is the age of the staking wallet and the third is the uninterrupted runtime as an active node since it went online By this mechanism the commitment of validating nodes in the Lition network is rewarded and thus honest behavior is incentivized Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) in One Solution In the case of Lition\xe2\x80\x99s layer 2 solution the transactions are validated once by the sidechain on which the block is mined (LPoS) Since sidechains are again pegged to the backbone mainnet (such as Ethereum) the whole security of Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s proven Proof of Work (PoW) system ensures sidechain transactions cannot be changed As the load on the mainnet is minimal and only non time sensitive transactions are carried out there the disadvantages of PoW to Lition are relatively small Sidechain Creation Lition\xe2\x80\x99s solution is designed so that any developer can quickly launch an application on the network and create its own sidechain(s) to store any public or private data a developer may need Nodes can then subscribe to the sidechain and therefore mine it Once a sidechain is created the transaction fees will provide an incentive for nodes to keep mining it Additionally every sidechain owner must pay a \xe2\x80\x9crent\xe2\x80\x9d in tokens that increases with storage size of the sidechain This gives an extra incentive to the nodes mining it and ensures that even low transaction chains will still continue to operate Otherwise these low transaction sidechains would eventually starve due to too few incentives Communication with the Backbone Mainchain \x0c24 Lition White Paper Lition\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure can be thought of as a system that is composed of two core engines One of these is Lition\xe2\x80\x99s EVM compatible virtual machine which executes smart contracts on its sidechains and the other is the link to the Ethereum mainnet where block hashes are periodically notarized for every sidechain Once a sidechain is registered to stimulate participation Lition will reward and allocate tokens to each node taking part in that specific chain\xe2\x80\x99s network This is part of an initial scheme called the Genesis Phase (see the section on page 27 for more information) On top of this the revenue flow from transaction costs is divided among the staking nodes This way the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s usage costs are transferred from the end user of the application to Lition for the initial period making the system initially more customer friendly The sidechain blocks are then validated on the Ethereum blockchain through a smart contract that executes either once every certain number of sidechain transactions or after a predefined period of time giving each side chain the flexibility to decide depending on the industry As shown in the table below the process of Mainnet Sync from the sidechains to the Ethereum mainnet produces negligible costs per transaction ($1 40/100 000) Gas cost for Mainchain sync Use Cases Lition Trx/Day Eth Average Trx Costs Assumed Average Sync Frequency Average Cost per Day for Sync Table 1 Costs of Mainnet synchronization Today\xe2\x80\x99s Use Cases 8 Growth Plan 2020 30 100 000 400 000 1 500 000 $0 07 $0 07 $0 07 1/5 000 txs

contract execution requires a specific amount of tokens The amount of tokens needed is deterministic similar to Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s Ether Gas function Due to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism the overall costs of transactions and smart contract executions are set to USD 0 01 Potential fluctuations in the LITION/USD exchange rate are accounted for through periodic gas modifiers This allows DApp users to calculate with fixed transaction costs which is crucial especially for large corporations The transaction costs are distributed upon mining of a block similar to Ethereum However no new tokens are spawned upon mining leading to a constant and limited total amount of tokens REWARDS FOR USERS HOLDING LITION TOKENS Lition\xe2\x80\x99s consensus mechanism which will assure the integrity of sidechains can be seen as a pure Proof of Stake (PoS) system Each and every sidechain has its own network of nodes Each node has to subscribe to a particular chain by filling in some parameters in a sidechain specific smart contract to the backbone mainnet The function to call is StakeTokens() It is thereby assured that an X amount of Lition tokens are being used to stake exclusively for one sidechain As mentioned above to incentivize good behavior in the network nodes have to be economically involved As collateral 20 000 Lition tokens are required to enter the network This amount is adjusted continually according to the USD market value of Lition tokens The goal is to keep the network accessible over time meaning that if the market price of Lition is doubled and sustains for a certain amount of time compared to its ICO price the tokens required to run one node are halved and so on The staking nodes will be rewarded by 2 token streams 1) Mining Rewards for Processing Transactions Lition\xe2\x80\x99s layer 2 solution is conceived as a scalable layer Therefore two main points must be tackled costs and speed of transaction execution To lower costs Lition decided to develop a system in which the transaction costs are constantly low capped to a max of USD 0 01 The problem with other blockchains such as Ethereum is that the market determines the transaction fees which means that if the system gets congested costs rise significantly The staking revenue stream for staking 1000 LITION is presented below The equivalent of USD 100 in LITION tokens is the minimum amount needed to be eligible as a staking node As the transaction costs depend on the LITION/USD exchange rate this amount can also change This is needed to ensure network security should LITION prices drop but at the same time gives business users security on their transaction costs The first scenario called \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s use cases\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the Lition Network once our energy and banking use cases have been migrated onto our system It is a conservative projection since it takes into account that 1000 customers utilize our use cases as is already the case today E g Energy Use Case every 15 minutes a buy order is triggered on the blockchain to sync the energy demand with the supply Every day (24h=1 440min) for each customer we will have 1 440 min / 15 tx/min = ~100 transactions Meaning that for 1000 customers * 100 transaction/ day / customer = 100 000 tx/day \x0c26 Lition White Paper In the Upcoming use cases scenario we show how many other use cases we plan to launch in the near future and how this would proportionally affect the transactions per day following the above logic The same applies to the growth plan 2020 scenario At the bottom of the table the annual interest rate is shown which will be as high as 34% once more use cases are launched The transactions per day are assumed by observing today\xe2\x80\x99s use cases Though already appealing it is a very conservative estimate If for example the energy use case scales to 100 000 customers the transactions and therefore the revenues will be factor 100 Use

scenarios During initial adoption the transactions per day will not be attractive enough for the nodes to stake Therefore Lition will go through an initial period of incentivized adoption called the Genesis Phase During this phase tokens are distributed each year to the holders of Lition tokens that decide to stake This solution makes it very attractive for Lition token holders to stake even if the network is not yet adopted in a significant manner 2) Additional Staking Reward During Genesis Phase The Genesis Phase will be in place for the first two years following the launch of the Lition layer 2 blockchain In this phase the initial functioning of the network is ensured by Lition which will distribute tokens for each staker regardless of transactions in the network However the variables that determine the staker that wins a specific block are still in place meaning that the rewards are distributed proportionally to three criteria The first is the amount of token that are owned by the node the second is the age of the staking wallet and the third is the uninterrupted runtime as an active node since it came online This rewards commitment of nodes in the Lition network As the table below shows it assures a constant LITION token inflow during the Genesis Phase Lition will use a maximum of 31% of all tokens during this Phase It is a maximum because during the Genesis Phase the inflow of external tokens to the staker will diminish proportionally to the number of transactions in the network meaning that the minimum annual interest rate will be guaranteed to be up to 20% the first year and up to 10 % the second year regardless of the amount of transactions but the allocation from Lition will diminish if more transaction fees are paid to the staker from the network users E g if the network grows \x0c27 Lition White Paper organically and stakers gain 15% in the first year Lition will pay the difference of up to 20% 15% = 5% and so on As soon as the network grows enough to guarantee 20% the first year and 10% the second year Lition will not allocate those tokens to stakers Genesis Phase Token Allocation for Genesis Phase (max ) Tot max Token Allocated (31%)

to an end once the system is able to sustain itself For now the maximum timeframe is set to two years however future events and community demand can have an influence For low transaction side chains it will also be possible to incentivize nodes to stake with a rent that the developer will pay EXPECTED BALANCE OF TOKEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND To ensure that the Lition blockchain infrastructure stays open and efficient we have introduced a token based concept As previously described its prime uses are to pay for transactions staking for correct network behavior and the creation of private sidechains that distributed blockchain applications (dApps) can use Due to the widespread use of tokens we anticipate a strong demand for them driven by organic (i e nonspeculative) business use as outlined in Figure 9 \x0c28 Lition White Paper Increased Platform Usage Correlates with Increased Costs for Computational Resources High Demand \xe2\x80\xa2 P2P energy trading (live) \xe2\x80\xa2 Further applications in Energy (piloted) and other sectors Low Supply \xe2\x80\xa2 Easy and cheap integration into existing SAP systems makes adoption easy \xe2\x80\xa2 Blockchain set to become the

tokens \xe2\x80\xa2 Corporations invest due to strategic interest in Lition blockchain infrastructure or current P2P trading product not due to speculation Figure 9 Drivers for expected increase in platform usage LITION REVENUE SOURCES AS A COMPANY To push the Lition blockchain as the standard for business use Lition as a company with its entity Lition Technology AG requires a sustainable source of income This income pays for development costs marketing towards gaining additional use cases etc A sustainable revenue source is crucial as income gained through an ICO is a one time effect Revenue sources are both digital and non digital split into the following two categories a) Mining Rewards through Staking Lition Tokens In the Lition eco system individuals and businesses use and pay with LITION Tokens for transactions staking and to spawn private sidechains These tokens will be sold in an initial coin offering (ICO) and listed at exchanges after the Token Generation Event (TGE) Lition will have ICO revenues from tokens sold as well as continuous revenues through staking Initially only ~60% of the tokens will be distributed so ~40% will remain with Lition (details see page 53) These ~40% will be used for staking and statistically lead to 40% of all transaction costs to be mined by Lition b) Intellectual Property (IP) While usage of the blockchain infrastructure does not require special IP just Lition tokens to pay for Gas this is different for use cases Lition owns the licenses and trademarks on their developed public private blockchain use cases While the code is open source only non commercial use is allowed (see github com/lition blockchain) This intellectual property allows Lition to generate non digital revenues through the traditional IP revenue methods Lition will exploit license askew sell and share its IP to private businesses and global industry players \x0c29 Lition White Paper Depending on the product industry and region Lition will choose the most adequate method Of course this is also influenced by the background and experience of the founders and core team Currently the team\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on creating and applying tech products and services in the energy and banking sector Currently Lition owns the IP on two working use cases both described in this white paper These are energy which is commercially live (page 30) and banking with an MVP for syndicated loans with security tokens (page 37) The business customers can either pay a one time fee or a royalty on every sale/transaction for the use cases they desire Furthermore Lition will share its knowledge with stakeholders the community and clients The paid training coaching customization and consulting services provide additional revenue streams and work as a highly costeffective marketing platform to grow our brand awareness \x0c30 Lition White Paper ACTIVE USE CASE IN P2P ENERGY TRADING LITION ENERGIE \xe2\x80\x93 THE WORLD\ S FIRST MASS MARKET P2P TRADING PLATFORM Alongside the Lition Foundation in Liechtenstein developing the standard blockchain infrastructure for business the German Lition Energie started with a P2P energy trading dApp and is now an officially licensed energy supplier connecting renewable energy producers directly to consumers via its blockchain based Energy Exchange platform By implementing a novel end to end energy exchange system this Lition use case bypasses unnecessary middle men within the energy supply chain The combination of a blockchain solution with highly efficient corporate processes and service operations that are built on cloud based solutions (SaaS) allows lower costs for energy customers while providing energy producers with higher profit margins This Lition use case simplifies and standardizes the energy sector shifting power from established and traditional utility corporations to consumers and producers by providing consumers with decision making power regarding their energy sourcing The exchange platform enables location and preference based offerings thus leaving it to consumers to decide whether they want to receive their energy from a photovoltaic installation on the neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s rooftop or a solar park from a renewable energy company in another state This is the key difference from today\xe2\x80\x99s industry practice in which consumers can choose their energy supplier but not where the supplier ultimately sources its energy With the new approach an increase in market demand for green electricity is directly routed to the energy source and the consumer decides Following the economic principles of matching supply and demand the increased demand is met by new green power plants This is how Lition Energie will democratize the energy sector In addition by cutting out intermediaries this use case results in green energy becoming more competitive Using an efficient blockchain based exchange platform Lition Energie simplifies the legal operational and economic hurdles for green power producers allowing the consumer to buy genuine green electricity at a record low price Long term industry expertise and continuous market research clearly show that price is the prime decision criterion for consumers Therefore a large scale rollout of green electricity with fast adoption rates requires competitive pricing 7 The energy use case currently supplies customers in more than 25 cities and has been featured in various news outlets like Coindesk 8 and Huffington Post 9 7 8 9 Lition Energie internal study on price comparison conducted in June 2018 https //www coindesk com/ethereum energy project now powers 700 households in 10 cities/ https //www huffingtonpost co uk/entry/renewable energy blockchain lition_us_5bfeb5a9e4b0d23c2138e1ff \x0c31 Lition White Paper LIVE DEMO AND SOURCE CODE For those that are not customers of the energy provider Lition there is a live demo of the energy trading solution including the ability to buy and sell energy and view the blockchain transactions on a block explorer at \xe2\x80\xa2 http //demo lition de \xe2\x80\xa2 User Name demo \xe2\x80\xa2 Password demo1234 \xe2\x80\xa2 Source code www github com/lition blockchain HOW IT WORKS TODAY For consumers the local Lition supplier functions as an energy supplier with all country specific licenses in place In Germany consumers are supplied through the German Lition Energie GmbH The German company holds a difficultto obtain license from Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) and has signed contracts with over 600 grid distribution system operators (DSOs) to ensure energy delivery to consumers and compliance with national legislation and taxation Thus Lition Energie can officially guarantee power delivery to the consumer Figure 10 Description of the Lition P2P energy trading use case Unlike traditional utilities in the \xe2\x80\x9cold world\xe2\x80\x9d this use case changes antiquated processes in the energy sector As outlined in Figure 10 it enables direct trading between consumers and producers or prosumers so that costly intermediaries such as the European Energy Exchange (EEX) are no longer necessary The trade itself is a smart contract execution The blockchain verifies the authentication of buyers and sellers trading energy with each other matches price and volume and ensures that the quantity of traded energy is sufficient (for details see the blockchain section) \x0c32 Lition White Paper After the non physical trade the physical execution is carried out by the local Lition supplier (Lition Energie in the case of Germany) It ensures that the grid is compensated as this is an intermediary that cannot (currently) be taken out The power is delivered according to the country\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory requirements and the customer receives billing and customer service While the customer\xe2\x80\x99s energy exchange portal offers large self service capabilities traditional communication channels like telephone and email are in place with a fully operational call center As quality of customer service is of utmost importance for a sustainable business Lition Energie has officially partnered with GASAG a leading German utility with over 400 call center agents to provide service operations to Lition Energie\xe2\x80\x99s customer base CONSUMER BENEFITS Customers of Lition Energie enjoy tangible and unprecedented benefits making it a truly mass market product As an enabler Lition takes out middle men that in the energy industry are conglomerates and have generated excessive profits for decades As a result of the blockchain based peer to peer energy trading highly efficient corporate processes and dedicated focus on digitization customers benefit from record low prices their most relevant decision criterion Currently customers are saving approximately 20% on their monthly energy bill which makes Lition Energie one of the cheapest energy suppliers in the market Additionally customers get to choose and support the power plant directly so the choice isn\xe2\x80\x99t made by a big utility but rather the customers themselves It is their contribution to a greener future Figure 11 Lition\xe2\x80\x99s P2P use case customer benefits and resulting commercial success With these mass market benefits Lition Energie was able to prove that offline revenues can be shifted into the blockchain space This makes Lition different from most of today\xe2\x80\x99s popular blockchain solutions like Bitcoin Ethereum and other altcoins which generate revenue solely from a closed community of Cryptocurrency affiliated audiences All solutions are not mass market products Although they could create media hype nearly all blockchain protocols on the market suffer from limited communities low token usage and low revenues shifted from offline to their blockchain In contrast within just weeks of the commercial launch in May 2018 Lition Energie has already attracted customers in over 25 cities and has contracted 7 green power plants with many more in the pipeline \x0c33 Lition White Paper Figure 12 Illustration of the Lition Energy Exchange COMPARISON WITH OTHER P2P ENERGY TRADING PROJECTS So far there have been several blockchain based energy solutions that have issued an ICO The four main projects are WePower from Lithuania which is active with a PoC Restart Energy which is also active with a PoC (their existing customer base is solely from their traditional non blockchain energy business) Powerledger io from Australia active with 4 pilots in Australia and New Zealand and Electrify Asia from Asia which is active with a PoC All those projects share a similar conceptual frame in that they use a blockchain enabled platform to trade energy While these projects are all still working on establishing the platform and/or starting in smaller markets the Lition Energy Exchange is a) active not only with a pilot but fully fledged and b) running in a 41 million household massmarket And all this has happened in Germany the largest and most regulated market in Europe \x0c34 Lition White Paper WePower Existing customer base Yes Existing Blockchain based Energy Exchange with real customers and revenues Yes Fully operational energy supplier available to a mass

application is running initially on the Ethereum public blockchain to ensure deployment on a trusted well working infrastructure The section below describes the current blockchain application serving today\xe2\x80\x99s energy customers which will be extended once migrated to the new infrastructure Technically every customer and every producer can run an individual node in the current Lition blockchain network Participation is at their own discretion As such each participant confirms blockchain transactions and contributes to the succession of the blockchain Lition utilizes adapted blockchain clients based on market leader Parity in combination with a specific custom developed API interface that customers can access by choice e g in case they want to optimize their energy algorithms themselves Energy customers just wanting to benefit from the producer of their choice and low energy prices can delegate blockchain engagement and trading to their local Lition energy supplier (currently Lition Energie in Germany) similar to cryptocurrency exchanges holding hot wallets for their customers The latter does not hold the private keys Hence the local Lition Energy supplier runs a node acting on behalf of all its customers but still signs every transaction with the individual private key of the customer to ensure every transaction can be reconstructed on the block while giving non technical customers a convenient and less tech related energy supply These customers therefore benefit from the blockchain in a \xe2\x80\x9cfire and forget\xe2\x80\x9d mode after their initial signup Hence customers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to deal with the blockchain unless they actively choose to do so While the majority of energy customers fall into the low involvement category Lition strongly believes in providing customers the freedom of choice to receive direct node and trading access to the energy exchange while using their own nodes As another layer of trust Lition provides the source code to the client and the blockchain smart contracts as open source to the developer community This allows every user to verify for themselves that energy transactions are carried out as intended This applies to the producers as well who use the same blockchain node client however as sell (as opposed to buy) smart contracts and functions The local Lition energy suppliers also run their own blockchain nodes to scan the stored blockchain transactions for settled contracts as this information is needed for settlement of the energy trades Prior to participating in transactions the nodes need to register with their public keys at their preferred local Lition Energy supplier for physical settlement of energy and funds Only producers that can in fact physically deliver power to the selected region are added to ensure market deals can be executed and that market participants are protected The requirements are country specific In Germany this requires recognition as a green producer as part of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG) and the ability to physically deliver power into the high voltage grid with a balancing operator area (Bilanzkreis) registered at one of the 4 transmission system operators Customers that wish to consume energy need an active energy delivery contract with the local Lition energy supplier After registration the market participant receives an 11 digit pre shared key that is used once for registration of their public key at the local exchange Since this transaction is written in the public blockchain all market participants can verify the registration of a consumer or a producer with their provided public key These are the registerProducer() and registerConsumer() functions that additionally pass an optional consumerData / producerData object describing the nature of the market participant to its peers \x0c36 Lition White Paper Figure 13 Technical flow of Lition energy transactions \x0c37 Lition White Paper MVP USE CASE IN BANKING & STO SUMMARY Lition has secured a piloting project with a two cooperative Banks of the German Volks and Raiffeisenbanken which are part of a Cooperative Financial Network holding assets summing up to more than 1 trillion USD (891 billion EUR) and a real estate development company (>100 million USD) Lition has signed a contract to develop an MVP for a syndicated loan Lition is together with the involved companies developing a DApp on the Lition blockchain for syndicated loans starting with a real estate loan of >20 million EUR covering a syndication of two banks A loan is ideal as it showcases public data \xe2\x80\x93 such as the approval that a loan has been given \xe2\x80\x93 as well as private data such as the underlying documents used to apply for the loan Using private keys the approval process of the banks can be further simplified The MVP of the loan can be tested publicly Further details are described in this article Figure 14 Screenshot of Banking MVP In a second stage we are planning to create security tokens for the loan thereby tokenizing it While the syndicated loan application process is done using a real loan the tokenization is a technical showcase as the legal framework has not yet been developed for this \xe2\x80\x93 though Lition is working on this topic as well together with the German government as further detailed on our medium blog 10 10 https //medium com/lition blog/a legal framework for blockchain made in germany with the help of startups like lition 9252688a46ef \x0c38 Lition White Paper PILOTED USE CASES IN OTHER ENERGY SECTORS NETWORK EFFECTS The energy industry is well suited to benefit from certain characteristics of blockchains like immutability and direct connection between peers Many articles have stated that blockchain has the potential to disrupt the energy sector for example PwC 11 describes multiple use cases in their papers The opportunities are widely recognized but so far there has only been progress on a pilot scale e g by the Brooklyn Microgrid 12 which tests how blockchain technology can be used to affect direct neighbor to neighbor sales of solar energy Other P2P energy projects in MVP or pilot scale include WePower Powerledger RestartEnergy Verv and Enosi Other applications like blockchain based billing of electric vehicle charging stations with Motionwerk or certificate of origin trading like SolarCoin for Electrify Asia \xe2\x80\x93 are all in the MVP/Pilot stage Leading the frontier to commercial readiness with a proven Peer to Peer energy trading application with real customers and power plants the Lition blockchain infrastructure already has a strong application prior to mainnet launch As several partners are already evaluating their blockchain based solutions in energy to run on the Lition blockchain infrastructure it is well positioned to become the standard for the energy industry as all participants gain network effects Figure 15 Overview of additional use cases in the Energy sector and their network effects 11 12 https //www pwc com/gx/en/industries/assets/pwc blockchain opportunity for energy producers and consumers pdf www brooklynmicrogrid com \x0c39 Lition White Paper Lition will develop the Energy Ecosystem together with partners such as energy retailers electric vehicle charging station providers Smart Meter manufacturers and grid companies Each of them will be connected to the worldwide energy ecosystem enabled by the Lition Energy blockchain Lition has already signed and lined up multiple international partners for this More details can be found in this whitepaper\xe2\x80\x99s growth chapter USE CASES FOR SMART METERING AND ENERGY DATA DRIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS End to end transparency is the guiding theme of Lition\xe2\x80\x99s core P2P trading use case By using the blockchain based Lition Energy Exchange platform consumers can now choose their preferred renewable energy producers While this novel transparency on the production side is great we want to take it one step further and also bring this transparency to households and businesses This enables any energy retailers and Smart Meter providers using the technology to offer additional services to their customer base THE SMART READER MAKES A SMART METER OUT OF OUR FUSE BOX \xe2\x80\xa6 SO YOU KNOW WHEN AND HOW MUCH EACH DEVICE CONSUMES The SmartReader makes the household smart Energy supplier using the Lition Energy Ecosystem \xe2\x80\xa2 The depicted SmartReader Box is installed next to \xe2\x80\xa2 Bundles the product with its blockchain based energy your home\xe2\x80\x99s fuse box and connects to the internet \xe2\x80\xa2 Through current clamps the device measures energy flow several thousand times per second to detect appliances tariff offering \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 An itemized energy bill by device Time Sensitive tariffs No more down payments \xe2\x80\x93 only pay what is used All smart home benefits provided by the standalone box Figure 16 Illustration of the Lition Smart Reader App This is achieved by installing a smart reader a small device connected to the internet via Wi Fi or cable connection next to the customer\xe2\x80\x99s fuse box A smart reader is a Smart Meter at a significantly lower cost The smart reader measures energy consumption and sends the data privately to the blockchain effectively providing the same functionality as a Smart Meter at a fraction of the cost Using a mobile app customers are able to observe a detailed real time visualization of the energy usage of all their household\xe2\x80\x99s electrical devices by utilizing energy disaggregation A customer can detect which appliances are currently active e g washing machine TV fridge etc and review statistics on the overall energy consumption in kWh The app further provides various smart home \x0c40 Lition White Paper features like a safety alert when you\xe2\x80\x99ve kept your oven on for too long or a security alert if a device like a light is switched on when you\xe2\x80\x99re not at home While these features are useful on their own bundling them with blockchain based energy supply contracts offers additional benefits By using a Smart Reader (equivalent to a Smart Meter but installed in the fuse box) to identify energy consumption of individual household devices a supplier using this Lition blockchain based technology can offer an itemized monthly energy bill This means instead of charging an estimated monthly down payment based on annual traditional meter readings customers are charged the exact amount as measured and they benefit from a further breakdown on the bill for each detected device This will provide full transparency to consumers who want to know their exact monthly cost per device Furthermore consumers will be able to replace high energy consuming devices with more energy efficient appliances by using our data driven approach Such analysis and smart recommendations are additional services to provide in the future There is another major benefit of having a smart reader By accumulating the data received from thousands of smart readers in Lition\xe2\x80\x99s customer households energy retailers will be able to offer time sensitive tariffs to customers With these tariffs customers can save costs during off peak hours e g in the very early morning hours These tariffs will also enable demand shaping as customers will have an incentive to relieve the grid in peak times and shift their load to off peak hours In Germany for example only high consumption customers (over 100 000 kWh annual consumption) can benefit from lower off peak prices as of now Moreover reasonable product recommendations (e g new fridge or AAA LED Bulbs due to high costs) based on various partnerships are further potential revenue streams while providing customers with recommendations for saving energy and money This global marketplace for energy data driven AI generated product recommendations gives customers unique insights for the right appliance decisions In summary the benefits are Smart Affordable \xe2\x80\xa2 Identifies your appliances and their energy consumption \xe2\x80\xa2 Benefit from low market prices during off peak hours \xe2\x80\xa2 Receive product recommendations based on your energy data \xe2\x80\xa2 Save up to 20% on household energy consumption in addition to the 20% cost savings of the Lition tariff \xe2\x80\xa2 Full energy cost control \xe2\x80\xa2 Device and its installation through a certified

\xe2\x80\xa2 Optional Measurement of solar production \x0c41 Lition White Paper Lition Energie is already a frontrunner in applying this use case in Germany and has already successfully integrated a Smart Reader that provides the daily energy quantity for blockchain based energy trading The additional benefits such as device disaggregation are currently being implemented and will be available to the consumer in the near future To make this use case possible Lition has partnered with the Smart Reader pioneer Watty from Stockholm Sweden They are a supplier of Smart Reader devices and developer of AI based algorithms for device detection and they are currently the market leader in disaggregation technology USE CASES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES The blockchain technology and the underlying Lition Token is well positioned to become the standard for charging electric vehicles and will highly impact worldwide desirability and usage of e mobility Background and Challenges of E Mobility Due to environmental problems and changes in global outlook on e mobility the market is growing rapidly Based on manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 launch plans and expected penetration rates the market potential for electric vehicles is projected to reach approximately USD 340 billion by 2020 13 which is equivalent to 10 to 15 percent of the global automotive market in that year Global plug in vehicle deliveries reached 1 25 Million units in 2017 resulting in a sales volume 57% higher than in 2016 14 The growing number of electric vehicles requires an increasing number of charging stations and also increases the demand for electricity the average electric vehicle consumes nearly as much electricity as a four person household per year In other words electricity consumption per household doubles when an electric vehicle is purchased 13 14 www atkearney de/documents/10192/245028/eMobility The_Long_Road_to_a_Billion Dollar_Business pdf/5f3b8f4d 1c68 41c2 8b92 8453d5561b05 www peakresources com au/news/global plug in sales for 2017 q4 and the full year prelim/ \x0c42 Lition White Paper With today\xe2\x80\x99s e mobility infrastructure drivers of electric vehicles face three major issues when charging their vehicles \xe2\x80\xa2 Numerous payment systems for e mobility solutions often make charging and payment for electric vehicles unnecessarily complicated for customers \xe2\x80\xa2 Pricing is expensive inconsistent and non transparent Electricity prices vary by more than 100% between individual charging stations \xe2\x80\xa2 Buying electricity at charging stations involves high priced intermediaries and lacks transparency Again large energy suppliers are hoarding the profits Contrary to many customers\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs green energy charging stations don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily use green energy but often rely on traditional local and nuclear energy sources Suppliers can free themselves of their bad reputations by obtaining easy to access and cheap green certificates In fact an electric vehicle can pollute as much as driving a dirty combustion engine vehicle Lition\xe2\x80\x99s Blockchain Infrastructure as a Foundation to E Mobility The Lition blockchain infrastructure is the foundation to solve these problems with its unique and globally adaptable blockchain approach Lition is already partnering with a leading charging operator with whom the use case will be developed and then deployed to their 1500 charging stations The underlying blockchain infrastructure will be the basis for this which will result in the following benefits for the consumer Convenience Cost \xe2\x80\xa2 Charge their electric vehicles at any charging station \xe2\x80\xa2 Use their existing individual record low tariff to save money when charging \xe2\x80\xa2 Use their producer of choice for charging their EV This may be the same producer they already selected for their electricity at home or a completely new one \xe2\x80\xa2 Receive one bill for emobility and electricity Table 4 Benefits for Consumers \xe2\x80\xa2 Earn money if car is used as electricity storage while plugged in Smart \xe2\x80\xa2 Use their individual smart contracts within our endto end energy exchange platform to charge their electric vehicles \xe2\x80\xa2 Drive with genuine green energy instead of coal or nuclear energy \x0c43 Lition White Paper USE CASES FOR SMART GRIDS So far Lition has commercialized one use case (P2P energy trading) and is actively developing three other use cases (e mobility Smart Metering and data recommendations) as described above On top of this there are additional applications from within the energy sector for which Lition is actively looking for partners with smart grids being one of the most relevant By connecting customers and producers directly via Lition\xe2\x80\x99s P2P trading use case transmission and distribution grid companies gain additional insights into their power flows On top of this Lition\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain technology can support their businesses in various ways \xe2\x80\xa2 Time of Use Pricing To reduce demand during high cost peak usage periods communications and metering technologies inform smart devices in homes and businesses when energy demand is high and track how much electricity is used and when These technologies also give utility companies the ability to reduce consumption by communicating to devices directly in order to prevent system overloads For example a utility could reduce the usage of a group of electric vehicle charging stations or shift temperature set points of air conditioners in a city To motivate them to cut back use and perform what is called peak curtailment or peak leveling prices of electricity are increased during high demand periods and decreased during low demand periods It is assumed that consumers and businesses will consume less during high demand periods if it is possible for consumers and consumer devices to be aware of the high price premium for using electricity at peak periods This could mean making trade offs such as cycling on/off air conditioners or running dishwashers at 9 pm instead of 5 pm When businesses and consumers observe a direct economic benefit of using energy at off peak times chances are high they will include energy cost of operation into their consumer device and building construction decisions Hence they will become more energy efficient As energy pricing is already defined by blockchain based P2P trading time based pricing is a logical and easy extension \xe2\x80\xa2 Distance Pricing Applying the same principles as for time of use pricing distance between the power plant and the consumer can be factored into customer pricing offered through the blockchain solution If a customer chooses a power plant close by he can save by paying a lower price compared to a power plant further away \xe2\x80\xa2 Reliability The smart grid makes use of technologies such as state estimation 15 which improves fault detection and allows for automated corrections of the network without the intervention of technicians This will ensure a more reliable supply of electricity and reduced vulnerability to natural disasters A blockchain provides the necessary infrastructure for this including a reliable source of underlying data and verifiable transactions to resolve issues \xe2\x80\xa2 Security Grids using the robust tamper proof Lition blockchain will mitigate vulnerability to terrorism or cyberattacks because data and transactions are highly secured With cyberattacks on the rise worldwide experts rate these features as very important for the future Yih Fang Huang Werner S Jing Huang Kashyap N Gupta V State Estimation in Electric Power Grids Meeting New Challenges Presented by the Requirements of the Future Grid Signal Processing Magazine IEEE vol 29 no 5 pp 33 43 Sept 2012 15 \x0c44 Lition White Paper \xe2\x80\xa2 Bi Directional Energy Flows Next generation transmission and distribution infrastructure will be better able to handle possible bi directional energy flows allowing for not only distributed energy such as from photovoltaic panels on building roofs but also the use of fuel cells charging to/from the batteries of electric cars wind turbines pumped hydroelectric power and other sources Classic grids were designed for a one way flow of electricity but if a local sub network generates more power than it is consuming the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability issues A smart grid aims to manage these situations via Lition\xe2\x80\x99s P2P trading solution on the blockchain As the underlying energy flows are already contracted on the blockchain managing the physical flows on the blockchain is a logical next step to avoid data duplicity with a single source of truth USE CASES FOR CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN The Certificate of Origin (also Guarantee of Origin) is an instrument that labels electricity from a specific source e g a specific power plant or a certain type of renewable energy generation through legal means (Directive 2009/28/EC 16) in Europe With this label customers can be certain of the origin of their electricity In operation a GO is a green label or tracker guaranteeing that one MWh of electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources GOs are traded When a company buys GOs as documentation for the electricity delivered or consumed the GOs are cancelled in the electronic certificate registry This single standardized instrument makes it possible to track ownership verify claims and ensure that GOs are only sold once and that there is no double counting While this practice works in theory it is a highly inefficient process with many intermediaries such as the energy producer its energy reseller with market access the exchanges on which certificates of origin can be traded the distribution grid operator obtaining the certificate from the producer and the transmission system operator invoicing it to the energy retailer who eventually bills it to the customer They all need to trust each other and they all need to communicate This is a conventional use case in which the trustless open nature of blockchains together with asynchronous encryption at the point of origin (the power plant) can simplify a process by taking out the many middlemen As customers are already trading energy with producers via the Lition P2P energy exchange storing certificates of origin on the blockchain is an easy extension allowing for global scale In this way the certificate of origin does not have to be linked to the physical energy delivery at all 16 http //eur lex europa eu/legal content/EN/TXT/ uri=CELEX 32014L0095 \x0c45 Lition White Paper USE CASES IN OTHER INDUSTRIES Fast transaction speeds aren\xe2\x80\x99t the only requirement of all use cases regulated businesses also require data deletion and truly private data As no other current blockchain can fulfill these requirements as outlined in the previous chapters Lition\xe2\x80\x99s new blockchain infrastructure is the solution of choice for the disruption of many additional use cases across a multitude of industries as outlined in Figure 18 Healthcare Enterprise Data Management Pharmaceuticals Media Automotive Travel Loan Finance Telecommunication Education Warehousing / Logistics Bond Finance Insurance \xe2\x80\xa6 and many more Figure 18 Sample industries with use cases for blockchain infrastructure A selection of some of the potential applications is detailed in the section below USE CASES FOR HEALTHCARE Currently medical patient data regarding diseases and insurance details are filed in different places When a patient has to settle insurance claims he or she has to collect and file all of this data With a blockchain solution this highly sensitive information can be stored on a private sidechain for doctors and insurance companies during claim settlement After the claim is settled the patient can \xe2\x80\x93 with the new infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 delete the data on the blockchain Thus patients\xe2\x80\x99 privacy will be kept secure at all times and this complex process can be managed efficiently \x0c46 Lition White Paper USE CASES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS Data privacy is crucial across the pharmaceutical industry The research development and clinical testing data required for approval of new drugs by public institutions like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and private patient data concerning illnesses medication age gender and family medical history require absolute confidentiality However relevant parties still need access to that sensitive information With the new Lition mainnet confidential data will be stored on a private sidechain providing access to involved parties and allowing for deletion of private patient data when it is no longer needed This will significantly streamline and further secure the entire approval process for new drugs USE CASES FOR ENTERPRISE DATA MANAGEMENT Research recently predicted that the rapid digitization of consumers\xe2\x80\x99 lives and enterprise records will increase the cost of data breaches to USD 2 1 trillion globally by 2019 17 As data exchange between enterprises is indispensable privacy and security is more than crucial The Lition Mainnet offers exactly the features needed to ensure privacy and security while effectively sharing data with the appropriate parties Confidential data is stored on private sidechains only accessible with private keys and deleted as soon as the data is no longer required The functionalities of decentralized data storage limited availability of private data and highly restricted access prevents data theft and sabotage USE CASES FOR BOND FINANCE The worldwide corporate bond market requires myriad approvals (e g credit rating scores balance sheets) and many middle men (for settlement custody etc ) The Lition Mainnet enables decentralized storage of all prerequisites for a loan plus automated issuance using a smart contract After the bond has been issued the beneficiary company can delete the data they no longer need Bond financing can be fully described within the public/private logic of the Lition Mainnet representing a much faster more reliable and cheaper way for companies to issue bonds around the globe USE CASES FOR PURCHASING/LOGISTICS The infrastructure of the Lition Mainnet allows users to publicly store material inventory data such as stock items certificates of origin quantities prices manufacturers and complaints Linking this information to a private sidechain with purchaser information can automate payment procedures increase restocking efficiency optimize transportation and improve material quality and response to supply and demand But not all data in these processes is meant to be public e g prices and demand Again the advantage of the Lition Mainnet is the private/public logic of the blockchain 17 https //www forbes com/sites/stevemorgan/2016/01/17/cyber crime costs projected to reach 2 trillion by 2019/#6db226a73a91 \x0c47 Lition White Paper USE CASES FOR AUTOMOTIVE Odometer manipulation is a major issue in second hand car sales Even in highly regulated countries like Germany police estimate odometer manipulation on 30% of all second hand cars sold resulting in annual damages for insurers between 6 and 7 billion euros 18 As odometer levels are classified as private data due to the connection to the car holder they cannot currently be publicly stored With the Lition Mainnet anonymous movement data can be stored on the private sidechain ensuring privacy of the vehicle holder as well as fraud protection on purchase via the public availability of the car\xe2\x80\x99s history Additional car details regarding accidents repairs etc may also be shifted to a private sidechain and used to settle insurance claims Again upon the driver\xe2\x80\x99s request personal data is deletable when no longer required USE CASES FOR TRAVEL Common search engines for hotels flights and rental cars operate as middle men between the customer and partners of the tourism industry causing unnecessary costs on both sides With the Lition Mainnet solution all offers can be stored on a public blockchain The customers\xe2\x80\x99 private information during the booking process (date of travel prices bank data etc ) is held on a private sidechain where payment procedures and travel details are kept anonymous and secure On request data can be deleted when no longer required USE CASES FOR SAP CUSTOMERS Even though this was only a very brief description of potential use cases it demonstrates the potential of the Lition Mainnet as nearly unlimited in commercial and industry applications SAP already forms the IT backbone of many modern enterprises and can integrate the blockchain into existing SAP systems running in more than 400 000 companies with more than 12 million users worldwide In this way rapid market

policy on the regulation of crypto currencies as a form of settlement in trade Governments adverse to the proliferation of the use of crypto currencies in local commerce could issue laws and regulations deeming the use of cryptocurrencies a regulated activity Countries such as China and Korea have issued regulations or statements prohibiting token sales United States allowing only certified investors to participate to the sale while other countries have sought to bring the sale of tokens within the regulator control of securities offerings This could result in holders of token being unable to use their token in the future without further regulatory compliance Risks Associated with Crowd Sale Tokens are not investment products Rather token serve a specific function within the Lition ecosystem For these and other reasons we believe the sale of token does not constitute a public offering of securities subject to prospectus registration requirements However public policy towards token sales is changing and it is conceivable that regulators may in the future seek to broaden the scope of regulation of token sales This could make token sales subject to registration requirements in the United States and similar jurisdictions If the token sale becomes subject to registration requirements this would delay or potentially postpone the proposed token sale indefinitely Taxation Risks The use of token as a form of settlement currency may or may not be subject to local income tax capital gain taxes VAT or other forms of taxes This uncertainty in tax legislation may expose merchants and customers alike to unforeseen future tax consequences associated with the use of token as a settlement currency and/or the trading of tokens or token for capital gains Capital Control Risks Many jurisdictions such as China impose strict controls on the cross border flow of capital Holders of token may be subject to these regulations and/or arbitrary enforcement of such regulations at any time This would make the transfer of token out of the local jurisdiction to overseas exchanges an unlawful activity exposing the user of token to government fines or other regulatory sanction CTF and Anti Money Laundering Regulations The United States has issued a series of regulations to combat terrorist financing (CTF) and money laundering activities Many other countries have enacted similar legislation to control the flow of capital for such illicit activities The use of cryptocurrencies by bad actors would breach such regulations Any illicit use of the token could seriously impact the global reputation of the RED token Network In such event it is not inconceivable that this could trigger scrutiny by CTF and anti money laundering regulators and potentially cause significant disruption to the distribution and circulation of tokens and Token in the RED token ecosystem \x0c69 Lition White Paper BUSINESS RISKS Lition plans to conduct closings of sales of token as funds are received If insufficient funds received from the sale of token Lition may not be able to implement its plans along the timeline as described in this white paper Lition\xe2\x80\x99s ability to remain competitive may depend in part upon its ability to develop new and enhanced products or services and to introduce these products or services in a timely and cost effective manner In addition product and service introductions or enhancements by Lition\xe2\x80\x99s competitors or the use of other technologies could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of Lition\xe2\x80\x99s existing products and services There can be no assurances that Lition shall be successful in selecting developing and marketing new products and services or in enhancing its existing products or services Failure to do so successfully may adversely affect Lition\xe2\x80\x99s business financial condition and results of operations Lition\xe2\x80\x99s ability to

\x0c70 Lition White Paper BLOCKCHAIN RISKS On the Ethereum blockchain timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times For example ETH contributed to the token distribution contract in the final seconds of a distribution period may not get included for that period Buyer acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s transaction at the time buyer expects and buyer may not receive token the same day buyer sends ETH The Ethereum blockchain is prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost Individuals may also intentionally spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens Buyer acknowledges and understands that Ethereum block producers may not include buyer\xe2\x80\x99s transaction when buyer wants or buyer\xe2\x80\x99s transaction may not be included at all Token may be subject to expropriation and or/theft Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the token distribution contract or the token in a variety of ways including but not limited to malware attacks denial of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing Furthermore because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software and token are based on open source software there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the token or result in the loss of buyer\xe2\x80\x99s token the loss of buyer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to access or control buyer\xe2\x80\x99s token or the loss of ETH in buyer\xe2\x80\x99s account In the event of such a software bug or weakness there may be no remedy and holders of token are not guaranteed any remedy refund or compensation Although Lition and the blockchain are operational at the time of the ICO it might not function as intended and any tokens may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable TOKEN CHARACTERIZATION AS A UTILITY Lition Tokens are a utility token By design there is no proximity to financial instruments and no financial instrument is provided to token holders in return The token is only used inside the blockchain as described in the respective section in this whitepaper Further use cases such as for charging stations and other additions will include elements that will not turn the token into a security BUYER KNOWLEDGE AND NO WITHDRAWAL RIGHT Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial matters including a sufficient understanding of blockchain or cryptographic tokens and other digital assets smart contracts storage mechanisms (such as digital or token wallets) blockchain based software systems and blockchain technology to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of buyer\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of tokens including but not limited to the matters set forth in this white paper and is able to bear the risks thereof including loss of all amounts paid loss of tokens and liability to Lition Parties and others for its acts and omissions Buyer has obtained sufficient information in order to make an informed decision to purchase tokens While deciding to enter and entering into any transaction based on this whitepaper the buyer/interested party is hereby informed and undertakes it will not benefit from a right of withdrawal from the transaction and his decision of entering into such transaction is final and under no circumstance he shall be given with a withdrawal right \x0c71 Lition White Paper KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER (KYC) RULES Considering the anti money laundering and anti terrorism national and international regulations Lition reserves the right to develop and apply KYC rules and procedure before the sale of tokens before the trade of such tokens and before or during the execution of any transactions
