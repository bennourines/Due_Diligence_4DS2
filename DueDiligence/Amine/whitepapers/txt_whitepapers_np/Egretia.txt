 Background
 1 1 Introduction to HTML5
 In recent years after many hardware upgrades and rapid development of Internet
 technology some bottlenecks (such as performance traffic and compatibility) that
 previously limited the operation of HTML5 games have now been eliminated Due to
 the cross platform nature of HTML5 this technology is widely used in games 
 marketing video media etc Using the power of mobile social networking HTML5
 content has been widely disseminated in mobile apps and created entirely new
 business models 
 From their perspective and due to the rapid pace of their lives and work users
 would like to make use of fragmented time at each leisure opportunity and
 enjoy relaxation and entertainment In terms of app operators a new model is
 expected to enhance user stickiness gaining more traffic 
 Click and play viral transmission user stickiness these characteristics of an
 HTML5 game make it a perfect fit for the current market demands 
 Currently users of HTML5 games already account for 47% of all mobile game
 users In terms of the business model in game payment instead of advertising 
 has become the main source of revenue accounting for 68% Combined HTML5
 games already have an independent commercial profitability In 2017 the market
 size of HTML5 games in China exceeded 10 billion Yuan and showed a growing
 trend After more than four years of evolution and development HTML5 games
 10
 have witnessed huge improvements related to business models user numbers 
 and market size 
 The domestic revenue of high quality HTML5 games has reached 200 million
 Yuan 
 HTML5 technology has been globally recognised as a cross platform and crossterminal
 solution It covers the Internet mobile game video advertising and
 other industries with a global market opportunity of 100 billion dollars 
 􀀷􀁕􀁈􀁑􀁇􀀃
 Due to the advantages of HTML5 technology an increasing number of wellknown
 enterprises have adopted this technology 
 • Google launched PWA advocating Android Instant Apps based on HTML5
 technology 
 • Baidu promoted light weight apps based on HTML5 technology 
 • Facebook released Instant Games based on HTML5 technology in Messenger
 with more than 1 billion daily active users and opened its advertising and
 payment service for Instant Games at the end of 2017 
 • In January 2018 Tencent WeChat released a series of mini games some of
 those games gaining over 100 million daily active users 
 Overall HTML5 has become one of the global Internet technology trends 
 􀀳􀁄􀁌􀁑􀀃􀀳􀁒􀁌􀁑􀁗􀁖􀀃
 Despite the rapid development of HTML5 industry there still remain many pain
 points 
 • Lack of a global unified and secure payment platform 
 • Lack of solutions to securely store virtual assets of users 
 • Lack of mechanisms to ensure “fairness” in games 
 11
 • Lack of solutions to rapidly respond to distributed back end communications 
 • Lack of mechanisms to effectively protect the intellectual property of HTML5
 products 
 • Need for effective mechanisms to motivate good teams to develop high quality
 games and apps 
 • Need for diversified approaches to monetise internet traffic 
 1 2 Blockchain Industry Background
 In recent years blockchain technology has gradually been understood and applied to
 related projects advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain itself have become
 increasingly obvious 
 Advantages 
 • Distributed ledger mechanism safe transparent and tamper resistant 
 • Turing complete smart contracts fair and square 
 • Decentralised data storage combined with smart contracts responsive and
 reliable 
 • Token system unified payment and settlement 
 Disadvantages 
 • Poor development testing and upgrade process 
 • Poor development tools and a small development community 
 • User inconveniences costs of learning are high 
 • Security issues of accounts and wallets 
 The Egretia team has joined hands with Egret Technology to create Egretia
 Blockchain Lab By combining blockchain technology with proven HTML5 workflows 
 developers will be able to rapidly develop blockchain applications and truly apply
 blockchain to the vertical industries

 2 1 World’s First HTML5 Engine and Platform
 2 2 Building a Decentralized HTML5 User Ecosystem
 2 3 Creating an Ecosystem With True Token Circulation
 Our Vision
 “Bring 200 000 Developers and 1 Billion HTML5 Devices to The Blockchain World ”
 2 1 World s First HTML5 Blockchain Engine and Platform
 In partnership with Egret Technology the global leader in the HTML5 industry the
 Egretia team is committed to building the world s first HTML5 blockchain engine and
 platform combining blockchain technology with proven tools communities and
 content of partners aiming to bring 200 000 developers and 1 billion mobile devices
 into the blockchain world 
 User Ecosystem 
 • The content powered by Egret Engine has reached hundreds of millions of users 
 For every user a unique cryptographic passport with digital encryption will be
 created 
 • Users will be provided with a low threshold high security digital wallet serving as
 a safe payment platform for all HTML5 blockchain applications 
 • A digital virtual currency token that potentially circulates in HTML5 projects all
 over the world will be created (Egreten) 
 • An effective sustainable ecosystem will be built for users 
 Technical Aspects 
 • Modularising blockchain functions integrating them into the Egret Engine and its
 front end development tools will contribute to directly reach more than 200 000
 developers Integrating Egreten into hundreds of thousands of games and
 applications will help to directly reach more than 1 billion users worldwide 
 • Integrating blockchain technology into the backend service logic using node
 servers around the world will provide HTML5 products with fast communication
 solutions and trusted smart contract server logic 
 14
 • A complete development suite documentation and development community will
 be built to provide a most complete and convenient developer ecosystem 
 Operational Aspects 
 • Through the existing Egret game platform with 40 million monthly active
 users the Egretia Network already has a professional global team of game and
 app distributors They are operating the content and there are plays to
 integrate the Egreten token payment system thus promoting actual utility and
 circulation of Egreten 
 • Together with strategic partners such as Facebook and Google the Egretia
 Network has a well established advertising platform to promote Egreten based
 games and products 
 2 2 Building a Decentralised HTML5 User Ecosystem
 Powered by the Egret Engine HTML5 content has over 75% marketing
 penetration in the HTML5 industry covering more than 1 billion mobile devices
 and users 
 The blockchain of the Egretia Network will be combined with Egret HTML5
 workflows Using a token mechanism every player will have a unique ID in
 games powered by the Egret Engine This will build a solid foundation for a
 stable user ecosystem 
 • Every user worldwide has a unique token passport in any game or application
 which is developed based on the blockchain of the Egretia Network 
 • The anonymity and encryption mechanism of the token passport effectively
 ensures the privacy of users 
 • Using unique anonymous secure tags the identity of a user is not limited to
 one application or one game By using a unique virtual identity every user
 can enjoy a life in the virtual world based on the Egretia Network 
 15
 • Due to the transparency and irreversibility of blockchain as well as the unique
 passport of each user available throughout the content system built by the
 Egretia Network users can be accurately identified and rated for their
 trustworthiness Users can also safely communicate with other users around
 the world using the Egretia Network making friends exchanging virtual
 assets etc 
 2 3 Creating an Ecosystem With True Token Circulation
 Based on the user ecosystem of the Egretia Network there is the aim of forging a
 new virtual currency token that can be used in all content powered by the Egret
 Engine Egreten 
 • The ecosystem will provide well established tools + SDKs for the blockchain
 community and developers to design and build applications and products 
 • Users can use Egreten as the currency to buy in game items pay for content 
 etc 
 • Users can use Egreten to take part in lotteries discounts and other promotions
 on the Egretia Network across the world 
 • Through the Egretia Network users can participate in crowdfunding of games
 which they support through the usage of Egreten and potentially receive
 Egreten incentives 
 • Developers and content publishers can use Egreten to advertise their products
 and services on the advertising platform of the Egretia Network 
 16
 • Distributors of content and users from the media industry can obtain Egreten
 through content distribution advertising etc 
 • An Egreten digital wallet is created based on the unique token passports of
 users in order to ensure safe storage of the virtual assets goods 
 crowdfunding rewards platform incentives etc of each user 
 Throughout the ecosystem it is envisaged that more than 200 000 developers
 worldwide would be able to use the Egretia Blockchain SDK to rapidly develop
 HTML5 blockchain games and applications This will increase the reach of Egreten to
 over a billion users the token will be circulating in all areas of HTML5 content 
 virtual goods platforms advertising platforms and communities 
 􀒁 represents the flow of tokens 􀒂

 3 2 Features of the Egretia Network
 􀀶􀁈􀁏􀁉􀀐􀁇􀁈􀁙􀁈􀁏􀁒􀁓􀁈􀁇􀀃􀀳􀁘􀁅􀁏􀁌􀁆􀀃􀀦􀁋􀁄􀁌􀁑􀀃
 The Egretia Network will include a self developed efficient public chain based on the
 DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism aimed at optimising HTML5
 game performance Through the blockchain interface layer in combination with the
 Egret engine tools developers can quickly create blockchain based DApps 
 􀀦􀁒􀁑􀁖􀁈􀁑􀁖􀁘􀁖􀀃􀀰􀁈􀁆􀁋􀁄􀁑􀁌􀁖􀁐􀁖􀀃
 22
 The public chain of the Egretia Network will be using a DPoS (Delegated Proof of
 Stake) as consensus mechanism 
 The DPoS mechanism is similar to a board vote where holders of coins cast a
 certain number of nodes using the mechanism for verification and bookkeeping 
 DPoS can significantly reduce the number of participating nodes for verification
 and bookkeeping it is designed to be able to achieve consensus verification in a
 second For the avoidance of doubt token holders which have delegated block
 verification and bookkeeping to the nodes would not receive incentives based on
 their token holdings only and without further contributing resources to the
 network only participating nodes which have contributed computing resources for
 block verification and bookkeeping would be entitled to receive token incentives 
 The stability of DPoS mechanism has been verified in BTS EOS and other projects 
 􀀫􀁌􀁊􀁋􀀐􀁓􀁈􀁕􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁐􀁄􀁑􀁆􀁈􀀃􀀃
 The public chain of the Egretia Network is a public chain with high concurrent
 processing power where performance is optimised for the needs of the game
 industry It is designed to have a fast TPS (Transaction Per Second) rate 
 Nonetheless in blockchain technology an impossible triangle exists meaning that
 scalability decentralisation and security cannot be achieved at the same time 
 Using a DPoS mechanism to greatly increase scalability more than 2 000
 transactions per second could be supported in the initial test chain In the future the
 TPS will be increased according to business needs 
 􀀵􀁈􀁄􀁏􀀐􀁗􀁌􀁐􀁈􀀃􀀳􀁄􀁕􀁄􀁐􀁈􀁗􀁈􀁕􀀃􀀤􀁇􀁍􀁘􀁖􀁗􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗􀀃
 The Egretia Network can modify system parameters without bifurcation Instead the
 Egretia Network will be able to change blocktime blocksize transaction fee etc via
 voting 
 The Egretia Network can modify the system parameters without bifurcation Instead 
 the Egretia Network will be able to realise a dynamic adjustment of parameters such
 as blocksize output speed and handling fee through voting method based on
 consensus 
 23
 For example A current blocktime of 3 seconds can be dynamically adjusted to 1
 second or a current blocksize of 2M can be dynamically adjusted to create larger
 blocks such as 8M 
 For the avoidance of doubt ultimately community members are not connected with
 the Foundation (or its affiliates) in any manner and the assets and funds of the
 Foundation (or its affiliates) remain under the control of the relevant Board of
 Directors who shall exercise independent judgement and apply them to achieve the
 Foundation s objects The right to vote does not entitle Egreten holders to vote on
 the operation and management of the Foundation (or its affiliates) or their assets 
 and does not constitute any equity interest in the Foundation (or its affiliates)

 The native digital cryptographically secured utility token of the Egretia Network
 (Egreten) is a major component of the ecosystem on the Egretia Network and is
 designed to be used solely as the primary token on the network Egreten will initially
 be issued by the Distributor as ERC 20 standard compliant digital tokens on the
 Ethereum blockchain and these will be migrated to tokens on the Egretia blockchain
 when the same is eventually launched 
 Egreten is a non refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of
 exchange between participants on the Egretia Network The goal of introducing
 Egreten is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement
 between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the Egretia Network 
 Developers can easily combine Egreten with their own games and players can safely
 and efficiently conduct virtual goods trading 
 Egreten does not in any way represent any shareholding participation right title or
 interest in the Foundation its affiliates or any other company enterprise or
 undertaking nor will Egreten entitle token holders to any promise of fees dividends 
 revenue profits or investment returns and are not intended to constitute securities
 in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction Egreten may only be utilised on the Egretia
 Network and ownership of Egreten carries no rights express or implied other than
 the right to use Egreten as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the
 Egretia Network 
 􀀺􀁄􀁏􀁏􀁈􀁗􀀃
 Both game developers and gamers will be able to manage Egreten through their
 wallets Users will be provided with a low threshold high security digital wallet 
 making the Egretia Network a safe payment platform for all HTML5 blockchain
 applications Currently PC mobile and browser versions of the wallet are being
 developed 
 􀀶􀁆􀁄􀁏􀁄􀁅􀁌􀁏􀁌􀁗􀁜􀀏􀀃􀀶􀁘􀁓􀁓􀁒􀁕􀁗􀁌􀁑􀁊􀀃􀀰􀁄􀁌􀁑􀁖􀁗􀁕􀁈􀁄􀁐􀀃􀀳􀁘􀁅􀁏􀁌􀁆􀀃􀀦􀁋􀁄􀁌􀁑􀁖􀀃
 From a long term view the blockchain framework will not only support the native
 chain of the Egretia Network but will also be extended to support Ethereum EOS
 and other public chains so that all HTML5 developers can efficiently create
 blockchain based games and applications

 The content powered by Egret Engine accounts for 75% of the HTML5 market in
 China with more than 200 000 developers worldwide 
 The Egret Engine will provide the Egretia BaaS SDK which will allow easy access to
 blockchain for all Egret games Through the Egretia BaaS SDK developers can
 create blockchain games or migrate existing Egret games to blockchain games in an
 easy way 
 27
 HTML5 Blockchain Engine Architecture
 As shown above in the diagram the bottom part represents the Egret Engine Using
 the Egret IDE tool “Wing” developers can quickly develop HTML5 games As long as
 developers add the Egretia BaaS SDK while creating a new project blockchainrelated
 APIs will be easily accessible 
 The Egretia BaaS SDK and the included APIs are as follows 
 Egretia Game API
 With blockchain popularity rapidly increasing many developers are eager to
 “blockchain ise” their games However as a matter of fact blockchain technology is
 fairly complicated At the same time not all developers have sufficient time to fully
 leverage the underlying technology The Egretia Game API is a solution through
 which developers can obtain easy access to blockchain 
 Through the Egretia Game API HTML5 games can be “blockchain ised” with just a
 few lines of code As you can see from the image above by adding the Egretia BaaS
 SDK into games and then calling the API interface in accordance with official
 28
 documentation tutorials developers will be able to combine HTML5 games with
 blockchain technology 
 KYC Certification
 With the help of KYC (Know Your Customer) information user information is
 encrypted and stored on the blockchain Due to the anonymity and traceability of
 blockchain it is safe and reliable to store user information on the Egretia Network 
 Using the KYC blockchain ID users will only have to sign up once for all games built
 by HTML5 Blockchain Engine 
 Egretia Data API
 The game industry has been criticised because of opaque data some developers
 control the falling probability of virtual goods in order to increase their revenue 
 Although the entire industry has put a lot of effort into solving the problem for
 example a group of developers has made public the falling probability of virtual
 goods game players still feel sceptical about game developers 
 Through the Egretia Data API developers can store the core data logic of games
 and applications in the Egretia Network thus realising data storage account
 disclosure and process verification this is making the data open fair and
 transparent 
 For example game developers write the core data logic game transaction
 information and game equipment values onto the blockchain so that players can
 view the game numerical information at any time This helps solving the mutual trust
 problem between game developers and players 
 Egreten API
 As the API for the virtual currency ecosystem on the Egretia Network virtual ingame
 items can be placed on the trading platform

 Egret Runtime is an accelerator component developed by Egret team to enhance the
 HTML5 game performance and can be embedded as a seamless extension into a
 browser or other applications on mobile devices By using Egret Runtime game
 developers can ignore the differences between diverse operating systems browsers 
 and terminals so that HTML5 games can run more efficiently with amazing
 performance In addition runtime also has access to mobile device hardware 
 improving the gaming experience By the end of 2017 Egret Runtime has been
 installed 1 billion times 
 Egretia Runtime Architecture
 The Egretia Runtime is a completely upgraded version of the Egret Runtime Not
 only does it fully support the functions of the original runtime it also integrates the
 Egretia blockchain modules to make for more secure core functions at the lower
 layer of the application The Egretia BaaS Module which allows developers to easily
 call the blockchain interface of the Egretia Network also fully supports the DPoS
 mechanism realising ledger and data exchange on the basis layer of the Runtime 
 􀀨􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁗􀁌􀁄􀀃􀀪􀁄􀁐􀁈􀀃􀀪􀁏􀁒􀁅􀁄􀁏􀀃􀀧􀁌􀁖􀁗􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁘􀁗􀁌􀁒􀁑􀀃􀀳􀁏􀁄􀁗􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁐􀀃
 The Open Platform of the strategic partner of the Egretia team Egret Technology is
 the largest HTML5 gaming platform in the world It has more than 2 000 distribution
 30
 channels and more than 65 000 HTML5 games with 40 million monthly active users 
 Leveraging the new business mode revolution brought by blockchain technology the
 Egret Open Platform will be fully upgraded to a decentralised HTML5 gaming
 distribution platform supporting HTML5 developers and reaching HTML5 players
 worldwide 
 Egretia Game Platform Architecture
 Egretia Game Platform
 As shown above with the Egret Engine and the Egretia BaaS SDK game developers
 have easy access to blockchain Players can obtain a unique ID through KYC and
 use it when playing all the games on the platform of the Egretia Network 
 Since the Egretia Network adopts DPoS and PoG to implement distributed ledger and
 data exchange mechanisms the longer the players will stay in games the greater
 the PoG values will be Depending on the duration of the game and the level of
 experience players can obtain various amounts of Egreten which will enable them
 to buy virtual goods in the game 
 Game developers may obtain Egreten by operating games 
 Egretia Game Distribution Mechanism
 31
 The game platform on the Egretia Network is a decentralised HTML5 game
 distribution platform Developers can independently launch HTML5 games and offer
 tasks encouraging players to spread games After completing the promotion tasks 
 players will obtain some Egreten as an incentive This way developers will be able to
 attract many players and those players are able to obtain virtual currency thus
 forming a healthy ecosystem 
 􀀷􀁋􀁈􀀃􀀹􀁌􀁕􀁗􀁘􀁄􀁏􀀃􀀪􀁒􀁒􀁇􀁖􀀃􀀷􀁕􀁄􀁇􀁌􀁑􀁊􀀃􀀳􀁏􀁄􀁗􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁐􀀃
 Players have always faced the problem how to ensure the value of virtual goods and
 the security of personal information in virtual goods transactions The Egretia virtual
 goods trading platform can help to solve this problem 
 Trading Platform Architecture
 As pictured above players can sell virtual goods of a certain game on the trading
 platform After selecting the game a game server the virtual goods category and
 specific items virtual goods can be sold in exchange for Egreten 
 On the other hand players can spend Egreten buying virtual goods on the trading
 platform 
 HTML5 games connect the in game virtual goods to the trading platform via the
 Egretia BaaS SDK Traditional virtual goods and account trading model are lacking
 32
 mutual trust at its foundation Based on the smart contract mechanism of
 blockchain both buyers and sellers can conduct transactions without concerns and
 will not need any guarantee from a third party 
 Based on the traceability feature of blockchain traders can view historical
 transaction records of virtual goods at any time Besides the anonymity of
 blockchain can well protect the privacy of buyers and sellers 
 􀀧􀁈􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁗􀁕􀁄􀁏􀁌􀁖􀁈􀁇􀀃􀀤􀁇􀁙􀁈􀁕􀁗􀁌􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊􀀃􀀳􀁏􀁄􀁗􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁐􀀃
 An advertising platform based on the Egretia Network will be created Based on KYC
 principles the Egretia Network is capable of capturing user profiles accurately so
 that ads that users are interested in can be delivered On the other hand the tokenbased
 advertising platform will be helpful to Egreten circulation 
 Blockchain Advertising Platform
 As shown above decentralised blockchain based advertising is a good solution for
 the shortcomings of traditional advertising 
 • Advertisers can serve ads using the Egreten virtual currency on the Egretia
 Network 
 • Developers integrate ads with content through the tools and SDK on the Egretia
 Network which will allow them to obtain Egreten 
 33
 • Developers can also spend Egreten paid by users upon delivering ads in order to
 attract more users 
 • Based on KYC principles the advertising platform can protect the privacy of users
 while getting user data effectively pushing content that users are really interested
 in greatly reducing the costs for advertisement 
 • Players can obtain Egreten by forwarding ads 
 As the first HTML5 blockchain platform the Egreten team is also actively
 communicating with overseas partners such as Facebook in order to jointly embrace
 the future of blockchain together 
 􀀧􀁌􀁖􀁗􀁕􀁌􀁅􀁘􀁗􀁈􀁇􀀃􀀦􀁒􀁐􀁐􀁘􀁑􀁌􀁆􀁄􀁗􀁌􀁒􀁑􀀃􀀉􀀃􀀶􀁗􀁒􀁕􀁄􀁊􀁈􀀃􀀦􀁏􀁒􀁘􀁇􀀃􀀳􀁏􀁄􀁗􀁉􀁒􀁕􀁐􀀃
 The HTML5 Distributed Communication and Storage Service is powered by
 blockchain technology to provide the
 decentralised server side distributed
 communication and storage 
 The Egretia Network will cooperate
 with more third party public chains
 as well as technology service
 providers offering developers more
 comprehensive distributed communications & storage services 
 The more developers and content the more widely distributed server nodes The
 faster storage of data and files being read the quicker the client and server side
 communications 
 By calling the SDK provided developers can simply access communication services
 on the Egretia Network realising online multiplayer data & file storage back end
 34
 game logic customisation Usability low latency high availability expansibility 
 customisability are its characteristics 
 In addition to helping developers create a game from its concept it is easy to
 migrate a single player game into a cross regional cross server low latency online
 game based on the technology of the Egretia Network thus greatly reducing the
 cost of game development 
 Multi nodes low latency
 Decentralised worldwide server nodes and the original server frame
 synchronisation technology will make for a quicker and more stable transmission of
 game data In the meantime to meet the needs of large multi player online games 
 full advantage will be taken of the rich experience the Egretia team has with building
 platforms and adopting a deep coupling approach Information that does not affect
 fairness will be managed in a traditional manner and core data will be processed
 through smart blockchain based contracts Seamless coordination ensures fairness
 and a smooth gaming experience 
 Quick Match
 Based on distributed back end communications a flexible matching mechanism will
 be meeting the majority of the matching requirements under different customisable
 rules This will help in enriching the gameplay helping more players build
 connections and truly achieving the state of global players using the same server 
 Quick Access
 Modularising the game lobby room and interactive processes the needs of
 developers will be taken into consideration combining front end engine and tools for
 developers to quickly access and develop games 
 The Server Side Logic of Smart Contract Management
 35
 Aside from basic networking capabilities game developers will also be provided with
 a server side framework based on smart contracts the Egretia Backend Logic
 Framework Developers will be able to extend server networking capabilities to
 implement the customised server side game logic Because the server side logic is
 based on the blockchain of the Egretia Network and managed through smart
 contracts the game logic is open and fair which can effectively prevent plug ins

 The decentralised game distribution platform is currently under development all the
 games are developed based on the blockchain of the Egretia Network accessing the
 KYC authentication system the digital tokens the data storage module and other
 functions of the Egretia Network 
 On this game platform players can not only play all HTML5 games but also obtain
 digital virtual currency tokens through playing games while at the same time
 gaining token incentives through completing the tasks in games The assets of all
 players are securely stored in an Egretia wallet 
 Because each user on the game platform has a unique passport accurate user
 profiles can be obtained based on historical data thus matching players according to
 36
 their interests Thus the platform of the Egretia Network is not only a game
 platform but also a social platform

 Risks
 You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with
 purchasing Egreten holding Egreten and using Egreten for participation in the
 Egretia Network In the worst scenario this could lead to the loss of all or part of the
 Egreten which had been purchased 
 1 Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
 The regulatory status of Egreten and distributed ledger technology is unclear or
 unsettled in many jurisdictions The regulation of virtual currencies has become a
 primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world It is impossible to
 predict how when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or
 create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications 
 including Egreten and/or the Egretia Network Regulatory actions could negatively
 impact Egreten and/or the Egretia Network in various ways The Foundation (or its
 affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions 
 or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or
 commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate
 in such jurisdiction After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and
 continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies the
 Foundation will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of Egreten Therefore 
 for the token sale the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order to
 avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible For the token sale the Foundation is
 working with Tzedek Law LLC a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a
 good reputation in the blockchain space 
 2 Inadequate disclosure of information
 As at the date hereof the Egretia Network is still under development and its design
 concepts consensus mechanisms algorithms codes and other technical details and
 parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed Although this
 white paper contains the most current information relating to the Egretia Network it
 is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Egretia
 team from time to time The Egretia team has no ability and obligation to keep
 holders of Egreten informed of every detail (including development progress and
 46
 expected milestones) regarding the project to develop the Egretia Network hence
 insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable 
 3 Competitors
 Various types of decentralised applications are emerging at a rapid rate and the
 industry is increasingly competitive It is possible that alternative networks could be
 established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying Egreten
 and/or the Egretia Network and attempt to re create similar facilities The Egretia
 Network may be required to compete with these alternative networks which could
 negatively impact Egreten and/or the Egretia Network 
 4 Loss of Talent
 The development of the Egretia Network depends on the continued co operation of
 the existing technical team and expert consultants who are highly knowledgeable
 and experienced in their respective sectors The loss of any member may adversely
 affect the Egretia Network or its future development Further stability and cohesion
 within the team is critical to the overall development of the Egretia Network There
 is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel
 may occur resulting in negative influence on the project in the future 
 5 Failure to develop
 There is the risk that the development of the Egretia Network will not be executed or
 implemented as planned for a variety of reasons including without limitation the
 event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset virtual currency or Egreten 
 unforeseen technical difficulties and shortage of development funds for activities 
 6 Security weaknesses
 Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with
 Egreten and/or the Egretia Network in a variety of ways including but not limited
 to malware attacks denial of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil
 attacks smurfing and spoofing Furthermore there is a risk that a third party or a
 member of the Foundation or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally
 47
 introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of Egreten and/or the Egretia
 Network which could negatively affect Egreten and/or the Egretia Network 
 Further the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable
 and advances in cryptography or technical advances (including without limitation
 development of quantum computing) could present unknown risks to Egreten and/
 or the Egretia Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus
 mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol 
 7 Other risks
 In addition the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there
 are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated
 with your purchase holding and use of Egreten including those that the Foundation
 cannot anticipate Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or
 combinations of the aforementioned risks You should conduct full due diligence on
 the Foundation its affiliates and the Egretia team as well as understand the overall
 framework mission and vision for the Egretia Network prior to purchasing Egreten
