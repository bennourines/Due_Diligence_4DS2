industry which will be subverted by WaykiChain \xe2\x97\x86 Sustainable growth by building up a perfect governance structure WaykiChain Team has realized effective administration on common procedures code management financial management salary management and privilege operation scope etc so as to 3 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer guarantee the sustainable growth of WaykiChain As the underlying system of blockchain 3 0 WaykiChain has not only flawlessly inherited the characteristics and advantages of the eco system of the traditional blockchain but also solved the technological bottleneck of the current blockchain thus truly integrating the blockchain and business Moreover WaykiChain is investing vigorously and continually in the R & D and in the innovation of the financial technology with focus on blockchain Based on its latest achievements WaykiChain has a clear vision to develop \xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain +\xe2\x80\x9d and to upgrade the value of the traditional industries as well as other industries building up a win win st blockchain Eco system in the 21 century WaykiChain blockchain application pioneer \xc2\xa9WaykiChain has the final interpretations on the white paper 4 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer Part I Design ideas of WaykiChain 1 1 Development and value of blockchain After more than 40 years of development internet has brought about new things and new concepts such as email network company social media mobile network big data cloud calculation internet of things etc Internet has drastically reduced the cost relating to searching coordination and information exchange radically lowered the entry threshold in many fields boosted new media new entertainment and new retails and finally generated the brand new organizational architecture model as well as the unprecedented digital business model Thanks to the sensor technology internet has fully permeated the environment where human beings reside However for business and economic activities simple information sharing and transmission cannot meet the development of the economic society When there is no verification information from the third party (for example verification of the transactor s identification qualification technological capability carried out by banks or government authorities) people cannot rapidly verify the identification of the transactor These transactors involved cannot establish a relationship of trust which is necessary in economic activities Therefore current internet information sharing and transmission solutions if not relying on the third party intermediary cannot realize the function of identity verification nor can it establish a relationship of trust between the two economic participants Huge limitations still exist It was not until 2008 that Satoshi Nakamoto firstly issued a point to point cash system and its infrastructure protocol Bitcoin an Electronic Cash in the Point to Point Internet This digital currency called \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin\xe2\x80\x9d can help two transaction parties to build up the bridge of trust to guarantee the completion of the transaction based on intelligent codes without relying on the verification from a third party intermediary After more than 10 years of development the blockchain technology behind bitcoin is gradually understood by more and more people and has undergone continuous development and innovation Blockchain s role in trust is like that of internet in information What is mostly absent in internet is the Trust Protocol used to confirm the validity and authenticity of every transaction The blockchain technology can provide bases to solve such problems optimizing the approaches and methods adopted by people to allow people to deal with trust security and privacy Hence based on its capability to promote transparency and to protect privacy blockchain connecting Trust the most profound need for human beings point the road ahead for a fairer more efficient and more accessible global financial 5 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer system The blockchain technology has huge potential which will bring about great changes for traditional manufacturing financial sector government bodies and all human beings Features and benefits of the blockchain technology a brand new distributed infrastructure architecture and calculation paradigm is established thanks to the block chain digital structure used for data verification and storage data generation and updating based on the consensus algorithm of the distributed computer node data transmission and access security guaranteed by cryptography as well as data programming and operation based on smart contracts consisting of automatic script codes The blockchain technology will store records in thousands of or even millions of independent computers while these computers can work in a coordinated manner no single entity can control them to alter data and software Moreover the blockchain technology can establish the reliable point to point trust in the internet so the value transfer doesn t rely on the intermediary Blockchain discloses information yet protects privacy makes collective decisions yet protects the interest of the single entity which increases the efficiency of value exchange and reduces cost as well The blockchain technology has gradually become mature bringing about the business ecologic circle of generation storage transaction and application In the industries covered by the blockchain technology banking securities and insurance have gained the biggest share In the future the entertainment and media industries powered by the blockchain technology will develop in an accelerating speed and other industries including medical treatment internet of things and supply chain will also see more and more applications of the technology WaykiChain is committed to the booming development of all industries Based on the incorporation of the benefits of both bitcoin and ethereum WaykiChain has built up the enterprise level blockchain infrastructure by integrating the on chain and off chain of the blockchain and thus formed the third generation blockchain eco system In the financial and entertainment sectors WaykiChain will use the blockchain technology to redefine the traditional concepts including assets currency investment and transaction solving the difficulties of exchange transaction and transmission of values on the internet such as funds contracts and digitalized assets etc Natural persons and financial organizations can through the eco system established by WaykiChain realize the on line value transmission and exchange in a highly trusted manner by using the whole set of decentralized mechanism constructed by the blockchain technology 1 2 Design principles and meanings of WaykiChain Although there are many blockchain platforms in the market and new platforms are 6 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer emerging every day It is rare to see the platform that not only incorporates with the traditional business but also applies in reality and the terminal application incorporated with the blockchain technology hardly exists Even bitcoin which is the earliest one applies in reality has more collection value than its currency value Such situations have more or less deviated from the final objective given to the blockchain technology to change the society or even to subvert the current business model We hope to build up a brand new blockchain Eco system which will be an option for the internet value transmission protocol in the future and to promote the usability and operability of the whole blockchain industry This is WaykiChain Thanks to its leading blockchain technology WaykiChain will based on its clear business positioning and strategic plans firstly permeate into and gain shares of the target markets such as the betting assets transaction and foreign currency exchange etc After accumulating users solid support WaykiChain will gradually develop a blockchain technology platform incorporated with real business applications 7 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer Part II WaykiChain technological solutions 2 1 Smart contract WaykiChain is a smart contract platform that supports Turing devices It adopts DPOS consensus mechanism sets up 11 voting nodes and generates a new block every 10 seconds According to detailed calculation by WaykiChain Team currently the confirmed transaction speed can reach 1000+tps WaykiChain\xe2\x80\x99s smart contracts are compiled with lua scripts Lua was innovated in Brazil in 1993 After 30 years of development lua is widely used in various kinds of fields such as games internet of things and built in devices etc It is easy to learn and use by community developers because of its detailed development materials and thus enjoys global support from developers and enterprises With only a small number of WaykiChain coins community developers can publish their lua smart contracts into WaykiChain\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized blockchain networks And thanks to smart contracts we can realize a plenty of applications scenarios such as assets issue bet application copyright sourcing mutual insurance decentralized exchange markets and cross border settlement etc 2 2 Voting mechanism WaykiChain adopts DPOS consensus mechanism with 11 accounting nodes When each block is generated each accounting node is elected according to the random perturbation algorithm from the 11 nodes with the most votes Then the accounting node gains all of the transaction handling fee in its accounting block If the user locks his WaykiChain coins he may earn the related interests When the votes of the corresponding user account change the interest will automatically accrue According to the design of the system the annual rate of return is 5% for the first year and the rate of return will decrease by 1% every year and finally the annual rate of return will be fixed at 1% permanently 2 3 WaykiChain applications WaykiChain decentralized betting application is the first smart contract released by WaykiChain Team In the application the built in application betting super coin will be published Every term of betting will be triggered by the initiator through the smart contract transaction During the valid period stimulated by the contract the user may initiate the betting contract transaction and all of the transactions can be searched and traced in the block browser and can never be revised All of the super coins in the betting will be frozen in the smart contract When a certain term of betting is over the bet initiator will publish final betting results through the contract 8 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer transaction Then the smart contract will issue awards to the correct bettor based on final results from official authorities WaykiChain\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized assets exchange market is another smart contract application released by the WaykiChain Team Users are allowed to exchange their real assets into their Wayki assets in the form of mortgage and trade them openly in the market The smart contract provided by WaykiChain allows the assets initiator to compile dividend sharing rules triggered by certain conditions And all of the market behaviors towards the object in the transaction will decide the final price of the assets in circulation Users needing foreign currency may also realize cross border remittance transaction and payment through WaykiChain The foreign currency exchange initiator may possess Wayki coins by means of pledging his assets to WaykiChain and earn profit by the rate of exchange Users needing foreign currency can directly look for recipients in WaykiChain WaykiChain forex platform based on the blockchain technology features high vertical efficiency that exceeds traditional means Thus more and more recipients will be lured into the business opportunities to meet their increasing demands for foreign currency exchange transactions 2 4 Sidechain The hottest platform which supports smart contracts Ethereum has received much recognition in the market However there is still huge potential improvement for Ethereum which could be seen from the recent network congestion In the history Ethereum had been stuck from network congestion or hacked frequently WaykiChain would apply its own sidechain technology which allows the applications based on WaykiChain to have its own sidechain Sidechains are mutually exclusive and are able to set up its own consensus Sidechain will be required to download specific blocks when using the sidechain application Therefore it will enhance the efficiency and reduces the resources waste Sidechain will transfer and receive information from the main chain to ensure the information security by registering its hash on main chain 2 5 Whole node wallet WaykiChain Team will publish Windows version whole node wallet in its first WaykiChain application named WaykiChain Betting The wallet will be integrated with the money transfer function for Wayki coins and super betting coins as well as the bet application center Within the wallet application center the user can directly publish the betting smart contract to participate in the betting The betting bonus will be 9 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer automatically issued to the user\xe2\x80\x99s wallet after the betting results are released 2 6 Mobile terminal WaykiChain is estimated to publish Wayki android and IOS applications in 2018 Mobile terminal applications will be integrated with Wayki coin light wallet The user can store Wayki coins and super coin digital assets in the local mobile terminal and can participate in betting games conveniently All of the betting bonus will be automatically issued to the user\xe2\x80\x99s mobile application after the betting is over 2 7 Block browser Block browser is a WaykiChain application data display system that displays money transfer records of Wayki coins and super coins balance of the address account betting transactions and drawing results etc According to the application data in blockchai all of the data is open transparent and irreversible by nature 10 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer Part III Application outlook and realization scenarios in WaykiChain industry 3 1 Global decentralized betting application 3 1 1 Pain points of global betting industry (1) Credit of traditional betting platforms When all the online betting platforms adopt the centralized business model (i e run by a certain organization or firm) all the participants in the game must have their assets managed by those centralized platforms The truth is that the credibility and qualification of many online platforms are worrisome to say the least Problems such as technical loopholes black box operation illegal collection money pool setup platform scam non real name verification information insecurity and lack of legal protection bring grave risk to the participants From technical perspective after examining five major security tests including code security data storage security data transmission security network port security and multilateral interacting process security we concluded that most of the online betting Applications and clients showed symptoms of encryption algorithm misuse encryption protocol\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect implementation or partial missing They are also scored poorly in areas such as user trading information protection user deposit protection preventing transaction history tempering and user identity theft etc As a result hackers are given plenty of opportunities to play their tricks in this process If one looks closely at these online platforms he or she will soon find out that most of them share the burden of poor credit Various platforms that involved in the betting business ended up pulling a string on their users and running away These online betting platforms do not own enough capital to hedge their risk and would therefore be dissolved the second when they encounter any major loss Some platforms would choose to scam their users to invest even before they had any loss Besides black box operations such as embezzlement underground lottery fraud lack of transparency in the rule put a thorn in the heart of all the players (2) Limitation of market supervision The authorities in different countries have different attitudes towards the betting industry Some countries regard betting as financial activities while some regard it as gambling Betting activities are treated with strict and tedious supervision which has substantially limited their development and innovation capabilities (3) High percentage of commission fee collected by traditional betting platforms 11 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer Operators of centralized betting platforms require high return to offset their risks because centralized betting activities or the events themselves mean high risks So the participants in the betting activities are forced to bear some of the cost of the operators The legal compliance fees collected by the supervision authorities as mentioned above also covertly reduce the return which should be enjoyed by users Now the total rate of return in the sports contest betting in China is usually around 70% Some illegal platform can provide 80% 90% rate of return However this is far from enough in the market According to probability theory nobody can win in the long term in such a distorted market (4) Niche betting market Traditional betting activities are supervised by the government which has resulted in the situation where most betting platforms are hidden in the underground market The outside world knows little about the platforms and so the market need is not met effectively Therefore the seller or the operator of the betting platform has more leverage on price which further squeezes the return of investors On the other hand providers of betting activities due to their covert characteristics are more difficult to gain the trust of users because users feel very difficult to verify the qualifications of the providers in the covert market or such providers intrinsically bear risks of trust breach Hence the participants of the betting activities are further discouraged and new users are blocked from the market (5) Lack of diversity in traditional platforms In the traditional business model of the centralized betting platform the operator as the opponent to participants will bet in the opposite way The operator can only make profits when participants make wrong judgments Therefore\xef\xbc\x8cmost traditional betting platforms have established their own risk control systems and product research departments If the betting rules of a certain event will give participants some advantages then definitely such betting event will not be adopted and published by the operator A philosophical question is raised only the products and events which are regarded by the operator as advantageous can be published in the platform while those events published to participants are proved to be advantageous for the operator Therefore in the market there is only a limited number of events available to betting participants In most cases such events are disadvantageous for participants 3 1 2 Business solutions for decentralized betting games The decentralized betting application built on the WaykiChain system has inherited the features and benefits of the blockchain technology so it will perfectly solve the 12 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer unreasonable problems in the current betting industry including the low rate of return on the traditional betting platform which is badly criticized shortage of available betting products and non openness non transparency legal risks fund insecurity and cheating of the operator etc Because the betting application built on WaykiChain is decentralized it will not be controlled by any party of interest Moreover the betting information is recorded in the distributed ledger and cannot be altered by any party so false betting results are impossible All users can check the real time betting records through the blockchain browser Any fraud or other illegal malicious behaviors will be found out and prevented in time For example in the soccer betting the WaykiChain application will refer to the officially published match results or to those trustworthy results accepted by the public and will collect and verify real time data All users will get a result recognized in consensus then WaykiChain smart contract will execute gains distribution according to the automatically calculated betting rate of return Because the execution of the smart contract is preset and the betting information of all users are recorded and cannot be altered in blockchain so all users enjoy a just open and fair gaming environment The blockchain technology itself has become the most powerful credit endorsement for the betting application Comparing with the traditional betting platform the betting application built on WaykiChain features another big advantage operational cost WaykiChain is jointly operated by whole nodes and users so no organization like the traditional operator will share the interest that is payable to the betting participant The rate of return in WaykiChain betting application may reach 99% which no other competitors in the market can do so Therefore the blockchain technology can bring about another big competitive advantage namely the participant can gain the highest rate of return in WaykiChain betting application Any individual who is very confident about a certain event can also publish a betting activity freely towards such event WaykiChain betting application allows all participants to publish their own event betting A publisher by using the smart contract provided by WaykiChain can write his event in which he trusts into WaykiChain and places his assets limits which he pledges in WaykiChain as the betting return Any user who is interested in and has opposite opinions towards the event can participate in the betting And the rate of return is decided by the ratio of investment fund of all the participants in the final event result The smart contract will help strangers to solve the biggest trust obstacle and at the same time it will not cost much as the third witness party Besides the betting application built on evade legal 13 WaykiChain can almost \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer supervision Firstly participants will use the digital currency issued by WaykiChain (not legal currency) Secondly like bitcoin WaykiChain is distributed in many nodes in the world which can neither be destroyed nor be caught Finally the anonymity brought by blockchain can help users to carry out games in a safer manner More importantly thanks to the decentralization in WaykiChain betting application there is no control of the rate of return or market manipulation on the part of the dealer and thus no dealer s runaways Users in WaykiChain betting application is worry free completely The WaykiChain application will be gradually open and provide all the betting products and games available in the market In the early stage the sports contest betting is used as the beginning point to lure and accumulate initial users Laterr it will be open for all users to create their own independent event bets As time passes by it will become a killer level unprecedented betting application on internet thanks to its comprehensive betting products and highest rate of return 3 2 Global decentralized assets transaction application 3 2 1 Pain points in the global centralized assets exchange The traditional security market is developed around the exchange The transaction system in the exchange guarantees the normal procedures of all transactions Once the system is attacked or doesn t work the whole network may be compromised and all transactions must be halted When the centralized assets exchange suffers loss because of outside malicious attacks all users on the platform normally suffer Famous examples include Mt Gox MF Global and Bitfinex exchanges Users must bear the loss when the exchange is attacked by hackers or the exchange goes bankrupt in some extreme cases there are embezzlements in the exchange By selecting the centralized assets exchange users must trust it completely giving out their assets for keeping without any doubts This means that the assets disposition right is transferred from the proprietor to the trustee i e the centralized assets exchange Therefore the exchange not only is entitled to dispose your assets but also sees all of your transactions No one can guarantee that the exchange will not execute the transaction to its benefits and as a matter of fact many exchanges have been done so Moreover every exchange has many employees which increases the difficulty of internal supervision (2) Unfairness of the centralized assets exchange Because users transaction information is visible in the exchange the scandals of insider trading in major exchanges can be seen frequently Besides the 14 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer transaction speed is not very fast in the exchange If some traders can always execute their transactions more quickly they can gain benefits by means of computing advantages and transaction proceeding speed which is called high frequency transaction This is very unfair to other traders And to compete for faster transaction speed requires more investment hence increasing the costs of transaction (3) Rules limits in the centralized assets exchange In the traditional centralized assets exchange such as NASDAQ and in the emerging digital currency exchange such as Coinbase users are required to follow the rules as stipulated by the exchange including limited trading time quota of cash withdrawn every day and even the proof of user s assets income as required by some exchange Moreover the assets products that can be traded in the traditional exchange are limited too The traded assets registered with the exchange must pass various kinds of inspections and supervisions which causes legal compliance costs and time cost as well Many quality assets are thus refused to be traded by the assets market (4) Time cost and high transaction fee caused by the centralized assets exchange The foreground system in the exchange is responsible for matching transactions while the background system is responsible for settlement and delivery There are many procedures and links in the two systems which leads to time and fund cost Moreover according to rules real time settlement cannot be made on the date of transaction which also brings about potential risks to assets Furthermore the operational and promotional fees in the exchange are expensive and such fees will be labeled as handling fees from users transactions Take the digital currency trading website Bitstamp as an example a user must pay USD 5 for every transaction worth USD 1000 However the handling fees of Bitstamp are not the most expensive among digital assets exchanges 3 2 2 Business solutions of decentralized assets transactions The blockchain technology helps to realize the concept of the decentralized assets exchange The decentralized assets exchange built on WaykiChain system will inherit all the functions in the traditional centralized assets exchange such as stock trading rare metal trading commodity trading etc The decentralized exchange can not only bear the load of the same or even bigger trading volume comparing to the centralized exchange but also solve the pain points that are common in the centralized one 15 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer Decentralization of WaykiChain technology means that no stakeholder groups or organizations can control the decentralized exchange thus keeping its fairness openness and transparency At the same time users don t have to worry about the credit of the exchange because the object of trust has changed from the traditional centralized organization to blockchain smart contract In WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange all transactions are realized through smart contracts without the existence of any fraud or malicious breaking promises Therefore the blockchain technology and smart contract can provide more effective support for the transaction of digital assets products hence laying the foundation for providing transactions of digital assets WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange empowers users so that they don t have to worry about the high time and handling cost in the traditional centralized assets exchange The blockchain technology can simplify and automate the profound trading procedures so that the assets publisher and investor can trade with each other directly reducing interactions between the foreground and background and save a lot of manpower and material sources Moreover the limits often seen in the traditional exchange exist no more in the decentralized exchange Users can trade at any time freely Cash withdrawal is not limited every user has full power to dispose his properties Thanks to the consensus algorithm and its irreversibility nature of the distributed blockchain technology adopted by WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange helps the participants to trade assets to perfectly shared data Every user\xe2\x80\x99s transaction is recorded in the block browser and cannot be altered Meanwhile the exchange allows anonymous transaction Users don t have to worry either the spying upon their transaction information or the dealer s counterpart transactions due to information advantages Any user can pledge his assets in WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange publishing his own WaykiChain assets For example John owns a company with an annual profit of USD 1 million and his estimated value of his company is USD 10 million However due to various kinds of limits from the stock exchange and supervision authority John is not able to list his company by issuing stock shares to the public Now John may choose to issue his WaykiChain shares on WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange John s WaykiChain shares are granted with value because he has pledged the future income and some proprietary rights of his company in the smart contract of WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange Every year based on the share ratio of the investors the profits of the company will be automatically allocated and the investors also enjoy the shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 right in the company Thanks to the smart contract of the blockchain technology the cost to establish trust is reduced drastically in the transaction 16 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange allows the user to pledge any assets to issue the corresponding WaykiChain assets The price of such assets will be recognized by investors according to market laws 3 3 Settlement time of international remittance and forex 3 3 1 Pain points of global cross border remittance and forex (1) Settlement time of international remittance and forex In the cross border transaction if the remitter and payee doesn t belong to the same bank the procedures necessary for the transaction is very tedious Different banks have different ledgers When the cross border transfer is executed banks involved have to check their own ledgers and the transaction can only be fulfilled after information is exchanged and verified by every bank Then comes the breach risk when both parties make the settlement Therefore the common solution is to seek the third party as an escrow account and only when the transaction is completed the third party will transfer the fund into the account of the payee Tedious account verification will slow the transaction speed Particularly when the cross border transaction happens more than one bank are involved if the respective bank for the remitter and payee intend to complete the transaction The time necessary in such procedures is unpredictable Sometimes the transaction can finish in one day and sometimes it will take several days In the forex market following ordinary procedure one trading party transfers its fund to the intermediary For example CLS a foreign currency settlement provider will hold the fund till the counterpart party provides its fund One problem occurs in the procedure is that before the settlement is completed the fund of the initiating party will be frozen in the transaction for one day normally or even longer Therefore the forex market as well as the cross border transfer faces the same problem i e uncertainty and delay of the transaction completion time (2) Exchange rate risk in the cross border remittance market The parties involved in the cross border remittance and forex must face the risk of exchange rate fluctuations due to the time delay of the transaction Usually the parties involved are required by banks to bear the rate fluctuation risk when they use the inter bank transfer service which increases uncertainty of transaction for both parties The risk of rate fluctuations can be particularly fatal for forex parties 17 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer (3) Fees in the cross border remittance market In the market every participant involved in remittance will be charged with certain fees And the more the money involved the higher the relevant fees are Hence another uncertainty occurs because the total fees for one transaction cannot be determined until the completion of the transaction Generally the fees for one transaction is 2% 3% of the traded amount in some extreme cases the fees may exceed 10% (4) Non transparency in the cross border remittance market As mentioned above neither the remitter nor the payee is sure about the necessary time and fees for the transaction They only know that the fee collected will be fluctuated within a range Moreover as the initiators of the transaction both the remitter and payee can neither search for the trading progress in the trading banks nor can they carry out effective real time tracing Because every transaction is usually fulfilled by many different participants it is extremely difficult to search and trace the relevant information When a mistake occurs beyond expectations it is very difficult to locate the mistake by tracing the transaction Mistakes will usually be found out after quite a time For example wrong account numbers takes even longer time to fix (5) Forex settlement risk Settlement is a major forex link The global forex settlement systems are innovated thanks to the development of the information technology Because financial systems are inter connected a settlement failure in a large amount of transaction will trigger a series of breaches The risk is that the cross border settlement can only be executed during the normal working time of the central bank of the home currency While both parties in the settlement may reside in different time zones if one party makes the settlement before the other party the other party waiting for the settlement will face its counterpart breaches If a forex trader pays its currency but doesn t get the currency payable it will face the loss coming from the rate fluctuations of the exact currency payable The risk comes from the synchronization of the payments by both parties (6) Supervision requirements in the cross border remittance and forex Every state puts much emphasis on the supervision of foreign currency and crossborder transactions It is also very difficult to increase the supervision efficiency and lower the cost as well 18 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer 3 3 2 Decentralized forex business solution Along with the development of WaykiChain there would be more and more users joining WaykiChain Some of them speak different languages and use different currencies To make all users to participate in the WaykiChain conveniently WaykiChain has provided a solution that different legal currencies can be converted At the same time the system will serve the users who need forex transactions and cross border remittance In WaykiChain decentralized forex application there will be forex recipient for various legal currencies Anyone can become an recipient Recipient can obtain the digital assets titles (WKX) by pledging assets to WaykiChain such as bitcoins Wayki coins Ethereum etc WKX can be WKCNY WKUSD or WKBTC WKX to the corresponding legal currency is anchored at the forex rate of 1 1 In WaykiChain users can either pay WKX to buy the assets priced with the corresponding legal currency or withdraw cash with WKX which has provided a channel for fund circulation WKX supplies will be strictly recorded in the blockchain browser where anybody can access WaykiChain will increase WKX circulations with the same amount as that of the corresponding pledged deposit and will recover the corresponding WKX in case of cash withdrawal For example investor John owns RMB 60 000 and intends to convert the money into USD But due to the forex control in the country John chooses to use WaykiChain to exchange for USD In WaykiChain decentralized forex application John finds recipient Terrence who wants to exchange for RMB with his USD and then sends RMB 60 000 to Terrence After that John gets WKUSD at the same exchange rate as that of USD Suppose the exchange rate of USD to RMB is 1 6 John gets 10 000 WKUSD At the same time the title of 10 000 WKUSD is taken back by the system from recipient Terrence By continuing to pledge the deposit to WaykiChain Terrence can gain more WKX titles to provide acceptance services The smart contract supported by WaykiChain will ensure the trasaction\xe2\x80\x99s immediacy and security Foreign exchange transaction and trade will become much faster and become more convenient for customers Moreover the transaction cost would be reduced as well Unlike the traditional forex platforms WaykiChain doesn t charge any handling fees The recipient can select his own forex rate and the range of fluctuations Finally the actual rate will be close to the officially published rate because the listed rate exceeding the market rate will be eliminated by the market WaykiChain contracts guarantees the instantaneity and security of every transaction because the exchange and cross border remittance between the currencies of different countries become very fast and convenient in the system At the same time the necessary cost is reduced to minimum 19 \x0cBlockchain business application pioneer 3 4 Construction of the blockchain Eco system WaykiChain
