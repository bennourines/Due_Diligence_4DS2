\x0c\xe6\xa6\x82\xe8\xbf\xb0 Overview The online game industry is a fast growing market with more than a billion users Blockchain games are considered to be the next growth point in the blockchain application field Globally the number of blockchain wallet users has reached 30 million Gaming is absolutely a highly suitable scenario to implement blockchain With the potential of reforming existing gaming modes blockchain games are superior to traditional games in credibility fairness democracy and ownership of virtual assets However they are currently trapped in a vicious cycle of high entry barrier low playability and ineffective marketing Krypton aims to create the first gateway to a blockchain gaming ecosystem It would reduce the barrier to entry faced by traditional developers and players Krypton can provide a comprehensive solution for creating blockchain based games and quickly acquire both traditional game players and existing blockchain users through its unique distribution system and public chain plan Krypton has been making steady progress and currently has more than 1 4 million users worldwide It supports both iOS and Android in 20 languages In addition it has created gateways for players developers blockchain communities and distributors Krypton is on the eve of a massive outbreak \xe3\x80\x8aNumber of Blockchain wallet users worldwide from 1st quarter 2016 to 1st quarter 2019\xe3\x80\x8bhttps //www statista com/ statistics/647374/worldwide blockchain wallet users/ \xe7\xac\xac 8 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 1 Market Analysis A Pain points of traditional game Industry Traditional game market has been experiencing explosive growth since 2007 According to Newzoo\ s data the global game market has reached $134 9 billion dollars by 2018 and and it is expected to reach $174 0 billion dollars by 2021 with a compounded annual growth rate of 10 3% In 2018 the Chinese market contributea $34 4 billion dollars accounting for 25% of the world ranking first in the world It is estimated that Chinese market will reach 50 7 billion dollars in 2021 Although the game industry has been developing at a high speed in the past 20 years it has faced various problems since its development The most prominent problems are mainly concentrated among players and game developers a Problems Facing Gamers (1) Developers lack credibility and game mechanics and data are not transparent In the past games often did not disclose the mechanism of in game digital assets and players could not verify the authenticity of the rules used by game development companies which harms player\ s rights and interests Especially for games such as chess and gambling the probability of winning or losing is described in plain text but the player still cannot verify its authenticity There may be situations in which the game development company seeks improper financial gains and damages the fairness of the game Traditional games often lack credibility Driven by their own interests many game development companies often change the game rules For example the probability of creating the best equipment has never been made public Some public probabilities such as those affecting the chance of drawing cards treasure chests and equipment are often secretly altered causing great dissatisfaction (2) Players do not really own their virtual assets in games For the virtual assets in current traditional games players only have the right to use but no ownership Although players pay for the virtual assets such as points items weapons and characters in the game and these can be traded but its ownership \xe7\xac\xac 9 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 essentially belongs to the game makers This is because in all current games the player\ s digital assets are stored on the official centralized server of the game For game makers these virtual assets are just a bunch of code that can be changed at will Players are not free to dispose their owned assets and trading is even not supported in most games In addition when the game development company stops the server operation or seals the player\ s game account number the player\ s game assets also disappear and the game assets are heavily dependent on the survival of the game product and is centralized (3) Depreciation in Virtual assets is a serious problem In order to make profits game operators generally continuously introduce new virtual assets with greater functionalities The so called god like costumes and beasts that players have paid a lot of money before are often replaced by new ones and the functionality of existing virtual assets cannot be guaranteed Further given that most games have separated servers items collected in one server cannot be brought over to other servers (4) Game assets cannot be traded across games Most game economies are a closed system which makes it impossible for game assets to trade across games For example it is difficult for players to sell Warcraft items in exchange for skins in Honour of Kings For those who have committed large amounts of fiat money there is almost no other way to recover the sunken cost once they stop playing the game except for selling their account at a large discount (5) Game asset trading is problematic The trade of game assets has always been problematic Peer to peer transactions in forums and communities are risky and transactions on third party trading platforms are subject to a 10 30% fee These circumstances have increased the difficulty of trading game assets b Problems Encountered by Developers (1) User bonus is decreasing while user acquisition (UA) costs skyrocket The rise of entertainment mediums such as short videos has led to a decline in user \xe7\xac\xac 10 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 bonus and a shortened game life cycle Internet applications such as e commerce are also competing with game producers for the attention of users resulting in increased UA costs In addition to a few top games the pay out rate and average revenue per user (ARPU) have little room to improve Due to the increase in UA costs most low ARPU games have difficulty obtaining players Further games with high ARPUs such as strategy MMOs can get players at a very high cost This actually caused bad money to drive out good money and the entire industry environment is deteriorating rapidly (2) Intensive competition and monopoly pattern in traditional game industry In 2017 the Chinese game market was monopolized by Tencent and Netease with a market share of 76 2% In the new market their market share reached 95 8% almost monopolizing all new opportunities Top game producers created extremely high barrier to potential competitors including prohibitive R&D costs IP resources human resources marketing expenditures hold on player\ s time and wallet Other producers are facing intense pressure just to survive B Blockchain Game Advantages over traditional games a Developer\ s credibility is guaranteed by transparent smart contracts Blockchain games can expose rules and are executed by smart contracts Users don\ t need to trust developers just trust the code The rules of how game assets are generated obtain probabilities quantities etc are ensured by mandatory and open source nature of smart contracts Typical applications are probabilistic guessing chess and card games Moreover based on the characteristics of smart contract enforcement and open source new teams without trusted endorsements can quickly gain users\ trust in their products which helps the growth of small and medium sized innovated teams b The players Truly own in game assets The virtual assets in blockchain games are divided into standard tokens and non standard (Non fungible Token) tokens which are divided into ERC 20 and ERC 721 of the Ethereum protocol The tokens of both protocols are stored in the user\ s own wallet and the user has complete ownership of these assets and is free to trade and use \xe7\xac\xac 11 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 Developers can\ t make arbitrary changes to the user\ s assets Even if developers decide to stop operating games in the future these assets will still exist on the blockchain which can still be traded freely and may be used in other applications At the same time through the traceable and non tamperable characteristics of the blockchain the occurrence of each transaction and the flow of assets are recorded and prevented from being tampered with and any fraud in the game is eliminated to a certain extent c Scarcity of virtual assets As long as other participants recognize the value of transferrable virtual assets at player\ s blockchain address the assets will always maintain their value and will not be changed easily by any game development company The release of virtual assets is achieved through smart contracts By nature all types of tokens are limited in amount d Fairer market for opportunities Blockchain game developers are now facing new high value market opportunities a premium user base + a global marketplace + a low barrier to entry Blockchain has a globally distributed user base with a high willingness to pay providing more room for growing ARPU The blockchain industry is still in the early stages of development Despite the emergence of ETH EOS and other top projects the final ecology is far from stable and it is a fairer market for new entrants e Increased liquidity of blockchain game assets Due to the openness and transparency of game asset distribution users can participate in game transactions with confidence Therefore the virtual assets of blockchain games have extremely high liquidity and users can transfer and trade their own assets The high liquidity of blockchain game assets can attract users to participate in the game and stimulate the payment rate In addition by tokenizing virtual assets through separate secondary smart contracts game assets can be traded more securely and conveniently In the future through cross chain technology players can trade game assets across games and platforms In traditional games the assets in the game are often limited within the game The game itself is basically worthless elsewhere and technically difficult to reuse The tokenized items+ mobile wallet of the blockchain game allows game items to be traded anywhere anytime across games and platforms \xe7\xac\xac 12 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 f More democratic rights to players With blockchain games the relationship between developers and players will change dramatically For the most part under the previous system the two tend to stand on opposite sides one side constantly revises the game mechanics adjusts the parameters and constantly tries to extract profits from players the other side wants to earn reputation in the game and plays for fun Because traditional games run on developers\ centralized server they naturally have god like authority However blockchain games run on multiple nodes and some of the nodes are run by the players so the developer and the players may form a community and reach a consensus When some nodes are handed over to KOL in the game the interests of the game community will be in line with the interests of the developer The loyal players will spontaneously maintain the balance of the game help the developer acquire users extend the game\ s life cycle and build it together with the community g Reforming traditional game experiences In the real world currency is issued by the central bank In the traditional game world virtual asset is obtained by players through tricks bounty tasks upgrades etc similar to the Prove of Work mechanism of the blockchain The blockchain token economy and the virtual economy of games belong to the category of digital economies Network content and assets are more suitable for the blockchain If blockchain technology and the token system are introduced into the game it will be a highly disruptive innovation Blockchain based games offer players and owners the possibility to be rewarded for their in game actions and this new game trend has begun to change the way players interact with games In the near future it will give players a unique gaming experience with evolving characters and easy cross game trading \xe7\xac\xac 13 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 C Pain points of blockchain game industry According to Dappradar the number of average daily active users of DAPP has increased from 158 000 in March 2019 to 184 000 in May 2019 as a result of increasing number of games and closer attention from more players Currently 47 of the top 100 Ethereum Dapps are game applications According to incomplete statistics there are currently nearly 500 blockchain games on the market Unlike traditional games most players of blockchain games are seeking speculation or novelty that is they do not play just for fun At present there are only 5 games with DAU higher than 1000 and 21 games with DAU higher than 100 which suggests strong potential of blockchain game industry Smart contracts and open source code have created a high entry barrier for game developers which set off a chain reaction in the blockchain industry (a) Difficulty for traditional game developers to enter the blockchain game business (b) Lack of popular games and existing games have low quality and playability (c) Lack of loyalty of existing users with speculative purpose (d) High barrier against traditional game user created by low quality of games and their unfamiliarity with blockchain infrastructure (e) Developers have to resort to third party distributors due to inadequate incentives to promote games designed for main net public blockchains (f) Low conversion rate of third party distributors which lead to high marketing expenditures and low returns Eventually the entire ecology falls into a vicious circle \xe7\xac\xac 14 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 2 Introduction A Overview Krypton aims to build the world\ s first gateway to the blockchain gaming ecosystem Unlike other games or content distribution projects Krypton believes that a complete blockchain gaming ecosystem should include players (both native blockchain users and traditional game migrant players) developers production and distribution of contents and community Only with the joint efforts of these necessary elements can the entire ecosystem enter the virtuous cycle and develop rapidly and healthily Therefore Krypton\ s gateway to the blockchain gaming ecosystem compromise four parts user entrance content gateway public chain community gateway and promotion portal a User Entrance In most blockchain games users need to complete public chain registration wallet generation record mnemonics exchange registration and currency trading before they can play the game which could be quite complicated and result in loss of users Krypton allows users to register easily with their WeChat account and then automatically generates player\ s wallet address to store the user\ s mining income When the user needs to withdraw or transfer the assets to wallet addresses just import a wallet address and it does not affect the player\ s gaming experience A smoother gaming experience would attract players who are used to traditional games \xe7\xac\xac 15 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 b Content Gateway This gateway suggests more high quality games High quality games are inseparable from excellent game developers When developing blockchain games traditional developers confronts many problems high development threshold caused by smart contract complexity security risks arising from open source code inadequate support for complex contracts resulting from low TPS of main net public chain inability to host high quality products due to insufficient API support difficulties of acquiring cross platform and cross token users The built in Layer 2 technology of Krypton puts the transactions that don\ t need to be publicized off the chain with encryption and gaming to ensure the ability to put them back on the chain at any time and eventually implements zero latency transfer confirmation and contract call without any fees Krypton provides game specific smart contract templates and SDKs which developers call on demand eliminating the time cost and security risks of smart contract development Krypton also provides cross chain trading solutions docking multiple public chains together and acquiring large number of users from other public chains Therefore with SDK service provided by Krypton solving all technical challenges traditional developers can concentrate on updating and developing games Fundamentally addressing the issue of developers Krypton can encourage more developers to create more high quality blockchain games C Public chain community gateway Based on different historical backgrounds technical paths and professional applications the blockchain industry has a variety of public chains forming a number of public chain communities each of which has its own original user group These unique user groups also form many independent communities There are no signs of integration of those communities in the short term which is quite unfavourable for the promotion of blockchain games A blockchain game often needs to be developed based on a public chain and then reuse the technology to other public chains but the user information virtual assets equipment and other digital information of the game can\ t be traded or transferred across different chains Krypton launches the public chain plan which packages the entire game ecosystem and quickly copies it to other public chains and help those public chains to build their own \xe7\xac\xac 16 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 game ecosystem Thus Krypton can activate original users using the game ecosystem At the same time it can also help original blockchain users to quickly join the Krypton ecosystem and exchange game tokens across different chains based on layer 2 In this way Krypton\ s public chain plan connects independent blockchain user groups and allows them to join Krypton ecosystem The free flow of users and value stimulates the activity of various public chains within the ecosystem d Promotion Portal Traditional blockchain games are usually distributed or promoted through third party channels such as wallets and information platforms Therefore the promotion is limited to the user base of those third party channels However a third party channel with more than 10 000 users may has a conversion rate lower than 1% because they are not binding on their users As a result developers have to promote their game on one thirdparty channels for a long time or turn to multiple channels Moreover the user groups of different third party channels may overlap which also increases the cost of game promotion Even if these channels exert the most ideal effects they cannot effectively cover the whole blockchain industry not to mention the traditional game users Krypton\ s innovative in game governance system adds blockchain solutions to the guild system in traditional game Based on fairness and transparency the community mechanism will make full use of ranks honours points missions and other functions of game to mobilize players support marketing activities and disseminate information more efficiently and accurately Meanwhile developers can cooperate with the managers (community leaders) of the target community that matches their game Employees (ordinary players) receive salaries from the community in exchange for their efforts and thus are bounded by the managers which means higher conversion rates to the game Finally the managers stimulate growth of the community by setting KPIs and engaging employees in game tasks with the ultimate goal to issue its own secondary tokens for the mutual benefits of game developers community managers and employees B Empowering public chains\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Krypton Platform Design In order to allow developers and users to reap benefit from the blockchain based on high quality game content social interaction system built in NFT wallet and marketplace Krypton created a closed loop ecosystem On the one hand it gives developers easy access to tools for development and helps high quality games issue ERC20 tokens \xe7\xac\xac 17 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\xb8\x82\xe5\x9c\xba\xe5\x88\x86\xe6\x9e\x90 Developers can benefit from issuing these tokens In addition these tokens can be used to charge which solves the problem that many non use tokens do not get spent and cannot maintain their circulation On the other hand users are encouraged to actively participate in Krypton ecosystem by playing games participating in the development of games holding game tokens a (1) Games Features\xef\xbc\x9a We focus on high quality content using our own development team and combine traditional game developers with existing successful blockchain games We also try to attract traditional game players in order to create incremental effects At the same time a game crowdfunding function will be released through secondary smart contracts on Krypton which will establish a strong connection between developers and early adopters In addition as an important function of the Krypton Chain games with high quality ecosystem and huge use base can issue their exclusive secondary ERC20 token based on Krypton chain So that players can play the game hold the game specific token and reap the benefits from future game development (2) i Existing Games\xef\xbc\x9a Block West (1) Developed by the core team members of Perfect World\ s The Condor Heroes team The world\ s first blockchain MMORPG game At present it has officially launched on Krypton and has many functions such as daily prize wheel quests battles social chat etc and issued built in ERC20 token (KC) based on Krypton Equipment and pets were

(KC) has been launched in the built in wallet of Krypton Players are free to perform transactions between the game and the wallet and can use the wallet to transfer tokens freely (3) The goal was to put Westward Journey on the blockchain While retaining the various interesting core gameplays of a traditional MMORPG the game mechanism is more transparent the assets are more tangible and reusable and all players can enjoy utility from the tokens ii Krypton Knight (1) Similar to the traditional classic shooting game Soul Knight the game has 5 kinds of characters hundreds of equipment dozens of maps and 3 modes (single adventure survival challenge and world boss events) The three modes are easy to get started difficult to master and have high playability More importantly the game\ s equipment are NFTs Any equipment that players receive can be transferred out to a wallet and then traded freely in the NFT Mall (2) The game was the first NFT enabled game supported by the Krypton Chain It truly realizes the full potential and value of game equipment outside the game Any player even those who don\ t play Krypton Knight can freely trade in the Krypton Mall When players trade the game\ s equipment the equipment is stored in their own wallet address and not on the game server \xe7\xac\xac 19 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe4\xbb\x8b\xe7\xbb\x8d iii Krypton Miner (1) The first match 3 game on Krypton The casual game of finding treasure chests is fun easy to get started and difficult to master If players play well they will get KGC rewards and there will be an extra reward distributed every week based on the topranking chart At present the single player timed mode is online and more modes will be released in the future iv Krypton Betting

eliminate player\ s distrust of the developer manipulating results The idea was to put the result of the random probability of betting on the blockchain (2) Krypton\ s players predict the outcome of the game and each event The odds are completely determined by the user\ s betting dynamics The settlement rules are completely transparent Currently popular tournaments such as the UEFA Champions League Asian Champions League the English Premier League the European Top Five Leagues the NBA the League of Legends LPL and the NFL are all supported v Krypton Celebrity (1) As the name suggests that is users can benefit from cultivating or collecting virtual cards trading fighting in the game The transparency of game is ensured through smart contracts The idea was to have a card game that used ERC721 tokens Because of the non identity of ERC721 tokens each token is an independent and differentiated individual which can be visualized into images with different appearances and parameters such as cats dogs fishes or a country city and celebrity etc (2) Krypton Celebrity is a celebrity card collection game We make celebrities in the Krypton community into tokenized card Players can buy and sell cards freely and gain more platform benefits by owning celebrity cards The current celebrities include the first members of the Krypton community third party partners and well known strategic

significant contributions to the development of Krypton (3) As an NFT asset Celebrity cards have reusable properties which are used by another game Krypton Tycoon Players with celebrity cards will automatically have a corresponding super strong card in Krypton Tycoon and can freely battle with other cards in the game vi Kether Tycoon (1) Simulation games are about constructing a decentralized virtual world from a base Players will obtain virtual property rights through various ways and can carry out various business activities in their own territory to grow (2) Krypton Tycoon is a

layers ecosystem layer platform application layer tool layer contract layer consensus layer and data layer A Ecology Layer Krypton\ s goal is to become the world\ s first gateway for blockchain games based on high quality game content social interaction built in token transactions and an NFT collectibles mall forming a complete closed loop ecosystem encouraging users to create value and accumulate digital assets by playing games on Krypton The ecosystem layer of Krypton is mainly composed of high quality game content like Krypton Knight Krypton Miner Block West Hyper Dragon and Titanium Interactive games The composition of the ecosystem layer is formed mainly through self research cooperation with traditional high quality game developers and existing successful games to combine traditional classic games with blockchain etc Not only ensure the quality of the game but also hope to attract traditional gamers creating an incremental effect At the same time Krypton will open the game crowdfunding function which will establish a strong connection between developers and users from the nascent stage of the game \xe7\xac\xac 28 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe6\x8a\x80\xe6\x9c\xaf\xe6\x9e\xb6\xe6\x9e\x84 B a Application Layer NFT Wallet Wallets are tools for storing and using cryptocurrency which play a pivotal role in the blockchain field Unlike traditional currency wallets the NFT wallet is a dedicated wallet for virtual collections that documents the various attributes of each digital asset and related events The specific implementation method is to monitor the ERC721 transaction on the blockchain convert the transaction on the chain into the ownership and topic data that the user cares about and provide a unified interface to record the specific attribute data of the NFT The built in token and NFT wallet not only facilitate transfer collection transaction record inquiry etc but also let user view all current collections in the NFT collection wallet and it is easy to initiate transfer collections and initiate sales of collections from wallets b Cross chain Transfers Cross chain is the direct circulation of tokens which overcomes the barriers between different chains Cross chain trading does not change the value of digital assets on each blockchain but only allows exchange/transfers between different holders One of the core elements of cross chain trading technology is to help user Alice on one chain find a user Bob on another chain who is willing to redeem From a business perspective cross chain technology is an exchange that allows users to conduct cross chain transactions on the exchange The ultimate goal of Krypton is to allow cross chain trading and exchanges that support cross chain trading will accept payments for Bitcoin and Ethereum and their ERC20 standard tokens Cross chain transactions can be implemented using hashlocking techniques relay chain (such as BTCRelay and ZecRelay) or cross chain communication protocols (such as Cosmos and Polkadot) Krypton uses Notary schemes which sets interoperable triggers between different chains Cross chain transfer behaviour can only occur if the trigger condition is met The solution does not require the construction of a new blockchain and functions directly on the original chain to achieve cross chain capabilities \xe7\xac\xac 29 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe6\x8a\x80\xe6\x9c\xaf\xe6\x9e\xb6\xe6\x9e\x84 c Multi currency Wallet Krypton Wallet will be the global cryptocurrency wallet that supports the transfer payment and storage of most cryptocurrencies Any cryptocurrency can be safely and conveniently traded on this wallet and the recharge and withdrawal between trading platforms allows users to have secure storage tools for their favourite game tokens d NFT Mall NFT Mall is a decentralized asset trading mall empowered by smart contracts The contract itself guarantees the security and transparency of the transaction process The combination of on chain execution and off chain match increases the fluency of usage Specifically the seller signs the sold item ID and price through the private key and sends the signature to the mall for the pending order the buyer can obtain the signature and send the response price to the transaction contract to complete the transaction C a Tool Layer Blockchain Browser The blockchain browser can be considered as main window of the blockchain information and the contents recorded in each block can be viewed from the blockchain browser Usually the digital asset user will use the blockchain browser to query the transaction information recorded in the block It will record in detail the confirmation process of each block and the process of generating and distributing tokens and completely record the token circulation between each block thus revealing the information more completely and publicly such as stocks increments turnovers etc The only thing that cannot be known is who is behind each block which is a feature of anonymity b Cross chain Asset Transfer The Krypton Chain will be the hub for cross chain trading of several assets We use smart contracts and hash locking technology to transfer digital assets from any chain to the Krypton Chain or vice versa without the help of any authoritative third party Regardless of the public chain of another game if it can support smart contracts and hash locks the Krypton Chain can be used as a cache for its high speed processing This can give developers a lot of convenience For example developers can reduce the cost \xe7\xac\xac 30 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe6\x8a\x80\xe6\x9c\xaf\xe6\x9e\xb6\xe6\x9e\x84 of learning and games developed using the original public chain are easily transferred to Krypton In addition the combination of cross chain transactions and the underlying blockchain can provide a more robust assurance of utility value for secondary tokens issued based on the Krypton Chain For example users can use ETH to freely and securely purchase or sell a Krypton based token on other chains without the presence of a third party c Krypton Account System The blockchain account system is based on key pairs which increases security and anonymity but it increases the entry barrier for ordinary users Krypton uses the mobile phone number that the user is familiar with as the default ID and the user can choose to actively associate the wallet address to realize the mapping between the account and the wallet The third party application can freely choose to use the user\ s account or wallet address as the main account When selecting the user account user can use the oauth2 0 provided by Krypton as the access and query the user\ s related information through the token such as the address of mapped wallet The wallet address user avatar and the property that needs to be received by the wallet address can be temporarily hosted in the account which reduces the barrier for Dapp development so that its function can be unaffected in the non wallet environment Users can also choose to use its own wallet address directly without having to go through Krypton interact directly with the user adding a lot of flexibility d RPC Interface (Remote Procedure Call) That is to say the calling procedure code does not run locally but rather implements the connection and communication between the caller and the callee Krypton will provide a wealth of technical PRC to meet the needs of games and NFT+ For example Krypton will provide a cross chain event monitor interface All the token transactions that occur on all Krypton\ s supported public chains are monitored by the Krypton client and support a programmable event handling mechanism Krypton also provides ample NFT+ query RPC For example being able to query NFT+ public key at any time owner etc \xe7\xac\xac 31 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe4\xba\xa7\xe5\x93\x81\xe7\x89\xb9\xe7\x82\xb9 D Contract Layer Solidity is a high level language for writing smart contracts The Solidity program needs to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) EVM is used to execute the smart contract of the Krypton Smart contracts can be developed using the advanced development language Solidity and the contract source code is compiled to get the bytecode that can be run in the EVM When deploying contracts and interacting with contracts bytecodes are passed and presented as hexadecimal strings E Consensus Layer The underlying technology of the Krypton Chain is the perfect blend and improvement of ETH and EOS technologies We implemented BFT DPOS technology based on the Ethereum The full name of BFT DPOS technology is the Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof of Stake Unlike traditional POS technology BFT DPOS achieves two important improvements First the block producer is voted by all participants the second is the use of Byzantine fault tolerance technology to shorten the block confirmation time Voting determines that the block producers can be part of the blockchain producer on the one hand and a correction channel on the other Any producer who does evil can be quickly removed by the voters thus maintaining the stability of the system The possibility of universal participation is an important guarantee for maintaining consensus The application of Byzantine fault tolerant technology allows a block to be confirmed within one second of its generation This speed of confirmation makes it possible for in game real time transactions based on blockchain F Data Layer The Big Data layer of Krypton is a decentralized file storage and reading system In this system we use a technique similar to the Interstellar File System (IPFS) to decentralize access to files For each data stored it can be obtained by its signature The behaviour data of NFT+ can be freely accessed In addition this system will support NFT+ based big data analysis For any NFT+ token all of its behavioural data can be stored and retrieved at low cost and guaranteed to be correct

Trading Market Problems The concept of decentralized cash has been proposed for a long time Bitcoin (BTC Nakamoto 2008) is the first decentralized ledger system with broad consensus and application Its revolutionary emergence has made the acquisition of consensus no longer dependent on an authoritative third party ETC (ETH Wood 2014) promoted the Bitcoin system which further supports a Turing complete trading system This makes Dapps possible However to date the ETH consensus system is still Proof of work (PoW) Thus ETH requires system participants to spend a huge amount of energy to competitively solve some cryptographic hashing problems And these hashing problems alone do not bring any meaning other than PoW BTC that use similar systems consume more energy per day than some small countries Because of the use of this system ETH has a lower transaction rate (the current transaction rate is only 15 transactions per second) As a next generation blockchain system DPoS proposes and improves another consensus system with other similar systems Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Its trading system can theoretically achieve TPS of 10000 ETH is also improving its consensus algorithm to improve transaction rates Such a system if implemented will greatly improve the experience of deblocking applications based on blockchain Although the blockchain technology has made great progress the current public chain system cannot meet the needs of a complete decentralized digital asset trading and management platform For example in the game field ETH\ s NFT system (ERC721) while giving an excellent digital asset trading system is far from meeting the high transaction rate and data storage and verification demanded for games Each NFT will have its specific trading history and behavioural trajectory in a multiplayer game due to its uniqueness (for example User A uses this NFT to perform an operation at a certain time) These trajectories even give the NFT a special use case Existing platforms are not able to record these data efficiently and completely One possible solution is to record the data on the existing public chain But this will make the NFT\ s record limited by the bandwidth of the public chain and will cause high costs Another solution is to rely on current database technology But such technology is centralized and records may be tampered \xe7\xac\xac 33 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe4\xba\xa7\xe5\x93\x81\xe7\x89\xb9\xe7\x82\xb9 with This greatly affects the practicality of the NFT Therefore digital assets require a more powerful NFT trading and management system Moreover due to the large number of existing underlying public links different game developers may use different underlying public chain systems This aspect makes the liquidity and practicability of digital assets worse and on the other hand the development and testing costs of decentralized games become higher These factors make the development of game DApps slow and the public acceptance rate is low Therefore we urgently need a cross chain high speed digital asset management and trading system to solve these problems Therefore the Krypton platform has proposed a cross chain asset exchange B Cross chain Solution In the case of single chain clear/settlement consistency and atomicity (if a transaction is treated as a program it is either executed completely or not at all this feature is called atomicity) are easy to guarantee However if the assets are on different chains it is necessary to technically guarantee the cross chain consistency and atomicity of clearing settlements and provide technical support for the cross chain asset exchange of the decentralized exchanges Currently cross chain solutions can be divided into three categories (1) Notary Mechanism This is a centralized or multi signature based witness model The main feature is not to pay attention to the structure and consensus characteristics of the chain but to introduce a credible third party to act as a notary as an intermediary for cross chain operations A representative solution is Interledger (2) Sidechains/ Relays The side chain is a chain structure that anchors the original chain but it is not the fork of the original chain Instead it extracts specific information from the data stream of the original chain to form a new chain structure and the relay is a channel of cross chain interaction and communication Whether it is a side chain or a relay the role is to collect data from the original chain playing the role of the monitor The side chain and the original chain cannot directly verify the state of the square because this will form a loop but it is feasible to include only light nodes with each other The corresponding verification logic can be implemented by the chain protocol itself or the application \xe7\xac\xac 34 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe4\xba\xa7\xe5\x93\x81\xe7\x89\xb9\xe7\x82\xb9 contract In general the main chain is not aware of the presence of the side chain and the side chain must be aware of the existence of the main chain Representative solutions are btcrelay RootStock Polkadot etc (3) Hash locking It sets interoperable triggers between different chains usually a hash of the random number of the plaintext to be disclosed The hash value is equivalent to the secret code of transfer and only those who get the cipher can get the money At the same time it also constructed two Redeem contracts which require double signature and have a time limit the other party signs and they are not signed When they sign the assets are returned One of the key technical designs is that a Redeem contract for a person who makes a transfer of a hash secret code is longer than another person in time thereby protecting his rights A representative solution is the Bitcoin Lightning Network Among the above three designs 1 and 3 don\ t require building a new blockchain and directly expand functions in the original chain to achieve cross chain capability The design of 2 realizes asset transfer across chains so that assets are aggregated into the same book to facilitate trading The first one has to be used as a notary by a third party which deviates from the purpose of decentralization of the blockchain The second solution requires building a new blockchain to realize the technology It is rather cumbersome In contrast option 3 does not require building a new blockchain and can be extended directly in the original chain to achieve cross chain capability \xe7\xac\xac 35 \xe9\xa1\xb5

uniqueness feature extends digital assets to a higher dimension The digital assets such as rare props best equipment pets and fashion in the game perfectly meet the conditions for becoming an NFT The NFT of game items truly gives asset ownership to the player and the NFT will exist and circulate independently separated from the game\ s and cross game assets become a reality which will be an extremely important step for the blockchain to promote the development of the game We have fine tuned the equipment NFT in Krypton Knight and formed a complete solution for third party developers In addition to ensuring the functionality of the traditional decentralized ledger system the goal of Krypton is to provide a complete high speed decentralized digital asset trading and management platform The digital asset of the planet\ s core is a new generation of non fungible token NFT+ NFT+ will provide a powerful big data entry access and management interface based on the original NFT The NFT+ token system is a three layer blockchain structure The bottom layer is based on existing public chain technologies such as the Ethereum or EOS system These public chain systems provide a decentralized value certification system The second layer is based on the cross chain NFT+ trading and management system of Krypton On the second level Krypton not only provides a high speed and low cost NFT+ decentralized ledger system but also provides a free NFT+ cross chain transfer system For example the user can transfer NFT+ to any public chain This will greatly facilitate developers and game users The third layer is an NFT+ big data access and management system On the third level Krypton will provide a decentralized NFT+ log system For each NFT+ token users can get their complete non tamperable behaviour data on the third level This platform will provide a complete ecosystem guarantee for the Krypton based games Next we introduce the NFT+ system and the structure of the layers of Krypton \xe7\xac\xac 36 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe4\xba\xa7\xe5\x93\x81\xe7\x89\xb9\xe7\x82\xb9 NFT+ is the core digital asset system of Krypton It provides a more powerful data storage and verification interface than traditional NFTs It is therefore more suitable for digital asset certification and management of games and similar systems To better introduce NFT+ we first introduce the traditional NFT system which is the token system based on the ERC721 protocol on Ethereum Unlike traditional tokens each NFT has a uniquely identifiable ID and is not subdivided For example the famous CryptoKitties each cat is a non subdividable NFT With the ERC721 protocol owners can freely trade NFT Since every item in life can be regarded as non fungible (i e unique) the NFT corresponding to the ERC721 has a wide range of application scenarios However the existing ERC721 protocol still cannot meet the management and application of many digital assets The main problem is lack of a unified data storage and verification interface and physical interface In a game or some other application scenario the NFT usually corresponds to the items in the game These items usually have certain features in the game For example weapons are lethal shields have defensive functions and some items even require multiple people to participate in order to function The usage of each item will generate corresponding data Compared to transaction data these behavioural data usually do not involve the ownership of the NFT and thus require less consensus It should not be stored on high cost public chains But these data form part of the function of the NFT For example the reason why an item is collectible is because a celebrity uses it to complete a certain task Therefore these data need to be stored and need to have authentication mechanism Other solutions may have to store this data in a centralized database This aspect makes the data easy to lose and tamper with on the other hand it does not have the authenticity of the authentication function \xe7\xac\xac 37 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83\xe7\xa4\xbe\xe5\x8c\xba\xe4\xbb\x8b\xe7\xbb\x8d On the other hand an important application scenario of the NFT is to correspond to actual objects For example an NFT can correspond to real estate cars and other products However the existing NFT has a problem of being out of touch with actual items For example trading a car in real life does not mean that it has been recorded on chain accordingly Trading items that require both online and offline operations will affect the NFT experience and functionality The underlying cause is due to the fact that there is no tamper proof authentication system in direct contact with NFT NFT+ is an improved version of NFT designed to address data storage and verification and physical linking issues The NFT+ solution is the concept of introducing a private key in ERC721 In addition to a unique ID each NFT+ pass corresponds to a public key private key pair NFT+ requires a private key signature to complete the transaction at the time of the transaction or transfer Each NFT+ data needs to be signed with its private key before being stored In this way its role has three aspects (1) The NFT+ public key can be used to verify the legitimacy of its ancillary data thus preventing data tampering (2) The private key of NFT+ can be regarded as the proof of ownership of another layer This private key merges with the owner\ s wallet to create a richer application scenario For example the owner of NFT+ can lease NFT+ During the lease period the NFT+ Pass will behave as a traditional NFT At the end of the lease period the private key owner can redeem the asset at any time (3) The private key of NFT+ can be determined by the real object For example future electronic products or actual licenses will be embedded with an integrated circuit that generates signatures but does not reveal private keys Trading is required when the transaction requires physical participation This solves the problem of NFT and physical disconnection \xe7\xac\xac 38 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83 Token \xe7\xbb\x8f\xe6\xb5\x8e b Technical Solution Achievements of game items Recharge method First the user recharges the main contract and transfers his NFT to an NFT agent The user needs to provide corresponding identity information which is determined by the agent The game centre server monitors the winding transaction and the game service provider obtains a recharge from a certain user Therefore an item will be added to the user on the central server withdrawal method The user first applies for a signature to the game server and the signature includes the amount to be withdrawn and the destination wallet address Then the user takes the signature obtained in the previous step and calls the API on the chain The chain contract verifies the legality of the signature After the verification is successful an NFT is transferred to the corresponding wallet address of an NFT agent

traditional game can also use the ERC721 protocol to tokenize the player\ s rare items to ensure the transferability and transparency of the assets Developers can also take advantage of the natural tradability of assets to enrich the gameplay Krypton has provided three different solutions for the asset winding of traditional games for different needs a One way asset reference The game server unidirectionally references the data on the chain monitor the transaction modification on the chain and synchronously modifies the mirrored data in the server Krypton provides event monitoring and notification APIs to easily inform the changes in the data in the application chain b Two way asset reference In addition to synchronizing the data on the chain the game server also needs to modify the chain data For example in a game of battle winner A wins the equipment of loser player B Krypton provides a proxy contract to host the user\ s property and user A user B and platform C need to sign the contract before starting a match After the game is over the three parties sign the results of the game (A obtains the equipment of B) and only two or more signatures can take effect c Logic on chain Applications can use smart contract to fully disclose their key logic such as equipment drop rate activity reward distribution and publish source code to the Krypton Any user can see the source code and call the corresponding interface to query the contract data which increases the player\ s trust \xe7\xac\xac 40 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe6\xb0\xaa\xe6\x98\x9f\xe7\x90\x83 Token

Token for ecosystem Mining Plan Total Mining Target 51% of the total KGC will be mined 1 53 billion Mining Timing Up to 10 years up to 300 million of KGC each year with no limit for minimum amount if the mined KGC doesn\ t reach the mining target amount the unmined tokens will be locked up and not issued KGC also provides the economic incentives which will be consumed to encourage participants to contribute and maintain the ecosystem on Krypton Computational resources are required for maintaining the Krypton thus providers of these resources would require payment for the consumption of these resources (i e mining on Krypton) and KGC will be used as the medium of exchange to quantify and pay the costs of the consumed computational resources KGC is an integral and indispensable part of Krypton because without KGC there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on Krypton Users of Krypton and/or holders of KGC which did not actively participate will not receive any KGC incentives (1) Mining Methods Method 1 lock other public chain tokens to mine KGC \xe7\xac\xac 44 \xe9\xa1\xb5

chain tokens and KGC until expiration Miners can ultimately get back all public chain tokens staked together with n% of public chain tokens (in KGC) as payment for their efforts First period n%=10% Following Periods n%=10%/(purchased amount of KGC pool/ total amount of KGC pool of last period) Attention Users has to claim the KGC mining incentives manually each hour if the rewards hasn\ t been claimed in 24 hours the token incentives awarded will be forfeited e g if buying 1 ETH of KGC pool on Ethereum Planet 1 ETH = 2000 RMB and 1 KGC = 0 05 RMB then the total amount of KGC allocated for mining incentives will be 2000*1*10%/0 05 = 4000 Every hour 1/24/365=0 000114 ETH and 4000/24/365=0 456621 KGC will be available to be distributed to miners in proportion to the actual work performed

of the name and trademark of any other company or organization other than Krypton Foundation LTD and Planet Earth does not mean that any party has an association or endorsement with it for the purpose of explaining the relevant content Note related to KGC KGC is the Cryptocurrency of Krypton KGC is not a virtual currency KGC cannot exchange items services and transactions on the exchange during the period of this document nor can it be used outside of Krypton KGC is not an investment vehicle no one can guarantee it will appreciate or depreciate in value and there is no reason to believe that the KGC you hold will definitely appreciate and there may even be a risk of depreciation KGC is not a proof of ownership or control holding KGC is not a grant of ownership to the holder and the equity of Krypton Foundation LTD and Krypton Games nor is it granted direct control or any decision making for Krypton Foundation LTD and Krypton Games Risk warnings related to KGC You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing KGC holding KGC and using KGC for participation in Krypton In the worst scenario this could lead to the loss of all or part of the KGC which had been purchased IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE KGC YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS \xe7\xac\xac 52 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\x9b\xa2\xe9\x98\x9f\xe5\x8f\x8a\xe9\xa1\xbe\xe9\x97\xae Risk due to user\ s personal wrong behaviour 1) Risk due to loss of private key Before KGC is assigned to the participant the participant will get the public key account associated with KGC The KGC public key account can be entered through the private key randomly assigned by the participant Krypton doesn\ t have access to any private keys It is possible to lose KGC in the associated public key account It is recommended to practice how to operate so that participants can safely back up the private key on multiple local devices preferably in a non network environment 2) Risk of disclosure of a private key to a third party Any third party individual or organization may process the KGC of its corresponding account after obtaining the private key of the participant\ s public key account Participants are advised to protect the relevant equipment to prevent unauthorized login and reduce the risk 3) Risks that may arise due to participation in the voting KGC holders are likely to cause KGC to be lost due to malicious or irresponsible voting behaviour in the voting Risks associated with network security during the use of KGC 1) Based on the related risks brought by the Ethereum network Krypton Foundation LTD will issue ERC20 tokens based on the Ethereum platform in the initial stage Any faults and unknown functions on the Ethereum platform may cause KGC to be unknown What you don\ t want to happen Ethereum and local unit accounts based on the Ethereum platform may lose any value like KGC For more information about the Ethereum platform see www ethereum org 2) Risk of illegal intrusion from a malicious third party A malicious third party such as a hacker other team or agency may attempt to interfere with the development of the planet which may be but is not limited to the following DDOS Sybil spoofing smurfing or Attacks based on consensus mechanisms etc \xe7\xac\xac 53 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\x9b\xa2\xe9\x98\x9f\xe5\x8f\x8a\xe9\xa1\xbe\xe9\x97\xae 3) Due to the risk of infrastructure software security vulnerabilities in the planet This network system is an open source system Krypton Foundation LTD employees or other third party organizations intentionally or unintentionally introduce bugs into the network core system which leads to KGC risks and losses 4) Major technological breakthroughs in the field of cryptography will become the risk of hidden weaknesses being exploited Cryptography is an important part of blockchain technology and advances in cryptography or other high tech technologies may cause KGC to be at risk of being stolen or lost 5) Risk of Krypton failure As a relatively high tech system Krypton may cause network failures that are unacceptable or unexpected and may also cause the risk of KGC to disappear or other risks that may cause fluctuations in the market 6) The planet may be at risk of being attacked because of its high value For many decentralized cryptographic tokens and virtual currency the KGC generated by the blockchain technology of the planet has the potential to be attacked by mining These include but are not limited to double attacks large mine attacks selfish mining attacks and competitive conditions attacks Unexpected and new mining attacks may occur posing a huge risk to the operation of the planet Risk due to market uncertainty 1) There is a risk of low adoption and/or small number of users of Krypton or its related planets If the Krypton platform or the generated planets are not used by more commercial personal or other institutions it will not generate more public attention and its development The use of a small number of people may limit or reduce the utility functions of KGC 2) KGC is at risk of insufficient liquidity caused by the exchange At present KGC has not yet traded on the exchange If the exchange is open after trading it is likely that there will be less understanding of various laws and regulations because the exchange is relatively new New exchanges are prone to fraud and failure compared to exchanges that have been established for a long time and have good trading with other mature virtual tokens Exchange problems can cause a large portion of KGC transactions to be subject to fraud or other operational risk issues which can lead to a reduction in the value and liquidity of KGC \xe7\xac\xac 54 \xe9\xa1\xb5 \x0c\xe5\x9b\xa2\xe9\x98\x9f\xe5\x8f\x8a\xe9\xa1\xbe\xe9\x97\xae 3) Participants are not at risk of insurance in the face of losses KGC\ s public key accounts are not the same as bank accounts other financial institution accounts or other social service accounts and Krypton Foundation LTD does not usually purchase insurance for network systems When KGC is lost or the planet is lost no insurance institution can provide claims to KGC holders 4) The risk of the dissolution of Krypton There are various factors involved in Krypton such as the bitcoin the value of Ethereum the failure of commercial operations or the claim for intellectual property rights Krypton may not be able to continue operations resulting in failure unsuccessful releases or team disbandment 5) Risks of regulatory policies in the jurisdictions or administrations of relevant regions and countries Blockchain technology is currently supported or recognized worldwide but has also been carefully reviewed by various regulatory agencies The functions of Krypton and KGC may be affected by some regulatory policies including but not limited to restrictions on use or digital currencies like KGC which may hinder or limit the development of the planet It is impossible to predict how when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications including KGC and/or Krypton The Foundation the Distributor (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies a cautious approach will be applied towards the sale of KGC Therefore for the token sale the sale strategy may be constantly adjusted in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible For the token sale the Foundation and the Distributor are working with Tzedek Law LLC a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain space 6) Other unknown risks Blockchain technology and corresponding digital currency technologies are relatively new and unproven technologies and there may be more unpredictable risks and risks may appear in more ways This document may be modified or replaced at any time however we
