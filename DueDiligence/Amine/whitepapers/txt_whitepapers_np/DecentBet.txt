 CONTRACTS ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN THAT RETURNS 100% OF PROFITS TO
 THE DBET HOUSE CREDIT HOLDERS 
 VERSION 0 5 2
 ABSTRACT
 Decent bet is a transparent smart contract based sports betting platform and
 online casino Employing the Ethereum blockchain based smart contracts 
 Decent bet is aiming for mass adoption Unlike other decentralized gambling
 platforms which primarily use Ether and Bitcoin for transactions Decent bet
 makes use of specialized ERC20 tokens – DBETs to facilitate bets on the platform
 as well as buy credits in the house known as DBET house credits This opens up
 numerous possibilities such as community owned houses white label solutions and
 more 
 The Decent bet sports betting platform will make use of a trusted setup wherein
 the Decent bet addresses will provide betting lines and outcomes All transactions
 will be transparent and verifiable on the blockchain This transparency will make
 it impossible for malicious or predatory activity to take place from the outset All
 payouts credit distributions lottery winnings house buy ins would be completely
 decentralized and determined on chain 
 A whole host of gambling based casino games will also be available on the
 Decent bet platform – making use of off chain state channels that are finally
 verifiable on chain The speed and scalability would combine the user experience
 of a high end gambling platform while bringing the transparency and auditability
 of the blockchain 
 This paper discusses the functioning of the Decent bet user owned house model 
 state channel based casino games white label solutions decentralized houses and
 business prospects for the platform

 2 0 INTRODUCTION
 2 1 About Decent bet
 Decent bet is a transparent profit sharing sportsbook and gambling platform employing
 decentralized Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain 
 Decent bet aims to provide a long term solution to allow users from around the world
 to establish credit in the houses DBET house credits that provide sports betting and
 gambling games while leveraging the blockchain to provide transparency verifiability
 and constant uptime unlike other regular online casinos This platform structure allows
 users to generate returns with minimal interaction while allowing houses on the
 Decent bet platform to operate and payout DBET house credit returns in a transparent
 and honest manner 
 Decent bet will start out with a single house operated by the Decent bet platform and
 in due time open doors to traditional casino operators to establish houses on the
 platform This essentially allows traditional casino operators to leverage blockchain
 technology to provide the next generation of gambling games and sports betting to their
 existing user base 
 2 2 Problems and Solutions
 Problem High profit generating gambling platforms owned by a single group/entity
 with limited transparency running on dated technology stacks 
 Traditional online casinos/sports betting platforms available in the current market work
 in a completely centralized manner and operating profits are distributed between
 selected individual(s)/group(s) 
 Although this may not pose as much of a problem at the moment with the coming shift
 from centralization and tightly controlled models to a decentralized future the current
 model has a high risk of being outdated in the coming years Decent bet’s vision aims
 Page 5 of 29
 to make full use of the opportunity that presents itself with the upcoming shift to
 decentralization – where DBET house credit holders will have a say in how the platform
 moves forward with a decentralized governance model receive profits generated by
 the platform for each session and even get to contribute to democratically selected
 charitable causes 
 With the current push for disruptive blockchain based solutions among all industries
 and the obvious fit for gambling based solutions there are a few platforms that have
 been conceptualized and at times have even been implemented over the last year 
 However regardless of what stage existing platforms are at this point in time there are
 a few fundamental issues that do exist with a majority of them 
 Problem Blockchain based casinos providing slow costly blockchain dependent
 games without layer 2 solutions sports betting platforms in their infancy/concept
 stages and profit sharing gambling platforms with a single house model 
 Platforms that have been built on the Ethereum Blockchain face the same problems
 that all decentralized platforms built on Ethereum face right now Games that are
 traditionally played at a quick pace are slowed down due to the slow block times for
 RNG and transactions on the blockchain in general Although this would not be a
 problem in the future with the scheduled upgrades to the Ethereum network that will
 greatly improve its capacity games right now are painfully slow and don’t replicate any
 regular online casino in terms of speed and experience This poses a significant
 roadblock in convincing the masses to switch to a blockchain based platform 
 Decent bet being based on Ethereum blockchain faces the same problem at the
 moment as these platforms but it looks to tackle it by using off chain state channels
 for RNG and game moves after channel creation This greatly improves the speed of
 games and offers the experience of any other high end online casino to the end user
 while being finally verifiable on chain State channels also lead to greatly reduced gas
 costs since transactions do not happen on chain 
 Sports betting platforms on the other hand pose a different problem in achieving
 Page 6 of 29
 consensus on events The task although seemingly straightforward turns out to be a
 complex action to implement whilst keeping methods of gaming the system to a low
 and reducing malicious entities from pushing the wrong outcomes to the network 
 Keeping a 50% majority consensus could lead a single entity/group to simply purchase
 50% of tokens in the network and push the wrong results 
 Increasing the consensus requirement to say 75% could lead malicious parties to
 constantly hold 26% or more of tokens in the network and push incorrect outcomes
 making it impossible to reach a 75% consensus 
 The decentralized crowdsourced outcome reporting problem is definitely a hard one to
 tackle and one which currently has two platforms actively working on solving it– Augur
 and Gnosis They still have ways to go before being ready for use at this point in time 
 However in the future APIs provided by the two platforms would be a great resource
 for betting platforms to link with and provide accurate outcomes in a decentralized
 manner 
 For now Decent bet looks to tackle this overarching issue by providing centralized
 oracles for each house on the platform The blockchain helps provide the transparency
 and verifiability to make sure the houses do not try to cheat players by pushing incorrect
 results to the platform With multiple houses that spring up on the platform users would
 have a variety of different outcome and line providers to choose from This also opens
 doors to bringing in traditional sports betting platforms to adopt the technology provided
 by the Decent bet platform and in turn increase the platform s user base as a whole 
 Apart from the two problems mentioned above platforms that do have profit sharing
 models at the moment seem to offer it in a closed manner – with a single house splitting
 profits of their offered games among users holding a dividend sharing token This may
 not be a problem in itself however for long term expansion of a platform Decent bet
 looks to bring in the multiple house model with white labelled houses which will allow
 for providers/casino operators to start their own house and have their own profit sharing
 mechanisms 
 Page 7 of 29
 Decent bet allows users to buy DBET house credits which will allow them to collect
 session returns and participate in the success of the platform in a very unique and
 advantageous manner Initially the sportsbook will make use of lines and outcomes
 supplied by addresses owned by Decent bet 
 The ERC 20 standard token provided by Decent bet will be used for all purposes within
 the platform unlike other smart contract based gambling platforms that allow bets in
 Ether 
 2 3 Market Analysis
 Since the majority of the running block chain based gambling platforms have been
 implemented only within the last year there aren’t any data sources providing usage
 statistics of the emerging market as of yet However statistics for online casinos are
 available and would portray an acceptable representation of our target audience and
 future growth potential 
 (Ref #4) The market for online casinos as a whole was $35 97 billion USD in 2014 and
 is estimated to reach $66 59 billion USD by 2020 at a CAGR of 10 81% Additionally 
 the use of mobile devices for online gambling purposes is increasing with market
 growth for this industry being very geographically specific 
 More than 80 nations have legalized online gambling and Europe has the largest online
 gambling market in the world which accounts for some 47% of the entire world 
 (http //www egba eu/facts and figures/market reality) Importantly this is something
 which is just going to increase as countries like the Netherlands adopt new online
 gambling regulations which facilitate and promote growth Additionally in the Asia
 Pacific region the online gambling sector has not grown much as there has been no
 scope a fact which promotes both a disadvantage and a significant opportunity to be
 explored 
 Page 8 of 29
 Since the online gambling market allows players to use virtual money it has reduced
 the burden and risk of carrying cash as in the case of real gambling activities and since
 this can be done in the comfort of one’s home many people are now resorting to online
 gambling Something which highlights that there is greater and greater opportunity for
 this market to grow and expand in the near future as governments move to regulate
 practices and enable safe healthy growth in a market which is still in its infancy 
 2 4 Limitations
 Obtaining correct and verifiable results/outcomes for sporting events in a completely
 decentralized system would require a significantly larger engineering effort while also
 opening doors up to a number of security and integrity concerns 
 Getting to market early maximizes our potential to succeed but requires us to use
 authorized addresses to provide outcomes to the contract – which would bring an
 aspect of centralization to the platform This approach means users would have to rely
 on Decent bet to provide accurate outcomes for games all other aspects of sports
 betting – i e payouts bets created house hedges etc are all decentralized 
 transparent and verifiable – which is a large improvement over existing centralized
 online gambling platforms operating today 
 For gambling games like slots craps and roulette that rely on instant results and game
 moves to meet the user experience expectations while making sure outcomes are
 verifiable on the blockchain Decent bet makes use of state channels between the
 house and users utilizing a REST API to communicate between the user and the house 
 Current competitive implementations rely on an oracle to act as an RNG to call back
 results into a contract taking much too long in terms of user experience which
 consequently will decrease the possibility of achieving mass adoption By using state
 channels that work completely off chain and are finally verifiable on chain – we are able
 to sidestep this limitation and improve the timeliness and quality of the service 
 Page 9 of 29
 However with the planned updates to the Ethereum blockchain such as sharding 
 which would increase Ethereum’s capacity in terms of transactions per second –
 Decent bet will eventually restructure all gambling game contracts to work based on
 completely on chain solutions 
 Page 10 of 29
 3 0 DBETS
 Decent bet uses its own ERC 20 standard token DBETs for all transactions on the
 platform Unlike other platforms in the space that make use of Ether and Bitcoin for
 gambling DBETs are used for gambling along with other use cases such as purchasing
 DBET house credits buying out custom houses purchasing lottery tickets and more 
 Ether will only be accepted by the Decent bet contracts at the time of the ICO and will
 be used to fund and run the platform for the foreseeable future 
 Page 11 of 29
 4 0 THE HOUSE
 Unlike traditional centralized casinos and online gambling platforms Decent bet offers
 a transparent house that its users can participate in 
 4 1 DBET House Credits
 The house allows users to purchase DBET house credits at the start of every session
 which are composed of three month periods Session 0 will begin with a house credit
 buying period for every user during which no profit distribution will take place From
 Session 1 onwards users will be able to redeem profits for their house credits at the
 end of every session with the distribution of profit being based on the proportionality of
 house credits that they have held in comparison to the total house credits bought out
 from the house 100% of all house profits will be distributed among house credit holders
 of which 5% is to be reserved for a winning DBET house credit holder lottery 
 4 2 Obtaining DBET House Credits
 All DBET house credits are purchasable using DBETs and are locked up for the entire
 session before they can be redeemed for profits or rolled over to the next session 
 4 3 DBET House Credits Exchange
 For liquidation purposes Decent bet will offer a decentralized DBET house credits
 exchange which allows users to trade their house credits for DBETs at any time during
 the initial 11 weeks of a session In the event a user has any house credits in active
 orders within the exchange during the profit distribution period the house credits would
 be automatically liquidated when users claim their portion of the profit distribution 
 Page 12 of 29
 5 0 SPORTS BETTING
 The initial offering at launch by Decent bet is a sport betting platform with multiple
 sports offerings such as Baseball American Football Basketball Ice Hockey Tennis 
 Soccer and more 
 All games bets and outcomes on the platform will be saved on Smart Contracts 
 However since there are issues with creating a completely decentralized sports betting
 platform in terms of having the right outcomes pushed to the contract and reducing the
 possibilities of different attacks and methods to game the system Decent bet will be
 pushing the games and outcomes onto the contract using trusted addresses Although
 this brings in an aspect of centralization to the platform all games odds and outcomes
 being pushed in would be transparent and verifiable on the blockchain Users would be
 able to immediately view incorrect outcomes on the blockchain and report them if any
 such occurrences were to happen 
 5 1 Decent bet API
 The Decent bet API will be used primarily to retrieve sports betting metadata The API
 will deliver metadata required by the front end such as team names league names 
 event names etc without bloating the smart contract with data that does not require
 decentralization and also helping to reduce gas fees Games on the Smart Contracts
 would be identifiable by their IDs 
 5 2 Results & Verification
 All odds and outcomes obtained by the Decent bet backend come from multiple sports
 betting feeds and line providers This approach reduces the chances of error while
 pushing odds and outcomes to the contract To verify any of the results users will be
 able to view the outcomes straight from the Decent bet front end or it s API and verifies
 the results pushed into the smart contract manually on the Ethereum blockchain If any
 outcome is found to be in error users would be able to call for a correction and receive
 a refund 
 Page 13 of 29
 6 0 CASINO
 In addition to the sports betting platform that will be available on launch Decent bet will
 launch a decentralized casino based on smart contracts and state channels Slots will
 be available at launch and will be followed by a series of other casino games such as
 craps roulette etc which will be developed in line with our vision of mass adoption 
 6 1 State Channels
 With the current state of the Ethereum blockchain – relying on an on chain oracle
 connected to a trusted source to act as an RNG i e random org or WolframAlpha 
 users have to wait for a callback from a query which could take a minute or more due
 to being on chain Furthermore Ethereum’s current limitations in terms of transactions
 per second dramatically disrupt the user experience by creating these delays which in
 turn would disenfranchise a large portion of our target potential users traditional online
 gamblers who are unaware of how blockchain gambling works 
 This led the Decent bet team to use an alternative method to act as an RNG and settling
 games on chain between the house and the user – state channels State channels
 make use of the blockchain to initially deposit funds into the channel contract for both
 house and player before making the game available to play for the player off chain
 using a turn based system The user and house exchange details for a turn using
 signed messages which enable final verification on chain 
 *** IMPLEMENTATION INFO TO BE PROVIDED IN FINAL VERSION ***
 On the front end all users viewing closed channels would be able to reconstruct the
 RNG sequence for all their games and verify validity The advantage of using this
 system is the speed at which games could be played and its scalability in comparison
 to a completely on chain solution with the current state of the Ethereum network With
 transactions only happening at the start and end of a channel contract rather than for
 every move – users would save significantly in gas fees which would otherwise cost a
 significant amount of Ether over time 
 Page 14 of 29
 With future updates that have been proposed to Ethereum such as Casper and
 sharding – Ethereum would have the capacity to process a magnitude of times larger
 amount of transactions per second (~15 tx/sec currently to over 10 000+ tx/sec – Ref
 #3) This would enable Decent bet to eventually switch to a completely decentralized
 solution for its casino games whenever the proposed updates are ready 
 6 2 Slots
 Slot machines provide more profit for casinos than any other type of game According
 to 2016 data slot machines accounted for more revenue than all other casino games
 combined with penny slots making up the most revenue 
 For example an April to September 2016 Nevada Gaming Control Board Gaming
 Revenue Report (ref) shows that the “total gaming win” (the casino’s win) from slots
 was $7 066 306 000 USD (about $7 billion USD) in total and the total table games win
 was $4 094 401 000 USD (about $4 billion USD) Even with sports gaming added in at
 $19 236 000 USD (about $19 2 million USD) no casino game revenue even gets close
 to slots (Ref #1)
 Slots on the Decent bet platform will have the advantage of being verifiable and
 transparent while being hosted on decentralized smart contracts 
 The slots contract will allow users to create channels between them and the house for
 initial deposits and final settlements All game moves will be processed using a simple
 two way communication over a REST API at the time of launch 
 Eventually with a stable release of Whisper (Ref #2) Decent would switch to using the
 Whisper protocol for complete decentralized communication for its state channels 
 *** IMPLEMENTATION INFO TO BE PROVIDED IN FINAL***
 6 3 Mechanics
 Page 15 of 29
 At launch Decent bet will offer multi line slot machines consisting of 5 reels and up to
 5 lines 
 Bet sizes for each slot spin would be multiplied by the number of lines the player would
 like to play For example if a user would like to spin with a bet size of 10 DBETs while
 playing 5 lines the user would have to bet 50 DBETs while increasing chances of a
 payout using more lines 
 Payouts are based on left to right symbol repetitions for each line starting from 3x
 symbol repetitions to 5x 
 The payout distribution is listed below for winning combinations of different symbols for
 each line Each symbol is denoted by an alphabet – which would be substituted by their
 respective symbols in the actual game 
 3xA – 10 4xA 20 5xA 30
 3xB – 20 4xB 40 5xB 60
 3xC – 40 4xC 80 5xC 120
 3xD – 50 4xD 100 5xD 150
 3xE – 75 4xE 150 5xE 225
 3xF – 150 4xF 300 5xF 450
 3xG – 300 4xG 600 5xG 900
 Slots will consist of 5 reels containing 7 different symbols each with varying frequencies
 giving multiple winning combinations at different probabilities The frequency
 distribution for each symbol in each reel is given below 
 S R1 R2 R3 R4 R5
 A 4 4 7 6 7
 B 5 4 4 6 4
 C 4 6 2 3 3
 D 2 2 4 1 3
 E 4 2 2 2 1
 F 1 2 1 2 2
 G 1 1 1 1 1
 This gives us a distribution of 21 symbols for each reel 
 Page 16 of 29
 The total number of different combinations would now be 21^5 or 4 084 101 different
 combinations Based on the reels distribution listed above the probability of a winning
 combination would be 9 433165%
 Returns to users based on different winning combinations based on the reels
 distribution and payouts mentioned above would be around 93 08291% 
 100% of the profits generated would be distributed among holders of DBET House
 Credits as part of each session profit distributions As stated in 4 1 the 5% balance is
 reserved for a single lottery drawing The game itself will create the experience of
 actually playing the slots in a casino and would be playable across multiple screen
 sizes We believe that mobile support will go a long way to increase adoption and user
 retention 
 6 4 Craps
 Craps will be the second casino game on the Decent bet platform The game will be
 offered with one table per player due to the user experience issues that would arise on
 a game with multiple players being required to push transactions into a smart contract 
 The craps game will be user friendly and in line with our vision to create a platform that
 is both transparent and provides a responsive user experience that will go a long way
 towards increasing adoption 
 Craps will also make use of state channels with pre determined random numbers
 making use of blended seeds and their hashes Users will always play against the
 house and will be able to choose between pass and don’t pass lines to start before
 rolling their die 
 Once the die is rolled on the front end a random number is generated based on the
 turn and its respective blended seed It then checks for the following conditions for a
 pass line bet 
 Page 17 of 29
 1 If the sum of the die is 7 or 11 the user wins the game If the sum of the die is 2 3
 or 12 the house wins the game 
 2 If the above conditions aren’t met the previously retrieved sum is now set as the
 “point” Now the user and the house gets to roll repeatedly until either the point or a 7
 comes up If the point comes up first the user wins If a 7 comes up first the house
 wins 
 3 All user winnings are double of the amount that was bet 
 For don’t pass line bets the conditions are swapped between the user and house 
 As with other Casino games on the platform 100% of the profits generated would be
 distributed among holders of DBET House Credits as part of each session profit
 distributions 
 6 5 Other Games
 Over time other casino games will be added on to the platform based on user
 demand in the form of smart contracts and state channels while making use of
 DBETs for all transactions 
 Page 18 of 29
 7 0 WINNINGS PAYOUTS & PROFIT DISTRIBUTION
 On the Decent bet platform users will be able to buy DBET house credits for each
 session a 3 month period At the beginning of session 0 or the final week of any other
 session users will be able to buy in to the house by using DBETs to purchase DBET
 house credits This essentially locks users’ DBETs into the house and allows it to be
 redeemed only at the end of a session along with profits 
 DBET house credits will also be exchanged on the DBET house exchange in the future
 for DBETs anytime during a session thereby providing liquidity DBET house credits
 can also be rolled over to the next session in the final week of the current session 
 locking in a users’ DBETs for another session while allowing them to redeem profits 
 Since smart contracts cannot automatically liquidate all DBET house credit holder’s
 due to its nature at the beginning of every session following S1 DBET house credit
 holder’s will have to manually exchange their house credits to redeem their payouts 
 All DBET house credit holders will be notified through the front end and via e mail
 before each house credit buying period and at the beginning of every profit distribution
 period 
 Profits for a user during each session are calculated using the following equation 
 𝐻􀝋􀝑􀝏􀝁 𝐶􀝎􀝁􀝀𝑖􀝐􀝏
 􀜶􀝋􀝐𝑎𝑙 𝐻􀝋􀝑􀝏􀝁 𝐶􀝎􀝁􀝀𝑖􀝐􀝏
 × 􁈺􀜵􀝁􀝏􀝏𝑖􀝋􀝊 𝑃􀝎􀝋􀝂𝑖􀝐􀝏􁈻
 Example if the total purchased DBET house credits equate to 10 000 000 DBET
 house credits and the session profits amount to 4 000 000 DBETs – the profits split
 between the users are 3 800 000 DBETs which is 95% of the profits Again 5% is
 reserved for the session Lottery 
 In this scenario if a user had purchased 20 000 DBET house credits he/she would
 Page 19 of 29
 be entitled to redeem
 􀬶􀬴 􀬴􀬴􀬴
 􀬵􀬴 􀬴􀬴􀬴 􀬴􀬴􀬴 × 3 800 000 for a sum of 7 600 DBETs 
 If for any reason the session profits are zero or below at the end of a session users
 would be able to liquidate their DBET house credit holders and realize a loss 
 Page 20 of 29
 8 0 LOTTERY
 Lotteries will take place at the end of every session after profit distribution takes place 
 All DBET house credit holders with a minimum of 1 000 DBETs at the end of a session
 will automatically be given an entry into the session’s lottery for every 1 000 DBETs
 they own up to a maximum of 5 entries The lottery does not require any manual
 interaction from the user 
 Lotteries work in a simple way A function is called at the beginning of a session as
 long as it hasn t been called yet The function requests a random number from
 random org between 0 and the number of DBET house credit holders present in the
 DBET house credit holders array for the previous house session 
 The address present in the DBET house credit holders array at the index denoted by
 the random number that s returned from random org will be deemed as the winner of
 the lottery 
 All winnings will be automatically transferred to the winner

 9 0 WHITE LABEL SOLUTIONS
 In line with Decent bet’s vision of a fast and flawless user experience for our blockchain
 based gambling platform it will offer white label solutions for other larger companies to
 adapt Decent bet’s platform & technology to create their own houses which utilize their
 own custom lines and feeds 
 9 1 Requirements
 All outside companies looking to utilize Decent bet for blockchain based gambling
 services will be required to hold at least 2 000 000 DBETs Vetting would take place to
 ensure their track record as well as to verify compliance with appropriate regulations in
 the jurisdiction they are based in 
 9 2 White Labelled Houses
 Outside companies that are accepted into the platform are allowed to implement their
 own custom games and line feeds through the Decent bet API Once the API
 implementation is complete separate smart contracts are created for each provider
 and users are allowed to switch between different providers from the platform 
 9 3 Initial House Buyouts
 Prior to the sale of white label houses to outside companies users will have an
 opportunity to purchase DBET house credits to the newly created houses These
 credits would have to be bought out by the companies at a pre defined rate set by the
 house credit holders For example a new house that is introduced to users has
 1 000 000 credits bought in by the users Users are now allowed to select a pre defined
 rate to sell the house to companies at Now in this case say users have selected a
 pre defined rate of 1 2x a company would have to pay 1 200 000 DBETs to all DBET
 house credit holders before being able to take control of the house This allows users
 to decide which providers they would like on the platform as well receive a financial
 incentive for doing so 
 Page 22 of 29
 10 0 MULTI PLATFORM USABILITY
 In line with Decent bet s vision of mass market blockchain backed digital casino betting
 front ends will be available across multiple platforms to increase adoption and retention
 rates Decent bet will offer both a responsive web front end as well as native mobile
 apps for both Android and iOS devices 
 With focus on games that are flexible in terms of transaction times – a significant
 limitation in Ethereum at the moment sports betting and casino games like slots and
 craps will still be able to be played with a smooth and appealing user experience 
 Page 23 of 29
 11 0 DECENT C
 Decent bet will establish a certified 501c (3) charity called Decent C for Humanity or
 Decent Charity for Humanity 10% of the profits generated by the founders DBET
 house credits will be donated to Decent C for Humanity The obligated amount shall
 not exceed $50 000 00 per session donation 
 The focus of the charity will be to provide support for humanity worldwide The
 beneficiaries of the charity will be chosen in 2 ways by the founders and by a vote
 through the community 
 Page 24 of 29
 12 0 CROWDSALE
 Decent bet will conduct a crowdsale September of 2017 offering DBET tokens to
 investors before a full launch of the platform 
 The crowdsale will be capped and 250 000 000 DBETs will be available for distribution
 during the duration of the crowdsale The crowdsale will continue until the cap is
 reached or 28 days has passed whichever comes first At the end of the crowdsale 
 any remaining tokens will be burned 
 Also the tokens distributed during the duration of the crowdsale will represent 70% of
 the total supply of coins The remaining 30% will be minted at the end of the crowdsale
 and would be allocated as follows 
 18% time locked founder’s share – withdrawable after 1 year This incentivizes the
 Decent bet team to develop the platform and remain motivated to grow token value at
 a steady rate 
 10% held by the contract that can only be used to establish the house This initial
 deposit into the house will be accounted as a contribution by the founders entitling the
 founders to the resulting DBET house credits profit 
 2% used for bounties – Bitcointalk signature campaigns Social media campaigns Blog
 posts translations and more 
 Page 25 of 29
 The distribution of Ether raised during the crowdsale will be used as follows 
 Development – 40% Will be used to hire developers to the team for smart contract 
 front end and game development to ensure Decent bet is on schedule for
 announcements on its roadmap and continues to bring in innovative ideas into the
 platform 
 Legal – 10% Licenses lawyer fees and other legal work/processes that are required
 to run a gambling platform legally 
 Marketing – 25% Bringing in users through the use of marketing campaigns
 online/physically that educate and convert regular online/traditional gamblers to users
 of the Decent bet platform 
 Operations – 25% For all other operating expenses that would be required by the
 platform to ensure day to day operations and long term growth 
 Page 26 of 29
 13 0 FUTURE POTENTIAL
 After the completion of the crowdsale based on the amount raised Decent bet will be
 setting up a larger development team looking to add as many casino games onto the
 platform as possible in line with its vision of mass adoption 
 With a vast selection of casino games that will be transparent auditable and verifiable
 using the Ethereum blockchain coupled along with a 100% profit payout to DBET house
 credit holders Decent bet will have a solid base to grow into a leading player in the
 global online casino market 
 With improvements to the current infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain Decent bet
 would also switch to a completely decentralized model for casino games as long as
 user experience would not be affected 
 From a sportsbook perspective Decent bet will be looking to add all popular sports/esports
 that cater to regions across the entire world to establish itself as the leading
 blockchain based sportsbooks globally

 14 0 RISKS INVOLVED
 14 1 Server Downtime
 With state channels Decent bet requires a mode of communication for gambling
 games to exchange data for each game move At the time of launch due to the lack of
 stable decentralized messaging protocols – Decent bet will have to make use of a
 REST API hosted on regular cloud infrastructure to act as a mode of communication to
 conduct off chain game moves between users and the house As with any solution that
 relies on a client server architecture downtime could happen due to a number of
 unforeseen circumstances 
 However with timeouts are embedded into each contract users are able to finalize and
 close channels themselves after the timeout period ensuring their funds are not held
 in limbo while the servers are unable to communicate directly with users 
 To mitigate these negative effects and keep uptime at a maximum Decent bet will
 make use of high end cloud infrastructure with multiple instances backed by load
 balancers along with DDOS protection All on chain events will also be watched by
 separate instances to ensure even if API servers are offline on chain transactions such
 as closing channels could be performed by the house Once Ethereum’s Whisper
 launches a stable release all communication between users and the house will be
 switched to use Whisper rather than the REST API 
 14 2 Trusted Data Providers
 All sports betting odds lines and outcomes on the Decent bet platform will be pushed
 by the addresses owned by Decent bet Users of the platform would have to rely on
 Decent bet to push in correct data which otherwise would lead to undesired
 consequences To prevent issues from arising in this aspect Decent bet will make use
 of data from multiple data providers and verify all data before pushing any data onPage

 chain However if any mistake does arise users would be able to report the bet call
 for a correction and receive refunds 
 In the future Decent bet will look into implementing decentralized oracles that would
 be incentivized to push the right results through a reward system with punishment for
 malicious activity 
 14 3 Ethereum Blockchain Dependence
 Since Decent bet is a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain it ultimately relies
 on the state of the Ethereum Network for its long term success Any unforeseen
 incident on the Ethereum Network could negatively affect Decent bet in terms of
 performance stability security etc 
 Additionally Decent bet will also be limited by the limitations of the Ethereum Network 
 may it be in terms of speed scale or any other factor However with the proposed
 updates that will drastically improve the state of the Ethereum Network Decent bet will
 only be set to improve in terms of offering complete decentralized/on chain solutions
 rather than relying on layer 2 solutions like state channels for fast verifiable gambling
 games
