Priewer CEDEX Co Founder Herzelia Israel ronenp@cedex com Evgeni Kif CEDEX Product Manager Kiev Ukraine evgenik@cedex com ABSTRACT Diamonds have the potential to become the next asset class This white paper addresses how CEDEX intends to bridge the gap between the current diamond ecosystem and the developing financial markets After presenting the difficulties and obstacles unique to the diamond ecosystem we will present four layers of developments and innovations marking CEDEX as the future global exchange for investment in diamonds In contrast to other commodities such as gold it is difficult to achieve uniform pricing characteristics for diamonds since they are not fungible One carat of diamonds is not equal to another carat due to many countless combinations of characteristics Furthermore the diamond market is missing liquidity While one can buy diamonds at retail it is a challenge to resell them at a reasonable market price Since diamond exchanges operate on a business to business (B2B) basis they are not relevant for traders and in fact there is no platform for reselling diamonds This white paper outlines how we aim to bridge the gap between the current diamond ecosystem and the future diamond investment market through a Diamond Digital Certificate process that will transform diamonds from a unique asset to a fungible asset with clearly defined values In addition we present a corresponding trading platform that will provide a two sided market in which traders will be able to trade and liquidate their diamond holdings We present and discuss the advantages of the CEDEX platform the mechanisms to achieve fungibility for diamond trading the process necessary to create diamond market value transparency and finally the blockchain based CEDEX

new asset class out of diamonds First diamond exchange for retail clients Market potential = US $350 billion Alpha version of the proprietary algorithm available on the site Strong team \xe2\x80\x93 proven results Financed by a publicly held company 1 INTRODUCTION Diamonds are most commonly known as precious gemstones used in the jewelry industry According to a recent report1 consumer demand for diamonds accounts for 95% while investment demand accounts for less than 5% In 2015 the value of the worldwide diamond jewelry market hit US $79 billion [13] Moreover Frost & Sullivan [19] predict a demand supply shortfall of mined diamonds that increases every year leading to a demand supply gap of 41 million carats by 2022 and 278 million carats in 2050 (approximately US $40 billion) As a result diamond prices are likely to be affected over the coming decades making them a potentially interesting investment asset Even though diamonds present an alternative investment up until now several issues have prevented their use as an investment vehicle Bain & Company [26] identify three main constraints First it is difficult to achieve uniform pricing for diamonds in contrast to other commodities such as gold since diamonds are not fungible As a result one carat of diamonds is not equal to another carat Generally diamonds are priced based on clarity color cut and carat size the \xe2\x80\x9c4Cs\xe2\x80\x9d of the diamond industry However they are also valued based on emotional factors [10][36] Different combinations of the 4Cs result in countless characteristic combinations making it difficult to establish a per carat price Second there is a lack of pricing transparency in the diamond industry due to missing industry standards and oligopoly structures Finally the diamond market lacks liquidity in that diamonds are usually a one sided market with limited to no ability to resell them at their real market price Paradoxically a surplus of liquidity also exists because the industry annually pushes diamonds worth approximately US $20 billion into the market Even though diamond trading exchanges exist they only service B2B transactions making them irrelevant for individuals or traders Two main issues have to be solved in order to allow commodity the creation of Diamond Digital Certificates First the creation of a process that transforms diamonds from a unique asset to a fungible asset with a transparent and clearly defined value Second the creation of a trading platform that provides a two sided market in which traders can liquidate and invest in diamond holdings This white paper addresses this gap by introducing CEDEX\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain based asset class trading platform for diamonds It answers the question of how to transform diamonds from a unique asset to a transparent fungible asset We also pose the following sub questions What data and market indicators must be compiled to create diamond market value transparency How can a two sided market for diamond trading be established And what are the mechanisms to achieve fungibility for diamond trading Page 5 \x0c2 CASE STUDY AND MARKET OVERVIEW Section 2 1 describes the status quo of the current diamond trading market In subsequent sections we show the innovations the CEDEX platform will bring to the market Section 2 2 gives additional background literature so readers who are new to this domain can become aware of necessary concepts terms and frameworks 2 1 STATUS QUO IN THE DIAMOND MARKET At the moment there are two main motivations for investing in precious metals such as gold silver platinum or diamonds First traders purchase such commodities to maximize yields by generating above market returns due to price appreciation Second hedge oriented traders seek a stable store of value to preserve their capital or to lower the volatility of their overall portfolios e g although polished diamonds generate less returns than other commodities they are significantly more stable [26] Interested traders who consider taking a position in diamonds have different options They can either purchase individual stones or sealed boxes of stones referred to as diamond bullions Bullions are usually filled with small stones of a defined type and can range in price Alternatively private banks may offer their clients the opportunity to invest directly in physical diamonds providing purchase services where diamonds are valuated and certified Traders may also gain exposure to prices of polished diamonds via asset management firms that buy and hold stores of physical diamonds Those firms sell shares entitling holders to a pro rata portion of the value of the diamond stores The funds typically purchase polished colorless stones weighing one to five carats Traders may alternatively buy shares of companies that operate in the diamond industry However the value of company shares does not necessarily correlate with the value of diamonds and depends on additional factors [26] It is important to note that diamond exchanges only target B2B transactions and are not relevant for individual traders Consequently it is challenging for individuals to sell diamonds at their market price This has led to the current system in which jewelry shops buy diamonds from individuals at a price point considerably below fair market value 2 2 RELATED PROJECTS USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY The CEDEX project addresses the pricing issues and the need to unlock diamonds as an investment option using blockchain technology Blockchain technology is best known for providing the foundation of the peer to peer (P2P) cryptocurrency and payment system Bitcoin [29] In recent years the blockchain concept also called the distributed ledger system has spread in popularity This has resulted in various blockchain based applications such as in the finance sector [8][24][30] in prediction markets [20][35][37] as a platform for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications [9][32] in the legal industry [31] and so on CEDEX utilizes the Ethereum [39] blockchain for its solution In addition to the underlying distributed ledger Ethereum incorporates Turing complete programming languages on the protocol layer to realize smart contract capabilities Smart contracts are \xe2\x80\x9corchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate verify and enact with computing means a negotiated agreement between consenting parties\xe2\x80\x9d [12] The latter establish binding agreements and deploy applications using such smart contracts to enable certain services and functionalities e g a P2P trading platform Several projects offer tokenization of asset classes e g Goldmint [21] OneGram [22] and Xaurum [40] which represent gold based cryptocurrency Due to the fungible nature of gold it is far easier to enable tokenization of metal based asset classes Alrosa3 is backing a project similar to Carats io together with an initial coin offering (ICO) called D1 Coin4 Everledger5 is also a diamond focused and blockchain based project that tracks defining characteristics history and ownership of diamonds to create a permanent record on the blockchain 1 http

com is to bridge the gap between the traditional diamond industry and the more innovative financial markets The platform envisions bringing together diamond holders who want to liquidate their holdings and traders looking to diversify or hedge their investment portfolio to include diamonds as an investment asset and doing so in a secure and transparent way CEDEX is built on four pillars The DEX proprietary technology blockchain technology Diamond Digital Certificate and the CEDEX Coin Diamond Digital Certificate A Diamond Smart Contract representing a diamond\xe2\x80\x99s ownership gem composite and historical trading information The DEX A proprietary algorithm that evaluates and rates the Diamond Smart Contract market price allowing \xe2\x80\x9cnon experts\xe2\x80\x9d to confidently trade in diamonds Blockchain Based Exchange A trading platform uniting Diamond Smart Contract owners and traders The CEDEX Coin A new cryptocurrency allowing traders and cryptocurrency holders to buy diamonds on the CEDEX com exchange Section 3 1 presents the way the DEX establishes transparency and standardization in diamond trading Section 3 2 discusses the Diamond Digital Certificate Section 3 3 maps the CEDEX solution in the domain of blockchain based exchanges Finally Section 3 4 outlines the CEDEX Coin 3 1 TRANSPARENCY AND STANDARDIZATION THE DEX The DEX CEDEX\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary machine learning algorithm addresses the most significant obstacles in transforming diamonds into an asset class i e lack of transparency and coherence in diamond value appraisal The DEX takes gemological data diamond financial indice data and global inventory data into consideration Utilizing the global diamond inventory data the DEX quantifies diamond prices and ranks individual diamonds and their respective prices [38] Briefly machine learning allows software applications to accurately predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed Machine learning algorithms receive input data and apply statistical analysis for predicting an output value within acceptable ranges 4 https //www d1coin io/ 5 https //www everledger io Page 7 \x0cThe DEX comprises three elements (Fig 1) The first is the gem composite expressed in percentage terms and representing a diamond\xe2\x80\x99s gemological perfection The second DEX element is the parallel composite indicating the rarity of a diamond category and the available quantity of diamonds in the relevant category The third DEX element is the indices composite giving potential traders market directions for the diamond industry Gemological Composite Ranks individual diamonds by their theoretical market value Parallel Trades Diamond Indices Fig 1 Simplification of the DEX algorithm Using the DEX traders will be able to base their investment decisions on analytical data which has not been available so far In so doing traders will be able to answer the question of which diamond represents the best value for money An alpha version of the DEX is already available on www cedex com for 0 30 0 39 0 50 0 59 0 70 0 79 1 00 1 19 Carat To maximize accuracy CEDEX is developing the DEX towards pricing additional types of diamonds The accumulated data is continuously analyzed and supplied to the pricing algorithm The DEX has the goal of pricing any certified diamond at an accuracy rate of more than 99 5% 3 2 THE DIAMOND DIGITAL CERTIFICATE A private diamond holder or dealer wishing to liquidate his or her holdings will be able to use the simple CEDEX Diamond Digital Certificate onboarding process to create a smart contract This contract represents the financial offering including the sale of a single diamond a shared investment on a high value diamond or a diamond basket sold to multiple traders (Diamond ETF) Once the request is executed the diamonds will be delivered to the custodian and validated against their GIA certificate Following approval the Diamond Smart Contract will be created and sent to the owner\xe2\x80\x99s digital wallet The diamond will remain at the custodian for safe keeping and the Diamond Smart Contract holder will have the option to either list the Diamond Smart Contract on the CEDEX Exchange or to sell directly peer to peer To ensure trust and reliability the CEDEX Exchange will only allow its users to purchase GIA certified diamonds GIA certificates are issued following grading by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) DISTRIBUTE Single Diamond Shared Investment PICK UP ist on CEDEX eer to Peer Diamond Basket (ETF) Fig 2 Three simple steps to upload a diamond/s and create a Diamond Smart Contract 1) Enter the GIA certificate (or certificates if loading a diamond basket) 2) Choose how many smart contracts to create (one for single stone sales multiple for shared investment or diamond basket) 3) List the diamond on CEDEX or sell peer to peer Order a pick up Page 8 \x0c3 3 BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY The CEDEX project uses blockchain technology to create a Diamond Digital Certificate In the first phase Diamond Smart Contracts will be issued via a simple process initiated once a diamond holder lists a stone for trading The simple interface will create a smart contract that represents the diamond\ s gemological data and additional information to allow the creation of a financial product that represents the underlying asset i e diamonds As the blockchain based CEDEX ecosystem evolves we anticipate the diamond ecosystem will adopt Diamond Smart Contracts as the new means of trading diamonds Cutting Center Gemological Lab THE NEW DIAMOND ECOSYSTEM ON BLOCKCHAIN Custodians Wholesalers Public Retail Stores iamond Smart Contract iamond Fig 3 The vision \xe2\x80\x93 the diamond ecosystem on blockchain Figure 3 shows the Blue Ocean vision of the diamond ecosystem The finished polished diamond will be sent for registration to the gemological lab After examining the diamond and issuing the grading report the lab \xe2\x80\x93 using the CEDEX open platform \xe2\x80\x93 will list the diamond to create the Diamond Smart Contract The token includes the following information GIA ID register wallet historical transactions and data necessary to create the fungibility mechanism CEDEX offers a simple Diamond Digital Certificate creation process to create a smart contract token (Diamond Smart Contract) as described in 3 2 After the Diamond Smart Contract creation the diamond will be sent to a custodian B2B digital diamond trading will commence until the stone reaches its final destination either on the CEDEX Exchange as a financial asset or until it is purchased as merchandize by the end user Once the diamond has been physically delivered to the end user the Diamond Smart Contract will be marked as delisted on the blockchain A Diamond Digital Certificate is beneficial to the entire ecosystem in many ways No additional transportation and insurance costs will occur while stones are traded within the ecosystem All transactions using the CEDEX Coin will save fiat currency transaction charges The diamond origin and all transactions will be documented on the Diamond Smart Contract The trades will be executed quickly efficiently and P2P without any third party involvement Open blockchain technology allows anyone to collect aggregate and analyze data for their own purposes and for public use thereby increasing transparency Page 9 \x0c3 4 THE CEDEX COIN The CEDEX Coin will be implemented as an ERC 20 compatible token over the public Ethereum blockchain Activity on cedex com and later on within the diamond ecosystem will be performed solely using CEDEX Coin This will make the token an integral part of the CEDEX platform and the driver of its economy Traders who want to purchase diamonds and diamond derivatives via Diamond Smart Contracts on the CEDEX platform will have to purchase CEDEX Coin to carry out their transactions Payment to and for all service providers such as the gemological labs custodian insurance and transportation will only be possible using CEDEX Coin Traders opening a short position will use CEDEX Coin to cover the collateral and borrowing fees Traders will be able to use their portfolios as collateral to receive CEDEX Coin loans Demand for CEDEX Coins will be influenced by the number of active traders using the platform The number of active users is expected to grow rapidly in the early years as the CEDEX Exchange opens new markets either by expanding its own operation or via licensing software to local entities As Fig 4 shows use of CEDEX Coin on the CEDEX Exchange will later expand to the diamond ecosystem Dealers and service providers will receive CEDEX Coins from CEDEX traders and will use the CEDEX Coins to pay for inventory and services throughout the entire diamond ecosystem to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs 4 A TWO SIDED DIAMOND TRADING MARKET All Diamond Smart Contracts as well as their trades will be stored on the blockchain thereby providing a fully transparent registry of the underlying diamonds trading history Diamond Smart Contracts will be tradable on the CEDEX trading platform or on a P2P basis allowing traders to easily participate in diamond investments The novel result will be a decentralized and fungible asset class trading platform that permits professional level investments in diamonds without requiring any expertise in diamond trading To explain how CEDEX will establish a two sided market for diamond trading Section 4 1 specifies the mechanism for uploading diamonds to the platform for subsequent trading Section 4 2 focuses on buying and selling individual diamonds Finally Section 4 3 describes the way CEDEX users may take possession of physical diamonds Page 10 \x0cInsurance Custodians Gemological Labs Secure Transport Manufacturers Fig 4 The expanding use of CEDEX Coin in the diamond ecosystem 4 1 SUPPLY SIDE SELLING DIAMONDS ON CEDEX On the supply side we have identified two main sources of supply a Diamond Dealers \xe2\x80\x93Post signing a strategic cooperation agreement with the diamond industry global leader IDEX online (see Partners section) CEDEX will be connected with all the major global diamond manufacturers b Private Diamond Holders \xe2\x80\x93 A considerable obstacle for transforming diamonds into a financial instrument is the inability for private diamond holders to resell stones fairly A retail client looking to sell back a diamond to a dealer or pawn shop usually receives a price 30 50% below fair market value Such a spread between the buying and selling price is the result of the illiquid and currently non transparent diamond market Private diamond owners hold hundreds of billions of dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of stones In 2016 alone approximately US $20 billion was purchased at retail We believe the opportunity to sell at market price will create an unprecedented flow of diamonds on to the CEDEX Exchange CEDEX use blockchain technology to create a Diamond Digital Certificate for all listed diamonds including those from private owners as illustrated in Fig 2 above 4 2 DEMAND SIDE INVESTING IN DIAMONDS With the CEDEX platform traders will be able to purchase a Diamond Smart Contract (representing a diamond) using CEDEX Coin The new asset class created by the CEDEX project will attract the following potential traders a Commodity Traders \xe2\x80\x93 Those traders currently investing in commodities such as precious metals seeking exposure to the sector or using these commodities as a hedging tool for currency or market fluctuation will be excited to discover diamonds as new asset class with low volatility and with very low correlation to the stock market b Cryptocurrency Holders \xe2\x80\x93 Cryptocurrency holders looking to reduce volatility will use the CEDEX Exchange as an opportunity to lock in and realize the value of their crypto assets Leveraging the online B2C expertise of its business partner TechFinancials Inc CEDEX will gradually expand to more markets to open this new and exciting asset class to traders looking to diversify their portfolios Page 11 \x0c4 3 DELIVERY OF DIAMONDS A trader who purchases a Diamond Smart Contract will be able to request the delivery of a physical diamond In such cases the delivery process will begin when the Diamond Smart Contract status changes to In Delivery Process and the diamond is sent to the owner Once the owner receives the diamond the Diamond Smart Contract will be marked as delisted by the smart contract Diamond Dealers Private Diamond Holders Cryptocurrency Commodity Holders Traders Fig 5 CEDEX creating a two sided market 5 CEDEX FINANCIAL OFFERINGS CEDEX is an open and transparent market place for traders to liquidate and invest in diamonds as a new financial asset class using blockchain technology and smart contracts All financial offerings are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdiction Section 5 1 explains category trading of diamonds on the CEDEX platform Section 5 2 discusses the processing of short sales with categorized diamonds Finally Section 5 3 shows an example of basket or ETF trading 5 1 CATEGORY TRADING One of the main hurdles of transforming diamonds to an asset class is the ability to create homogeneous products The CEDEX solution will combine blockchain technology and the DEX algorithm to create Category Trading The methodology assigns commonly traded diamonds to major categories based on their gemological characteristics [15] For each category CEDEX defines a benchmark Within each category the diamonds will receive a deviation score from the category benchmark which is encrypted in the Diamond Smart Contract The ability to assign a deviation to the Diamond Smart Contract is the result of the DEX algorithm Once listed a smart contract will calculate the value difference from the category based on the deviation score and allow the DEX to evaluate and rate all Diamond Smart Contracts in the same category creating a homogeneous asset class for the traders Category \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d Category \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d sorted by value 990 990 870 103% 940 100% 940 870 94% 86% Fig 6 Category trading of diamonds Page 12 \x0cFigure 6 depicts an example where three diamond holders (shown on the left side) list diamonds that are all 1 carat in size but have slightly deviating gem compositions In the center of the figure is the CEDEX trading platform which uses the DEX to calculate a 1 carat category that is a 100% gem composite The result (on the right side) shows that the DEX calculations yield a clearly justified theoretical market price per diamond that is expressed in tradeable Diamond Smart Contracts 5 2 SHARED INVESTMENT One of the most exciting and innovative trades the CEDEX platform will offer its users is the \xe2\x80\x9cShared Investment\xe2\x80\x9d option After uploading a diamond for trade a diamond holder will have the option of selling the stone as a single Diamond Smart Contract or as multiple Diamond Smart Contracts Choosing the multiple Diamond Smart Contracts option will create multiple smart contracts that represent partial ownership of the backed diamond This function will for the first time allow retail clients to invest in high valued diamonds that are usually a speculative and volatile segment of the diamond market 5 3 SHORT SALE Short selling is the well established practice of selling securities without owning them This strategy is motivated by the belief that the price of a security will drop allowing it to be bought back a lower price to generate a profit In such a case traders earn the price difference of the security minus the borrowing cost To open a short sale position [17] on the CEDEX Exchange a trader will send a short sell order that will initiate a request to locate and borrow the relevant category Once this order is approved and if the bid/ask prices match the order will be executed Short selling on CEDEX will use an automated feed from the Lending Company for the quick approval of the borrowing request When the short sale is executed the Lending Company will lend the Diamond Smart Contract to the short seller against collateral and borrowing fees The collateral and lending fees will be calculated on a daily basis Buy Short Sale Lending Company CEDEX Borrow Diamond Smart Contract Collateral + Borrowing Fee Fig 7 Opening a short sale position TRADER A PUBLIC Page 13 \x0cFig 7 shows the opening protocol of a CEDEX short sale position To the left of the figure the Lending Company lends a Diamond Smart Contract to Trader A who in return deposits collateral plus borrowing fees Once the short seller ask price is matched by the buyer bid price the trade will be executed Lending Company Buy to Close Short Sale Sale CEDEX Return Diamond Smart Contract Receive Collateral TRADER A PUBLIC Fig 8 Closing a short sale position Fig 8 To close the short position Trader A buys the same Diamond Smart Contract category on the CEDEX Exchange and returns it to the Lending Company The Lending Company returns the collateral to trader A and the transaction is completed leaving trader A with the trade margin minus the borrowing fees When the trader wants to close the short position the same diamond category is bought back on the CEDEX Exchange and returned to the lender The short seller retains the margin less the borrowing cost paid to the lender 5 4 BASKET TRADING \xe2\x80\x93 DIAMOND ETFS One of the main milestones representing the evolution of a financial asset is the creation of derivative products [16] that allow diversification and efficient market exposure Briefly a derivative product is a contract based on an underlying asset from which the former value is derived Given the anticipated rapid demand for the new diamond asset class the CEDEX platform is structured to develop financial instruments such as exchange traded fund (ETF) [33] trading ETFs are traded comparably to stocks and traditionally held assets e g commodities bonds stocks and so on Mapped onto the CEDEX system a diamond holder will be able to upload a list of GIA certificates [34] to trade multiple diamonds as one basket The CEDEX system creates multiple Diamond Smart Contracts that each represent a partial ownership of the basket This novel function is anticipated to evolve over time to complex financial products backed by diamonds such as short ETFs leveraged ETFs single category ETF baskets multi category ETF baskets rear and high value ETF baskets and more 5 5 LOANS TO TRADERS The diamonds held by the custodian on behalf of traders will be able to serve as collateral for providing loans Users will be able to get CEDEX Coin loans based on their portfolio liquidity Interest will be set according to common interest rates Such loans will be provided on selected Diamond Smart Contracts (e g loans will not be given on shared investment Smart Contracts) Once a loan is granted the Diamond Smart Contracts that are set as collateral will be marked on the smart contract and could change ownership if the lender defaults Page 14 \x0c6 THE CEDEX PLATFORM The CEDEX platform will give traders a clear view of possible financial offerings without the need for extensive knowledge about diamonds The trading platform screenshots below illustrate the methodology that will enable traders to choose either an investment range or an investment category The DEX displays diamonds listed in sequence by \xe2\x80\x9cbest value investment\xe2\x80\x9d from top to bottom The DEX rating range is represented numerically in values from 0 599 to 0 999 with the higher rating representing the most valuable investment (based on the DEX algorithm as described in Chapter 3 1) In addition the system will provide traders with financial and gemological data allowing them to gauge the investment potential in parallel to the DEX recommendation Fig 9 Screenshots of the CEDEX Exchange The buyer will choose the desired investment category The DEX the proprietary CEDEX algorithm sorts all diamonds in that category displaying the best value diamonds at the top (asking price vs market price) Page 15 \x0c7 RAPID DEPLOYMENT \xe2\x80\x93 FEASIBILITY EVALUATION We have performed a paper based feasibility evaluation that considers existing blockchain projects to explore the degree of rapid CEDEX deployment The suggestions in this section are tentative system candidates Ultimately the CEDEX ecosystem must satisfy functional and non functional requirements derived from the system presentation in earlier sections Section 8 1 briefly presents the requirements and Section 8 2 lists existing system candidates for rapid CEDEX deployment 7 1 REQUIREMENT SETS Functional requirements for the CEDEX system are as follows Identification authentication of stakeholders is essential to ensure that only credibly credentialed interaction with the diamond trading platform is possible Smart contracting capability is another functional requirement for diamond trading on the CEDEX platform Evaluation functionality must guarantee that smart contracts are developed in a sound way and are executed as intended without flaws that would lead to unintended consequences e g a wrongful diamond classification loss of tokens and so on Data storage management is also essential for the CEDEX system Mass data must be stored in a blockchain based way and there should be an additional blockchain database with an elaborate manipulation logics layer on top Non functional requirements [2][23] for the CEDEX system are discernible during development versus runtime and we have chosen a suitable subset for both Modifiability and integrality of the CEDEX system are non discernible while security interoperability high automation performance usability and flexibility are discernible during runtime Finally we consider requirements of the CEDEX architecture that are beyond the scope of this paper and future work namely scalability applicability completeness and feasibility Modifiability is non discernible and means taking changes and adaptations to the diamond trading context into account These comprise regular updates and harmonization of composed blockchain systems e g those resulting from regulatory changes Security refers to CEDEX\xe2\x80\x99s ability to not allow unauthorized usage and denial of service attempts while allowing trusted users with good reputations The sub requirements of security [1] are system availability for authorized action confidentiality and integrity Confidentiality is the absence of unauthorized disclosure of information Integrity is the absence of improper system alterations A diligent security study is important to the CEDEX system implementation and our important future work High automation is assured if the CEDEX system considers the existing blockchain based systems for an application implementation Flexibility is given when the system is built to accommodate many diverse activities during runtime including the participation of diverse partners and the exchange of diverse data Usability of the CEDEX system [4] will be achieved by taking the following sub requirements into account User interface simplicity and error avoidance assumes anticipating and preventing common stakeholder use errors during diamond trading closely related error handling supports a user with error recovery and learnability infers users can quickly master CEDEX based diamond trading 7 2 EXISTING RAPID DEPLOYMENT SYSTEMS To prevent us from re inventing the wheel we performed a study about available systems for the rapid deployment of the CEDEX system For identification an existing blockchain based system is Civic6 which currently only takes the email address and mobile phone number of users who wish to gain identified access into consideration The advantage of Civic is that users retain ownership of their identity which differs from alternative systems such as the Estonian e residency7 identification In the latter case a government entity retains identification ownership and has the 6 http //civic io/ Page 16 \x0cpower of revocation which is undesirable While the newly established Civic identification is currently still limited research shows [25] that authentication is essential to ensure an identified individual is who he or she claims to be While the current version of Civic is limited so that authentication of identification is not assured it is possible to combine Civic with other existing services such as Verify8 which automatically checks government issued documents against database systems for identity authentication For smart contracting the current standard is Ethereum [39] despite acknowledged drawbacks First proof of work (PoW) transaction validation does not scale and thus Ethereum is not feasible for most industry applications Second the Ethereum affiliated Solidity smart contract language cannot be formally verified [6] and was recently hacked9 because of security flaws This resulted in a loss of approximately US $50 million10 More scalable is a smart contract solution that uses proof of stake (PoS) [5] transaction validation and blockchain sharding [27] For example the smart contract system Qtum [11] already uses PoS successfully in its application For smart contract evaluation several existing systems with minimal capabilities are available For a limited set of insecure coding deficiencies Securify11 formally verifies Ethereum smart contracts as a beta version Securify provides an online verification example with checks for recursive calls transaction recordings unexpected Ether flows insecure coding patterns and untrusted input use in security operations Other examples for projects under development are the Embark framework12 and Populus13 Both appear immature for formal verification and evaluation The ongoing research topic of smart contract evaluation is addressed in recent scientific publications In [7] the authors explore the challenge of writing secure smart contracts A problem is that programs and pseudonymous users call third party program public methods with the consequence of insecurely combining trusted and untrusted programs Translating the smart contract code to the functional programming language F* is an option to allow for analyzing and verifying Solidity code runtime safety and functional correctness In [14] common smart contract development pitfalls are checked based on a set of heuristics stemming from empiric observations of students The occurrence of common development mistakes decreases by following best practices as the pitfall heuristics address the aspects of failures to use cryptography misaligning incentives errors in encoding the state machines and Ethereum specific mistakes such as incentive or call stack bugs For blockchain based mass data storage the so called Interplanetar File System14 (IPFS) [3] is an open source content addressable P2P distributed hypermedia protocol IPFS provides a highly performing block storage model with hyperlink addressable data sets In IPFS a single computer stores data subsets using content addressing with hash linked lists distributed across several computers Data is distributed in IPFS across several computers to develop distributed blockchain applications in addition to adding immutable permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction For managing diamond trading data BigChainDB [28] is an existing suitable system candidate that is a decentralized blockchain database with blockchain characteristics for the creation and movement of digital assets immutable trading event tracing and decentralized control Its complementary nature to other blockchain systems such as IPFS Ethereum or Qtum is important for the CEDEX system 7 http //e resident gov ee/ 8 http //www

market is valued at approximately US $60 billion a year with consumers purchasing merchandise worth US $20 billion annually Only 5% of this US $20 billion market is purchased for investment purposes There are major global forces mostly focused on the B2B or derivatives markets seeking to introduce diamonds to the finance market These include the Indian Commodity Exchange RapX\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with Bloomberg and the Singapore Diamond Investment Exchange The transformation from merchandise to financial asset class will increase investment volume substantially To evaluate the potential market size for investment diamonds we have analyzed the gold market This market has a turnover of US $700 billion with gold and gold derivative investments totaling 80% approximately or US $550 billion The remaining 20% represents jewelry and industrial use The current diamond market turnover is approximately US $90 billion with an investment value of only US $1 billion By removing the market barriers described above we believe diamonds will become the leading investment assets for traders seeking to hedge currency or get exposure to this alternative asset class This shift could potentially increase the diamond investment market from US $1 billion to US $350 billion assuming the relationship between investment turnover and jewelry and industrial use is similar to that of gold

paper explains the status quo in which the main problem hindering diamonds as a tradeable asset class is the very characteristic that the diamond industry promotes \xe2\x80\x93 each stone is unique Consequently there is a lack of transparency and liquidity on the one hand as diamonds change ownership via private transactions On the other hand there is an untapped investment market that we estimate at US $350 billion Once CEDEX is launched this investment market will start growing rapidly We have discussed our long term vision of a diamond ecosystem based on blockchain technology and shown examples of other projects that are also based on Diamond Digital Certificates and in which all means of payments are digital The market indicators for creating diamond market value transparency and coherence are established by the DEX the CEDEX machine learning algorithm that takes several factors into account These factors include diamond financial and global inventory data diamond prices and their individual rankings Currently the DEX is available for 0 3 0 5 and 1 carat round diamonds A considerable challenge has been to establish fungibility for diamonds to allow uniform trading The CEDEX platform will solve this problem by applying the DEX algorithm and creating a smart contract that represents a gemologically validated asset Consequently it is possible to apply innovative trading mechanisms employing blockchain based tokens such as category trading short selling or ETF trading to the diamond industry We stress that these mechanisms are not a complete set In the future more diamond trading mechanisms will be developed with blockchain based tDiamond Digital Certificates being the technological enabler Page 21 \x0cThe Diamond Smart Contracts will be transparently registered on the blockchain to achieve full diamond trading traceability This will allow Diamond Smart Contracts representing fungible diamonds to be traded on the CEDEX platform or P2P by professional traders in a decentralized way Consequently we will enable single diamond trading uploading diamonds for sale and also taking physical delivery by a trader in which all related events are stored on the blockchain The result will be the establishment of a two sided market for diamond trading While the deployment feasibility of the CEDEX system is positive limitations of this paper pertain to the CEDEX platform being a decentralized and distributed diamond trading platform with complex business semantics flowing across system components that must be cross component dependable and free of concurrency conflicts APPENDIX A CEDEX COIN TOKEN OFFERING The pre sale offering will be conducted over a maximum period of 10 days or or until the pre sale cap is reached The pre sale will begin on March 16th 2018 at 10 00 GMT The main sale start date will be dictated by the completion of the pre sale The main sale will commence at 10 00 GMT on the day following the close of the

the net proceeds collected in the token sale will be used as follows Up to 20% for finalizing the development of the DEX Diamond Smart Contracts and the exchange as described in the milestone section in Appendix C below Up to 45% for marketing business development and sales purposes Most of the funds will be used for marketing the exchange in different jurisdictions This will include online and offline marketing activities signing partnership relations with various business partners and signing agreements with potential partners from the diamond industry Up to 20% for regulation licenses legal and operational progress Up to 15% for working capital The expected breakdown may be altered based on the token sale outcome and project progress 20% CEDEX Development 45% Marketing & Business Development 20% Regulation 15% Working Capital Page 23 \x0cAPPENDIX C EXECUTION & BUSINESS ROAD MAP The CEDEX project was launched at the beginning of 2017 The CEDEX team has already achieved extensive business and technological milestones as illustrated in Fig 10 In October 2017 TechFinancials announced the project to the public AIM Announcement October 23 2018 Below we have detailed the four milestones that are the building blocks of the CEDEX project Q1 2017 Q3 Q4 2017 Q4 2018 Q4 2019 Market Research Diamond Smart Contract Development Launch of CEDEX Platform Geographic Expansion Technical Feasibility Assessment Marketing Strategy Token Sale Security Audits Starting \xe2\x80\x9cDEX\xe2\x80\x9d Development \xe2\x80\x9cDEX\xe2\x80\x9d Alpha Launch 1 2 3 4 5 6 Q2 2017 Q1 2018 Q2 2019 Team Set up Token Pre Sale Offering Financial Offering Expansion Business Strategy Token Sale Offering Short Sale Implementation of the Blockchain Technology CEDEX Platform Development Fig 10 CEDEX road map and milestones CEDEX Coin Will be available for Use (see section 3 4) 7 ETF Trading Leverage Products & Loans Q4 2017 MILESTONE 1 \xe2\x80\x93 THE DEX The first milestone and major achievement of the CEDEX technology and diamond teams is the creation of an alpha version of the DEX As explained in detail above the DEX is an algorithm that compiles all relevant market and technical data and creates a machine learning engine to evaluate a diamond\xe2\x80\x99s market price and rate its asking price accordingly The alpha version of the DEX is already operational on the cedex com website Q4 2018 MILESTONE 2 MVP LAUNCH (MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT) OF THE CEDEX PLATFORM The second milestone is to finish the MVP product complete the regulatory framework for launching the product in the first locale and start marketing activities in order to drive traffic to the platform The MVP will allow traders to buy sell or take physical delivery of a diamond Page 24 \x0cThe main components of the MVP product Diamond onboarding from diamond dealer\xe2\x80\x99s ERPs Customer onboarding platform Registration KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (anti money laundering) support Customer wallet management External wallet \xe2\x80\x93 allows users to use standard Etherium wallets Internal wallet \xe2\x80\x93 allows users not familiar with crypto wallets to participate in the exchange Trading arena in which customers can buy and sell Diamond Smart Contracts using CEDEX Coin Creating Diamond Smart Contracts Representing the Diamond DEX Version One in which every diamond presented on the Exchange will get a DEX score Web Trading Arena Web Mobile Trading Arena Operational Back Office system CRM Diamond Upload \xe2\x80\x93 integration with diamond ERP system Wallet Management Compliance Management Configuration Management Q2 2019 MILESTONE 3 \xe2\x80\x93 FINANCIAL OFFERING EXPANSION AND REGULATION The next step in the evolution of making diamonds a commodity is the ability to transform them from a one of a kind asset to a homogeneous asset CEDEX\xe2\x80\x99s innovative solution combines blockchain technology and the proprietary developed algorithm to create a Category Trading Category trading is the building block for future development of the asset class allowing traders to get exposure to different diamond categories short selling a category and expanding to complex derivatives As the CEDEX platform evolves we expect professional traders and financial institutions utilizing this new financial product to offer their clients exposure to their existing portfolios Such expansion of the diamond investment market will be followed by the addition of more regulation to the Exchange to secure traders and to adhere to local regulatory constraints In terms of financial offering development we plan to expand the CEDEX offering and start introducing complex derivative products such as leveraged ETFs short leveraged ETFs cross categories products high value diamonds ETFs future contracts and so on Q4 2019 MILESTONE 4 \xe2\x80\x93 GEO EXPANSION Once the CEDEX is adopted in the initial locale the exchange business roadmap is planned to expand to additional markets To allow such expansion the CEDEX will require regulatory licenses to comply with each country\ s regulatory requirements Each geographical expansion will result in additional usage and demand for CEDEX Coin as new traders receive access to the CEDEX Exchange Page 25 \x0cREFERENCES 1 Avizienis A Laprie J Randell B Landwehr C Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure

the token sale and/or the functionality of CEDEX tokens in order to comply with regulatory requirements or other governmental or business obligations Nevertheless we believe we are taking commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the token sale mechanics and issue of CEDEX tokens do not violate applicable laws and regulations We have used reasonable endeavours to approach the token sale in a responsible and sensible manner Given the legal uncertain of distributed ledger technologies businesses and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency related businesses and activities in a number of jurisdictions we have spent time and resources to consider its business approach and where it proposes to operate now and in the future It is possible that CEDEX Tokens described in this whitepaper and which are the subject of the token sale may comprise a security in your jurisdiction or the offer for sale by the Company of the Tokens in your jurisdiction may be a regulated or prohibited activity and in either of these cases the Company may be liable for the same The Company accepts no responsibility or liability to you in these or any other circumstances You are strongly advised to take independent legal advice in respect of the legality in your jurisdiction of your participation in the token sale and purchase of Tokens A private key or a combination of private keys is necessary to control and dispose of CEDEX Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault Accordingly loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing CEDEX Tokens may result in loss of such CEDEX Tokens Moreover any third party that gains access to such private key(s) including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use may be able to misappropriate your CEDEX Tokens Because CEDEX Tokens and the Network are based on the Ethereum protocol any malfunction breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or CEDEX Tokens Moreover advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing could present risks to the CEDEX Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol the CEDEX Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating CEDEX Token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks and selfish mining attacks Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the CEDEX Tokens including but not limited to accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the CEDEX Tokens in a variety of ways including but not limited to malware attacks denial of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing Furthermore because the Network is based on open source software there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Network which could negatively affect the Network and the CEDEX Tokens Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions CEDEX Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them Thus in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us to offer recourse to you The regulatory status of the CEDEX Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications including the Network and the CEDEX Tokens It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications including the Network and the CEDEX Tokens Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Network and the CEDEX Tokens in various ways including for purposes of illustration only through a determination that CEDEX Tokens are a regulated financial instrument that require registration or licensing Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction The tax characterization of CEDEX Tokens is uncertain You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing holding and utilizing CEDEX Tokens which may result in adverse tax consequences to you including without limitation withholding taxes transfer taxes value added taxes income taxes and similar taxes levies duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements It is possible that alternative networks could be established in an attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services The Network may compete with these alternative networks which could negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally Such lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential functionality of CEDEX Tokens The Network is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time Although we intend for the CEDEX Tokens and Network to follow the specifications set forth in this whitepaper and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends (subject to internal business description) we may have to make changes to the specifications of the CEDEX Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons This Page 29 \x0ccould create the risk that the CEDEX Tokens or Network as further developed and maintained may not meet your expectations at the time of purchase Furthermore despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Network it is still possible that the Network will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained which may negatively impact the Network and CEDEX Tokens It is possible that due to any number of reasons including but not limited to an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ethereum (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies) decrease in the CEDEX Tokens\xe2\x80\x99 functionality due to negative adoption of the Network the failure of commercial relationships or intellectual property ownership challenges the Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve Because CEDEX Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate affiliates all decisions involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole and absolute discretion including but not limited to decisions to discontinue the Network to create and sell more CEDEX Tokens for use in the Network or to sell or liquidate the Company These decisions could adversely affect the Network and the CEDEX Tokens you hold As the Company provides a decentralized cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients including users and applications the Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud The Services may involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity Similarly the Services may be interrupted and files may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the Company\xe2\x80\x99s Services The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the Network and therefore the future functionality of any CEDEX Tokens that you hold Cryptographic tokens such as the CEDEX Tokens are a new and untested technology In addition to the risks included herein there are other risks associated with your purchase holding and use of CEDEX Tokens including those that the Company cannot anticipate Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This whitepaper contains forward looking statements or information (collectively \xe2\x80\x9cforward looking statements\xe2\x80\x9d) that relate to our current expectations of future events In some cases these
