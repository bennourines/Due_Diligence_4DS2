under at least 2 witnesses thanks to the blockchain technology T MenaPay token holders get benefits as long as the platform gets more popular which is also encouraged by the Islamic Finance approach 4

a C a s h h a s a stable 1 US Dollar value which is warranted by the same amount of USD kept in multiple banks as fiat currency equal to the amount of MenaCash in circulation MenaCash solves one of the huge problems to use cryptocurrencies in daily life for users fluctuation The main objective of the project is to make it possible easy and secure to transfer money for each user by using the advantages of today\xe2\x80\x99s high\xe2\x80\x93end technology As you can see in the following parts it is obvious that there is a need in MENA region for a revolutionary payment system which can solve many problems that current old fashioned banking system brings such as security difficult transaction process highly expensive transaction fees MenaPay\xe2\x80\x99s products are also designed with excellent user interfaces with the local languages advanced data tools for both users and merchants to disrupt not only cash dependent payment system but also old fashioned banking tools 3 Introduction 3 1 Vision and Mission of MenaPay MenaPay aims to become the most commonly used cryptocurrency in the world [1] [2] starting from MENA region Focusing on 18 country and 441 Million people as a starting point MenaPay carries the mission of becoming the largest non bank payment solution by using blockchain technology while generating significant returns for the investors The business model that you can review in detail in this paper will create a whole new standard in crypto industry by creating an infinite \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Mining Reserve\xe2\x80\x9d by using the the majority (75%) of the revenue to buy back the MenaPay tokens from the market and fill the reserve MenaPay Token Holders will be the nucleus of a huge community to disrupt traditional banking system in MENA and will create the most advanced financial system which will cover the entire region with its Islamic compliant transparent and decentralized structure Today traditional financial system instruments such as banks credit cards debit cards and cash suffer from the lack of security slow and inconvenient ways of transaction These traditional financial institutions spend huge amounts of money and resource to prevent fraud but none of them fully succeed Blockchain is the only way to solve all these problems that current banking and payment systems have till a better technology comes out 5 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cMENA does not have a similar non \xe2\x80\x93 bank payment system while other leading players such as China already has Just like any other revolutionary dynamic technology grows with the power of people who believes in it T Developing the MenaPay Platform with community support is the futuristic way of finding the opinion leaders and securing necessary funds This futuristic way is now possible thanks to one of the last milestones of technology called \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d Since the Internet came out in 1989 blockchain is the first tech wave which shook the whole world with a similar impact It will disrupt every single business and destroy them if they do not keep pace with it Now it is time to create new structures that really belong to public not to a certain central authority 3 2 Definition of MenaPay In order to understand what MenaPay is first it is important and a priority to understand MENA 3 2 1 What is MENA The Middle East and North Africa region includes 18 countries and approximately 441M population The region officially speaks two languages 359M (81% of the region) people speak Arabic and 81M people speak Turkish [3] 93% of the region practice Islam religion [4] Figure 1 MENA Region 6 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cEven though the region looks harmonized in terms of language and religion it has an extremely fragmented structure in terms of geography politics economic power and currency Turkey plays a bridge role between the Middle East and Europe The Republic of Turkey is governed by full democracy and 99% of people practice Islam [4] It\xe2\x80\x99s the 17th largest economy globally It has a developed and broadminded banking [11] [19] and financial system while having 40 Million unbanked population The State of Fintech report says startups in MENA raised $50 million in funding in [13] 2017 a 270% percent increase on the $18 million in disclosed investments 2016 GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) region is the shining star of the Middle East GCC is formed from Saudi Arabia Kuwait the United Arab Emirates Qatar [6] Bahrain and Oman Average GDP per capita in these countries is 26 000 USD All of the Middle East is considered an oasis for digital industries Especially GCC region is the target of many global companies while they all face difficulties while entering the region Payment collection is one of the biggest challenges especially for online businesses More than 50% of the GCC region is unbanked while 84% of t h e total MENA region is unbanked GCC is a region where Islam religion is practiced in the most conservative way The fact is traditional financial institutions do not comply with Islamic practices so huge amount people prefer to use cash in everyday transaction since it is more safe way than using banking tools in terms of their beliefs That is the core reason of the high unbanked population ratio as 84% in such a rich region Poor banking systems also do not make people\ s lives easier Most of the population in the MENA region prefers cash on delivery as a primary payment method for e commerce Interest is forbidden by Islam and any payment method developed by banks are not welcomed as their major revenue stream is from interest gains Any P2P transaction should be witnessed by 2 parties in order to comply with Islamic jurisprudence to prove that there is no interest gain The nature of blockchain and the MenaPay revenue structure perfectly meets Islamic tenets T When we analyze the rest of the region we see many crowded but unstable economies Traditional financial institutions cannot provide trust to the public as they are fully controlled by the governments In some countries such as Egypt it is not possible to withdraw or make cross border transactions of foreign currency Meanwhile keeping the money in the local currency became very risky in terms of consistent devaluation There are 18 different currencies in the region which MenaPay wants to interconnect creating one common currency instead 7 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cNo Country Abbreviation of Currency Currency 1 Algeria DZD Algeria Dinars 2 Bahrain BHD Bahrain Dinars 3 Egypt EGP Egyptian Pound 4 Iraq IQD Iraqi Dinar 5 Jordan JOD Jordanian Dinar 6 Kuwait KWD Kuwaiti dinar 7 Lebanon LBP Lebanese Pound 8 Libya LYD Libyan Dinar 9 Morocco MAD Moroccan Dirham 10 Oman OMR Oman

Turkey TRY Turkish Lira 18 Qatar QAR Qatar Rial Table 1 MENA Currencies 8 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cAlong with the challenging environment the region has 49% of the total oil reserves in the world [7] Countries like Turkey and Egypt are top tourism destinations with their deep history and natural beauties UAE also became one of the top tourist destinations and one of the financial capitals in the world with their visionary government Dubai is the first city using blockchain in their government operations T Countries like UAE Turkey Qatar and Kuwait are leading the technology and innovations in the region UAE is the number one country in terms of smartphone penetration in the world [20] Digital adoption of the rich Arabic public is impressive Both Bahrain and UAE are competing to be the capital of blockchain projects by solid legal framework preparation and open minded authorities The average GDP per capita of the GCC region is 236% bigger than world average [6] [8] Other countries sometimes counted as part of MENA Including the populations of Afghanistan Armenia Azerbaijan Chad Comoros Cyprus Djibouti Eritrea Georgia Mali Niger Pakistan Somalia Sudan Palestine and Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic wide MENA region has 827M population in total 3 2 2 What is MenaPay MenaPay is the first blockchain based non bank digital payment gateway for building the biggest cashless society in the world It focuses on the MENA region primarily MenaPay allows users to transfer money within daily life in a secure fast and decentralized way MenaPay focuses on MENA as its primary market so it is fully compliant with Islamic finance rules which are very important specifically in GCC region to provide a convenient and trustable digital payment solution Users who most probably care about Islamic finance will see that blockchain technology meets the requirements of Islamic finance rules about money transactions between parties and earnings from the investments 9 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cThree major statements in Islam are highly important in the region \xe2\x80\xa2 Interest is prohibited People cannot generate profit via interest \xe2\x80\xa2 There should be at least 2 witnesses to approve any debt transaction between 2 parties \xe2\x80\xa2 Earning money via money is allowed if and only if people invest in a real working business and/or asset T On blockchain structure at least 3 parties are needed to confirm the transaction It cannot be deleted or rearranged by any individual or a central authority after a transaction has been confirmed MenaPay focuses on building a large community of consumers and merchants who prefer MenaPay as their primary method of payment for any digital business such as ecommerce and any online/offline or traditional P2P transaction for each aspect of daily life including P2P cross border transactions MenaPay can be used in various places restaurants coffee shops shopping malls gas stations vending machines shortly in every possible money transaction activity Basically MenaPay aims to be integrated in every possible industry 3 3 What is the Difference Between MenaPay Token and MenaCash The MenaPay Platform creates a token and a coin which you will see clearly and in detail through this whitepaper In the blockchain ecosystem a token represents a fungible or tradable asset or a utility on a blockchain MenaPay Token is a utility token which will be issued with a limited number of 400 million 64% (256 million) of the total tokens will be owned by the public MenaPay Token is used for mining purposes from the reserve by 2 ways getting via peer to merchant (P2M) MenaCash transaction and MenaPay token staking We apply this process via \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Mining\xe2\x80\x9d MenaPay token holders have the option of staking their tokens and earn tokens according to the amount of staked MenaPay tokens and the time they keep in their wallet MenaPay will be able to be purchased (buy back) from exchanges after the IEO to fill the Green Mining reserve During the IEO period only the confirmed users in the whitelist who completed the KYC process can purchase MenaPay tokens from www menapay io using various payment methods 10 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cMenaCash is a stable cryptocurrency of the MenaPay platform which will be used for daily transactions between 3 dynamics in the system users merchants and foundation Transactions between users P2P (peer to peer) transactions between users and merchants P2M (peer to merchant) and transactions between approved merchants and MenaPay Foundation for conversion of their MenaCash to fiat currency purposes M2F (merchant to foundation) will be possible by using MenaCash MenaCash will be generated on the MenaChain permissioned blockchain to assure secure and fast transactions between the users Circulating supply of MenaCash will always be equal to the US dollars in the bank accounts of the MenaPay Foundation 1 MenaCash = 1 USD T Platform PayPal WeChat Pay AliPay MenaPay Currency Money Yuan Yuan MenaCash Table 2 Platform Examples 3 4 Governance Structure Defining the governance structure is the key point to assure the trust in the community and integrity of the team as a whole We\xe2\x80\x99ve defined governance structure of MenaPay Foundation and management of MenaCash in order to have 100% trust by our entire ecosystem 3 4 1 MenaChain Solutions DWC LLC MenaChain Solutions is a company which act as a foundation by its philosophical approach to its business preliminarily MenaPay MenaChain Solutions does not carry a profit motivation for the company itself so in this whitepaper \xe2\x80\x9cMenaPay Foundation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFoundation\xe2\x80\x9d describes MenaChain Solutions DWC LLC The main goal of the company is to create a total new payment and money transfer solution with its blockchain based technology which will belong to the community and bring a significant solution to the everyday problems that payment systems currently have 11 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cThat is why MenaChain allocates its 75% of total income to buy back MenaPay Token in order to fill its green mining reserve for the users Shareholders of the company assign the Executive Board members Executive Board members lead the company with full integrity They consider benefits of the MenaPay community and all stakeholders of MenaPay ecosystem including users merchants and resellers Executive Board acts according to the vision of MenaPay Since the priority is sustainable growth Executive Board has right to make strategic decisions to change transaction fees cash out fees allocated revenue to buy back the MenaPay tokens to fill the green mining reserve and the distribution ratio of the reserve Obviously those token purchase activities would positively affect the token prices in the market Executive Board is responsible to implement effective security measures and ethical standards to avoid fraud insider trading and misuse of information The entire company team works full time dedicated to MenaPay operations The management team prepares the annual budget for marketing and operations The Managing Director of MenaPay has the right to spend within the budget and has limited authority on the Power of Attorney For the payments over the limit 2 signature authorities are required one from the Managing Director and the other from an Executive Board Member CFO directly reports to the Executive Board with respect to reporting audit and internal control purposes Every quarter at least one board meeting should be performed Executive Board is responsible with controlling the management team All strategic decisions such as investment acquisitions budget revision etc requires board approval 3 4 2 Trust structure for MenaCash Trust structure of MenaCash is good use case of blockchain Instead of using traditional audit methods by providing periodical financial documents blockchain gives the freedom for an instant audit Our 3rd party audit and escrow partners are announced on the www menapay io to assure the 100% safe and trustworthy structure for MenaCash As the total circulating supply of MenaCash should be equal to the US dollars in the bank there will not be a moment where the US dollar amount is less than MenaCash in the circulation In order to assure that structure bank accounts of MenaCash will be separated from the MenaPay Foundation Any cash that will be able to release only with the approval of MenaPay Foundation CFO and the reputable 3rd party audit company 12 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cMinimum MenaCash reserves to be hold is calculated based on the USD equivalent of total assets and cash amount in the banks Total provision should be equal to the MenaCash in the circulation after deducting the commission and cash out fees that MenaPay deserves In order to explain the instant audit process clearly it\xe2\x80\x99s better to explain by a chart below with the assumption that we have 100 million MenaCash in the circulation Status at a moment N 100M MenaCash in circulation 100M USD in the bank accounts M2F Merchant sends 1M MenaCash to convert it to fiat currency Status at N+1 99M Menacash in circulation 100M USD in the bank accounts Control & Audit MenaPay confirms that wallet ID belongs to an approved merchant 3rd Party Audit makes instant audit from the NODE established in their facility Fund Release 1M USD Fund is released to the merchant in 24 hours after double confirmation from MenaPay Foundation and 3rd party audit Our policy is to keep maximum 100M US Dollar in a single bank account Bank accounts and the locations of the banks will be distributed worldwide No interest profit will be generated based on reserved money Instead of keeping all the money as a cash reserve in the bank it will be kept in different assets such as other Islamic Finance compliant tools such as real estate low risk venture capital funds etc Executive Board holds the right to change the type of the reserved currency to any currency which is acceptable by the regional merchants The US Dollar has been chosen for the convenience of merchants as of 2018 GCC countries use local currencies fixed to the US dollar and the oil price is determined with US dollars In the future we foresee that Euro or Yuan may become more popular If the fiat currency expectation of the majority changes Executive Board can decide to shift to another currency which is globally reputable and acceptable 13 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0c4 Need for MenaPay The new digitized world requires using technology in each single area The countries which inspired the others with their game changing steps such as China had readily been aware about the importance of the need in the fintech market Today the total amount of people who use Alipay and WeChat Pay in a month is around 900 million [10] We can clearly say that they already started to live in a digitalized cashless future Even though banks worked well enough till now the system is designed according to the antiquated economy and just like any other industry it will be disrupted by the new technology The issue with banks had and has been a problem in regions like MENA Despite the high penetration rate of smartphones and internet connectivity more than 84% of the adult population in the region is unbanked [11] while three in four GCC bank customers are ready to switch banks for a better digital experience [12] With the population of MENA getting younger better educated and more demanding a need for a massive overhaul in financial services occurred MenaPay has been designed to solve the lack of problems that traditional payment/ banking system has besides creating a chance to get rid of the obligation of carrying cash and recognition of fake cash MenaPay is also the way to have an easy fast and secure payment opportunity for those who does not prefer banks and bank products\xe2\x80\x94debit or credit cards\xe2\x80\x94due to their religious beliefs whom contain 378 Million people With this chance to digitize payment in all areas of daily usage life will be easier for MenaPay holders while merchants who do not use credit and debit cards will be available for shopping 4 1 Payment Problems in MENA and Solutions by MenaPay \xe2\x80\xa2 Single Payment Method for Online Shopping As a result of the poor banking system and lack of proper applications of Islamic finance the only way to shop online is using the most common method cash on delivery (CoD) But it also brings some other risks and problems such as high costs and uncharged deliveries Also CoD method can only be used for physical goods Proper monetization of digital goods and services is still a big challenge MenaPay introduces fully Islamic finance compliant digital payment system to users along with its stable currency MenaCash 14 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Obligation of Carrying Cash Apart from security problems this brings despair to users since this payment method is the only way People are not happy to carry large amounts of cash but they love shopping There is no solution if the user loses that high amount of money on the way to buy a valuable good One of the goals of MenaPay is to get rid of cash with the ease of digital payments and security of blockchain technology MenaPay brings a digital single and stable currency to the region which people can carry within their smartphones \xe2\x80\xa2 Cross Border Money Transaction Due to the extreme conversion rates of banks it is very costly to make cross border transactions or online payments in various currencies MenaPay aims to make this process as easy as sending a message on any online platform After completing the KYC process that MenaPay requires from the users money transfer between countries will take seconds as it is a necessity of the digital age we live in \xe2\x80\xa2 Dependent Central Authorities Because there are trust issues and high inflation risks people mostly do not prefer to hold their money in the national banks of their countries Blockchain technology solves any trust or dependency problems that might occur by its nature All savings are recorded on the blockchain and can\xe2\x80\x99t be changed by anyone The MenaPay platform also belongs to the community it\xe2\x80\x99s designed to sustain forever \xe2\x80\xa2 Counterfeit Money Problem Counterfeit money is a serious problem especially in North Africa and the north part of the Middle East where people have plenty concerns about fraud Digitalized and stable currency MenaCash of the MenaPay Platform will also be a solution for this common concern 4 2 Stable Cryptocurrency for Transaction MenaCash Digital or blockchain based payments are typically much faster than today\xe2\x80\x99s classical financial tools since there are no intermediaries The major obstacle for the crypto payments could be the unexpected fluctuations in the currencies As a solution to this problem MenaPay offers its own 100% USD backed stable coin MenaCash 15 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cAnother problem could be the wrong addressing the wallet ID while sending money MenaPay offers a useful way to preclude this problem with solutions such as QR Code and UI/UX design which shows Merchant\xe2\x80\x99s name on the screen during the payment MenaCash will be easily reachable through MenaPay app via all current payment systems such as credit or debit cards and our offline reseller network in the region 1 MenaCash will always be equal to 1 USD so user will not worry about the value of the money The exact amount of circulating MenaCash will be held in several banks so the users can always be sure that their wealth is under protection and available in fiat currency form This will be reputable and trustworthy specifically by and for the approved merchants on the system since they will easily be able to cash out MenaCash from the foundation Only approved merchants will be able to convert their MenaCash to fiat currency with a minimum amount restriction We will not let the users cash out through the foundation due to money laundering concerns Users can cash out their MenaPay tokens from exchanges 4 3 Easy Cash Out for Merchants MenaPay Foundation will give the right to cash out only to the

unique ID and they are matched with users Wallets that are held by merchants are matched with their identities as a company also and are shown to the customer during the payment transaction This assures the customer of the address he/she is transferring MenaCash to MenaPay ID matching process is designed to transfer MenaCash with top security measures Every user\xe2\x80\x99s information is matched with the ones that are kept on the off chain During every transaction request which comes over the MenaGateway validity of these informations are confirmed by the user During MenaCash transfer receiving side\xe2\x80\x99s app produces a QR code encoding its public key When the sending side\xe2\x80\x99s app scans this QR code it gets this public key which is enough for performing the transaction But to ensure receiver\xe2\x80\x99s real identity sender additionally requests supplementary identity information using receiver\xe2\x80\x99s public key The public key is matched with the identity of the receiver on MenaPay servers and masked identity information is returned to the sender side as identity hints Figure 7 Wallet \xe2\x80\x93 ID Matching 23 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0c6

of the traditional financial system Figure 12 MenaCash Possible Flows 29 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0c7 Introduction to Technical Design The problem with public blockchains such as Bitcoin as day to day payment systems is that they are not as easy to use as credit cards or cash You cannot be expected to wait in your favorite coffee shop for half an hour or a few minutes for Bitcoin for your payment transaction to go through Most blockchain based currencies are slow compared to traditional payment methods Both consumer or institutional wise privacy is a problem when a blockchain is considered as a day to day payment system Users or companies may not want their transactions to occur on a public platform that is all transactions and payments can be traced publicly Privacy is a problem (for now) as a payment system on daily basis Today payments systems such as Visa have the capacity to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS) When TPS is considered most blockchain platforms fall short Bitcoin can handle 7 TPS whereas Ethereum can handle 15 TPS These limits are probably going to increase in the future with 2nd layer technologies like lightning network sharding etc MenaChain is designed to support over 100s of TPS initially but will be scaling up to support thousands in the following years It is important to remember that TPS does not mean a clear explanation of the transaction in terms of speed Today while Visa finalizes an entire transaction in 15 seconds in CEMEA (Central Europe Middle East and Africa) region [25] MenaPay Platform requires less than 10 seconds to finalize a transaction The technologhy behind platform makes MenaPay at least %33 faster than current common payment system such credit cards 7 1 Why MenaPay Chose Ethereum MenaPay is utilized on the Ethereum platform using ERC 20 technology which is public easy to use and one of the biggest and widespread blockchain platforms in the world Ethereum has the most widespread use utility tokens Whether it is stock exchanges or transactions between two dynamics all operations are held much faster than the existing banking system by the blockchain technology Ethereum is a decentralized network of computers with two basic functions These functions are a blockchain that can record transactions and a virtual machine that can produce smart contracts 30 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cThanks to these two functions Ethereum can support decentralized applications (DApps) These DApps are built on the existing Ethereum blockchain piggybacking off its underlying technology In return Ethereum charges developers for the computing power in their network which can only be paid in Ether the only interplatform currency Depending on its purpose DAPPs might create ERC 20 tokens to function as a currency a share in the company for points in a loyalty program or even proof of ownership say of an amount of gold or the deed to a house A smart contract is a computer protocol on the blockchain which technically orders projects In our use smart contracts are the unchangeable agreements on how transactions are approved according to the rules written within them They are responsible for the autonomous ruling of the system Smart contracts basically act as objective escrow mechanisms Since smart contracts can be written to define rules for token uses and for decision making processes a central authority is disintermediated The tokens follow a list of standards so that they can be shared exchanged for other tokens or transferred to a crypto wallet Ethereum community has created these standards with three optional rules and six [15] mandatory ones Optional \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Token Name Symbol Decimal (up to 18)

Blockchain MenaChain MenaChain is the blockchain platform designed to build MenaPay\xe2\x80\x99s scalable payment system MenaCash is the default and only cryptocurrency of MenaChain MenaCash is a stable coin backed by USD All created MenaCash will be backed where 1 MenaCash = 1 USD 31 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cMenaChain is designed to support over 100s of TPS initially but it will be scaled up to support thousands in the following years via parallel blockchain Parallel blockchain structure creates basically as an alternative way to overlocked blockchain The important part for speed of transactions is transaction finality which measures how long one user must wait for the confirmation of transaction from the starting moment After at least 2 confirmation the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and This is a significant property for a business because waiting an hour on a [24] blockchain network can have significant repercussions for businesses In MenaPay time for transaction finality is measured in seconds not minutes hours or days That means user will not spend longer time than current payment process with any common credit/debit card or cash usage MenaChain is decentralized and borderless There are no leaders miners or coordinators with special influence towards consensus Every node is equal MenaChain is designed as a permissioned blockchain platform therefore an identity authentication service is required Rather than providing unknown entities like in open networks participants are known but all the participants can hide sender receiver addresses as well as the amount that is being transferred from other merchants on the chain MenaChain also supports multi signature wallets for its corporate users The transactions on the chain can be configured to require the signatures of multiple users when the use case calls for it T MenaChain built on standalone installation of Stellar nodes Since approval of MenaPay Foundation is needed in order to join the MenaChain network as a node all nodes assumed safe participating the MenaChain Network MenaChain platform will start with a small number of nodes during the testing phase Then it will expand to have nodes run by approved organizations which meet certain requirements The real life identities of all the participants are known These participants have a common goal\xe2\x80\x94they want to do business together\xe2\x80\x94but they do not necessarily trust or like each other Nevertheless knowing the identities of the participants allows a permissioned blockchain to use the SCP (Stellar Consensus Protocol) a federated Byzantine Algorithm 32 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0c7 2 1 1 Federated Byzantine Agreement / Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) Figure 13 Federate Byzantine Agreement Consensus means achieving agreement across validators in a network The validators must each agree on a transaction in a network and the network must also tolerate faulty or incorrect messages from misbehaving validators There are several protocols in achieving consensus in a network such as Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Work where the consensus mechanism relies on the computing power of the nodes competing with each other to solve cryptographic puzzles and thereby reach consensus Another widely known practical consensus mechanism is Proof of Stake where nodes are not associated with computing powers and electricity consumption but instead the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selections Odds of block discoveries are in parallel with the amount held in individuals\xe2\x80\x99 wallets Simple selection by account balance would result in undesirable centralization as the single richest member would have a permanent advantage Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) was pioneered by Ripple and refined by Stellar In FBA each participant knows of others it considers important It waits for the vast majority of those others to agree on any transaction before considering the transaction settled In turn those important participants do not agree to the transaction until the participants that they consider important agree as well and so on Eventually enough of the network accepts a transaction that it becomes infeasible for an attacker to roll it back 33 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cStellar Consensus Protocol is derived from the concept of Byzantine Agreement that functions as a provably safe construction of Federated Byzantine Agreement It achieves robustness through quorum slices since all the nodes in the network are assumed safe and trusted Individual trust decisions made by each node that together determine system level quorums 7 2 1 2 Quorum and Quorum Slices A quorum is the minimum number of votes that a distributed transaction has to obtain in order to be allowed to perform an operation in a distributed system In a distributed system a transaction could be executing its operations on multiple nodes Since distributed transactions are required to be atomic the transaction must have the same fate at every node even when nodes are partitioned and the partitions may not be able to communicate with each other This is where a quorum based technique comes in The fundamental idea is that a transaction is executed if the majority of nodes vote to execute it Traditional non federated Byzantine agreements require every node to be involved with every transaction to reach a quorum This is a waste of time and resources In federated Byzantine Agreement a quorum slice is the subset of a quorum convincing one particular node of agreement A node can rely on multiple set of nodes asserting statements Each node chooses one or more quorum slices which are sets of nodes including the node itself resulting in a more federated and decentralized environment A quorum slice represents a sufficient set of peers that the node selecting the quorum slice believes the slice collectively speak for the whole network Compared to decentralized proof of work and proof of stake schemes SCP has modest computing and financial requirements SCP works through the use of quorums which are set of nodes used to reach an agreement This gives the ability to process larger number of transactions quickly and cheaply since there is no expansive mining operation involved The reason that MenaPay choose SCP is Compared to decentralized proof of work and proof of stake schemes SCP has modest computing and financial requirements SCP works through the use of quorums which are set of nodes used to reach an agreement This gives the ability to process larger number of transactions quickly and cheaply since there is no expensive mining operation involved 34 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cSCP provides advantages such as decentralized control low latency flexible trust and asymptotic security Nodes can reach consensus in a couple of seconds which is within typical human expectation for a web or payment transaction Safety rests on digital signatures and hash families whose parameters can realistically be tuned to protect against adversaries with vast computing power Users also have freedom to trust any parties that they see fit [23][24] There is 1% fee for each MenaCash transaction between individual users The fees will be gathered in a special decentralized address MenaPay secures its MenaCash transfers and intakes with the MenaGateway technology MenaGateway technology again offers a transparent substructure for both MenaPay users and the merchants Figure 14 MenaPay Permissioned Blockchain 35 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0c7 3 What is Green Mining In order to understand the mining system of MenaPay let\ s take a look at the blockchain technology first Theory A cryptocurrency system such as Bitcoin possesses state information enabling users to derive their balances For Bitcoin the system state is a collection of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) with each output cryptographically locked requiring the user to provide a proof of ownership to spend a UTXO Instead of explicitly storing the balance Bitcoin and other digital currencies maintain a complete history of users\xe2\x80\x99 transactions which can be used to infer the current state and all past states of the system Transactions represent atomic changes to the system state Transactions are grouped in blocks blocks form an ordered collection called the blockchain To organize the blockchain each block contains a reference to the previous one The first block in the chain is the genesis block it does not have a previous block and is usually hardcoded into the protocol New blocks are discovered according the specified set of rules set by the cryptocurrency protocol An important function of these rules is to protect against attacks on the blockchain and to reach consensus in case multiple instances of the blockchain appear Proof of work and proof of stake refer to two kinds of restrictions on valid blocks and imply two different consensus mechanisms Definition 1 We say that a user works on top of block B if he attempts to discover a block that references B as the previous block Note that B uniquely determines the entire blockchain so we can denote a blockchain with its latest block and say that blocks are discovered on top of blockchain B A cryptocurrency system can be viewed as a distributed database with copies of the database belonging to infrastructure providers for the currency communicating via a peer to peer Internet protocol In terms of the CAP (consistency availability and partition tolerance) theorem cryptocurrency systems are available (every request receives a response) and partition tolerant (the service still performs even if some nodes fail) but are not consistent From time to time different users of the system will see different states of the system as current In some cases the inconsistency corresponds to the situation when a new block has been discovered but has not yet been relayed to all users of the system To obtain eventual consistency a sound consensus protocol should impose the following requirement 36 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cCondition 1 A user who discovered a block should be encouraged to broadcast it over the network immediately and not hold it for himself In other cases system inconsistency is caused by the blockchain splitting into several branches There are various causes of blockchain branching (forking) \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Two users discover new blocks at about the same time An attacker attempts to reverse completed transactions by forking the blockchain In order to discourage deliberate branching a sound consensus protocol should add the following requirement Condition 2 A user should be discouraged from discovering blocks on top of intermediate chains More precisely if there is a known block B\xe2\x80\xb2 referencing the block B the user should have no reason to build on B With the situation depicted in Figure 1 only three blocks can be used as a base for extending the blockchain according to Conditions 1\xe2\x80\x932 Bi+2 B\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2 i+1 and B\xe2\x80\xb2 i+2 There are further restrictions imposed on valid blockchains in most cases these conditions amount to selecting a chain with the maximum number of blocks (which excludes B\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2 i+1 from blocks a rational user could build on his own chain) The goal of consensus rules is to assure selection of a single chain however it is usually the case that some rules depend on the user E g if there are multiple Bitcoin blockchains with the same length users should select the one they received first Thus there is no way to enforce the selection of the same blockchain for all users (as it is very difficult or impossible to ensure that user specific rules are followed) In order for the system to be eventually consistent its consensus protocol should satisfy the following third requirement 37 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cCondition 3 Consensus rules should be constructed in a way that results in resolving blockchain forks i e one of the competing branches should take over all other branches in a reasonable amount of time We will use separate terms for discovering blocks using proof of work and proof of stake algorithms Definition 2 The process of solving a computational challenge imposed by a proof of work protocol is called (block) mining Proof of Work (PoW) PoW systems need computing power and electric consumption to approve the operations on the network (Ex Bitcoin) Consider Bitcoin as an example of a cryptocurrency systems secured with a proof of work algorithm Each block in Bitcoin consists of two parts \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Block header of key parameters including block creation time reference to the previous block and the Merkle tree root of the block of transactions Block list of transactions To reference a specific block its header is hashed twice with the SHA 256 function the resulting integer value belongs to the interval [0 2256 \xe2\x88\x92 1] To account for different possible implementations we will use a generic hashing function hash ( ) with a variable number of arguments and range [0 M] For example arguments of the function can be treated as binary strings and merged together to form a single argument that can be passed to the SHA 256 hashing function T The block reference is used in the proof of work protocol in order for a block to be considered valid its reference must not exceed a certain threshold hash(B) \xe2\xa9\xbd M/D (1) where D \xe2\x88\x88 [1 M] is the target difficulty There is no known way to find B satisfying (1) other than iterating through all possible variables in the block header repeatedly The higher the value of D the more iterations are needed to find a valid block the expected number of operations is exactly D 38 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cThe time period T(r) for a miner with hardware capable of performing r operations per second to find a valid block is distributed exponentially with the rate r/D P{T(r) \xe2\xa9\xbd t} = 1 \xe2\x88\x92 exp(\xe2\x88\x92rt/D) Consider n Bitcoin miners with hash rates r1 r2 \xe2\x80\xa6 rn The period of time to find a block T is equal to the minimum value of random variables T(ri) assuming that the miner publishes a found block and it reaches other miners immediately According to the properties of the exponential distribution T is also distributed exponentially n # t def P {T = min(T1 Tn ) t} = 1 \xe2\x88\x92 exp \xe2\x88\x92 ri D ri P {T = Ti } = $n j=1 rj i=1 The last equation shows that the mining is fair a miner with a share of mining power p has the same probability p to solve a block before other miners It can be shown that proof of work as used in Bitcoin satisfies Conditions 1\xe2\x80\x933 Proof of Stake (PoS) On the contrary to Proof of Work (PoW) Proof of Stake networks are not associated with computing powers and electricity consumption Odds of block discoveries are in parallel with the amount held in individuals\xe2\x80\x99 wallets In proof of stake algorithms inequality (1) is modified to depend on the user\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of the particular PoS protocol cryptocurrency and not on block properties Consider a user with address A and balance bal(A) A commonly used proof of stake algorithm uses a condition as hash(hash(Bprev) A t) \xe2\xa9\xbd bal(A)M/D (2) where \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Bprev denotes the block the user is building on t is the current UTC timestamp For various reasons some cryptocurrencies use modified versions of (2) which we discuss in the corresponding sections 39 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cUnlike (1) the only variable that the user can change is the timestamp t in the left part of equation (2) The address balance is locked by the protocol e g the protocol may calculate the balance based on funds that did not move for a day Alternatively a PoS cryptocurrency may use unspent transaction outputs as Bitcoin does in this case the balance is naturally locked A proof of stake protocol puts restrictions on possible values of t For example if t must not differ from the UTC time on network nodes by more than an hour then a user can attempt no more than 7200 values of t Thus there are no expensive computations involved in proof of stake Together with an address A and a timestamp t satisfying (2) a user must provide a proof of ownership of the address To achieve this the user can sign the newly minted block with his signature in order to produce a valid signature one must have a Private Key corresponding to the address A The time to find a block for address A is exponentially distributed with rate bal(A)/D the (2) implementation of proof of stake is fair the probability to generate a valid block is equal to the ratio of user\xe2\x80\x99s balance of funds to the total amount of currency in circulation The time to find a block for the entire network is distributed exponentially with rate \xe2\x88\x91 a bal(a)/D T the currency \xe2\x88\x91 a bal(a) is fixed or grows at a Thus if the monetary supply of predictable rate the difficulty D should be known in advance D = 1 Tex \xe2\x88\x91 a bal(a) with Tex denoting the expected time between blocks In practice D needs to be adjusted based on recent blocks because not all currency owners [16] participate in block minting 7 4 Innovative Reward System by MenaPay Green Mining MenaPay introduces 2 approach via Green Mining as explained below 7 4 1 MenaPay Token Chance for Each P2M Transaction First one comes with the chance of earning MenaPay Token Each individual who uses the MenaCash for the transactions to the merchants (Peer to Merchant transaction P2M) has a chance of getting MenaPay Token as a reward via the system calls Proof of MenaCash Transaction (PoMT) When a transaction happens between a user and a merchant users qualify for a chance to earn MenaPay Token regarding the following formula 40 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cVm = Total value to be divided between participants for month m km = Number of participants in month m sim = Total amount of share that participant I receives in month m xim = Share coefficient of participant I in month m yinm = Value of nth transaction by participant I in month m zinm = Random number zinm \xe2\x88\x88 [0 1] and zinm can have a different probability distribution function every month F = Cumulative distribution function for transactions Returns a constant number for each transaction depending on its value As a major revolution the reward is independent from the volume of each transaction and reward make the user a MenaPay community members even if they had never purchased a MenaPay Token before T 7 4 2 Staking Model for MenaPay Token Holders Second and the most reformist way to generate additional revenue apart from the price increasing is staking the MenaPay Tokens 41 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cSince Menapay Platform is a nonprofit organization it must use majority of its revenue to fill Green Mining reserve This amount calculated as 75% of Menapay Platform\xe2\x80\x99s revenue and will be used to buy MenaPay Tokens from the exchanges in order to feed Green Mining pool It is creating a new standard in the crypto industry for the level of participatory returns beyond the regular incentives for users and investors Each staked MenaPay Token is considered as a mining token and has chance to win an additional token based on the smart contract designed by the criteria mentioned below Total # of tokens staked on daily basis Total # of tokens in the green mining reserve The users who stake their MenaPay Tokens will have right to earn tokens from Green Mining pool according to the number of staked tokens In order to take advantage of this model user must stake minimum 5 000 MenaPay Token with the minimum time limit as 30 days Users who decided to get back their tokens before the minimum period may not take any share from the Green Mining reserve Only staked tokens holded in the native MenaPay wallet or MenaPay payment application will be considered As a summary staking income by MenaPay tokens will be distributed on the (N+30) day where N is the first day of staking for the individual It is important to highlight that MenaPay Token is a utility token since MenaChain Solutions DWC LLC does not issue dividends and/or voting rights to the token holders MenaPay Foundation will distributeMenaPay Tokens from Green Mining reserve with holders according to the amount of their staked MenaPay Token in their wallets as mentioned above MenaPay Foundation keeps the right to adjust the model according to the needs of the market and community 42 MenaPay WhitePaper

financial service records with respect to the previous year [17] Financial services spend multibillion US dollars to prevent this kind of malicious cases Another control mechanism is added to the system for each added control mechanism to inhibit the added control mechanism This process is an endless chain reaction which is reflected as inefficient time and money on both internal processes of financial institutions and user experience In the technology environment we live in this system is still used while it has continuously given deficits which has ended with great amounts of labor and money thefts The seven year fraud which has reached a $81M volume in India is an example from hundreds [18] T For credit card purchases mostly the information on the card is sufficient A card left on the table is open to be used outside of the owner\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge MenaPay is developed with 2FA payment passwords or approval processes considering this kind of possibilities Every transaction step is written in a block on the blockchain and MenaPay which is on a permissioned blockchain keeps records of these transactions Records cannot be tampered with since the blockchain is fully closed

of the most commonly used cryptocurrencies in the world and distinctly the #1 crypto currency in MENA region Accordingly we expect to enter into the Top 30 Cryptocurrencies by Market Capitalization Smart Contract to MenaChain In the third quarter of 2019 MenaChain will also have a smart contract so it will have the securest way to transact money between two parties Specifically companies which have security concerns will be able to define a 3rd party to control the transaction of money and/or goods Whitelabel MenaCash Wallet Since it requires a long detailed process to develop a wallet for

region all products will be launched with Arabic Turkish and English languages firstly After reaching over 5 million users MenaPay community will be willing to use MenaPay at overseas as well We expect a significant request from the merchants located in the countries such as UK and USA where MENA region people frequently visit Also merchants and users in the other Islamic countries (extended MENA region) will be willing to use MenaPay and we\xe2\x80\x99ll support the community by adding more languages 51 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cExpansion to Asian countries MenaPay expansion plan especially covers the Islamic Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia We\xe2\x80\x99ll take Islamic Asian countries as our base point to penetrate the large and promising Asia market At the

open offices in Asia to reach the potential merchants with local teams Advanced AI features P2P Lending and payment installment MenaPay is the future of finance MenaPay platform collects user data and analyses them with advanced machine learning and AI features By the end of 2019 MenaPay data platform will reach a sophisticated level to calculate proper credit score for the users Credit scores can be shared with the merchants upon approval from the users Then merchants can decide whether to allow users to pay in installments or start payment after a certain period of time according to their credit score Dubai \xc4\xb0stanbul Bahrain Riyad and Kahira will be the places welcoming MenaPay\xe2\x80\x99s first offices in the region During the IEO MenaPay plans to be listed on the Top exchanges After the IEO since the key part for a cryptocurrency to take place in any exchange is the number of users and the volume MenaPay aims to reach 1M users in a very short period of time and 5M users in 6 months which would make MenaPay globally #1 cryptocurrency in terms of number of users The main reason for MenaPay\xe2\x80\x99s development is to serve any person who wants to use a digital payment system in their daily life AliPay and WeChat Pay examples which dominate the payment system industry in the Asia region are guarantees for the success of MenaPay within the MENA region by easily gaining users where the internet and mobile penetration rates are extremely high 8 5 Business and Revenue Model MenaPay eliminates major cost channels of POS machines monthly fixed fees expensive credit and debit card fees by integrating barcode and QR code technologies which are usable on every smartphone into the system This opportunity is highly intriguing for the merchants Built with these advantages and the blockchain technology which eliminates intermediaries MenaPay aims to create its own ecosystem without depending on other dynamics 52 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cMenaPay Foundation generates the revenue to be distributed to MenaPay Token Holders through 3 channels \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 P2P transaction fee P2M transaction fee (from merchant) M2F cash out fee Transaction fees for P2P will be 1% on average and cash out fee will be 5% on average Figure 20 MenaPay Platform Revenue Models All transactions are 100% transparent and secure whether guaranteed by the technical structure of the blockchain technology or by the nodes that will be given to the 3rd party audit companies Revenue generating methods of MenaPay do not include any interest methods MenaCash equivalent USD is kept in accounts of MenaPay This money is never to be subjected to interest The accounts are interest free In case of large sums of money money will be held in baskets of gold different fiat currencies and liquid real estate assets Any P2P transaction witnessed by 2 parties is considered as compliant with Islamic jurisprudence so long as there is no financial interest within that system 53 MenaPay WhitePaper V 2 0 \x0cMenaPay Foundation also assures not to generate any interest gain from the cash reserve of MenaCash MenaPay Foundation uses %75 of its total revenue to fill the Green Mining pool which will use for staking and rewarding models Detailed information can be found under section 7 4 8 6 Financial Projections From the 1 000 merchants we will be reaching at the end of year 2019 there will be 10 000 users acquired on the average for each This will bring our user number to 10M Today the mobile payment penetration of WeChat Pay is around 87% in China WeChat Pay first arose in September 2014 If this high percentage achieved by WeChat Pay and MENA region\xe2\x80\x99s digital transformation rates are taken into account the number of users solely within the MENA region would become 225 million in year 2022 The average money transfer per person made within the year 2017 through digital POS machines is 243 USD [21] Even if the exponential increase of the transfer amount is disregarded with 225M users MenaCash transaction volume would be 60B USD Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017 there were 2 9 to 5 8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet most of them using Bitcoin [22] Considering Bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency even with the fast paced volatility it is accustomed with we can predict that MenaCash would become the most used cryptocurrency with its stable USD backed value in the region and the world Graph 3 a MenaCash User Target Graph 3 b MenaCash Transaction Volume
