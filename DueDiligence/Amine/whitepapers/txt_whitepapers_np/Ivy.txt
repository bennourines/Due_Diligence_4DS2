payments (Ivy Network) If implemented token holders may have the ability to voluntarily de anonymise transaction data to the satisfaction of financial institutions in order to facilitate transactions using cryptocurrency with the security and reliability of the blockchain Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 5 \x0cIntroduction 1 Ivy is a blockchain based technology for FIAT & Cryptocurrency business transactions which require verification in the international monetary system The Ivy Network utilizes IVY tokens which will carry Know your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Transaction (KYT) to meet the verification requirements for transactions In a truly global financial market place there is a very real need for fast & secure transactions that meet KYC & BSA / AML requirements for not just traditional FIAT currency but also cryptocurrencies as well Ivy bridges the gap between the centralized traditional banking & payment systems and the decentralized blockchain network to leverage the best of both worlds \xe2\x80\x93 fast decentralized processing that meets the regulatory requirements of Financial Institutions around the world For an individual and/or business Ivy presents the opportunity to make payments in cryptocurrencies to third parties and for the third party to receive cash To the banks Ivy opens new channels of deposits that will ultimately provide more revenue for financial institutions reduce fraud losses and provide for significant automation of existing manual processes leading to substantial cost savings Ivy bridges the gap between the centralized traditional banking & payment systems and the decentralized blockchain network to leverage the best of both worlds 6 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 \x0cProblem There is an increased scrutiny from regulators surrounding any potential transactions being linked to the proceeds of fraudulent of money laundering activities Through embedding KYC and KYT data points into a transaction itself Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain technology will provide regulatory comfort and access to large pools of global funds that would otherwise be unbankable Ivy solution Ivy provides financial institution grade technology that can be easily implemented globally i Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s technology will provide Know Your Transaction (KYT) information that greatly exceeds regulatory requirements as will be hashed into the blockchain and accessible as required ii Know Your Customer (KYC) to satisfy Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and global AML requirements hashed into the blockchain and accessible as required iii Immutable records in the blockchain for audits by Financial Institutions Compliance Departments Bank Auditors and Potentially Regulators iv Cashier services to convert Ivy tokens into fiat in traditional bank accounts via near instantaneous payment mechanisms Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 7 \x0cThe cryptocurrency market is broadening and deepening at a rapid rate with a current

of and potential for these currencies is well recognised anonymity has prevented wider mainstream adoption as there are a lack of financial institutions that support transactions involving cryptocurrencies 8 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 \x0cThe primary reason for this lack of support within the global banking and financial industry is due to the applicable regulation that requires certain transaction information inconsistent with anonymity The Tokens will be a blockchain based cryptocurrency intended for transactions with financial institutions and embeds far more Know Your Transaction (KYT) and Know Your Customer (KYC) information into payments than incumbent payment networks including current baseline payment systems such as the SWIFT protocol CHIPS and Fedwire Token holders will have the ability to voluntarily deanonymise transaction data to the satisfaction of financial institutions in order to facilitate transactions using cryptocurrency with the security and reliability of the blockchain 1 2 We believe the opportunity for the Tokens is immense with \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 A Blue Sky Market o Potential continued cryptocurrency market growth o Potential

Incumbent Funds Transfer Process Works An electronic funds transfer is a transaction in which money moves from one financial institution to another (or from one account to another) at the instruction of a financial institution\xe2\x80\x99s customer Financial institutions facilitate this through the communication of electronic messages that form the basis for making the required bookkeeping entries and making funds available Electronic funds transfers are the primary mechanism used by businesses for the transfer of money between two parties Financial institutions facilitate electronic funds transfers through the sending and receiving of electronic messages per understood and well supported standards including SWIFT and ISO 20022 The messages sent between financial institutions direct the sending bank to debit the sender\xe2\x80\x99s account and the receiving bank to credit the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s account The entities involved in a transfer include \xe2\x80\xa2 Originator (such as a business or individual) the initiator of the transfer \xe2\x80\xa2 Beneficiary the party who is the end recipient of the transfer \xe2\x80\xa2 Originator\xe2\x80\x99s financial institution the financial institution that receives the originator\xe2\x80\x99s transfer instructions and transmits the fund\xe2\x80\x99s to the beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s financial institution \xe2\x80\xa2 Beneficiary\xe2\x80\x99s financial institution the financial institution that receives the funds and holds the account to be credited and \xe2\x80\xa2 Additional/Intermediary Financial Institutions other institutions that may be required to execute the transaction PAYMENT ORDER ORIGINATOR MESSAGE TO ORIGINATOR\xe2\x80\x99S FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CREDITS ACCOUNT OF BENEFICIARY\xe2\x80\x99S FINANCIAL INSTITUTION BENEFICIARY Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 11 \x0cFrequently used payment formats include SWIFT The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (\xe2\x80\x9cSWIFT\xe2\x80\x9d) is a member owned messaging network used for funds transfer instructions using standardized codes SWIFT is a communication network that a financial institution in one country can use to communicate with its branches or other financial institutions in a different country SWIFT is a messaging system for funds transfer instructions rather than a financial settlement system Most international interbank messages use the SWIFT network SWIFT divides its messages into a series of formats known as message types Each message type represents a type of transaction or message The message types are separated into ten categories (MT0xx \xe2\x80\x93 System Messages MT1xx \xe2\x80\x93 Customer Payments and Checks MT2xx \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Institution Transfers MT3xx

day5 SWIFT directs the transfer of nearly $5 trillion worldwide each day or $1 25 quadrillion per year6 CHIPS The Clearing House Interbank Payments System (\xe2\x80\x9cCHIPS\xe2\x80\x9d) is a funds transfer system that transmits and settles payment orders in US dollars for some of the largest and most active banks in the world On an average day CHIPS transmits and settles more than 446 000 \xe2\x80\x9cpayment messages\xe2\x80\x9d worth $1 5 trillion It operates 20 hours a day and matches transactions between banks in real time7 Fedwire The Fedwire Funds Service (\xe2\x80\x9cFedwire\xe2\x80\x9d) is a real time gross settlement system jointly owned by the 12 US Federal Reserve Banks8 Both senders and recipients must hold accounts with Fedwire participating financial institutions and the transfers are same day non revocable payments Though participating institutions are all US based institutions Fedwire can be used as the US based portion of international transfers In 2016 Fedwire transfers averaged a daily volume of 590 209 transactions representing $3 05 trillion9 The Fedwire service operates beginning 9 00 PM the night before a business day until 6 00 PM Eastern Time (GMT \xe2\x80\x93 5) ACH The Automated Clearing House (\xe2\x80\x9cACH\xe2\x80\x9d) is an electronic payment network run by the National Automated Clearing House Association (\xe2\x80\x9cNACHA\xe2\x80\x9d) a non profit membership association supported by 10 000+ financial institutions ACH transfers include direct deposits payroll payments and consumer payments (e g to insurance and mortgage companies) ACH direct debit transfers include consumer payments on insurance premiums mortgage loans and other kinds of bills ACH covers the United States The European equivalent is SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) and the UK has three equivalent systems BACS CHAPS and Faster Payments The ACH Network moves $43 trillion and 25 billion electronic financial transactions each year10 Financial institutions use various payment formats depending on the nature of transactions In some instances multiple payment methods may be used for a single transaction 5 6

the Incumbent Funds Transfer Process Transactions between two parties are typically referred to in the financial industry as third party payments That is transactions processed by financial institutions on behalf of parties \xe2\x80\x93 individuals or entities \xe2\x80\x93 that are not themselves financial institutions With some notable exceptions these transactions generally can be divided into two main types \xe2\x80\xa2 Transactions processed pursuant to documents to which the financial institutions are privy such as in the case of trade finance where one or more financial institutions will have access to a letter of credit a guarantee and/or some other information such as bills of lading and other shipping information \xe2\x80\xa2 Transactions processed without financial institutions having such documents These transactions are often referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cclean payments\xe2\x80\x9d The significant majority of third party payments processed are of this type where the financial institutions processing the payments have relatively little visibility into the nature of the underlying transaction In the trade finance space such transactions are referred to as \xe2\x80\x9copen account trade\xe2\x80\x9d Information that might be included with financial transactions fall into two categories \xe2\x80\xa2 Know Your Customer (KYC) KYC information typically includes identifying information such as the customer\xe2\x80\x99s name address account number and so on \xe2\x80\xa2 Know Your Transaction (KYT) KYT information includes details such as the type of transaction (for example whether the transaction involves cash foreign wire payments or cheques) the recipient of the funds (including its address as reported by the sender at the time of instruction) and details included in the transaction memo 4) Industry Regulation and the Relevance of Ivy Over the past 50 years funds transfers have become increasingly electronic With this advancement and the accompanying growth in transaction volumes financial institutions law enforcement and regulatory agencies are confronted with increasingly numerous and complex challenges for combatting financial crime Jurisdictions throughout the world continue to strengthen anti money laundering (AML) laws Because nearly all countries have adopted \xe2\x80\x93 and commit increasing resources to the enforcement of \xe2\x80\x93 these types of laws consumers and businesses are accustomed to financial institutions requesting KYC information to verify the identity of a customer when a new financial account is opened or when a large funds transfer is made a Anti Money Laundering at Financial Institutions Taking the United States as an example the Bank Secrecy Act11 and other requirements call for financial institutions to implement and adhere to policies procedures and controls sufficient to provide for the detection investigation and reporting of suspicious activity This includes transactions that could signify money laundering tax evasion or other criminal activities Similar requirements are commonplace in developed economies around the world Methods used to detect suspicious activity typically involve rules based automated suspicious activity monitoring platforms that review on a batch processed basis recent customer activity These rules or scenarios flag specific transactions or groups of transactions for further analysis This analysis typically involves a manual review by financial institution personnel to either eliminate the flagged activity as \xe2\x80\x9cnot suspicious \xe2\x80\x9d or to escalate the activity for further review and potentially onward for reporting to law enforcement Additionally certain higher risk customers are often subject to periodic ongoing due diligence reviews that involve an indepth analysis of the transactions conducted by the customer over a period of for example the most recent six or 12 months These due diligence reviews have a similar purpose to the automated transaction monitoring detection methods which is to understand the nature of the underlying activity so that the financial institution can make decisions regarding the risks and acceptability of retaining the customer relationship apply appropriate controls to the account(s) of identified parties and report suspicious activity as required Regulatory expectation in this area is that financial institutions undertake enough due diligence and analysis to gain comfort that customer activity is not suspicious otherwise the activity should be further analyzed and reported to law enforcement Financial institutions are expected to perform these assessments on the basis of all available information where additional information would assist financial institutions are expected to collect it but to do so in a manner that does not \xe2\x80\x9ctip off\xe2\x80\x9d anyone \xe2\x80\x93 including the customer or related party \xe2\x80\x93 that an investigation has been or may be in progress 11 https //www occ treas gov/topics/compliance bsa/bsa/index bsa html Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 13 \x0cb Ramifications of Anti Money Laundering Laws Compliance with AML laws requires that banks have sufficient information to implement execute and support their anomaly detection programs Cryptocurrency and its inherent anonymity put banks in a bind since such transactions do not naturally come with the information banks need to carry out the practices they need to identify fraudulent or illegal activity To protect themselves banks commonly suspend accounts that contain fiat deposits originating from cryptocurrency related transactions and refuse to accept gains or settlement in cryptocurrency as a legitimate medium of exchange One implication of this decision is that legitimate businesses are unable to perform transactions involving cryptocurrencies because they are unable to bank the proceeds c The Benefits of More Information There are clear benefits from having additional information readily available either while investigating an automated transaction monitoring system\xe2\x80\x99s alert or during an activity review as part of ongoing due diligence The additional information can help the investigator or reviewer more effectively and efficiently determine whether the nature of the activity including the parties involved gives rise to any doubt as to its appropriateness or legality This additional information can help the financial institution determine whether a customer needs to be categorized as high risk or if the institution is breaching its obligations under AML laws In the case of routine benign activity this information can allow a bank to more effectively focus investigative resources on other customers and their heightened risk activity Although traditional payment methods typically embed limited information this additional data is generally readily available either within the financial institution\xe2\x80\x99s KYC records about the instructing customer or provided directly by the customer in transaction instructions Information of the former type could include for example a description of the nature of the customer\xe2\x80\x99s business their geographic focus expected activity that the account(s) are likely to experience and information regarding related parties to the account such as beneficial owners and signatories The transaction itself (KYT) could include information related to supporting documentation such as invoices credit notes shipping documentation and information identifying the parties to a transaction (these may include more parties than the originator and beneficiary parties such as shipping companies) It can also include documentation or evidence of such documentation that would show the legal permissibility of transactions such as licences issued by U S Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Foreign Assets Control or the Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau of Industry and Security Embedding such information into the payment instruction mechanism as an aspect of the supporting protocol could prove crucial to help a financial institution\xe2\x80\x99s reviewer form a more comprehensive and clear picture regarding the nature of the underlying activity By making KYC and KYT information more readily available and eliminating knowledge gaps the financial institution can focus its attention on investigating other instances that deserve heightened scrutiny Unfortunately a number of protocol developments in financial technology focus heavily on interoperability and speed considering regulatory compliance as an overlay of inconvenience that can be addressed at later points following deployment meaning that the promise of a comprehensive solution is seldom realized 14 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 \x0c3 The Ivy Opportunity A Highly Disruptive Superior Technology The benefits of cryptocurrency vs incumbent financial systems are well understood FASTER EASIER NO DELAYS CHEAPER MORE DATA However the inherent anonymity of most current cryptocurrencies creates incompatibility with the current financial system The Ivy Network will enable KYC KYT and AML data supporting transactions to be captured using a blockchainbased cryptocurrency It will be optimally designed for transactions with financial institutions embedding far more compliance and transaction audit information than incumbent payment networks Transaction data will be made available to satisfy the stringent requirements of financial institutions and intermediaries When implemented the Ivy Network will have TRACKABLE SECURE distinct advantages over incumbent financial systems and competing cryptocurrencies Ivy seeks to bridge the gap between current global financial systems and the emergence of cryptocurrencies positioning itself as the future for global payments 1) Comparison to Incumbent Financial Systems When fully developed the primary differences between the Ivy Network and traditional payment networks will be that the Ivy Network \xe2\x80\xa2 will securely facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrency payments while associating KYC and KYT data via the trusted distributed Ivy network \xe2\x80\xa2 will securely store an immutable reference to supporting transaction data in a public blockchain \xe2\x80\xa2 will embed more KYT information into the transfer than traditional payment methods \xe2\x80\xa2 will embed more KYC information into the transfer than traditional payment methods \xe2\x80\xa2 will be able to be integrated into existing banking software \xe2\x80\xa2 will offer easy integration into accounting software for bookkeeping efficiency and \xe2\x80\xa2 will provide revocable access to KYC/KYT data to financial institutions accountants company managers and others depending on the information they require Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 15 \x0cIn regards to KYC and KYT frequently used incumbent payment formats typically support collecting relatively few data points The table below indicates the approximate volume of KYC/KYT data points included in a typical transaction KYC and AML data points SWIFT Fedwire Chips ACH 10 17 9 10 Note The Company is not affiliated with SWIFT CHIPS ACH or Fedwire All information is provided on a general basis and is based on the available information at the time of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s research When implemented the Ivy Network will be far more descriptive than the existing systems and processes Depending on the type of financial transaction being performed it is anticipated that the Ivy Network will allow for the inclusion of more than 120 different KYT data points and more than 70 different KYC data points in transaction messages A convenient way to categorize these data points is according to the documentation source from which they might originate Type of Transaction 16 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5

a cryptocurrency with several distinguishing features and benefits Feature Description Benefit The Ivy Network and related transactions allow for the clear integration of KYC/KYT/ AML data in the flow of cryptocurrency transactions Legitimacy of parties and purpose of transaction is easily understood and used for adjudication of decisions regarding payments and deposits TRANSFERABLE Tokens will exist as a cryptocurrency that can be freely traded on a public blockchain without encumbering associated KYC/KYT/ AML information associated with its purpose for financial institutions and intermediaries Parties may easily use and exchange the token for its utility allowing for an honest reflection of its value and removing ivykoin com and cryptocurrency exchanges as sole determinants of the cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s value NONFORGEABLE The Ivy Network transactions and supporting data will facilitate using blockchain architecture which enforces the immutability of assignment and transaction data Users of the Ivy Network will be assured of the certainty of transactional integrity and the security of data for ensuring the durability of transactions and data that support decisions related to cash movement Tokens will be issued in known quantity with known initial distribution and allocations Public transactions benefit from economies related to coin scarcity where private network movement provides accurate reflection of liquidity and velocity of money within the network All data collected is persistently secured transported and tracked on a private clearing network that consists of financial institutions and intermediaries Eligible parties have the information they need for KYC/KYT/AML functions Parties may be added or removed without compromising the underlying security of data RECOGNIZABLE LIMITED SUPPLY DE ANONYMIZED ON REQUEST RECOGNIZABLE TRANSFERABLE NONFORGEABLE LIMITED SUPPLY DE ANONYMIZED ON REQUEST The Ivy Network when fully developed is anticipated to have distinct advantages over Ripple our leading competing cryptocurrency Ivy Ripple \xe2\x80\xa2 Designed to break KYC/KYT/AML barriers between cryptocurrency and existing financial

intended to be a decentralized network of validators consisting of financial institutions and intermediaries who use the Tokens for the purpose of communicating KYC/KYT/AML data and for settling balances on the network Compliance and audit are first principle concerns in the Ivy Network Transactions with Tokens will be initiated against a contract listed on the public Ethereum network using Tokens that are easily traded for their utility of facilitating payments to recipients of payment remittance in fiat currency at their financial institutions This differs greatly from the use of XRP

visit www ivykoin com Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 19 \x0cIvy Operational Specifications 5 1) Operational Platform Overview a Base Functionality The Ivy Network is envisioned to provide the following functionality to end users This functionality may be delivered to its constituents by desktop/web and mobile experiences Financial Institutions & Financial Intermediaries Senders & Recipients In addition to the base features described above the Company plans in due course to incorporate the following features functionalities and solutions into the Ivy Network \xe2\x80\xa2 Purchase or sale of Tokens \xe2\x80\xa2 View cryptocurrency exchange availability and exchange rates for common cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\xa2 Estimate network charges and receive quotes for using Tokens \xe2\x80\xa2 View financial institution and financial intermediary mean times for transaction settlement and \xe2\x80\xa2 View KYC data access logs with respect to personally identifiable information (for senders ) \xe2\x80\xa2 Maintain enterprise account and identity information \xe2\x80\xa2 Manage account access settings for organization members and \xe2\x80\xa2 View Token data container contents and access history b Peer to Peer Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency Network Whereas the initial uses for the Ivy Network is to provide for predominantly business to business transactions strong demand also exists for a simplified payment network that allows individuals to easily send receive and manage their cryptocurrencies and easily convert them to fiat currency c Software Integration The Company will seek to integrate with existing bank software so that KYT and KYC can be distributed automatically to the correct locations within the respective bank system The Company also intends to integrate with major accounting software systems The easy integration of payments and receipts from customers including invoice details will enable transactional data to be loaded directly into the accounting software reducing the customer\xe2\x80\x99s administrative load add icon 20 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 d Cashier and Conversion Services The Company intends to develop cashier services and conversion services Cashier services facilitate \xe2\x80\xa2 The withdrawal of fiat money from bank accounts and its conversion into cryptocurrency and \xe2\x80\xa2 The conversion of cryptocurrencies back into fiat money and their deposit into bank accounts \x0cExchange services will allow customers to convert Tokens to and from a range of other cryptocurrencies By providing both cashier and exchange services the Company intends for the Ivy Network to be an end to end solution particularly for businesses making large transfers The Company will seek to \xe2\x80\xa2 Facilitate the conversion of fiat money into cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\xa2 Facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrency across the globe and \xe2\x80\xa2 Enable the recipient to exchange the cryptocurrency back into fiat money in their bank account Most importantly it is intended that the Ivy Network will be able to do this without causing a problem with either the sending or receiving financial institution e Fixed Price Transfers via Open Market Operations Potential currency loss during the process of cryptocurrency transfers is one of the biggest inhibitors to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by merchants The Company aims to develop a fixed price solution to remove currency loss due to cryptocurrency price volatility The fixed price solution involves using a pool of treasury coins to be used specifically for USD fiat to USD fiat transactions involving two bank accounts Fiat will be pulled from the senders bank account using an ODFI (\xe2\x80\x9cOriginating Deposit Taking Financial Institution) The Ivy Network will then facilitate the conversion of the fiat into Tokens using a treasury of off market tokens designed specifically for this purpose (see section 7) 2) Financial Institutions With increased financial institution support the Ivy Network has the potential to be used for the following transactions plus many more \xe2\x80\xa2 Domestic or international purchases of goods \xe2\x80\xa2 Business to business services \xe2\x80\xa2 General transfer of value which is destined to be fiat in a financial institution \xe2\x80\xa2 Software licence purchases \xe2\x80\xa2 Real estate purchases \xe2\x80\xa2 Global investing \xe2\x80\xa2 Large personal transfers and \xe2\x80\xa2 Small personal transfers 3) User Functionality It is proposed that the Ivy Network will provide a value exchange between counterparties where (1) a sending party seeks to send large sums of cryptocurrency to a receiving party and (2) the receiving party receives that cryptocurrency balance to a bank account in fiat currency Both senders and receivers will be able to use Tokens to move cryptocurrency into financial institutions via the Ivy Network which will be available for purchase at ivykoin com and publicly on major exchanges Account holders wishing to move other cryptocurrencies through the Ivy Network must trade third party cryptocurrencies into Tokens first ivykoin com will be accessible by users via phone or mobile device and from a sender\xe2\x80\x99s perspective will provide the following core functionality \xe2\x80\xa2 Account setup and management \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction management and \xe2\x80\xa2 Token purchase sale and transfer Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 21 \x0ca Account Setup and Management It is anticipated that senders and recipients will be able to create Ivy Network accounts at ivykoin com and after the registration process receive unique sender identification information The Ivy Network will save all of the sender\xe2\x80\x99s account information so that they do not have to provide the same information for subsequent transfers This KYC information consists of a variety of data fields and files that represent the identity of the user such as name email phone address and government identification When fully developed accounts will be able to be managed through an online dashboard at ivykoin com including updating KYC and recurring transactional data Account holders may request to connect to other Ivy Network account holders and populate a roster of known and verified cryptocurrency payment peers which is helpful when sending frequently to the same recipients or to quickly and efficiently send to new recipients Account holders may make themselves visible on the Ivy Network globally and requests may be made by one account holder to add another to their own roster They may also use Ivy Network services to convert and send Tokens to their own fiat accounts at financial institutions i Sender Data Verification The Ivy Network intends to verify basic sender data and legitimacy of bank accounts as part of the account opening process The Ivy Network will provide initial identity document verification using various third party services Identity documents such as passports and drivers licenses are intended to be validated within minutes If documents are not recognised then the account will be placed into pending status for further investigation Similarly business licenses and other registered corporate documents will be able to be quickly verified Toward the same end account holders\xe2\x80\x99 bank account information is intended to be verified using a process whereby small deposits are placed into account holders\xe2\x80\x99 bank accounts and those deposit amounts are used to independently verify the successful connection between the Ivy Network and the bank account Despite these efforts the Company does not guarantee responsibility for the legitimacy or illegitimacy of payments though this practice is very similar to that taken by incumbent networks a Transaction Management Once an Ivy Network accounts is established it is anticipated that a sender will be able to initiate a transfer of Tokens to a recipient The sender will enter the specific transaction information into the account in advance of the transaction The Ivy Network will request base level information for all transfers however the required additional detail varies based on the laws and regulations that are applicable The Ivy Network will prompt a sender to provide additional specifics related to their transaction For example if a sender is making a payment in exchange for goods the information the Ivy Network embeds into the transfer might include country of origin final destination proof of import duties paid or other identifying information A sender may also choose to provide additional details about the transfer \xe2\x80\x93 for example a copy of the invoice with the payment Furthermore if a sender knows that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t a trusted source by the recipient they can include information such quality assurance certificates batch information articles of incorporation and other voluntary KYT information which is extensive b Ivy Purchase Sell and Transfer It is anticipated that the Ivy Network will facilitate the secure transmission of funds and data for the benefit of both a sender and a financial institution When a bank is reviewing transactions for suspicious activity it will have significantly more data points to assist in the review as compared to legacy payment networks and more modern alternatives for payment transfers Payment values will be viewable by the public in the blockchain and cannot be deleted KYT and KYC data will be encrypted and bound to Tokens sent by a sender to the Ivy Network and are subsequently accessible to the receiving institution and receiver This KYC/KYT/AML data can only be viewed by parties associated with the transaction The diagrams below depict the anticipated flow of Tokens from the perspectives of a sender receiver and financial institution The user interface is simple and intuitive

Transaction Record is generated and made available to Sender Recipient and Recipient\xe2\x80\x99s Financial Institution If transaction is not approved funds become available in Sender account for future activity Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 23 \x0cIvy Technical Specifications 1) Overview of Technical Architecture It is intended that the Ivy Network will function through the use of a dual network architecture where senders of Tokens operate on a public network (Ivy Public Network) and parties that provide the financial settlement to fiat currency participate on a private network (Ivy Private Network) KYC/KYT/AML data supporting transactions will be captured in cryptographic containers that are generated from the Ivy Public Network interaction with the Ivy Network smart contracts and support the activities of the Ivy Private Network participants in facilitating transaction settlement This data will be stored and accessible by the financial institution and governing regulators of the fiat balance recipients The following technical specifications are each anticipated to be part of the Ivy Network when fully developed add icon 24 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 6 \x0cSender

Contract 2 1 2 n FI approves transaction & cash deposit verified 6 Ivy Private Network Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 25 \x0ca Public Network ivySend and Public Ivy Tokens (IVY) Once the Ivy Network is operational it is anticipated that public parties seeking to send third party cryptocurrency to the account of an intended recipient must exchange their cryptocurrency for Tokens at a public exchange or purchase Tokens directly from the Ivy Network Ivy Public Network Tokens (IVY) will be authored to the ERC20 specification available on the Ethereum network Tokens will be submitted to an Ivy Network contract (ivySend Contract) on the Ethereum network where they are subsequently held in escrow The escrow state completes on the basis of two conditions a) the transfer is successfully completed in which case the Tokens are transferred to the Ivy Network where they are sold on secondary markets or on the Company\xe2\x80\x99s website for either cash or third party cryptocurrency or alternatively burned or b) the transfer fails in which case the full amount of the Tokens submitted to the Ivy Network is refunded An ivySend Contract is anticipated to be a smart contract that can be addressed by any number of parties interested in calling it from the public Ethereum network While in initial implementation it is likely to be available through the interface of ivykoin com through the website\xe2\x80\x99s direct integration with the Ethereum network It is additionally envisioned that other parties will similarly incorporate this contract as a payment interface An ivySend Contract is intended to operate using Ethereum network gas incentives whereby the sender must cover the calling cost of the contract allowing the contract\xe2\x80\x99s processing on the Ethereum network to occur Should gas submitted not prove sufficient for mining public incentives the escrow contract will never take effect to secure the sender\xe2\x80\x99s Ivy Network account balance such that it might continue with the rest of the transaction Ivy Network fees are also incorporated into the cost of the ivySend Contract process (much like wire transfers performed at traditional financial institutions) It is anticipated that a party seeking to use the Ivy Network can use the Company\xe2\x80\x99s website to easily view a) common cryptocurrency to Token exchange rates at a variety of common cryptocurrency exchanges b) expected Ethereum gas charges for successful execution of the ivySend Contract and c) total gross Token fees (fiat balance desired + gas charges + commission) for a given balance of fiat currency sought to be sent to an intended recipients account As a number of these components are volatile in overall pricing by using the Company\xe2\x80\x99s website it is intended that a user of an ivySend Contract can receive a price quote for execution over a 10 minute period which locks in the execution quote for a given ivySend Contract transaction of the quoted parameters within an upper and lower limit of volatility expressed by the Ivy Network at the time the price quote is given In this way when fully developed IVY is anticipated to offer full utility functionality for its holders and protects them from volatility in operating against the contract b Private Network ivyReceive and Private Ivy Tokens (IVYB) The Ivy Private Network is intended to distribute funds to the bank accounts of intended recipients by the use of private ivyNetwork contracts (ivyReceive Contracts) The Ivy Private Network is proposed to operate using a private permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain specialised coordination of financial institutions and intermediaries It is anticipated that ivyReceive Contract will be hosted on the Ivy Private Network It will be the mechanism by which the settlement ledgers of participating financial institutions and intermediaries stake their participation using a private Token (IVYB) which will be an Ethereum compatible ERC20 token that operates on the Ivy Private Network ivyReceive Contract is intended to be how the Ivy Network uses IVYB for its direct settlement of balances of recipient accounts When fully developed IVYB are anticipated to be asset backed tokens that reflect Ivy Private Network account holders that have fiat reserves capable of clearing transactions to the Ivy Network IVYB will be pre mined by the Company convertible to IVY by the Company only and given to Ivy Network account holders in proportion to their reserves in the Ivy Network In the case of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s use of IVYB the Company is intended to offer a public accounting of IVYB assets and liabilities to show that its dollar deposits on the network are always equivalent to its token holdings whether in escrow or reserve When message of a transaction pending arrives at the Ivy Private Network an account holder must stake its IVYB for the opportunity to receive the represented balance meaning that the Ivy Private Network account holder must have a balance of IVYB at least equal to the amount of the transaction In this interaction the process of staking the token provides the release of the supporting KYC/KYT/AML information to the institution or intermediary from which they are prompted to accept or decline the funds (manually or automatically if pre authorized) These Tokens are submitted to the ivyReceive Contract The ivyReceive Contract has two mandatory conditions for release of staked tokens a) Demonstration of Transaction Approval \xe2\x80\x93 Upon the review of applicable KYC/KYT/AML information an agent of the applicable financial institution sends either an approval or a denial response back to the ivyReceive Contract Here there are two potential outcomes a) the transaction goes through successfully in which case the IVYB are returned and the IVYB 26 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 \x0cvalue on deposit by the Ivy Private Network account holder at the financial institution for the intended recipient\xe2\x80\x99s account or b) the transaction fails in which case the IVYB are refunded to the financial institution and b) Demonstration of Cash Deposit \xe2\x80\x93 A monitor of the status of Ivy Private Network account holder\xe2\x80\x99s bank account provides the mechanism by which demonstration of cash deposit by the financial institution into the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s account has occurred This status may require either custom integration for the purpose of observing the account state or similar using account access services from vendors such as Yodlee13 Xignite14 or Plaid15 Either way the business to business arrangement between the Ivy Network and the financial institution will stipulate what the timing constraints for release of funds between the accounts are If both the \xe2\x80\x98demonstration of transaction approval\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98demonstration of cash deposit\xe2\x80\x99 are shown as true the party staking IVYB on the Ivy Private Network is eligible to receive payment from the unlocked ivySend Contract on the Ivy Public Network If both conditions are false or until they are otherwise set to true the ivySend Contract on the Ivy Public Network may be redeemed by the sender Transaction approval may be withheld by a financial institution as it seeks to clear identified compliance requirements through the use of KYC/KYT/AML data submitted with the Ivy data container Using metadata associated with the transaction and container it is possible to facilitate a degree of automated clearing on the basis of country of origin nature of goods exchanged in commerce or other configurable rules as desired by the processing financial institution or intermediary Just the same manual workflow may require that escrow be maintained for an extended period of time The default behaviour for submissions is for sender escrow to be determined by outcomes on the Ivy Private Network however it is envisioned that delays with the bank KYC/KYT/AML process and communication between sender and recipient may also require some accommodation whereby after a given period of delay the sender may unwind the process by choosing to retrieve a Token deposit from escrow It is intended that the ivyReceive Contract maintains an observable balance of all pending staked transactions Permissions on the Ivy Private Network provide isolation of the individual balances and workflow status of settlements pending at each of the Recipients\xe2\x80\x99 Financial Institutions and supporting Financial Intermediaries In this way the private token when locked in the ivyReceive Contract is intended to a) provide visibility to the process of consideration by which the financial institution or intermediary is considering the validity of the balance transmission and b) provide a throttle for the financial institution operations such that they may not stake a disproportionate amount of transactions without clearing them to satisfaction Of course this also raises the question of what compels the financial institution or intermediary to make the deposit as required at all For this purpose the Ivy Network will be able to report the service levels of each of the financial institutions and intermediaries on its network Clearly if a financial institution is not serving the needs of its clients the clients should have the ability to consider other options or opportunities from among the other participants on the Ivy Network where transfer receipt is either more timely or reliable c Interchain Communication and the Ivy Oracle Service The Ivy Network is intended to serve as a functional intermediary between the Ivy Private Network and Ivy Public Network detailed above listening to and responding to events associated with the ivySend Contracts and ivyReceive Contracts It is anticipated that state changes in the ivySend Contract are observed by authorized Ivy validators participating on the public Ethereum network Similarly state changes in the ivyReceive Contract are observed by Ivy Network validators participating on the Ivy Private Network Both of these validator sets will be able to inform the Ivy Oracle Service that provides attestation to the state of each escrow contract and facilitates their respective functions Of specific interest is how value moves from the Ivy Public Network ledger balance to the Ivy Private Network ledger balance This is intended to involve a value transfer from IVY to IVYB which occurs upon the approval message to the ivyReceive Contract and demonstration of posted balance to a recipient\xe2\x80\x99s bank account At the point when these two events occur the IVYB is released and the IVY in the escrow agreement is claimed by the Ivy Network The IVY receives the determination of the IVYB transaction on the Ivy Private Network ledger through the use of the Ivy Oracle Service and its constituent validators to the Ivy Private Network When the IVYB was committed to the ivyReceive Contract the public address of the sender to the IVYB will be recorded This public address was used for sending the Ivy transaction containerof KYC/AML information Subsequently 13 https //www yodlee com/ 14 https //www xignite com/ 15 https //www plaid com/ Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 27 \x0cthis address is used as a settlement account address for the Ivy Network to privately settle its own transactions against the network 2) Identity on the Ivy Network When fully developed it is intended that the Company will manage two types of identities on the Ivy Network sender identities and financial institution and intermediaries identities a Sender Identity The Ivy Network is intended to require senders to register with the network prior to sending currency It is assumed by the Ivy Network that recipients are identified by their respective financial institutions and intermediaries as part of establishing an account For establishing a sender account on the Ivy Network self sovereign identity is sufficient however additional transaction information may be required for authorization against the Ivy Network This information is submitted and stored by the sender on the Ivy Network to establish an account and allow for the Company to provide attestation for specific transaction types where supporting information is required Copies of sender sovereign identity information are packaged in the Ivy data container as part of the submission of the transaction to the intended balance recipient\xe2\x80\x99s financial institution and other intermediaries While specifically restricted to their purposes these credentials may be accessed and are relevant for extended periods of time beyond the transaction Using the Company\xe2\x80\x99s website it is possible to monitor who and when these credentials are being accessed on a continuing basis b Financial Institution and Intermediary Identity It is intended that Ivy will rely on the good hiring practice and vigilance of information security practices at the financial institutions and intermediaries where it communicates data It would be largely impractical for the Company to keep track of all employment events corporate and HR related activities Accordingly the Ivy Network will require the identity of relevant compliance staff at financial institutions intermediaries and interested agencies to be registered with the Ivy Network for the purpose of enabling and disabling access to distributed containers of KYC/AML data The Ivy Network will be updated on relevant employment actions of financial intermediaries on a timely basis It is anticipated that financial institution managers may log into the Ivy Network to manage the access and permissions of relevant staff to ivyReceive Contract functions and container data All activities of identified users can be centrally tracked and managed and individual transaction container history viewed 3) Blockchain Technology Application Consensus on distributed ledger is the function by which validators sometimes called miners determine the accurate representation of data as appropriate to reflect correct ledger balances given the transactions submitted to the network Given the opportunity for network and system disruptions it is easy to anticipate that there are opportunities by which some parties may be disconnected and miss important data during their unexpected absences Just the same in a network where there are shared perspectives there need to be established mechanisms to come by one settled outcome of the truth In networks such Bitcoin and Ethereum the current mechanism is called \xe2\x80\x98proof of work\xe2\x80\x99 Proof of work encourages validators to compete on the basis of computing power and electricity to validate transactions submitted to the network Having more computing power helps validators solve cryptographically difficult problems that are subsequently submitted to the network for the right to append captured transactions as blocks to the network (incidentally these blocks of transactions are validated on the predication of other blocks that have been previously submitted creating a chain\xe2\x80\x94 hence the term \xe2\x80\x98blockchain\xe2\x80\x99) As the blockchain grows new blocks increase in difficulty to append\xe2\x80\x94and validators compete at great expense for the value of both validation incentives and block rewards they hope to capture and redistribute within their networks While providing for a notion of byzantine fault tolerance this process is both expensive and slow for a private network Consequently this is why Bitcoin and Ethereum both process fewer than 20 transactions per second16 Alternatively a consensus mechanism called \xe2\x80\x98proof of stake\xe2\x80\x99 implemented by Tendermint and proposed as the \xe2\x80\x98Casper\xe2\x80\x99 consensus improvement to Ethereum moves the expense of gaining the right to append ledger transaction blocks from investment in computing and electrical power to investment in the cryptocurrency itself17 In proof of stake a party with proportionally more 16 http //www altcointoday com/bitcoin ethereum vs visa paypal transactions per second/ 17 CIT 28 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 \x0ccryptocurrency has proportionally more likelihood of appending the next block of transactions Because each validator is \xe2\x80\x98staked\xe2\x80\x99 in the network the network can potentially punish the validator by reclaiming their interests in the network for malicious behaviour that results in the production of false transaction blocks that requires subsequent correction by the rest of the network Challenges occur from this approach for two main reasons however a) any single party or colluding parties with 51% of the network value has a greater likelihood of wining consensus and b) a malicious majority cannot be overruled through the investment in computing power as proof of work allows Moreover just as proof of work requires validation incentives to for validators to capture transactions in the form of block rewards proof of stake similarly uses incentives (e g \xe2\x80\x98gas\xe2\x80\x99) to prevent the submission of transactions that create work without commensurate financial value on the network (e g spam) 18 In financial payments networks specifically private and permissioned network are more readily organized and governed by shared interest than public anonymous networks so issues of aligning incentives to prevent suspect behaviour give yield to concerns regarding practical throughput and resilience of coordinating functions that facilitate accurate and compliant settlement Networks including Stellar and Ripple use their own validators or shared participation of validators to shield their direct inputs to network results 19 whereby external and malicious participants are unlikely Here their consensus is focused on resilience and availability of distributed ledgers through their networks As a result throughputs are higher 20 The Company envisions the Ivy Private Network as consisting of validation nodes sponsored by entities other than itself The Ivy Private Network will be validated directly by financial institutions and intermediaries who are independent yet aligned In this environment spam messages from permissioned network participants seem highly unlikely and even deleterious to their shared goals for participating in the Ivy Network in the first place Greatly reduced likelihood of network spam and aligned incentives removes the need for block rewards that typically incentivize public blockchain networks For consensus the use of a scheduled byzantine fault tolerant algorithm such as Istanbul BFT makes most sense 21 In this consensus algorithm each participant creates blocks on a scheduled round robin basis and submits its results to the rest of the network which must vote with a 2/3 majority to approve the leader\xe2\x80\x99s block calculation This approach allows approximately 1/3 of validators on the network may prove to be malicious while still proving the network resilient Specific benchmarks of Istanbul BFT indicate that it is capable of ~1000 transactions per second 22 which reflects the total estimated network of interagency transactions that happen today between FedWire SWIFT and ACH today 23 For its purposes it is anticipated that the Ivy Private Network will initially adopt the use of Quorum JP Morgan Chase\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of permissioned Ethereum using the Istanbul BFT consensus algorithm 24 This implementation of Ethereum has a number of potential benefits for the Ivy Network a) it provides the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain as validated and improved in the context of a global financial institution b) it provides interoperability with smart contract development and investment that can be prototyped and made portable to any number of other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) supporting environments (including Ethermint Qtum and even the public Ethereum blockchain) 25 26 and c) given its familiarity as an alternative blockchain in the financial community its adoption and use provides a baseline of community and support most likely to be echoed in the same financial institutions and intermediaries that the Company seeks to support its network functions Quorum additionally supports alternative consensus algorithms based on authority of the leading validator should higher transaction throughput be required and stability of the intentions of network participants allow for reductions in block validation overhead 18 In public settings potential spam transactions can crowd legitimate transactions creating an environment similar to that which exists in the settings of a denial of service attack if validators are consuming effort with worthless transactions valuable transactions have a harder time being processed 19 CIT Stellar sharding 20 CIT 21 Byzantine fault tolerance or (BFT) is a reference to a problem in computer science that addresses coordination issues within networks of distributed systems commonly referred to as the byzantine generals problem whereby any single system actor left to their own devices is incentivized to work in their own interest instead of the honest interests of the network 22 https //www slideshare net/YuTeLin1/istanbul bft 23 CIT 24 https //github com/jpmorganchase/quorum 25 CIT

data integrity 27 28 A logical representation of a private network node is shown in the figure below Quorum Ivy APg IPFS Bigchain08 Conceptual Ivy Private Network Node 4) Ivy Data Containers It is anticipated that the Ivy Network will use dxChain cryptographic containers to store KYT/KYC/AML data in a date container (Ivy Data Container) Users submit their data through the distributed application interface on the Ivy web site at the time they request the transfer of currency This specific container format of the Ivy Data Container is shown in figure below Container Metadata Transaction Metadata Submitted Transaction Details Sender Identity Information Supporting Documentation and Attachments Ivy Data Container Contents of the Ivy Data Container are intended to include \xe2\x80\xa2 Container metadata \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction metadata \xe2\x80\xa2 Submitted transaction Details \xe2\x80\xa2 Sender identity information (as applicable) \xe2\x80\xa2 Supporting documentation and attachments Using this format each component of supporting data is independently and persistently encrypted to secure access at rest and during exchange using standard AES 256 symmetric and 4096 bit RSA asymmetric cryptographic methods and SHA 384 message digests Digital signature based on RSA asymmetric keys are anticipated as vulnerable to both Grover\xe2\x80\x99s29 and

quantum resistant algorithms as better understanding and support by industry becomes available 31 Cryptographic containers are intended to provide for a few key features to the Ivy Network \xe2\x80\xa2 Provide persistent control and protection of all communicated information \xe2\x80\xa2 Provide ability for the Ivy Network to add or remove parties to the container after initial receipt and \xe2\x80\xa2 Provide the sender with surety that the specifics of their transaction with the recipient are confidential Through the use of Ivy Data Containers individual behaviours against the network can be tracked and verified Ivy Data Containers are intended to store both structured and unstructured content collected from the ivySend Contract submission process Where applicable Ivy normalizes the collection of data within the Ivy Data Container to comply with data sets codes and formats of the ISO 20022 standard 32 a Generation and Storage of Ivy Data Containers When fully developed upon submission of content to an Ivy Network contract a request is made to the Ivy Network to generate a container of the relevant data The application will send submitted KYT/KYC/AML data to the Ivy Network and return the container identifier back to the sender The sender submits their Ivy deposit and the generated container identifier to the ivySend Network contract When generated the Ivy Data Container becomes resident on an IPFS file system that is hosted within the scope of the Ivy Private Network The Ivy Private Network file system will allow for sharing of relevant content within the network 33 Three separate writes of the container are made to the Ivy Private Network to ensure file redundancy as only local copies are guaranteed upon request A mapping of these container identifiers and object identification points on the Ivy Private Network are stored in a BigchainDB network that is shared between the nodes of the Ivy Private Network 34 Retrieving Ivy Data Containers involves querying the BigchainDB network by the container identifier of the generated container to receive the relevant object identifiers for retrieving related containers Within the Ivy Network this functionality is abstracted and maintained by a hosted service on the permissioned network Ivy Data Containers may be copied and stored freely without violating their underlying security model b Accessing Ivy Data Containers It is intended that access to Ivy Data Containers is managed by a network bound access management service that is responsible for handling requests for specific portions of Ivy Data Container content and providing requisite access on the basis of the following criteria (for the purpose of simplification users systems and processes of systems are treated as user requests) a) the requesting user\xe2\x80\x99s organization \xe2\x80\x93 the determination of whether the KYC data relates to a transaction that occurred by the requesting user\xe2\x80\x99s organization or alternatively if the requesting user\xe2\x80\x99s organization is a regulator b) the requesting user\xe2\x80\x99s submitted credentials \xe2\x80\x93 the determination of whether the requesting user\xe2\x80\x99s credentials are current per communication between Ivy Private Network account holders and the Ivy identity management environment and c) specific administrative restrictions placed on the requesting user\xe2\x80\x99s submitted credentials and the specific types of identity information being requested For example specific information identified as Personally Identifiable Information may not be available to all requesting users These restrictions are coordinated between administrators from constituent financial institutions and the Ivy Network Upon successful authorization to the Ivy Data Container requested content is presented to the requesting user or process 30 31 32 33 34 https //en wikipedia org/wiki/Shor\xe2\x80\x99s_algorithm http

Rights and Tokens are considered highly speculative and the purchase of Rights and Tokens carries with it a number of risks The Directors strongly recommend that potential purchasers consider the risk factors described below together with information contained elsewhere in this paper and consult their professional advisers before deciding whether to acquire Rights and Tokens If any of the following risks are unacceptable to potential purchasers then the potential purchaser should not purchase Rights or Tokens The order of the risks set out below is not intended to have any bearing on the likelihood of such risk arising or importance of any such risk to any particular purchaser Purchases of Rights and Tokens should only be undertaken by individuals or entities that have significant experience with and understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens like Bitcoin and Ether and other blockchain based software systems Purchasers should have a functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens The Company is not offering advice and the Company will not be responsible for any lost funds Rights or Tokens resulting from actions taken by or omitted to be taken by purchasers Loss of access Tokens may be stored in a wallet and be accessible with (inter alia) key signatures Loss of the requisite private key(s) associated with a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s digital wallet will result in loss of the stored Tokens If a purchaser does not maintain an accurate record of its private key or the password used to access its private key this may lead to the permanent loss of access to its Tokens Purchasers must safely store their passwords in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location Any third party that gains access to a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s private key may be able to gain access to the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s Tokens If a potential purchaser does not have such experience or expertise then it should not purchase Rights or Tokens Risks associated cryptocurrency protocol Tokens are based on cryptocurrency protocols Any malfunction unexpected functioning forking breakdown or abandonment of the Ivy protocol may have a material adverse effect on Tokens For example this might adversely impact a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s ability to transfer or securely hold Tokens In addition advances in cryptography or the development of quantum computing could render ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ivy protocol Any such impact could adversely affect the value of Tokens 36 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 \x0cMining attacks Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Token transactions on the Ivy blockchain including but not limited to double spend attacks majority mining power attacks selfish mining attacks and race condition attacks Any successful attacks present a risk to the Tokens including but not limited to accurate execution recording of transactions involving Tokens and expected proper payment operations Hacking cyber threats and security weaknesses Hackers individuals other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Tokens and any platform on which they are traded in a variety of ways including but not limited to malware attacks denial of service attacks consensusbased attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers could present risks to the Tokens which could result in the theft or loss of Tokens Markets risk The Company cannot fully control the actions of any or all purchasers of Tokens Even if secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation Furthermore to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e g as denominated in a fiat currency) such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to nil If a purchaser chooses to use Tokens on exchanges it is at the purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s own risk Such exchanges are independent of and are not operated or controlled by the Company Risk of exchanges Cryptocurrency exchanges on which Tokens may trade may be relatively new and are likely to be largely unregulated and may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than well established regulated exchanges Where cryptocurrency exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in Token trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues such cryptocurrency exchange failures may result in a reduction in the price and value of Tokens Uninsured and transaction losses Unlike funds held in accounts at banks or some other financial institutions Tokens are generally uninsured unless a purchaser specifically obtains private insurance In the event of loss of Tokens or the loss of the ability to use the Tokens there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged in respect of the Tokens If Tokens are stolen or incorrectly transferred such Tokens may not be recoverable and the Company takes no responsibility for their recovery As a result any incorrectly executed Token transactions could adversely affect the value of Tokens Cryptographic token transactions are not reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or in theory control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the host blockchain platform Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a datablock that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a Token or a theft of a Token generally will not be reversible and there may be no compensation for or avenues of legal or other recourse in respect of any such transfer or theft Such loss could adversely affect the value of Tokens generally Uncertain regulations enforcement actions and geopolitical events The regulatory status of the cryptographic tokens blockchain and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications including the Tokens It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting blockchain and distributed ledger technology and its applications including the Tokens Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Tokens in various ways including for purposes of illustration only through a determination that Tokens are a regulated financial product or instrument in one or more jurisdictions that attracts disclosure registration or licensing requirements or by the banning of the use of or dealings with Tokens altogether The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or meet the relevant regulatory requirements to operate in such jurisdiction Ivy White Paper v1 5 June 2018 37 \x0cPolitical or economic crises may motivate large scale sales of Tokens which could result in a reduction in the price and adversely affect the value of Tokens Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative decentralised means of transacting and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events Large scale sales of Tokens would result in a reduction in the liquidity of such tokens Tax The tax characterization of Rights and Tokens and the tax ramifications of holding Rights and Tokens is uncertain in many jurisdictions Purchasers must seek their own tax advice in connection with purchasing Rights and Tokens which may result in adverse tax consequences to Purchasers including but not limited to withholding taxes income taxes and tax reporting requirements Purchasers bear the sole responsibility for any taxation requirements in purchasing using and holding Tokens Unfavourable currency fluctuations The Company intends to use the proceeds from selling Rights to fund the maintenance and development of the Tokens The proceeds of the Offer will be denominated in United States dollars If the value of United States dollars fluctuates unfavourably during or after the Offer the Company may not be able to fund development of the Tokens Extreme volatility Tokens are not intended to represent any formal or legally binding investment and will not necessary be tradable on any public market once developed In addition cryptographic tokens that possess value in public markets have demonstrated extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand Exchanges and public markets are independent of and are not operated by the Company Trading on any exchanges or public markets is at each purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s own risk and the Company cannot and does not guarantee any market liquidity or saleability of Tokens Additionally different regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions and the potential inability of citizens of certain jurisdictions to open accounts at exchanges located throughout the world the liquidity of Tokens may be materially different in different jurisdictions This would likely be reflected in significant price discrepancies between markets It is also possible that the value of Tokens will drop significantly in the future Any such drop in the value of Tokens could adversely impact the Company\xe2\x80\x99s ability to raise funding for continuing operations including the development of the Tokens It is possible that a competing cryptographic currency could have features that make it more desirable than Tokens to a material portion of the cryptographic token user base or that there could be a general reduction in the use of cryptographic tokens due to an overall reduction of confidence in the technology Any such occurrences may result in a reduction in demand for and use of Tokens which could have a negative impact on the price of Tokens generally In addition a lack of stability in the cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges due to fraud business failure hackers or malware or government mandated regulation may result in greater volatility in the price of Tokens Intellectual property rights claims Third parties may make intellectual property ownership claims relating to the Rights or Tokens and/or their source code or other underlying intellectual property Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property claim or other legal action any threatened action may adversely affect the value of Tokens Unanticipated risks The Rights and any to be developed Tokens represent a new and relatively untested technology In addition to the risks noted above there are other risks associated with any purchase of Rights or Tokens the holding of Rights and Tokens and the use of Rights and Tokens including risks that the Company has not anticipated Unanticipated risks may come in the form of variations or combinations of the risks set out above or otherwise 38 June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1 5 \x0cGlossary ETHEREUM Ethereum is a leading decentralized platform for smart contracts utilizing the Solidity
