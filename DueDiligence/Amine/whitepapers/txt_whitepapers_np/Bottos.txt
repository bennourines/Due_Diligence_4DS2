Bottos Team and Development Planning 70 6 1 Bottos Team Introduction 70 6 2 The Timeline of the Bottos Project 71 3 \x0c1 Overview and Design Concept of Bottos What is Bottos Bottos is a decentrilized infrastructure that focuses on artificial intelligence It is designed to be a consensus based scalable easy todevelop and synergetic one stop application platform for data model computing power and storage capabilities through data mining and smart contracts Bottos has a bottom level public blockchain specially designed on the basis of data characteristics as well as a platform for data circulation among different participants within a broad based AI ecosystem Bottos can be applied to fields of big data artificial intelligence smart hardware robots Internet of Things VR/AR and so on In a word Bottos is not only an artificial intelligence public blockchain but also provides services for data and models circulation It realizes the value transferring of artificial intelligence and its derivatives fed by data eventually forming a new decentralized AI ecosystem The basic public blockchain of Bottos is designed to serve artificial intelligence and has strong industrial attributes for its performance advantages in data computing storage sharing and more Its original 4 \x0ctechnologies mainly include smart token design lots drawing DPOS algorithm and decentralized storage with AI algorithm leading competitive advantages in data privacy protection big data storage etc The basic service blockchain of Bottos aims to create a decentralized platform for data circulation which helps obtain AI training data and attracts active participation of AI and its derivatives The ownership of data and models is assured to encourage users to share and then make transactions quicker Smart contract lifecycle management can be beneficial to eliminate trust cost and improve efficiency of AI and its derivatives Bottos adopts DApps as its main application development layer which can be classified into three types AI AI Derivatives and blockchain based Technologies DApps based on blockchain Technologies such as Lightning Network Oracle Sidechain and Cross Chain are mainly used to improve Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 ecosystem and will constantly emerge with the iteration of blockchain technology As for AI DApps focus on pure software and feature iterations and upgrades of models after data feeding DApps in AI Derivatives refer to the intelligent hardware internet of things and robotics that combine software and hardware which act as sources of new AI data through hardware All DApps make closed loop demands for data eventually forming a data collection pool worldwide Demands being mapped through blockchain based technologies also exist among intelligent modules of DApps that can finally form a huge module collection pool In other words model is a kind of data and will form a decentralized data collection pool that can be called 5 \x0cIPDB (Note In general the data here has a more generalized definition and it contains models ) In terms of artificial intelligence Bottos draws on the successful experience of the Ethereum ecosystem and then builds a decentralized artificial intelligence infrastructure to break the \xe2\x80\x9cisolated Data Island\xe2\x80\x9d eliminate trust cost and to realize data and model sharing in scale Bottos also helps AI form relation mapping by using eco DApps to accelerate the iterative scene based functionality of AI which accordingly produces integrated effects and will ultimately help realize practical artificial general intelligence (AGI) In terms of data sharing Bottos encourages users to share data through an economic incentive method called data mining to solve the problem of inaccessibility to high quality data in the industry Bottos will build the world\ s largest data/model pool (IPDB) based on blockchain technology which is going to greatly promote the registration exchange and circulation of highquality data and model assets/IP that possess real time value Bottos as a publich blockchain for AI Blockchain is a kind of data structure based on cryptology technology which organizes and maintains large amounts of data in a decentralized way All the data on the blockchain is attached with an individual digital signature that cannot be forged In addition the totally public facing blockchain enjoys various advantages such as high reliability instant settlement and distrust It 6 \x0cenables global data sharing and traceability which will make it possible to establish a global decentralized AI data training platform with larger scale and higher quality that can control the privilege and conduct audits Bottos a public data blockchain for artificial intelligence can greatly protect the privacy of user data and ensure that all data should be authorized by users before circulation and the users\xe2\x80\x99 data won\xe2\x80\x99t be sold again without a second authorization due to its unique performance Nowadays as the Network Security Law are increasingly perfect and sound 90% of big data companies are on the verge of survival and thus abuse of user data and leakage of personal privacy will surely become a thing of the past Also as data security is rising to a country\xe2\x80\x99s strategic level blockchain based on cryptography technology organizes and maintains large amounts of data in a decentralized way which will enable global scale data sharing and help AI break data oligarchs and build a new AI ecosystem Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 Design Philosophy Data is treasure Dominating data makes power In this case pursuing autonomy and decentralization is necessary Bitcoin has implemented autonomy and decentralization of property rights through public key cryptography and POW consensus mechanism While Bottos transfers and upgrades data speeds up data flow and then accelerates the evolution of artificial intelligence through data mining Data is the new form of oil The Bottos platform gathers numerous 7 \x0ccompanies focusing on big data artificial intelligence intelligent hardware robots Internet of Things etc All of these companies will be DApps on the Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 platform They take data as \xe2\x80\x9doil\xe2\x80\x9d and create new productivity in a decentralized way There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that AI will have new productivity in the future and blockchain technology will restructure productive relation Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 platform implements a new decentralized AI ecosystem based on blockchain technology Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 Solutions The public blockchain of Bottos is designed around the characteristics of data to conquer issues like \xe2\x80\x9cdata security\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clarge scale data storage\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdata cleansing and labeling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdata fraud\xe2\x80\x9d The public chain is created by original technologies including \xe2\x80\x9cprudent identity system\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clots drawing DPOS consensus based algorithm\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent portion storage\xe2\x80\x9d (Note Details refer to the published technical documents ) To serve the community and DApps is the criterion of a public blockchain The pioneering DApps multi value token system is implemented rapidly around the world to apply DApps into business in an intelligently derivative way Data mining is also initiated to encourage data sharing which can help users liquidate their unique data so that everyone is able to boost AI 8 \x0cBottos\xe2\x80\x99 platform assembles a large number of continuous AI training data and models With the expansion of the community and AI resources rules modules based on blockchain technology can be stacked making the whole ecosystem possible to evolve into artificial general intelligence (AGI) Innovations of Bottos\ Key Technologies 1 Original Data Market mechanism to launch the engine of high quality data flow 2 Initiative data mining and intelligent storage to ensure data security and privacy 3 Pioneering multi value and its value system to rapidly put DApps into practice Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 Goals 1 To establish a decentralized AI infrastructure to realize Artificial General Intelligence 2 To build the most efficient intelligent data exchange center worldwide 3 To set pricing standard of data assets 9 \x0cBottos\xe2\x80\x99s Application Scenarios 1 Big data Data is a future asset for enterprises so is personal data Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 built in authentication system specifies the uniqueness of data as an asset after the registration and validation on the blockchain Big data companies can access Bottos as nodes to realize correct data confirmation and data circulation They can liquidate their own data as well as ensure data privacy and ownership Big data companies can also collect data through Bottos\ s huge community and achieve one to many data cleansing and labor subcontracting of data tagging via smart contracts 2 Artificial intelligence and AGI With the recently popular AI algorithms such as deep neural networks Monte Carlo search trees intelligence in specific fields is not far from us but the development of artificial general intelligence is seriously lagging behind On the one hand Bottos can help artificial intelligence quickly obtain the needed training data On the other hand it can invite all AI participants via smart contracts and eliminate trust cost to greatly boost the research and development of AI Bottos can accelerate the arrival of AGI for speeding up the circulation of data that allows isolated data and models to form a new accumulation With Bottos artificial intelligence has obtained not only high quality training data development capital but also the market valuation of data and models as well 10 \x0cas Token\ s liquidity eventually setting a market pricing standard for data and models 3 Smart hardware Internet of Things Robots etc Smart hardware Internet of Things and robots all belong to the upstream artificial intelligence and are combinations of software and hardware Here hardware can be regarded as a tool for data collection Bottos starts with data mining for which intelligent hardware Internet of things and robots can be seen as mining machines at the data level On Bottos the combinations called artificial intelligence derivatives can achieve product crowdfunding and mining machine iteration by working as mining machines to mine data which in turn realizes a dual upgrade of software and hardware The implementation of artificial intelligence derivatives on Bottos includes the creation circulation and buy back of Tokens New tokens are expected to come along with every promising technology products and will be generated by data mining like Bitcoin after people use the corresponding products On the Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 platform the worthy Token can apply for a direct exchange with the Bottos Base Token (BTO) via a community poll 4 Super Robots The super robots people usually imagine are like terminators who are capable thinking deformable and equipped with various inductive and recognition functions The future AI is strong AI and robots will also have emotions To make robots execute human instructions and prevent similar 11 \x0cbehaviors like attacking human requires the entire transparent and open robot intelligent module which means only the robots recorded on the chain can guarantee safety The number of robots in the future will be so many times larger than that of humans that the centralized management will lag behind The necessity of registering recording and managing the birth and historical behavior of robots in a distributed manner inevitably brings the \xe2\x80\x9crobot national ledger\xe2\x80\x9d In the future robots can access Bottos\ built in identity management system in the form of nodes 12 \x0c2 Project Background Market research firm IDC predicts that by 2025\xef\xbc\x8cthe \xe2\x80\x9cdigital universe\xe2\x80\x9d (data created and replicated every year) will reach 180 ZB(1 80\xc3\x971023 bytes) which will take more than 450 years with broadband to transmit From toilet seats to toasters subways to wind turbines more and more equipment is becoming the source of data collection Everyone is competing to collect much more data from different sources such as photos and video streams uploaded by social network users information generated while commuting or exercising as well as numerous sensor output data attached to different scenarios on the jet engines Data is to AI what \xe2\x80\x9cmilk powder (formula)\xe2\x80\x9d is to a baby With the iteration of artificial intelligence technology the quality and scale of data have become the bottleneck for its development The data scale becomes even more significant after an eye catching paper was published in 2001 by two researchers from Microsoft Michele Banko and Eric Brill First they described that the number of training words used in most natural language processing work is less than 1 million which is a very small data set For the algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Perceptron the error rate is as high as 25% while the more advanced newer memory based algorithm 13 \x0chas an error rate of 19% Here are four data points at the far left of the following picture Source Banco and Brill 2001 It is not the most amazing thing Later Banco and Brill showed impressive results As you add more data\xe2\x80\x94several orders of magnitude and then keep the algorithm consistent the error rate will sharply decrease The error rate is less than 5% when three more orders of magnitude are added 18% and 5% make great difference in many fields because the latter is valuable in practice But will the error rate keep decreasing significantly if the data scale reaches a higher order of magnitude Data quality determines artificial intelligence models 14 \x0cBesides the data scale data quality plays a decisive role If the junk data is adopted to train models you will get models of low quality The junk data may come from malicious or non malicious breakdowns that can crash or tamper the data such as faulty IoT sensors faulty data sources or environmental radiation that causes bit flipping (bad error correction mechanism) etc It makes sense that AlphaGo eventually chose the wisdom of high quality groups rather than just learning a massive chess manual AlphaGo invited more than 200 second rate chess experts to evaluate the nodes and then summarized their results to beat a world\xe2\x80\x99s champion Later it introduced machine learning to win Ke Jie a Go championship holder 13 times in a row Initially Facebook and Google collected users\xe2\x80\x99 data from reviews likes and other interactions to improve targeted advertising In recent years these companies found that data can be highly utilized for artificial intelligence (AI) or \xe2\x80\x9ccognitive\xe2\x80\x9d services and some can also generate new sources of income In the age of traditional Internet it takes considerable cost to collect vast amounts of data If you have resources in hand you can easily get data Sometimes you even firmly keep your data to yourself In this new world data is the oil and artificial intelligence algorithms are what will consume it More data means more wealth but big data is controlled by few people Nowadays when an App is installed it is a must to \xe2\x80\x9cagree and install it\xe2\x80\x9d We are using our data in exchange for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d services Whether this 15 \x0ctransaction is fair or not depends on where the value of these services come from data or an algorithm for analyzing and processing data In the early stages of web searching the value of newly added data decreases as the size of data increases The increasing information won\xe2\x80\x99t create more value once exceeding a certain threshold However with the growing self learning ability of the algorithm in the era of artificial intelligence the apps get more and newer data as feedback creating better search results For example with online car hailing new data may not add value as it has enough data (such as real time traffic information) But the new data can serve other purposes as long as you continue to collect such as route planning Massive data of uneven quality may advance the quality of the AI model(Figure 1) but only new data with high quality (may not massive) can drive and make qualitative change to a model(Figure 2) Big data companies especially Internet companies that can obtain massive real time data from different users are impossible to surpass by other companies for constantly optimizing their systems through analyzing these data Sometimes small companies may call data via the API provided by large companies but no data on user behaviors is publicly available for free thus forming a monopoly on data Actually this monopoly can also be regarded as the monopoly on information and resources in the information age 16 \x0cFigure 1 MORE data > Model + Figure 2 NEW data > NEW model However this will be a thing of the past Throughout the development history of artificial intelligence it has moved from the first stage features technologies driven by algorithms and computation to the second stage data deeply driven by massive amounts of structured and reliable data And when it comes to the third stage scenariodriven force dominates We are now undergoing the transition from the second stage to the third stage On the one hand the deep learning model is upgrading (such as the migration learning model and the multi task learning model) on the other hand compared to millions of training data for a rough AI model thousands of tagged training data that has undergone refined processing can also achieve the same goal Artificial intelligence models are mainly based on deep learning models Deep learning models are rarely used in medicine education and many other fields of daily life though they are now influential in the fields of voice image recommendations etc First it lies in that the data we get is often small such as data on personal mobile phones educational and medical testing as well as questions and answers of customer service Second deep learning model 17 \x0ctransforms the original features from low level to high level in a non linear way which is a very complex and fragile process The third problem is the application especially the personalization of learning and application in machine learning Taking the mobile phone as an example any recommendation on information and services should be suitable for the users\xe2\x80\x99 behavior Since any personal data is small the problem here is how to adapt the general model of the cloud to the terminal\ s small data so that it can work better This requires an upgrade of the deep learning model such as a migration learning model that focuses on small data training namely a task parameter that is specifically optimized and performs well when dealing with another task which can help machine learning migrate to the mobile from the cloud In this way individuals will have a learning model completely personalized and decentralized which subverts the centralized model in the era of artificial intelligence 2 0 This is the AI democratization advocated by Li Feifei a professor of Stanford University and the founder of ImageNet\ s The decentralized AI model built through the integration of blockchain artificial intelligence and data will be the milestone in this era of AI democratization To simply make the most of small data we are not far enough in the artificial intelligence 3 0 era How to quickly obtain tagged training data after refined processing also determines the evolutionary speed of the artificial intelligence model In general the more accurate the data is the better the model will be as well as the product effect As a result Artificial intelligence 18 \x0ccompanies must accumulate tagged data that is more refined and accurate conforming to their own application directions Different application directions require different content and even different tagging methods which constitutes an on demand market Also the tagging is demanding most artificial intelligence companies and crowdsourcing platforms cannot meet these requirements To a certain extent the competitiveness of an artificial intelligence company depends on the quality of tagging data data collection data cleansing etc In the third stage of artificial intelligence in which dimensions and quality of data collection are more demanding we can not only provide personalized services for different users but also implement different decisions under different scenarios in a real time way for promoting better development and giving decision makers a keen insight of the event to make more accurate and smarter decisions By contrast the traditional way of information gathering on the Internet can hardly meet the personalized needs In the age of artificial intelligence the value of data wealth will gradually manifest and data is spawning new economies With the amount of data increasing artificial intelligence creates new productivity while blockchain reconstructs production relationships We are about to enter a new era of distributed artificial intelligence as the scale and quality of data is increasing that makes artificial intelligence models continuously iterated and stacked Distributed computing speeds up the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) Therefore 19 \x0cwe firstly proposed the concept of a decentralized artificial intelligence infrastructure tailored for the artificial intelligence industry from the bottom layer of the blockchain the service layer to the application layer Bottos implies the robot operating system and Bottos hints the BOT ATTOS (Italian) A combination of these two words means creating a distributed intelligent robot system with artificial intelligence developers from all over the world Hence Bottos was born 2 1 An Overview of Problems Saving your data as a competitive advantage or sharing with others Artificial intelligence adores data The more data that is collected the sounder the model will be In general the data is like an isolated island especially in the new environment where data is encouraged to only serve yourself acting as your \xe2\x80\x9cmoat\xe2\x80\x9d However with a blockchain control featuring decentralization/sharing data sharing is easy and possible which can bring more fresh data that can make newer better models 20 \x0cFigure 2 Analysis Framework of Big Data In the above framework (Figure 2) the closer it is to the bottom layer the more time the data analysis process takes When it climbs to the top side decision making time gets rather shorter In terms of frequency and data value a process at the top offers low frequency but high value while one at the bottom features high frequency but low value That\xe2\x80\x99s why Bottos encourages data sharing which in turn improves models and then lowers costs and brings higher profits (Figure 3) Centralization or decentralization Even though sharing can be achieved without blockchain by some companies the benefits of decentralization are worth more First decentralization helps build a sharing infrastructure which is conducive to a uniform standard for the whole 21 \x0cecosystem thus establishing a universal registration center Second decentralization makes it easier to turn data and models into assets for others to use via authorization which can be profitable Third decentralization helps to form a global scale data sharing the IPB (the Intel Planetary Data Base) Figure 3 Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 Analysis Framework of High Quality Data Many companies have selected and repackaged public data to use easily in certain aspects such as APIs for weather or network time as well as financial data for stocks and currencies To date the public data market value has reached over one billion US dollars Bottos also aims to build such a platform to make data access through a single database in a similarly structured way (or just through the API) With regard to the external data 22 \x0cOracle can play its role in making data easy to use via the blockchain In short Bottos hopes to create new dimensions for numerous databases and data sources General public blockchain or public blockchain exclusive to artificial intelligence Bitcoin went on line in early 2009 marking the first generation public blockchain Around 2014 the integrated public blockchains such as Ethereum featuring smart contracts came into being which could support diverse business scenarios and derived quite a few decentralized industrial applications (DApps) Meanwhile lots of challenges are inevitable in the development of the public blockchain As a matter of fact the current public blockchain platform mainly supports virtual digital assets and virtual digital application scenarios and has a weak connection with the real world generally reflected in both performance and diverse business requirements The problem of performance is easy to understand due to the naturally irreconcilable contradictions between decentralized features and TPS (Transactions Per Second) Ignoring the impact of hardware dropping the decentralized features of the public blockchain will inevitably improve TPS Besides it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for the relatively fixed single public blockchain to meet the diverse demands among various actual application scenarios because industries individually have their own unique governance models access requirements privacy protection etc As the next generation public blockchain system that precisely serves the AI and its derivatives in architecture governance models and development Bottos has been digging into AI and 23 \x0chas presented its unique innovations in consensus algorithms decentralized storage and architecture governance in order to quickly mature DApps which is one of Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 core goals Keep data like an isolated island or select the high quality data together As already mentioned common people don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to confirm whether there is any defect in training data and what the data in and out of the model is like Therefore the data provider only needs to label the model with a timestamp in each process of building and running models and then add the labeled models to the blockchain database (including digital signature for models) making data traceable in model aspects/application models In this case it is beneficial to discover leakage and tamper fraud in data supply chain on all layers so that the reason why the mistake occurs is clear The same data source reviewed in many ways will guarantee the validity of data and models To be free or charged Data and AI models protected by copyright law can be used as an intellectual property (IP) asset Once the data/model is built you will own the copyright and be able to authorize others to use it Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 system will build a decentralized exchange center to create various functions of data/model assets such as registration circulation transaction etc Decentralization here avoids entities from controlling the data storage infrastructure or subjects from owning the ledger Instead the registration of 24 \x0cthe entire ledger is done by the consensus based nodes of the whole network All of these will bring a truly open data market which is exactly what people in the fields of data and AI expect for quite a long time Permissions can also be used as assets in Bottos Data creators can draw up the license in advance to limit the using of upstream on launched data such as read privileges or view privileges only for a certain part of the data /model The rights you own can also be transferred to others in the system just like Bitcoin The data/model permissions can even be regarded as original assets of Bottos Artificial Intelligence DApps and Data Mining Bottos builds a decentralized database infrastructure via decentralized processing (using smart contracts to be the storage state machine) which is consistent with the essence of smart contract technology like Ethereum On the basis of Ethereum DApp projects can be used mutually due to the interrelated business models which helps to build a strong ecosystem that AI currently lacks With an underlying blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts Bottos creates the \xe2\x80\x9cdata investment\xe2\x80\x9d making the entire process of data training models accumulate wealth independently The Bottos opens source community will be committed to acting as Ethereum in the AI community which will attract global AI companies developers data companies and individuals to jointly build a brand new AI new economy 25 \x0c2 2 Mission and Vision As an infrastructure focusing on AI Bottos has a bottom level public blockchain specially designed on the basis of data characteristics as well as a platform for data circulation among different participants within a broad based AI ecosystem The data circulation in Bottos which constitutes the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest pool of data collection based on blockchain technology originally creates smart contracts featuring data investments to realize personal data assets shared via data mining In this way the data circulation forms a connection between the value of personal data and AI models curing the pain of inaccessibility to highquality data in the AI industry Bottos will greatly promote the registration exchange transaction and circulation of high quality data and model assets IP that possess real time value which will provide high quality data/model resources for data demand parties and implement shared value for data/model providers by the way of \xe2\x80\x9cdata investment\xe2\x80\x9d through highly scalable smart contracts Bottos will usher in a revolution in the AI industry bringing a series of systematic market changes in artificial intelligence smart hardware robotics the Internet of Things and so on Bottos has been designed as a platform for a new AI ecosystem which will power artificial intelligence We believe that the coming of artificial intelligence will form a global pool of structured big data so that all of us can share the new fortune in the data era 26 \x0c2 3 Major innovations (1) Building a public blockchain exclusive to AI based on blockchain technology Blockchain is a new application mode of several computer technologies such as decentralized data storage point to point transmission consensusbased mechanism and encryption algorithms Bottos creates a public blockchain exclusive to AI which is based on the public blockchain with four main features First it encourages data sharing under the control of decentralization/sharing In this way Bottos will provide more data for AI thus providing better models as well as new models Second this public blockchain transforms AI products into DApps on Bottos through data mining which can quickly realize the upgrade of software and hardware Third it will trace the provenance for data/model via tamper resistant/audit tracking records thereby changing the credibility of data and models making intelligent robot ID systems for recording all data possible Fourth by building original assets/establishing an exchange center registered data/model permissions can become intellectual property (IP) assets to form a decentralized exchange center and a value definition platform thereby establishing a high quality data circulation center and heading for the formation of the world\ s largest data collections pool (2) Everyone boosts AI Decentralized collaboration implements AGI (Artificial general intelligence) clusters 27 \x0cAt present AI possesses various powerful capabilities including computing derivation searching recognition and prediction The integration and amplification of these capabilities will only enable AI to become a rational smart machine in the future instead of being as smart as human pets like cats and dogs that have the smart nature with obvious life characteristics for its lack of spontaneity and subjectivity sensibility and other conscious traits Besides AI doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a carbon based material composition mechanism like mammals so that we cannot impose peculiar intelligence attributes that mammals possess on machines (AGI\ s research partly starts with analyzing the neural mechanism of the brain )Therefore the exploration of AGI doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily rely on methodology that simulates the neural mechanisms of human brains or advanced mammals It is possible that the self knowing intuition characteristics of the digital life can be motivated after AGI exists in the form of data (usually also information) gets developed and stronger on the rational level This inspired time node is scientifically known as the arrival of AI singularity which can be implemented in the BOTTOS ecosystem as follows 1 Quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes 2 Masters from the general public disturb the transformation process effectively (3) Data Market works as a launch engine for high quality data circulation Data Market including Oracle and DataFeed mechanisms is the bridge between the real world and the data world for Bottos that aims to build a world class high quality data training platform Data Market is the launch 28 \x0cengine for high quality data circulation to make external data easy to use via blockchains Meanwhile Bottos is also an artificial intelligence model pool which can be easily called and stacked by artificial intelligence companies to form more advanced models In a word Bottos hopes to expand a new scale for numerous databases and data sources including model libraries and model sources (4) Data mining and smart storage have become models for the design of data public chain The bottom layer of Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 system not only uses the account system to achieve compatibility with external virtual machines such as Ethereum EVM but also creates contracts with smart data investment to achieve economic incentives for the original data/model assets making the process of the entire data training model itself able to accumulate wealth The data and model wealth is reflected in the whole ecosystem of Bottos which is the value in data and model circulation Bottos can be used in artificial intelligence and its derivative industries including big data Internet of Things smart hardware robots etc The companies focusing on big data and Internet of Things can access Bottos as data nodes and gain benefits by sharing data Intelligent hardware robots and other combinations of hardware and software can design their hardware to collect valuable data just like mining machines which can generate revenue and realize the dual iteration of hardware and software to rapidly develop this industry after the use and mining of their users The introduction of AI 29 \x0ctechnology into the design of the bottom chain is a unique feature of Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 public chain and DApps ecosystem on Bottos in the coming years For one thing decentralized storage is an indispensable part of data security for another Bottos creates a service sample in decentralized computing and other aspects for the main chain by introducing AI technology into decentralized storage (5) The pioneer of multi value system and its value system to help DApps improve quickly Bottos is committed to building a new ecosystem of artificial intelligence and an exclusive public chain of artificial intelligence an infrastructure that serves AI and making the design of tokens more flexible The pioneering multi value system and its value system allow the main Token to have its own stable value mechanism with lock in incentives and secondary derivation which can be integrated with the business entities and help DApps improve quickly (6) \xe2\x80\x9cToy Brick\xe2\x80\x9d model with dynamic node The blockchain is composed of different nodes with relatively fixed functions which greatly limits the expansion of blockchain functions and makes it hard to exploit the advantages of division of labor brought about by blockchain decentralization As an artificial intelligence infrastructure the Bottos blockchain provides different services Therefore as the node introduces the micro service architecture the node functions can be 30 \x0cdynamically organized and defined The node types can also be dynamically distributed to the blockchain network which forms a decentralized network composed of different functional nodes The node can be flexibly deployed in different systems according to different functional requirements It can be a host with lower performance a powerful workstation or a cloud computing platform to form a flexible and configurable network system To this end the Bottos system proposes a manageable dynamic node model that supports the deployment and management of nodes as well as the release and update of node functions (7) One stop service and release of DApp The Bottos designed microservice architecture brings the flexibility of functional deployment while the business DApp provides convenience for flexibility in deployment Considering the difficulties of a DApp\xe2\x80\x99s development and deployment Bottos proposed one stop development and deployment services of DApp providing the corresponding basic features to support DApp agile launching systemically \xe2\x9e\xa2 Support Token\ s distribution naming hosting and other services \xe2\x9e\xa2 Support Off chain data storage service to solve chain storage problems \xe2\x9e\xa2 Support the release and discovery of DApp services to make 31 \x0cit easy for users to uniformly call \xe2\x9e\xa2 Provide decentralized transactions of DApp Tokens to rapidly realize and converse Token value \xe2\x9e\xa2 Provide one click rapid deployment for DApps installation and deployment \xe2\x9e\xa2 Provide DApp related contract management and deployment to support promising standardized contract templates 2 4 Core objectives 1 Build the world\ s most efficient AI data exchange center Bottos builds a decentralized AI data exchange center based on blockchain technology which allows the world to cooperate more efficiently and allows the data to be richer and more reliable Bottos provides better models out of new scale data for AI developers and companies as well as updated models due to updated data 2 Building a new artificial intelligence ecosystem The Bottos platform allows any dev team or company to build AI algorithms/models and then fund the search for high quality data to train algorithms/models meanwhile bringing new economic incentives to those data providers It also makes crowdsourced intelligence and aggregated data 32 \x0cmore appreciated At the same time the user base of Bottos has also continuously grown due to the continuous expansion of ecological applications It has obtained traffic from the entrance of products such as smart hardware within the ecosystem which has further increased the value of the platform 3 Form the pricing standard of global data assets Bottos aims to build a global open data exchange platform with a single pool of liquidity that makes it possible to create artificial intelligence projects easily When a large number of data transactions are possible the Bottos platform will continuously update the system through artificial intelligence algorithms and eventually become the standard for data assets 33 \x0c3 Core Commercial Logic 3 1 Layered Design of Bottos The Bottos platform will consist of three main layers the bottom layer the service layer and the application layer Figure 4 The main layers of the Bottos platform The Bottos public blockchain includes the bottom layer and the service layer and the bottom layer covers account based systems POS consensus algorithms smart contracts etc The Bottom Layer of Bottos adopts an account model to implement Bottos VM which is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and other public blockchain Virtual Machines 34 \x0c3 2 Bottos Data Services Bitcoin pioneered computing mining for tokens successfully However it consumes massive computing and other resources So we put forward a new model for data collection and data mining in which users only need to offer the testing data instead of investing computing largely The tokens can be earned by maybe uploading some dialects several birds\xe2\x80\x99 pictures or audio files It is more meaningful to issue tokens in this way which is more in line with the idea of a modern sharing economy Figure 5 Function Diagram of Bottos 35 \x0c36 \x0cThree parties of data collection 1 Demander of Model Data (hereinafter referred to as Party A) 2 Provider of Model data (hereinafter referred to as Party B) 3 Verifier of Model Data (hereinafter referred to as Party C) Figure 6 three parties of data transaction 37 \x0c38 \x0cTwo basic points of data mining 1 The blockchain guarantees the traceability and tamper resistance of any operation 2 User\ s credit(data quality rating) will be affected by any malicious operation which will largely decide the user\ s income 3 3 Bottos Storage Service As a provider of the data exchange market itself Bottos with a core technology of data storage needs a massive reliable and decentralized storage system to collect data Therefore Bottos designed decentralized storage and realizes this co building node storage service through incentive mechanisms 39 \x0cConsidering the users\xe2\x80\x99 storage requirements Bottos provides two choices First it provides a basic storage service for the ordinary users whose data storage is certain short term and of small scale Second it provides paid storage service which is available in the Bottos\ storage transaction market for the specific users whose data storage is long term and of large scale Bottos will provide tokens as an incentive on its platform for those individuals or organizations who contribute the nodes and register its storage capabilities including capacity interfaces storage types and corresponding Service Level Agreement (SLA) 3 4 Bottos Algorithm/Model Service Artificial intelligence companies can register and publish algorithms or models through Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 model market Also those companies can purchase the corresponding computing and virtual machine resources from the Bottos system to deploy the algorithm model register the API accessing interface in Bottos and launch it into model trading market with a fixed price Then users can purchase the algorithm and model with tokens via API calls 40 \x0cFigure 7 Bottos Algorithm/Model Service 3 5 Bottos\ computing service Machine learning especially deep learning algorithms costs a large sum of computing At the same time deep learning and neural network algorithm themselves require multi node cooperative computing The blockchain itself is exactly a decentralized computing resource which features decentralization and incentive mechanism It improves the management and sharing of computing resources and then builds a larger and more convenient computing resources pool by using the computing resources inside a data center collaborating and sharing unused and scattered computing resources Meanwhile with the development of 5G and IOT it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to equip discrete computing resources such as edge computing and fog computing with a more extensive and reliable management network Blockchain is able 41 \x0cto create a shared transparent and tradable computing environment to organize these resources In short a blockchain decentralized resource pool promises trustworthy and value based management than can make better use of various computing resources from cloud computing resources to discrete computing resources 3 6 Eco Applications of Bottos DApps DApps Includes artificial intelligence robots Internet of Things and other strongly data dependent application industries The application layer based on the core layer and service layer mainly exists in the front end in which some applications may be built by Bottos (such as location sharing) while others will be built by the community and third parties We hope that the Bottos community can attract worldwide developers to build a variety of applications Applications developed by third parties may charge additional fees or use other business models such as market making information sales or advertising As put in the next section many Bottos applications may take owning tokens as a core part of the business models Bottos will be committed to creating a high quality data circulation platform that helps AI Insight and others to realize algorithm upgrades and model upgrades by simple plugging and provide users with more and newer value 42 \x0c3 7 Concept of Bottos Multi Value System Different trading products offer different values which are hard to unify That\xe2\x80\x99s why multi value comes in handy Pricing it with a single token may distort the values fail to reflect the value of the product reasonably and interfere with each other For example if one type of token is used for the value of data and price of storage the exchange between them could be unfair as data cost and actual storage cost may make a great difference It can\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the true cost with a token valuation and when seeking for a unified price at their respective markets will interfere with each other which makes it hard to find a balance point for the different market capacity Ethereum\ s GAS similar to fuels such as gasoline is consumed in every transaction namely it is paid by each sides of the transaction EOS adopts the \xe2\x80\x9cland lease\xe2\x80\x9d model that purchases system resources according to instantaneous or long term use based on bandwidth and computations While The Bottos\ \xe2\x80\x9cGAS\xe2\x80\x9d design is similar to the sunlight land model in which a certain amount of sunlight wind rain and so on are generated on per unit of land Light wind power and water here are all fuels for Bottos applications We call this analogy design Multi value In the Bottos system the land area is the amount of BTO holdings and units of BTO can be mortgaged to generate a certain percentage of stable value which is able to be integrated with the business entity Multi value has the main characteristics listed below first the Bottos eco 43 \x0cvalue can realize value exchanges on an atomic level second the atomiclevel exchanges can happen between the Bottos ecosystem and other public blockchain ecosystem that is to say functional tokens such as storage tokens and computing tokens can be compatible with other ecosystems and other main blockchains can also use Bottos\ s storage and computing resources third in the application layer DApps can also realize multi value for the DApp internal autonomy and integration with the business entity There are lots of resources on the earth including the \xe2\x80\x9cland\xe2\x80\x9d of EOS and the \xe2\x80\x9coil\xe2\x80\x9d of Ethereum For Bottos the sunlight rain and wind on the earth are all resources Although the sun emits light and heat infinitely during a certain period of time the radiation on the surface of the earth is basically constant so is the wind and rain These resources consumed by photosynthesis of green plants transform wastes such as carbon dioxide into their own energy nurturing the earth This kind of ecology on the one hand coincides with Bottos\ s idea of converting neglected and wasted personal data into AI productivity that serves humanity On the other hand it can maximize the value of land (BTO) as the land is value added not only due to its scarcity but also because it makes \xe2\x80\x9cpoor land into an oasis\xe2\x80\x9d In a word Bottos has a double valued effect (Details refer to the technical whitepaper ) 44 \x0c4 Application Scenarios In the previous chapters of Overview and Design Concept of Bottos a brief introduction has been made to the Bottos\xe2\x80\x99s application scenarios including the fields of big data AI robots IoT and so on This chapter is mainly to further describe the application scenarios in order to better develop the economic applications of Bottos In recent years AI has developed into the second stage that is driven by big data after finally conquering problems that have existed for decades One of the key points from Go to human speech recognition is that AI has the ability to collect and learn massive amounts of data that lowers the error rate Big data has completely transformed AI Throughout several popular applications of AI (see figure below) a common characteristic is that a large amount of data has been accumulated for algorithm / model training in the Internet era such as real time trading data in finance trading data in ecommerce etc 45 \x0cFigure 8 The application scenarios of AI in the second stage In the previous abstract we discussed the driving forces in the different stages of AI We have moved from the first stage when AI was driven by algorithms and computing to the second phase in which AI is ignited by a large amount of structured and reliable data While in the third stage scenarios are the main driving force in which case AI not only can provide personalized services for users but also execute different decisions under different scenarios For example in the field of facial recognition devices with this function are useless for frontier guards who must wear masks to prevent frostbite at 40 degrees below zero Also facial recognition requires individuals\xe2\x80\x99 photos of all ages which are easy for everyone but rather difficult for web crawlers to 46 \x0ccollect Therefore in the third stage AI demands higher dimensions and quality of data collection and formulates different decisions according to different scenarios in which case things will develop better and decisionmakers hopefully have a deeper insight whose decisions can be more accurate 4 1 Bottos and DApps To serve the community and DApps is the criterion of Bottos public blockchain The pioneering DApps multi value system is implemented rapidly around the world to apply DApps into business in an intelligently derivative way Data mining is also initiated to encourage data sharing which can help users liquidate their unique data so that everyone is able to help boost AI 4 1 1 Classification of DApps on Bottos Bottos can deploy Dapps in a one stop way The categories include \xe2\x9e\xa2 Sidechain technology lightning network status channels and other blockchain technologies that improve the performance and scalability of Bottos public blockchain \xe2\x9e\xa2 Pure software of AI technologies like AI algorithm models \xe2\x9e\xa2 Other AI derivative technologies combining software and hardware like smart hardware robots In addition to AI and its derivatives big data and IoT can also 47 \x0cbecome nodes on Bottos which is one of the essential links in the Bottos Ecosystem 4 1 2 Bottos and DApp AI companies can launch and deploy their own AI algorithms and models and purchase the corresponding computing resources as well as data on Bottos These companies will use the data for learning and training to deploy AI services and form their own DApps so that they can gain revenue by registering services provided by DApps on Bottos and providing an interface for external users to access AI companies can also sell algorithms and models in the market to obtain the corresponding Token by direct transaction Besides they can choose to tokenize the services provided by DApp and issue their own tokens on the platform so that consumers should pay specific tokens when using DApp services in this way these companies can realize financing and value their services 4 2 Bottos and AI As for AI we hope one day that it can have insight and make decisions like a human A human being is a collection of various abilities and born with fixed genes that can be analogous to the algorithm models of AI When we are learning we just input the data and our brains extract and store the rules In this way AGI can learn rules through certain data training as time accumulates by finding common learning modes or algorithms which are just 48 \x0clike human genetic genes At the same time human learning is a coherent behavior A simple ability learned before can be the prerequisite for the next skill to be learned that is iterate high level modules are based on the junior modules Therefore artificial general intelligence needs to be fed with continuous training data and of course it can be piled up directly with different rules and modules that have been trained Bottos is such a platform that speeds up the data circulation allowing isolated data and models to form a new accumulation which can accelerate the coming of AGI 4 2 1 Bottos and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) With the development of AI people will have different opinions on the definition of AI that seems to be constant at present For example the automatic visual recognition of car license plates and the automatic recognition of handwriting were considered to be cutting edge AI technologies 20 years ago however these common pattern recognition technologies in people\xe2\x80\x99s subconscious are no longer advanced AI technology or even AI technology Curiosity drives human infinite exploration of the material and spiritual world People\ s curiosity and awe of strong AI (or artificial general intelligence also called AGI) are based on the fact that AGI still has a long way to go As advanced tools AI and machine learning have greatly improved their 49 \x0capplication effect due to the current methods based on probability statistics and search (Hidden Markov Monte Carlo Tree and Bayesian networks) and those based on connectionism (various neural networks) as well as the tremendous improvement of computing However the current technology has not found the way to AGI When AI develops to a certain stage it may encounter a bottleneck once again if it only depends on the development mode of big companies and large organizations without a figure like Einstein that promotes the development of AI like the promotion of modern physics in the 21st century On one hand although AI possesses powerful capabilities of computing derivation search recognition and prediction and the integration and amplification of them will enable AI to become a rational smart machine in the future its lack of spontaneity and subjectivity sensibility and conscious traits results in that AI looks far less \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent\xe2\x80\x9d than human pets cats and dogs\xe2\x80\x99 intelligence has obvious life characteristics which can\xe2\x80\x99t be found in AI at present On the other hand since the mechanism of AI is different from that of the mammal which is carbon based material composition mechanism we cannot impose some specific intelligence attributes of mammals on machines (The research on AGI partly starts with analyzing the neural mechanism of the brain) Therefore the methodology for the exploration of AGI doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on simulating human brains or the neural mechanisms of advanced mammals When AGI that exists in the form of data is developing and strengthening continuously at the rational level the characteristic of digital life\xe2\x80\x99s intuition may be motivated This inspired time node is scientifically known as the coming of 50 \x0cAI singularity and its implementation can be briefly summarized in the Bottos ecosystem as follow 1 Quantity change leads to qualitative change Newer features and breakthroughs emerge in Bottos due to the global scale of the AI data and models collection pool 2 Experts from the public rather than just one or two companies effectively influence the transition process 4 2 2 Bottos and Speech & Semantic Recognition Language recognition as the technique that converts language into text is a branch of natural language processing The main steps of the foreground are divided into three steps signal collection noise reduction and feature extraction The extracted features are decoded in the background by the language model obtained by linguistic big data training finally converting the language into text so that the machine can recognize and understand the aim of the language At present the maturity of language recognition technology can reach 95% but the change brought by the accuracy from 95% to 99 99% is a qualitative leap which will make people tend to use the language frequently As a kind of one dimensional time domain signal language recognition has two main difficulties in actual operation The common difficulty/pain point in speech recognition is the cocktail party problem that is how to find signals that need to be identified among numerous noises and interference signals which is particularly prominent and difficult to solve especially in the cases with very large noises and interferences The first is the acquisition and cleaning of data Language recognition requires the support of massive 51 \x0cstandardized corpus data in specific fields while the diversity of local dialects has particularly increased the workloads of corpus search Through the Bottos platform the data acquisition and cleaning can be completed directly point to point and subdivision work can be achieved as well as corpus search workloads can be greatly reduced through economic incentives The second is the extraction of linguistic features which now mainly depends on deep learning with a multilayer neural network equivalent to a feature extractor This kind of extractor can achieve the maximum reduction of signal features by describing the characteristics of the signal layer by layer from part to whole general to concrete On Bottos many language recognition developers can create models of different language features according to their own preferences Like minority languages language recognition developers can take their own advantages to commercialize their personalized models they develop on this platform In this case many giants in the field will be interested to this such as IFLYTEK CO LTD Which dialect do you want Siri to say And which is more convenient Taiwanese Sichuan dialect Hunan dialect Shandong dialect Northeast dialect or Mandarin We know that the current languages that can be recognized by AI speech recognition are Mandarin and Shanghai dialect Whether it is Apple Siri or Microsoft \xe2\x80\x9cXiao Na\xe2\x80\x9d a large number of AI companies need to collect a large amount of recorded audio for the development of dialect speech recognition Bottos\ s high quality data circulation platform can help developers quickly collect personalized dialect 52 \x0ccorpuses and make the models quickly matured and improved by peer to peer and other better economic incentives finally realizing business value Just like the speech recognition Bottos\xe2\x80\x99s semantic recognition is similar to the decentralized Wikipedia which is making the AI model proven and sophisticated by peer to peer technology The difference here is that Bottos is based on blockchain technology which makes the data for model training credible and traceable and everyone involved can share product value 4 2 3 Bottos and Computer Vision The main bottleneck of computer vision is that current image recognition technology can hardly solve the problem of incomplete overexposure and dark images due to the influence of a picture\xe2\x80\x99s quality and lighting environment In addition subject to the amount and quantity of marked data it is difficult to make a breakthrough of current algorithmic iteration in the specific application scenarios without large scale or high quality subdivided application scenario data High quality models can be trained by high quality data which can be realized in Bottos High quality data can be collected via peer to peer technology and economic incentives on Bottos\xe2\x80\x99s platform expanding the volume and quantity of tagging data and resulting in personalized computer vision model with better quality Similar to speech recognition Bottos also obtains image data by establishing a peer to peer connection between developers and users For example many wild bird photographers have stored large amounts of high 53 \x0cdefinition pictures in their own albums Bottos works as a paid sharing platform making it possible for individuals to liquidate their data and support the development of AI technology 4 3 Bottos and Big Data Data will be a new asset of companies and personal data is also emerging as a new asset Blockchain allows data to truly flow with \xe2\x80\x9cconfidence\xe2\x80\x9d 4 3 1 Bottos and Data Confirmation Built in identity authentication system Bottos solves the unique problem of data asset through the registration of the blockchain to confirm the right Big data companies can access Bottos as nodes to realize data confirmation transaction circulation and liquidation while guaranteeing data privacy and ownership 4 3 2 Bottos and Data Authorization Data analysis is the core of realizing data value To effectively protect personal privacy and prevent leakage of core data is the primary solution in data circulation when analyzing data For example with the popularity of face recognition fingerprint data analysis applications and methods of genetic data detection and analysis more and more people are worried about the serious consequences of personal health data leakage Bottos can prevent this through encryption digital signatures distributed 54 \x0cintelligent storage and community governance When the value data is hashed and placed on the blockchain only authorized people can access the data on the static node with digital signature technology 4 3 3 Bottos and Big Data Sharing How can Bottos advance the yield of medical big data Here is the typical illustration Bottos gathers the power of the community and attributes the ownership of the data to the owners Users can manage their digital assets with Bottos such as personal electronic medical records (electronic format or photo & image data etc ) which can be uploaded on users\xe2\x80\x99 local nodes with private keys\xe2\x80\x99 access restriction avoiding legal restrictions on personal medical data Another example is personal genetic sequencing which can be be completed with distributed computing resources on Bottos at low cost Bottos has a special security design for the data allowing sequencing to become the solution of industrialization on a global scale thereby advancing the massive growth of data Big data companies can also accomplish one to many labor subcontracting in data cleansing and tagging through smart contracts by the data collection in Bottos\xe2\x80\x99s large community 4 3 4 Bottos and Data Privacy Security In the Bottos ecosystem users\xe2\x80\x99 data can be stored on decentralized blockchain nodes and analyzed without accessing the original data through distributed smart storage which can not only protect the data privacy but also make it safely shared with scientific research institutes and doctors worldwide All of these make a basic human health database to battle sudden 55 \x0cand difficult diseases in the future Anyone can independently manage their own data assets and provide an interface for their ledger Bottos strictly controls data fabrication and tampering with a design of multi value system in its community governance making a high cost for bad actors and widespread influence 4 3 5 Bottos and Data Tagging The cost of data tagging is very high in the current AI industry which is time consuming and critical in primitive accumulation Bottos is just settling on this point and creating great industrial value through multi role participation of community nodes or types of data crowdsourcing platforms that may subvert the AI industry 4 4 Bottos and Smart Hardware Nowadays smart hardware such as smart bracelets watches doorbells and door locks have entered into the public\ s vision many of which are related to our lives and health However the data monitoring function of smart hardware is very weak which is vulnerable to hacker attacks such as smart door locks Hidden dangers of smart hardware have caused accidents and disputes which blocked the development of smart hardware At the same time the current smart hardware with a single function and weak user\ s viscosity also restricts the development of the industry 56 \x0c4 4 1Bottos and Data Sharing Bottos is safer than any current database that relies on the central system because it can stop users\xe2\x80\x99 data from being kept on any intermediary or centralized server through no centric nodalization of blockchain technology The accessing of smart hardware into the Bottos system returns data ownership to the users who share their data thus generating data\xe2\x80\x99s value Namely users can own the profit by participating in data sharing 4 4 2 Bottos and Smart Hardware Data Mining Bottos pioneered a mining model of digital assets based on blockchain technology that allows users to earn digital assets through data mining We have combined AI with hardware into AI derivatives The role of hardware is the collection of new data Therefore in data mining the hardware is the mining machine The scenarios with a combination of Bottos and smart hardware are numerous Bottos allows users of smart hardware to participate more deeply in the construction of AI systems which will effectively solve the problem of low efficiency and high optimization costs of AI self accelerating AI development For example in the AI field children\ s smart story machines can identify their dialogue scenarios but the current overall development is relatively slow with a clumsy voice and semantic recognition While after using the Bottos system the project party of a children\ s smart story machine can transform the chip and encourage users to complete AI tasks such as using more of the voice conversation function to feedback the dialogue experience 57 \x0cand to upload dialogues that they feel are good for enriching the semantic library Any contributions like these will help users earn tokens which can be used to purchase more services and products The subversive point of this approach is to truly benefit the early adopters of the product Traditionally the birth of a smart hardware or robotic product requires a set of processes including prototype product crowdfunding make models and mass production sales updating replacing The more iterations of the product the better the performance experience and the cheaper the price The drawback of such a process is a limited early development of the product which is obvious for the first batch of users who bought this product with a high cost and poor experience However with Bottos the sooner the first users contribute their data the sooner they\xe2\x80\x99ll get the AI tokens which means more earnings that can balance out the pre purchasing cost 4 5 Bottos and the Internet of Things Similar to smart hardware Bottos\ decentralized structure ensures the security of the Internet of Things (LoT) At the same time the distributed computing system can greatly reduce the pressure on the center\ s computing and releases more possibilities of the organizational structure of the LoT providing more space for innovation Moreover the decentralized approach stores the data in different nodes to ensure data security and prevent attacks such as DDOS Besides chaining into Bottos allows the participating parties to collaborate with multiple parties 58 \x0c4 5 1 Bottos and Selection of Value Data Here the distributed devices of the IoT are used as data collection sites (as one observed point without active output) and those devices only count and verify the characteristics they have observed and use them comprehensively In the Bottos system valuable data will be selected so that there is no junk data to occupy resources At the same time Bottos makes it difficult to falsify data making the data brought by the Internet of Things more accurate and effective 4 5 2 Bottos and Sharing Economy In Bottos no longer considered as a point the terminal device can actively participate in the resource entities of the Internet of Things allowing more resource interactions and collaborations between terminals Terminal equipment as a participating node in Bottos can provide resources such as storage calculation and data In Bottos terminals can be assigned to different owners through smart contracts and idle resources can be sold to obtain corresponding values with little additional cost thus the sharing economy becomes more thorough 4 6 Bottos and Intelligent Robots Automatic control machines are commonly known as robots which include all the machines that simulates human behavior and thoughts as well as other organisms (e g robot dogs robot cats ) Robots consists of smart modules based on AI of which some specific skills are beyond humanity in a 59 \x0csense Paolo Dario a professor from Santa Ana University in Pisa Italy gave a keynote speech at the 2017 World Robotics Conference in which he pointed that the robots surely develop with a certain risk and may need to be regulated In essence the robot is not a separate unit On the contrary it will become an interconnected robot group We should treat them as foreign entry as the robots are increasingly advanced and powerful Hence it is necessary to be aware of the birth the historical behavior records and other information of each robot as well as its genetic composition and the directions in which its future iterations will take place The ultimate goal of Bottos is to realize the friendly collaboration between robots and humans in the future The platform aims to help intelligent robots grow rapidly in a distributed manner at this stage With Bottos robots can realize the one stop transformation to become a blockchain robot achieving rapid iteration 4 6 1 Bottos and Robot ID Cards In the future the number of intelligent robots will be larger than that of humans It is absolutely necessary to identify and certify their information on what smart modules they contain and what data they are fed before the robots leave the factory which paves the way for robots management and laws and regulations for robots Bottos\ built in ID management system is designed to be a robot national 60 \x0cledger which works as Credit Archives for robots that consist of all round information of each intelligent machine/equipment basis point including robot\ s brand its manufacturer traceability fully transparent supply chain peer to peer intelligent identification credible identity verification decentralized collaboration smart data exchange device Token transfer and so on 4 6 2 Bottos and Robot Transformation Bottos is designed to help robots realize blockchain transformation Here is the feasibility listed in the four main points First robotics start ups launch crowdfunding on Bottos to raise the first round fund for model production in the way of basic tokens on Bottos as well as issuing their own Bot Tokens Some key information of the products will be totally public on the chain and each robot will has its own ID Second robotics start ups design its products as data collector that is conducive to the iteration of products When users use the robots and sell the data to the start ups it constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cdata mining\xe2\x80\x9d With Bottos\ economic incentives start ups can quickly obtain valuable data for product improvement Third users can use the acquired token to purchase other services provided by the company or the next generation of products Token can also be exchanged at Bottos\ built in decentralized exchanges and used to purchase other services in the Bottos\xe2\x80\x99 system Tokens play a role in anchoring 61 \x0cthe value data circulation and model iterations throughout the entire process in which case a tokens value reflects the overall market value of start ups and their products Finally according to the collected data the start ups can keep feeding and designing new AI modules to improve product performance enhance user experience as well as realize blockchain transformation of robot products 5 Bottos Governance Structure 5 1 Establishment of the Bottos Foundation The Bottos Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the Foundation ) is a non profit organization which is committed to the development and construction of Bottos as well as the advocacy and promotion of governance transparency to promote the safe and harmonious development of the opensource ecological society The Foundation will help to manage the general
