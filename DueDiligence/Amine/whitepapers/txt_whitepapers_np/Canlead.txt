system would allow the first party to share any opportunity and the second party to earn from referring any opportunity to the third party without going through an intermediary Contracts provide part of the solution but the main advantages are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent false opportunities and collect payments We propose a solution to the false opportunity and payment problem using a peer to peer to peer network based on the distributed ledger technology (DLT) blockchain and smart contract Furthermore tokenization of opportunity converts an opportunity be it a job product or service into tokens enabling referrers in a referral chain to refer portions of the opportunity and earn rewards in cryptocurrency It\xe2\x80\x99s a new recruiting and marketing method allowing businesses to create opportunities transfer and share values more seamlessly than ever before Aimed at the forward thinking companies and individuals who seek to create values from the opportunity they want to share with their network 2 0 Introduction The purpose of Canlead is to bring together and improve upon the concepts of social networking sharing economy token ecosystem and allow developers to create consensus based applications that have the standardization scalability and interoperability Canlead does this by building an ultimate multi party tokenized incentive system whereby everyone in the network is motivated to participate because of the reward and reputation system for opportunity sharing and earning Selling products and hiring people relies mainly on the intermediary whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a company or an individual to connect unique opportunities to talented candidates or entities While the system works well enough for most transactions it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model the speed of delivery and prone to dispute The cost of selling and hiring increases transaction costs depending on the monetary value of the opportunity limiting the maximum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for large transactions Typically a payment provider such as PayPal Worldpay or Stripe charges a 3% transaction fee so a $1 000 000 USD business deal would incur $30 000 in transaction fees These costs and payments can be avoided by using an offline method or make payments over a cost effective platform without a trusted party What is needed is an opportunity and referral platform with a payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust allowing any two willing parties to transact directly and cost effectively with each other without the need for a trusted third party Transactions that are immutable would protect sellers or hirers from fraud and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect referrers or buyers In this white paper we are laying the foundations for a decentralised platform that will have built in incentives for everyone producer (customer provider or host) broker (referrer agent or leader) and consumer (friend seeker or candidate) A platform that is open and free to evolve is highly scalable and has no single point of failure Page 4 of 41 \x0cCanlead will target the recruitment market first and focus on the job boards recruitment agencies and freelancers Who We Are Canlead Limited was registered on the 14 December 2016 in the United Kingdom (Reg No 10524761) to provide software and services Canlead has built and maintained the Canlead platform beta version since 2018 Qindel Group is a technology consulting partner based in Madrid Spain is working in conjunction with Canlead utilising their technology know how to strengthen our capability We are committed to building a Web 3 0 sharing economy application platform and contributing to the 4th industrial revolution As a result Canlead is investing in the future development of the distributed ledger technology blockchain A I and leading the community towards a better and smarter future Our Vision and Mission Referral recommendation and word of mouth have been the norm in how people refer other people in both marketing and recruitment since the beginning of their existence Today technology advancement has reached a point where an opportunity could be tokenized shared referred and earned in a decentralised network \xe2\x80\x8bWith this realization that everyone needs an opportunity such as a job Canlead aims to incentivise people to share and earn from any opportunity they may find on chain 3 0 Current Landscape The past 15 years have seen the emergence and proliferation of many social networking technologies and social media platforms that have significantly changed the way individuals connect and interact with friends family and professionals online These platforms have had a significant impact on the way in which people create and refer opportunities be it a job product or service how we work and ultimately to establish and maintain a public or private network of connections with limited regional boundaries We create and refer opportunities all the times and most often via word of mouth Page 5 of 41 \x0cAt the same time many businesses are looking to capitalise on the opportunities presented by today\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly globalised business environment driving international expansion is at the forefront of their strategy and roadmap Today we create and refer opportunities using phones emails and online platforms such as LinkedIn the best innovation in the recruitment industry since 2003 Sharing is hip disruptive and a potentially lucrative investment theme Furthermore there is a growing trend the \xe2\x80\x98Sharing Economy\xe2\x80\x99 it is important to understand that this is not a vision of the future but that it is already long in progress These newer online platforms are already transforming 21st century business via disruptive business models like on demand (Uber) rental (Airbnb) gig (TaskRabbit) access (Spotify) collaboration (WeWork) platforms (Amazon) circular (ThredUP) and peer to peer (Lufax) As BofAML points out these tech focused models are unlocking the value of unused and under used assets driving a shift from asset heavy to asset light businesses and enabling access over ownership [2] The way we do business in the future will change the way we work and our working environment Canlead offers a solution that lets people refer talents to people and not resumes Hence improving the hiring experience and earning for all The Future of the Professional Services Industry An Age of Disruption Many industries and business models are at risk of being disrupted due to rapid technological developments enabling new business models replacing old distribution channels and changing the way people and businesses interact with each other [3] Page 6 of 41 \x0cCanlead has created a new \xe2\x80\x8bSharing Economy 2 0 business model that will transform the way people share and earn from opportunities New technology will enable recruiters marketers agents and freelancers to focus on customer relationships The Future of Jobs Employment Skills and Workforce Strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Disruptive changes to business models will have a profound impact on the employment landscape over the coming years Many of the major drivers of transformation currently affecting global industries are expected to have a significant impact on jobs ranging from significant job creation to job displacement and from heightened labour productivity to widening skills gaps In many industries and countries the most in demand occupations or specialities did not exist 10 years ago and the pace of change is set to accelerate [4] Canlead will incentivise everyone user and community alike as well as creating new opportunities a different way of working and doing business we bring it onto the street To address these evolutionary changes and market needs Canlead has created a new business model that improves productivity built a platform that combines the power of the social networking technology sharing economy model and Canlead incentive system After 18 months of research and development Canlead has launched a beta product to test the market The positive responses from its partners in technology recruitment and consultancy are indicators of a good product market fit and therefore the business value has been proven 4 0 Recruiting and Marketing Challenges More specifically the world of recruiting and marketing has undergone a major transformation in the last decade Changing employment trends social media and Page 7 of 41 \x0ctechnological advancements evolving employee demographics just to name a few These factors have all contributed to the ever evolving recruiting and marketing industry In order to keep up with these changes it makes sense for recruiting and marketing leaders to be proactive keep an eye on current and upcoming strategic challenges in talent and customer acquisition and work towards implementing innovative technology This section outlines some common challenges from recruiting to marketing concerning Canlead they will be addressed in section 5 and 6 4 1 Hiring and Recruiting The hiring and recruiting process in the current landscape is complex often involving many processes online systems and requires a significant amount of time effort and costs particularly in the technology market The typical customer agency and job seeker\xe2\x80\x99s challenges are highlighted below CUSTOMER (Fintech Enterprise) \xe2\x97\x8f The internal hiring process is often long complex and expensive \xe2\x97\x8f The average recruitment agency fee is 20% or $20 000 per hire based on a $100 000 salary \xe2\x97\x8f The average enterprise hiring cost is $4 000 per hire \xe2\x97\x8f The average hiring timeline is 4 months per hire \xe2\x97\x8f Often difficult to assess the skills and professionalism of the candidate due to the lack of reliable data \xe2\x97\x8f The candidate response rate to an in house recruiter on LinkedIn is 8% \xe2\x97\x8f The employee referral program does not often deliver the expected outcomes AGENCY (Technology Recruitment Agency) \xe2\x97\x8f The recruitment business is highly competitive particularly in the technology market \xe2\x97\x8f The operational cost is expensive so young and inexperienced recruiters/ consultants are often employed to keep this cost low \xe2\x97\x8f The sale lifecycle is very long particularly with large customers \xe2\x97\x8f The number of contract job opportunities a recruiter closes is 2 2 per month \xe2\x97\x8f The number of permanent job opportunities a recruiter closes is 3 per month \xe2\x97\x8f The average remuneration is $5 000 per recruiter per month \xe2\x97\x8f The average placement cost is $2 272 per hire for a contract job opportunity \xe2\x97\x8f The placement timeline is 1 to 4 weeks \xe2\x97\x8f The candidate response rate to an agency recruiter on LinkedIn is 8% \xe2\x97\x8f The referral scheme does not often motivate the network of associates or deliver the expected outcomes Page 8 of 41 \x0cCANDIDATE (Job Seeker) \xe2\x97\x8f Finding a desirable job opportunity is often difficult due to a vast amount of job boards \xe2\x97\x8f Customising resumes to fit each job description is time consuming candidates often have many versions of their resume \xe2\x97\x8f Good job opportunities often go to the recruiters\xe2\x80\x99 network first \xe2\x97\x8f The average timeline is 3 months to find and start a new role \xe2\x97\x8f Often difficult to understand the job description due to lack of information \xe2\x97\x8f Recruiters send job opportunity messages to users in Linkedin which often resulted in users disengaging these messages \xe2\x97\x8f Candidates often disregard the recruiter referral scheme due to a previous negative experience 4 2 Advertising and Job Boards The end to end process from source to hire requires a significant amount of traffic effort and cost CUSTOMER (Retail Enterprise) \xe2\x97\x8f Difficult to measure the ROI of the job board service costs \xe2\x97\x8f Customers and employers often create such long and clunky application processes that put off candidates from applying JOB BOARD (Big Co) \xe2\x97\x8f It is difficult for job boards to prove to their customers (employers) that they have generated a hire Candidates may see a job on the job board during the day at work but when they are at home they may go direct to the employers website to apply which means that there is no way to track the candidate from the job board This in turn makes it difficult for the customer to measure the ROI of the job board service costs \xe2\x97\x8f Many recruitment systems do not provide an end to end tracking capability e g from job registration job application to the job offer and candidate hired This again means that even though the job board has generated real applications the employer does not have very good tracking in place to measure it \xe2\x97\x8f And finally even where the tracking is in place and job boards can show they have generated 1000 clicks from the job board to employer job view the drop off rate may be up to 90% so the employer then claims the job board offers poor traffic quality when in reality candidates do not want to fill in yet another form to apply for a job CANDIDATE (Job Seeker) Page 9 of 41 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f There is no incentive for any candidate to interact with the job boards other than sign up and apply to the job advert which limits the amount of traffic they are trying to increase 4 3 Sales and Marketing The sale process requires a significant amount of time effort and cost particularly in the enterprise software market CUSTOMER (Technology Software Vendor) \xe2\x97\x8f The sale process is often long and expensive \xe2\x97\x8f The typical deal size is $200 000 to $1 000 000 per enterprise software product such as Red Hat ServiceNow and Oracle is often in the multi million dollar range \xe2\x97\x8f The typical cost of sales is $50 000 to $100k per deal \xe2\x97\x8f The typical timeline from lead to deal (contract signed) is 6 to 9 months \xe2\x97\x8f Often difficult to assess the prospective candidate (enterprise) pain points and needs due to the lack of reliable data \xe2\x97\x8f The typical referral incentive is 7% for the bronze partners and ranging from 20% to 30% for the gold partners CONSULTANCY (Technology Consultancy and Reseller / Partner) \xe2\x97\x8f The consultancy business is highly competitive particularly in the technology market \xe2\x97\x8f The sale lifecycle is often very long particularly with large clients \xe2\x97\x8f Often difficult to assess the prospective candidate (enterprise) pain points and needs due to the lack of reliable data CANDIDATE (Fintech Enterprise) \xe2\x97\x8f Procuring an enterprise technology product such as an IT infrastructure automation is often difficult due to a number of similar products in the market today \xe2\x97\x8f The product selection and procurement process is often complex time consuming and costly \xe2\x97\x8f The typical timeline from engagement to contract signed is 6 to 9 months Canlead addresses these challenges by building incentives into the Canlead models developing features in the blockchain based Canlead platform to enable customers to hire the best candidates or acquire the right products cost effectively as well as using blockchain/ smart contracts to incentivise the users with tokens for every successful referral Page 10 of 41 \x0c5 0 Canlead Solutions 5 1 Canlead Sharing Economy Model Consulting recruiting and marketing agencies are the intermediary or brokerage entities These intermediary entities have the know how that other businesses are relying on to complete their business transactions A payment processing provider needs technical talents to develop their payment gateways They use a job recruitment agency to find and supply these talents to them A local restaurant uses a payment processing provider to process the payments made by its customers Today most business entities are acting in some capacity like an intermediary entity from an ecosystem perspective As a result Canlead has developed a Sharing Economy 2 0 model to disrupt and transform the traditional intermediary business The Canlead Sharing Economy 2 0 model addresses the challenges mentioned above and offers the following advantages over the Sharing Economy 1 0 model such as Airbnb which is mentioned here for illustration purposes \xe2\x97\x8f The Canlead Sharing Economy model support intermediary business services such as recruitment property travel and offers new features over the Airbnb Sharing Economy model \xe2\x97\x8f Three user profiles or actors customer referrer and candidate to support the Canlead Sharing Economy model \xe2\x97\x8f Three way rating system customer referrer and candidate to improve trust for greater success \xe2\x97\x8f Three sided market customer referrer and candidate lead to more users which lead to more revenue and so on\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x97\x8f The customers post job or service opportunities on the Canlead Referral Board the referrers find and refer the opportunities to their friends or candidates Canlead Sharing Economy 2 0 Model Page 11 of 41 \x0cThere are many types of opportunities and referrals as well as personal and professional networks interacting with each other in the real world it\xe2\x80\x99s a complex ecosystem However when this ecosystem is broken into its component parts we can easily identify and model their roles responsibilities and activities The Seesaw Network Model diagram below outlines how Canlead has solved the opportunity & connection problem and the problem of supply & demand Canlead is unlike any other platforms of its kind it creates a real world three sided market customer candidate and referrer where the referrer\xe2\x80\x99s network maintains the balance of supply and demand Canlead Seesaw Network Model Page 12 of 41 \x0cThe Airbnb Sharing Economy 1 0 model addresses a unique set of challenges in the Travel industry such as user verification trust payment etc and it\xe2\x80\x99s a two sided market host and guest The Airbnb Sharing Economy Model Source \xe2\x80\x8bhttps //rctom hbs org/submission/airbnb how the sharing economy is disrupting thetravel industry/ Most professionals are familiar with the LinkedIn model platform and service which has a two sided market customer and candidate Furthermore the LinkedIn model is not a transactional Sharing Economy model whereas the Canlead model is a Sharing Economy model that offers many advantages \xe2\x97\x8f Opportunity and referral e g targeted sales and marketing \xe2\x97\x8f Dedicated professional recruiters e g referrer who can offer guidance and advice \xe2\x97\x8f Work with people you know and trust professionally or socially instead of agency recruiters \xe2\x97\x8f Three sided market e g larger network effect Page 13 of 41 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Incentive driven e g all users are incentivised \xe2\x97\x8f Simple business model e g no win no fee \xe2\x97\x8f Trusted users customers referrers and candidates via review and ratings better than skill endorsements \xe2\x97\x8f Support B2B B2C and C2C 5 2 Canlead Users and Roles There is 3 type of user roles in the Canlead model they are Canlead Roles Customer / Producer Referrer Candidate By definition the Host is someone who can CREATE the opportunity SET and PAY the referral fee By definition the Leader is someone who can REFER the opportunity and RECEIVE a referral fee from the Host By definition the Candidate is someone who can CONSUME the opportunity i e get hired via the referral process Producer Referrer Candidate Provider Agent Employee Customer Middleman Associate Recruiter Broker Friend Hiring manager Lead Marketeer Consultant Consumer Page 14 of 41 \x0cSale manager Freelancer Influencer Introducer 5 3 How Canlead Works As an example if you are a business owner running a recruitment agency or you are a consultant/ recruiter searching for talents to fit a client\xe2\x80\x99s job description the process is complex expensive and time consuming involving multiple parties with many stages from talent identification interview to contract approval invoicing and payment (1)(2) As an example a recruiter from a job recruitment agency \xe2\x80\x9cABC\xe2\x80\x9d sign up and become a Customer (Host) The signup process is simple and requires their full name email phone number location industry and specialisations (skills) \xe2\x97\x8f The Customer (Host) builds their Network and Community by inviting their contacts to join Canlead as trusted Connections (associates freelancers and referrers) \xe2\x97\x8f The Customer (Host) creates and post job opportunities set up the pay out payment account in Fiat currency or Crypto currency (available in the future) \xe2\x97\x8f The Customer (Host) is given a new lead from a prospective client or an existing client\xe2\x80\x99s employee freelancer or former employee \xe2\x97\x8f Note the employee or freelancer can sign up and become a Referrer (Leader) at any time If they are existing users then they can simply switch their user profile to become a Referrer (Leader) The Referrer (Leader) is responsible for leading the referral process to a successful conclusion so they may get recognised and rewarded the referrer fees and CAND tokens (3)(4) The Referrer (Leader) can find and refer any opportunities they may find on the Canlead platform to their friends or candidates \xe2\x97\x8f The Referrer (Leader) builds their Network and Community by inviting their contacts to join Canlead as trusted Connections (associates specialists freelancers and customers) \xe2\x97\x8f The Candidate builds their Network and Community by inviting their contacts to join Canlead as trusted Connections (associates specialists freelancers and friends) \xe2\x97\x8f Note anyone can sign up and become a Candidate at any time The Candidate can notify their Referrers (Leaders) when they are seeking for unique job opportunities (5)(6) Once a Customer (Host) and Candidate have been introduced and connected they go through the standard interview and contract negotiation process They should always communicate using the Canlead platform to guarantee payments Page 15 of 41 \x0c(7) The Customer (Host) pays the referral fee to the Referrer (Leader) after the Candidate started their first day and/ or passed their probation The Customer (Host) pays Canlead a 10% commission or service fee for using the platform and service (8) All users who are involved in the referral process can rate each other after every successful payment transaction to improve their reputation (9) The Canlead platform rewards the CAND tokens to each user after every successful payment and rating to incentive the network General Opportunity and Referral Process and Dataflow 5 4 Canlead Feefer Artificial Intelligence A major challenge to solve is to provide personalised engaging and timely referrals or recommendations from a pool of millions of items to millions of active users Canlead Feefer Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be developed to address this challenge In Canlead the customer will create and post the opportunities on to the boards There will be millions of customers undertaking this posting of opportunities on to the boards The key referral problem is this given a query set Q comprising a set of opportunities and corresponding weights return a set of boards that the referrers may be interested in Page 16 of 41 \x0cThe query set Q is referrer specific and is generated dynamically after every action of the referrer as an example most recently interacted opportunities have high weights while opportunities from a long time ago have low weights Among other things Canlead Feefer referrals are used to show a grid of opportunities in a referrer\xe2\x80\x99s home page that the referrer might find relevant to save in their board Whenever a referrer clicks on an opportunity Feefer is used to show related opportunities When a referrer views one of their own boards Feefer is used to suggest other opportunities to be saved to the board Feefer is also used to recommend \xe2\x80\x9cPicked for you\xe2\x80\x9d boards Similarly Feefer generates recommendations in the customer\xe2\x80\x99s home page that the customer might find relevant such as the referrer\xe2\x80\x99s leaderboard profile as well as the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s home page with recommendations about which referrers they should follow The goal is very simple Canlead wants referrers to make one or more referrals each time they log in to use the app 5 5 Problem Summary for Design Considerations These are the areas Canlead is intended to solve both off chain and on chain \xe2\x97\x8f Lack of incentives to share quality opportunities and build long term relationships \xe2\x97\x8f Lack of certainty if the opportunity candidate referrer and customer is reliable \xe2\x97\x8f No universal referral board where users can share and earn from referrals \xe2\x97\x8f No candidate referrer and customer de facto rating and review portal \xe2\x97\x8f Tokenizing opportunities based on the Canlead Sharing Economy 2 0 model \xe2\x97\x8f Monetising social networks and reputation through sharing and earning \xe2\x97\x8f Solving proof of opportunity and referral (POR) adding transparency and reducing opportunity wastage in any multi billion dollars\xe2\x80\x99 market \xe2\x97\x8f Providing access to quality services and talents globally lower costs and higher quality of candidates \xe2\x97\x8f Reducing complexity in billing payment cross border payment and settlement systems 5 6 Token Design Considerations Canlead is adopting a token design concept that consists of building an ecosystem surrounding our market or the business model that we create using the blockchain technology It is an extremely complex task comparable to designing and launching a completely new economic structure We intend to keep the design and the underlying token architecture as simple as possible and minimize our assumptions about agents\xe2\x80\x99 behaviours because even very simple structures can lead to extremely complex interactions and outcomes Page 17 of 41 \x0cDesign Inputs Token design requires an understanding of the \xe2\x80\x8bincentives for each participant in our ecosystem business model market structure and network structure The final model leads to a protocol design that should allow our network to sustain itself in a healthy manner while prioritising system safety by correctly engineering incentivisation and dis incentivisation mechanisms An incentive is something that makes people act in a particular way and is central to the study of economics In our context we use it to achieve mutual gains when parties have differing motivations and/ or degrees of knowledge Taxonomy of Actors The first crucial step in the token design process is to determine for whom the network is being designed i e all the agents that will participate in the network their specific roles within the economy and how they all influence each other Defining participants\xe2\x80\x99 roles and user flows such as the direction of interactions/ communications within our network will influence strategic interactions among network participants which in turn affect our network and hence the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s outcome Finally determining network participants and their roles is a critical dependency for the next step of defining the \xe2\x80\x8bnetwork\xe2\x80\x99s objective function\xe2\x80\x8b also known as the reward function and utility function which is the most important output of our design Without defining a full picture of network participants and their roles we can neither define the metrics that would determine network success such as user engagement or other payoffs nor the constraints of our problem The \xe2\x80\x8bNetwork Objective Function is the primary objective we want the network to optimise above all else and helps us aggregate the different goals of a particular network depending on their relevant importance Equally as important as a network\xe2\x80\x99s objective function are the model\xe2\x80\x99s constraints a requirement in the design of safe systems Key Stakeholders In The Canlead Ecosystem The approach is to formulate the problem who are the stakeholders what do they want and then translate them into objectives and constraints The \xe2\x80\x8bobjective function is to maximize the supply of relevant data service and reward the tokens for the supply and maintenance of the relevant data and service Canlead\xe2\x80\x99s token design uses this goal to direct all other token design decisions The key tool used by Canlead to incentivise behaviour around this \xe2\x80\x8bobjective function is through the introduction of token rewards Stakeholder What value they can provide What they might get in return Opportunity provider Supply opportunities Tokens for making the opportunity available Page 18 of 41 \x0cOpportunity referrer Supply consumers (candidates) Match consumers (candidates) to opportunities Tokens for making the referrals possible Opportunity consumer (candidate) Supply own talents (skills) and resources Tokens for participating in the referral process Verifier Verify opportunities Tokens for verifying the authenticity and quality of the opportunities Mediator Mediate conflicts Tokens for mediating any conflict between parties Keeper Run nodes in the network Tokens for chain keeping 5 7 Game Theory Game theory is the study of multi person decision problems and a crucial tool in the token design process since it helps us determine the outcomes from the strategic interaction of players given their preferences and incentives Canlead will fulfil this objective with the least amount of assumptions possible about an agent\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour In many token use cases self interests of the network participants are in direct contrast to the interests of the network as a whole Moreover stakeholders\xe2\x80\x99 incentives are not always aligned Therefore game theory is an extremely useful tool that can help us understand the underlying drivers that dis incentivise cooperation within our ecosystem and better design a token that aligns participant incentives among themselves and with the objectives of the network 6 0 Market Research Sharing is not a new concept Giving someone a ride in your car dropping your pet off at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house cooking for guests and referring friends to an opportunity are all common actions The sharing economy on the other hand is a concept that has only recently come to fruition It\xe2\x80\x99s a newer form of sharing where a service is provided for a monetary return At first glance it seems mainly limited to the transportation industry and the travel industry But the economic foundations of sharing are broad Many other industries could soon face the disruption experienced by taxi fleets and hotel chains Based on the PwC report the sharing economy market is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2025 a huge increase from the 2014 market value of $14 billion The rise of the sharing economy is changing the face of global business creating opportunities for new entrants challenges for incumbent players and searching questions for all stakeholders Page 19 of 41 \x0cThe original sharing economy groupings of services are \xe2\x97\x8f Accommodation (Airbnb) \xe2\x97\x8f Transportation (Uber Citymapper) \xe2\x97\x8f Services (TaskRabbit Freelancer Canlead) \xe2\x97\x8f Finance (Xero Wefunder) \xe2\x97\x8f Goods (eBay) \xe2\x97\x8f Software and digital entertainment (Spotify) The downsides of the sharing economy are platform monopolies privacy violations unfair competition and trust about 69% of Americans say they will not use the sharing economy company until it is recommended by someone they trust Most new entrants coming into the sharing economy market are still related to travel accommodation and collaboration As a result an opportunity has arisen for a platform aims at the Service sector focusing initially on the HR / Recruitment market where Canlead intends to address 6 1 Market Opportunity The global job market is growing fast with a compound annual growth rate of 10% and will exceed $26 billion by 2020 Below is a list of a 5 year historical job vacancy from the major economies UK France Germany and the US The UK economy is strong with a steady increase in job vacancy over the last 5 years The 2017 data has been normalised to show about 9 8 million job vacancies per year [5] Page 20 of 41 \x0cThe French economy has been bumpy with a small increase in job vacancy over the last 5 years The 2017 data has been normalised to show about 3 5 million job vacancies per year [5] The German economy is strong with a significant increase in job vacancy over the last 5 years The 2017 data has been normalised to show about 10 1 million job vacancies per year [5] Page 21 of 41 \x0cThe US economy is strong with a significant increase in job vacancy over the last 5 years The 2017 data has been normalised to show about 75 million job vacancies per year [5] Using the above job vacancy data we devised a simple model to

\xe2\x97\x8f No win no fee business model Profile \xe2\x97\x8f Use existing LinkedIn Google or Facebook to sign in \xe2\x97\x8f View and edit user profiles Page 24 of 41 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Three way user performance rating after successful referrals to improve integrity and credibility Design and Brand \xe2\x97\x8f Memorable name \xe2\x97\x8f Simple idea and product offerings \xe2\x97\x8f Design has three actors/ user profiles to provide an open scalable and adaptable solution 7 0 Product 7 1 Background and Product Market Fit Test Canlead began when we provided opportunities and referrals to our community of suppliers and customers looking for a deal be it a job product or service Now we provide an online service of customers (Hosts) referrers (Leaders) and friends (Candidates) who can choose to create a Canlead user account so they may list their unique opportunities or refer their friends Canlead makes the job product service opportunity sharing and referral easy enjoyable and safe We verify personal profiles and opportunity listings maintain a smart messaging system so customers (Hosts) referrers (Leaders) and friends (Candidates) can communicate with certainty and manage a trusted platform to transfer and collect payments (tokens) The Canlead application/ platform (off chain version) has been beta tested and the product market fit has been proven by our partners in technology recruitment and consultancy The Canlead App Page 25 of 41 \x0c7 2 Canlead Decentralised Application (Dapp) Canlead as a decentralised platform (Dapp) will enable businesses and communities to monetise their data and services to help drive the value of the Canlead ecosystem As with any platform the network effect is enhanced by the growing number of participants When the network expands the utility of the Canlead token (CAND) increases along with its market reach Canlead is an open platform and will give the development community a tremendous amount of flexibility and the potential to be rewarded for their contributions For example developers can use the Canlead API sets to write their own community built software application services (via their own 3rd party application) that will be integrated within the Canlead platform The development community will be able to earn CAND for every successful transaction the customer put through their community built application services For example if a producer transacts with \xe2\x80\x98ABC\xe2\x80\x99 Limited or Developer via their community built application service \xe2\x80\x98XYZ\xe2\x80\x99 successfully then \xe2\x80\x98ABC\xe2\x80\x99 Limited or Developer who created the \xe2\x80\x98XYZ\xe2\x80\x99 Service will be rewarded Canlead has selected the Ethereum blockchain technology as a foundation to build the Canlead decentralised application (Dapp) to support the expected user and customer growth over the next few years 7 3 Why The Blockchain Blockchain technology offers several real world benefits and advantages \xe2\x97\x8f Covert real opportunities into tokenized values this way each person who is involved in the referral opportunity gets a portion of the value \xe2\x97\x8f Offer rewards in CAND tokens instead of loyalty points as CAND tokens can be used to purchase or trade with other products and services within the ecosystem \xe2\x97\x8f The token connects opportunities with users and rewards successful referrals \xe2\x97\x8f Furthermore the CAND token unlocks several premium blockchain features one2one referral leaderboard borderless payment application integration and 3rd party services \xe2\x97\x8f A decentralised and distributed ledger provides users with a safe and secure system giving them the confidence that no business can change the system of records \xe2\x97\x8f A consensus mechanism removes any centralised controlling body to enable network participants to validate transactions proof of opportunity and referral and add clarity for both the business and user Note Blockchain is providing the foundation on which the decentralised network is built allowing it to run with no central authority Page 26 of 41 \x0c7 4 Technology Limitations The main limitations of blockchain technology today are \xe2\x97\x8f Transaction time which is currently ten minutes on average for Bitcoin (blockchain info) and seventeen seconds on average for Ethereum (ethstats net) \xe2\x97\x8f The cost for each transaction / smart contract execution \xe2\x97\x8f The limited ability of the network to interface with real world information Despite these limitations Canlead believes that blockchain technology is well suited as a solution to conduct \xe2\x80\x98opportunity and referral\xe2\x80\x99 transactions because the number of transactions in recruitment is relatively average due to the nature of the sector 7 5 Smart Contracts For The Existing Legal Framework Canlead\xe2\x80\x99s engineering team will design a community led \xe2\x80\x98opportunity and referral\xe2\x80\x99 platform powered by smart contracts combining solutions from the legal blockchain and payments industries Canlead will prototype some of the core technology using blockchain technology that will become the Canlead Dapp allowing each party to transact including the Customer Referrer Candidate and the third party application service The workflow for each process will be built to meet the market rules within the systems currently existing in the UK The goal of launching the Canlead platform in the UK first is to allow the prototype to be narrowly focused on driving consumer testing adoption and improvements within a controlled market Thereupon Canlead will seek to implement the Canlead solution and drive continuous rapid growth throughout key markets around the world However due to blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s new and innovative nature Canlead recognises the existence of regulatory and infrastructure limitations in the current technology therefore Canlead delivery approach is to build and deploy features gradually over time The first iteration of the Canlead Dapp (which includes a centralised interface and decentralised smart contracts) intends to streamline existing processes among other things reducing the need to rely on the multiple intermediaries currently involved in the recruitment transactions While aspects of the process will be partly decentralised it will primarily make the current recruitment process easier to manage and more transparent As it develops Canlead intends to transition towards a pure p2p2p decentralised system that removes the need for most of the existing intermediaries involved in recruitment transactions today We note that certain people and intermediaries performing physical functions such as interview and negotiation will remain part of the transaction process in the immediately foreseeable future 7 6 Technology Considered to Build & Run the Canlead Dapp The Canlead platform is being developed using a hybrid architecture with functionality on the blockchain (on chain) and functionality of the blockchain (off chain) This architecture is designed to optimise the scalability security and authentication capabilities Page 27 of 41 \x0cOn chain Technology On chain capabilities are leveraged where they provide the greatest value specifically those providing encrypted transactions and ensuring tokenized value flow Our current plan is to build on Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s platform using Parity and Solidity to develop the smart contract The Canlead Token has been developed using ERC20 The smart contract creates and manages token flows which a) enable easy transactions for community partners and stakeholders b) provide an incentive to drive greater usage and c) provide governance of the tokens Off chain Technology Off chain capabilities are the underlying capabilities which provide the authentication and communications at scale Hybrid Technology Stack Canlead will use the existing and new technology stack \xe2\x97\x8f Client side JavaScript \xe2\x97\x8f Server side Golang \xe2\x97\x8f Framework / Front end Library React \xe2\x97\x8f Database Postgres \xe2\x97\x8f Ethereum Development Language Solidity (for coding smart contracts that run on Ethereum) \xe2\x97\x8f Parity Ethereum A client and user interface providing the platform of choice for developers and users of decentralised applications \xe2\x97\x8f Ethereum Development Framework Truffle (for compiling migrating and testing smart contracts) \xe2\x97\x8f Decentralised Storage Storj (for storing user profiles opportunity listings files chat messages) \xe2\x97\x8f Peer to Peer Distributed File System IPFS (for storing user profiles opportunity listings files chat messages) \xe2\x97\x8f Meta data Storage Blockchain (for critical data encryption keys meta data) \xe2\x97\x8f Ethereum Identity Management uPort (for digitally sign transactions and easy login to Dapps) \xe2\x97\x8f Cloud Service Amazon AWS EC2 EKS ECS etc \xe2\x97\x8f DevOps Continuous Deployment GitLab Canlead Architecture Page 28 of 41 \x0cArchitecture We plan to build native applications we plan to build technologically independent solutions for Android and Apple devices with both relying on the same JSON API that will be an integral part of the Canlead backend Hosting We have already released a beta version of our cloud solution hosted in the AWS public cloud that allows for high security and heavy loads We plan to build a disaster recovery solution redundant cloud mirrors in different AWS region with direct live replication and live migration in critical situations Our cloud solution must contain enough hardware and networking resources to host all of the solution\xe2\x80\x99s VMs and large data storage Page 29 of 41 \x0cCanlead intends to use a distributed database to store listings as an intermediate step along the way to a decentralised solution The mobile web app will have a digital wallet to store the Canlead Utility Tokens and users will be able to store in those wallets the tokens that they collect via the rewards programs and any payment 8 0 Business and Operating Model 8 1 Business Model Canlead has a simple and scalable business model The referrer refers candidates to opportunities posted by the customer When a referral is completed on the Canlead network the customer pays the referral fee to the referrer and the service fee to Canlead for every successful business transaction The breakdown is as follows \xe2\x97\x8f The customers pay 100% of the referral fee to the referrers for the service they provided \xe2\x97\x8f The customers pay 10% commission (service fee) to Canlead for using its platform and service \xe2\x97\x8f In total the Hosts pay 110% Currently payment can be made in the following fiat currencies \xe2\x97\x8f GBP \xe2\x97\x8f USD \xe2\x97\x8f Euro Canlead is planning to add the follow cryptocurrencies in the future in the jurisdictions where it is possible to do so \xe2\x97\x8f CAND \xe2\x97\x8f ETH \xe2\x97\x8f BTC Note The customer set the referral fee in the referral opportunities so the higher the fee the more interests they get potentially 8 2 Operating Model To make this a reality Canlead\xe2\x80\x99s operating model hinges on the value of its digital platform Canlead owns no hard or soft asset be it a job opportunity or property sale opportunity as it relies on Customers to join the platform and lists their opportunities Canlead verifies customers in addition to providing a rating system for customers to rate each other based on their experience The element of trust that this builds is essential in the sharing economy to ensure that the platform enters into the virtuous cycle of success more referrers lead to more candidates and customers which leads to more revenue and so on Page 30 of 41 \x0c9 0 The Canlead Token and ICO Crowdsale 9 1 Canlead Token Overview Canlead is introducing the Canlead Utility Token CAND to the SHARING ECONOMY for the customer referrer and candidate in any market The CAND token connects opportunities with users and rewards successful referrals Furthermore the CAND token unlocks several premium blockchain features one2one referral leaderboard borderless payment application integration and 3rd party services Opportunity sharing and earning will profoundly change the way we do business and work in the future The CAND token is a utility token even though people earn tokens by performing certain tasks in the network or they can buy tokens to get access to the Opportunity they want from the Referral Board people are not buying tokens with the expectation of profit then they are investing their money in the expectation of getting the Opportunity The CAND token is based on the ERC20 standard which allows for simple integration into users\xe2\x80\x98 wallets It is used for all transactions among the participants of the Canlead ecosystem and economy when a high degree of decentralisation and token utilisation is reached 9 2 Token Mechanics The CAND token as an integral part of the Canlead ecosystem performs multiple functions and will be fully designed so that our users will want to use it frequently CAND tokens will be used to increase the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s chances reduce the customer\xe2\x80\x99s hiring cost and improve the referrer\xe2\x80\x99s quality of referral as well as rewarding desired behaviours and outcomes Since the Canlead network will operate on its own blockchain all behaviours and outcomes will be recorded and automatically trigger token rewards creating an immediate feedback loop that encourages positive behaviour The feedback loop requires Canlead users to receive feedback in the form of reviews and ratings which will encourage them to continue good behaviour 9 3 Token Features The Canlead token provides for multiple features within the Canlead platform \xe2\x97\x8f Form of payment CAND tokens will serve as a means of payment or reward within the ecosystem although we will accept and use other types of fiat or cryptocurrencies \xe2\x97\x8f Gamification Referrers will earn CAND tokens for their achievements the total amount of tokens earned per month number of opportunities shared per month number of successful referrals per month higher ratings etc Page 31 of 41 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Development contributions External developers will earn the CAND tokens for their contributions to the Canlead source code based on measurable metrics such as GitHub references library usage in the Canlead code base and hackathon wins \xe2\x97\x8f Partnership access Canlead will give access to advanced platform features and the partnership programs will help integrating big companies and institutional players into the Canlead network 9 4 The ICO Crowdsale Campaign The crowdsale period will begin on Date (TBC) at 00 00 and will continue until Canlead reaches the hard cap of the
