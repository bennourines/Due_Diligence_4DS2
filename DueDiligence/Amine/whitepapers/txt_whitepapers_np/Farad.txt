b FARAD Commoditising Forward Purchase Contracts in Ultra capacitor Intellectual Property Rights on Ethereum Blockchain Wan M Hasni1 and You Hua Nong 2 1 2 Chairman and CEO Virtue Fintech FZ LLC Chief Executive Officer HK Aerospace Beidou New Energy Technology Co Ltd \xe2\x88\x97 The authors benefited from comments and inputs from Andras Kristof 7th July 2017 FARAD is an attempt at providing a new novel way of commoditising Intellectual Property Rights related to a set of technologies related to metal oxide based ultra capacitors development and production The approach taken here is by introducing forward contracts based on the manufacturing application of the technology and how these forward contracts are structured as the underlying assets of a digital commodity The commoditisation program entails identification of the economic appropriation rights for the technologies and how it could be coded onto Ethereum Blockchain Smart Contracts which would then create a tokenise digital asset commodity called FARAD This digital asset is named as a \xe2\x80\x9cCryptoken\xe2\x80\x9d signifying the cryptographic element of the Ethereum Blockchain and the tokenising of the digital asset The paper sets out on how this could be achieved 1 \x0cIntroduction The economics of welfare and the allocation of resources for invention had been in the mind of economists such as Arrow (1962) for a very long time and until today the issues remain unresolved and continue to plague innovators industries and governments alike At the heart of the problem is how does resources (i e investments) be allocated to support the innovators to continue their production of knowledge (which we would define here as the Intellectual Property Rights or \xe2\x80\x9cIPR\xe2\x80\x9d) 1 so that society could progress Too little of resources allocated would mean that society is hindered by the lack of technological progress and at the same time the high level of uncertainties facing any investments into IPR requires higher risk premiums This leads to the pricing of such risks be indeterminate and the market for IPR be incomplete (as described by Arrow and Debreu (1954)) The incompleteness here emanates from both sides the innovators (or producers of IPRs) and the investors (or resource providers) In economic of exchange environment this is termed as the no trade Nash equilibrium Arrow (1962) suggests that we could model solutions for this problem by creating a market for \xe2\x80\x9ccommodity options\xe2\x80\x9d where information is a commodity and as a commodity it could possibly be traded The main object of such commodity is that its owner could appropriate economic benefits by having sufficient legal measures in order for some form of monopoly power be exerted Once this is defined the risk measures could then be determined and would have a better chance of being priced efficiently The first part of the solution involves the protection of the IPR where in today\xe2\x80\x99s world the rudimentary form of information is in bits and bytes The way to create \xe2\x80\x9cprotected commodity\xe2\x80\x9d is by creating a \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d whereby such bits and bytes could be stored and disseminated under the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic eye\xe2\x80\x9d and yet being protected from any theft This box is what could be termed as 1 Intellectual property rights refers to the general term for the assignment of property rights through patents copyrights and trademarks These property rights allow the holder to exercise a monopoly on the use of the item for a specified period 2 \x0cdata entry storage and publication in a publicly distributed ledger and database Under such environment the private information such as an IPR could be published publicly with all the necessary identifiers and yet only people with permission could see what is inside the \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d without any compromise of information thievery As an example a patent could be submitted (by publishing publicly) and most contents of the patent details are hidden from the public (such as proprietary processes etc ) save what is absolutely necessary to be disclosed (such as major economic claims) The second part of the solution (assuming that the box is already secured) is how to secure the economic appropriations from such \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d If those economic claims could be defined and determined precisely it would allow any economic investors to have sufficient information for them to make judgments on the risks related to such claims Furthermore if such process is transparent with a high level of accountability and could be ratified within the market then the risks associated with the \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d and its claims could be ascertained definitively The blockchain technology so far is the most viable answer to the problem posed above with its potential to deal with the essential basic building blocks of information (i e data) by the allowance of the creation of virtual ledger to be recorded and distributed with the principles of what is termed as \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cintermediary less\xe2\x80\x9d methods of transactions as its core functionalities It is a revolution for the fact that these are the issues plaguing the whole financial industry which blockchain could potentially solve Bitcoin as the main proof of concept and proof of technology for blockchain had been operating successfully for more than eight years since its first creation in 2009 2 It is the main reference point for the applications of blockchain technology However what had been less understood is the economic potentials of the backbone of blockchain that is the Distributed Ledger and Database Technology (DLDT) DLDT while novel in its structure and forms still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t realised its full economic potential With the rise of many crypto currencies such as 2 Please refer to Nakamoto (2008) 3 \x0cBitcoin Ethereum and alike it was argued by its proponents that it could enter the market as a clear alternative for the furtherance of international exchange economy by being more efficient (lesser costs of transactions and less time consuming) information ally more efficient (by having a fully decentralised and trust less system) whereby economic agents could operate in a border less world (hence overcoming barriers and constraints) and finally the boundaries of optimality and fairer economic allocations could be achieved 3 Bitcoins has its own shares of controversies and being the first one introduced have some inherent draw backs However many of these issues are addressed in the newer blockchain systems that had been introduced such as the Ethereum (blockchain) Networks 4 One of the most significant approaches of Ethereum is what is termed as \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d which makes it be more suited to customised applications 5 We will use the Ethereum platform as the base of our proposed solution In order to demonstrate the idea of commoditising Intellectual Property Rights as proposed the paper will explain how Ethereum blockchain could be used as the backbone for the commoditisation process and the result of such exercise would produce a crypto token (or cryptocurrency) which could be traded and exchanged within the market place If this idea could be implemented it would open up a whole plethora of financing and investments in technologies which would be a major push for many new technologies where this new method could be the choice of fundraising activities The paper proceeds as follows The first section will lay down the principles of economics of exchange and how could \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d system of economic exchanges be performed and how 3 For detail explanations about cryptocurrencies and Bitcoins please see Vigna and Casey (2016) Please refer to the Ethereum Whitepaper Buterin (2014) 5 Ethereum Network is \xe2\x80\x9ca decentralised platform that runs smart contracts applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime censorship fraud or third party interference Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s protocol is built to allow flexibility and increase functionality to provide the ability to program many different types of smart contracts within the Ethereum system Ethereum is written in Turing complete language\xe2\x80\x9d For reference please see Harm et all (2017) 4 4 \x0cthe blockchain Distributed Ledger and Database Technology be applied theoretically to a system of economic exchanges by deploying \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d which will lead to how a crypto token be created out of such process the second section will describe a specific IPR which is the deployment of technologies for the manufacturing of metal oxides based ultra capacitors be commoditised within the definition of the crypto token The crypto token is named as FARAD the third section will explain how FARAD is generated using the Ethereum Network blockchain environment and how further improvements for the FARAD ecosystem could be undertaken and finally the fourth section concludes 1 Role of blockchain in economic exchanges The main principle of economic of exchange is whenever parties could agree on the value of the items to be exchanged be it goods commodities services or monies the exchange would occur otherwise the exchange failed to take place (or no trade would happen) In order to describe this the main descriptions of the exchange economy and the main assumptions to for an economic exchange model need to be defined 6 1 1 Descriptions of economic exchange An economic exchange could happen if two party Alice A who owns some Commodity x and Bob B who owns some Currency y agree on exchanging between them whereby Alice takes some units of the Currency y in exchange of Bob taking some units of Commodity x Negotiations happens at time t0 and transaction took place at time t1 This is only possible If and Only If Alice and Bob agree on the values of those Commodity and Currency to be the same at t0 6 Any forms of market is a form of economic exchange A bazaar as a market place is an exchange as much as the stock markets We are using a simplified version of economic exchange model by generalising some of the assumptions For full understanding of the markets and rigorous treatments readers are referred to MacMillan (2002) and Kreps (1990) 5 \x0cThis can be represented by FA t0 (yt1 ) = GB t0 (xt1 ) (1) Where A is Alice and B is Bob and F and G are value functions at time t0 of Alice on y and Bob on x respectively If the above equation fails to match no exchange will occur or no trade happened The no trade theorem7 could be described by first expanding Equation 1 as follows FA t0 (yt1 + \xce\xb4y t1 ) = GB t0 (xt1 + \xce\xb4x t1 ) (2) Where \xce\xb4y t1 and \xce\xb4x t1 are the differences or variations in expectation which represents the differences in the quality of the Commodity x delivered and the premiums or discounts in the amount of payments to be received in Currency y at time t1 In another word there are uncertainties involved in the transaction in regard to the value of Commodity x and amount of Currency y 8 This could be viewed from the classic Nash\xe2\x80\x99s equilibrium solution to the Prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma setting 9 What are the sources of variations which lead to failed trade There are a plethora of things that could possibly happen In the studies of economics of exchange the possible candidates are the costs of transactions informational asymmetries or incomplete information disjointed or fragmented market problems economic externalities such as taxations and others 10 7 For detail exposition of \xe2\x80\x9cNash Equilibrium of No Trade\xe2\x80\x9d please refer to standard economic text books on game theory such as Gintis (2000) 8 Note that Bob may pay in his local currency which is different from what Alice received which is in her local currency 9 The term Prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma is widely used and explained in most of the economic textbooks as part of economic game theoretical discussions As a reference please see Kreps(1990) 10 Detail discussions on the subject could be found in most classical economic texts such as Akerlof (1970) Spence (1973) Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) and Kreps (1990) 6 \x0c1 2 Trust less system of economic exchanges Now let us turn to another major issue in any economic exchanges namely what could be termed as trust less system of economic exchanges It is well known that one of the central problems in economic exchanges is about \xe2\x80\x9cPayments\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cDelivery\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cPVD\xe2\x80\x9d) or sometimes also termed as \xe2\x80\x9cPost Trade Settlements\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cPOTS\xe2\x80\x9d) The standard solution for this problem is for the market to operate through \xe2\x80\x9cmarket intermediaries\xe2\x80\x9d which functions as the central party playing the role of intermediation as the custodian and clearing agents for both sides of the exchanges For this to happen all parties must \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d the intermediary to play its role Banks stock exchanges fund managers are among the notable examples of these \xe2\x80\x9ctrusted\xe2\x80\x9d intermediaries Unfortunately the intermediation process itself is mired in the question of \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cagency problems\xe2\x80\x9d with which a set of layers and costs involved (such as transaction costs monitoring costs etc) opacity of the process (such as informational asymmetries) market fragmentation and disjointedness and economic externalities The question is could this be reduced or eliminated This is what a system of \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d economic exchange could offer Before proceeding further it is important to lay down the basic principles of \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d economic exchanges which are necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) requirements for it to be possible 1 Intermediary less transactions there is no need of any central party or \xe2\x80\x9ctrusted\xe2\x80\x9d intermediaries to be a middle party to the transactions The transacting parties are relying directly on each other through a system whereby \xe2\x80\x9ctrusting\xe2\x80\x9d someone is not relevant but rather the \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d is being relied upon the system itself and the system is free from \xe2\x80\x9chuman interference\xe2\x80\x9d 2 Ir reversibility and immutability of transactions once an exchange is agreed as per agreed value and terms it is no longer changeable or mutable no parties could unilaterally 7 \x0cchange or cancel unless pre agreed arrangements had been made Despite any arrangements made it must be made and agreed within the public domain rather than on personalised domain which makes such transactions to be immutable 3 Automatic execution of contracts once a contract is consummated it will be executed without any further reference to any parties The execution is on \xe2\x80\x9cautomated\xe2\x80\x9d track whereby both parties have delegated the execution to a system whereby there is no need of exercising further efforts beyond the first exercise of contracting The contracts should then be fully specified which leaves no room for discrepancies in terms of its executions 4 Transparency responsibility and accountability the execution of the trade are within the public environment where all items are fully transparent to everyone Furthermore the responsibilities are clearly defined and every party is fully responsible for their promises and be accountable for it as well Could a trust less system of economic exchanges with the above principles be conducted in practice This is best explained through an example (following from the example of Alice and Bob) Alice who owns a commodity wishes to sell the commodity on a forward sale contract to Bob Bob agreed to pay for the commodity now at a fixed price of say y1 In this case y1 is assumed to be delivered to Alice on the spot and Alice could accept y1 as its the choice of payment currency (i e no foreign exchange risks taken by both sides) The forward sale contract specifies that at a certain fixed time in the future Alice shall deliver the commodity into a pre determined \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d and when the time period matures (i e the delivery date) the commodity is delivered automatically into such \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d and Alice has no influence to change such process 8 \x0c(i e it is an automated process) This process had bet set and pre determined even before the spot payments are made by Bob (and hence Bob is secured by such process rather than dependence on Alice\xe2\x80\x99s performance based on her promises) Furthermore all the contracts and promises are done between Alice and Bob in a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic domain\xe2\x80\x9d which would then have it recorded and its the contracts are captured immutably Since it is done in a public domain the transaction is fully \xe2\x80\x9ctransparent\xe2\x80\x9d to the whole public in which case the responsibilities of each party as well as the accountabilities are clearly defined (in another word anyone could \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d and checked whether Alice or Bob are performing their promised performances) Under such conditions the \xe2\x80\x9cpromise\xe2\x80\x9d made by Alice to Bob could now be verified and proofed by any other people at any time on real time basis Based on that arrangements Bob could then \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d his rights (over Alice\xe2\x80\x99s promise) to Charlie Charlie is willing to accept the \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d from Bob without the need of knowing Alice since he relied on the public records which had been verified and proofed in the public domain to determine the value of such rights transferred to him by Bob Bob then could charge a certain payment say y2 to Charlie for him to transfer those rights Which means Bob could trade that commodity to Charlie even without referring to Alice In the above narrative it could be seen that there are no intermediaries involved all the Payments versus Deliveries are carried out by an automated process without any further human alterations everything that happened (between Alice and Bob Bob and Charlie) are all recorded immutably with full transparency and accountability There are no extra costs imposed by any third party in the process (i e no transaction costs) information is complete (as far as the transaction is concerned) there are no externalities involved (assuming free and open competition) 9 \x0cand the market is actually fully linked by the lock in process as described 11 1 3 Blockchain distributed ledger technologies and cryptoken The main thrust of the blockchain technology is commonly termed as Distributed Ledger and Database Technologies It is best described as an encrypted database of ledger transactions which are distributed over the networks as the records which are commonly maintained by the participating computers on the networks and updated by the networks continuously from the beginning of its creation up to the current time The network is a fully decentralised system and the maintenance of such network is done on voluntary basis It is dubbed as the new way of computing which overcomes many of the defects of the centralised systems of database managements Smart Contracts on the other hand is actually a set of predetermined codes which is performing a Turing complete process whereby the codes are self executing all the pre determined rules and process which one set in place is no longer changeable or amendable unilaterally by any parties A cryptoken in short is a set of algorithms based on the Ethereum codes of smart contracts A cryptoken is basically backed by the \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic appropriation rights\xe2\x80\x9d from the applications of the intellectual property concerned or easier still to think of it as a flow through entity Furthermore with such character the cryptoken could play the role as instruments in a trust less system of exchanges as described above 1 4 Tokenising intellectual property rights as a commodity Let\xe2\x80\x99s refer back to what Arrow (1962) suggestion where if we could \xe2\x80\x9ccommoditise\xe2\x80\x9d Intellectual Property Rights by assigning the \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic appropriation rights\xe2\x80\x9d to it which then allows such commodities to be exchanged This could be accomplished by linking directly the economic 11 Note that the example suffers from some limitations due to its simplified nature For the purpose of the discussion here the example suffices to make home the point that \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d system of exchanges are possible if it could be transacted and defined in such logical manner 10 \x0cbenefits from those IPR onto Smart Contracts as defined before and the Smart Contracts will provide the necessary linkages between the economic benefit claims of the IPR by the owners of such IPR and any such benefits will \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically\xe2\x80\x9d flows from the usage of the IPR to the \xe2\x80\x9ccontracting\xe2\x80\x9d parties involved in such IPR An example of this would be that the IPR owners are giving out IOU\xe2\x80\x99s to the \xe2\x80\x9cfunders\xe2\x80\x9d who funded the activities related to the IPR Once \xe2\x80\x9ccontracted\xe2\x80\x9d the flows will be on an automated basis from the IPR owners/users to the \xe2\x80\x9cfunders\xe2\x80\x9d The first step is to define those economic claims and link them to the Smart Contracts secondly the terms of the exchanges between the IPR owner and the \xe2\x80\x9cfunders\xe2\x80\x9d could be linked by having the \xe2\x80\x9cfunders\xe2\x80\x9d to make their payments in some currencies such as cryptocurrencies Since the IOU\xe2\x80\x99s are essentially the promise of future delivery of \xe2\x80\x9cpayments\xe2\x80\x9d against a current payment of cryptocurrencies the future payments itself could also be made in some cryptocurrencies Once the whole links could be established they could then be entered onto a blockchain systems whereby the ledgers and database will be updated on real time basis Under such system a crypto token to represent the future claims could be generated For the purpose here such crypto token is named as \xe2\x80\x9ccryptoken\xe2\x80\x9d In essence a cryptoken is the whole stack of Smart Contracts entered onto the blockchain which will perform its intended purpose on an automated basis as a full \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d economics exchange program Since such cryptoken is enshrined within the \xe2\x80\x9clock up\xe2\x80\x9d environment the issues of Paymentsvs Delivery or Post Trade Settlements are solved Furthermore if proper valuations in terms of its current value as well as future values and the risks involved could be quantified then such cryptoken could be categorised as a commodity (or more aptly a digital asset) which then could by itself be exchanged and traded And since the core subject matter is related to economic\xe2\x80\x99s appropriations derived by the IPR this type of cryptokens are in fact commoditising the IPR itself as Arrow (1962) had imagined The focus of next few section is to explain how such concept could be implemented within 11 \x0can actual setting 2 Tokenising metal oxide based ultra capacitors technology The main subject of this paper is how to could create a \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d economic exchanges in real life environment based on a commodity which in this case is an Intellectual Property Rights over a certain technology used in the manufacturing of metal oxide based ultra capacitors This section proceeds with a brief description of the technology (or IPR) and how such IPR be commoditised 12 2 1 Metal Oxide based ultra capacitors technology Capacitors had been in the market for a long time however only of late the advancement in the technology of capacitors had taken giants leaps whereby the race for the energy storage market had produced what is called as ultra capacitors In the case of the specific metal oxide based ultra capacitors technology dealt with here took a long time from its early days of discoveries to reach the market place It is reminiscent of a case where funding and investments took a long time before any positive returns on investments are realised What further complicates the matter is the intellectual property involved are very delicate as it involves multi facets from the scientific discovery to the industrialisation of the manufacturing process and all the way to the end products for the users All in all it took almost 30 years from the early discovery to where it is today 13 What\xe2\x80\x99s interesting though is the development for the market for energy storage devices which had taken leap and bound over the last ten years and with the coming of new innovations 12 The set of metal oxide technologies referred to here is based on patents intellectual property rights as well as the various developments by Aero Beidou organisation (please see http //aerobeidou com) and the details of the various patents are available from http //aerobeidou com/#Patents 13 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the delay is solely due to scientific discoveries but in some ways it also depends on the maturity and demand of the energy storage markets 12 \x0csuch as the electric vehicle and Internet of Things (IoT) devices the market for energy storage with higher power density as well as high energy density had increased exponentially The issues facing ultra capacitors comparing to batteries (as the traditional energy storage devices) is akin to a vase (ultra capacitors) and a bottle (batteries such as Lithium Ion) where a vase could fill in water and dispose water quickly in large volumes (in a matter of seconds) whilst a bottle could take in small volume of water over time and dispose water off in the same manner Potent combinations between the two are what the market really need energy storage devices that can take in energy rather quickly and pour them out over time (that is the vase is the intake and the bottle is the one pouring out) Such feat however could not be accomplished easily with existing ultra capacitors in the market and the problem lies with the design of such ultra capacitors Most existing ultracapacitors would have limits in terms of its \xe2\x80\x9cshape\xe2\x80\x9d which is bulky and round and size which is \xe2\x80\x9clarge\xe2\x80\x9d on the other hand most capacitors could only handle lower voltages of up to 2 75 Volts and can be designed in a cascade or serial arrangement which requires a balance circuitry In the case of the metal oxide based ultra capacitor it could typically be stacked up as a single unit to match the battery\xe2\x80\x99s voltage and no extra balance circuit is required This is the major advantage of the technology 14 The metal oxide based ultra capacitors invented and designed under the various Intellectual Property Rights addressed here could overcome those limitations as described before First it can be designed to the smallest (as small as 15x17mm thickness 0 25mm with 3 3V with the capacitance of 5mF) 15 it can easily be stacked to reach combined voltage of up to 100 volts (or more depending on the needs of the applications) there are no upper limits in terms larger sizes (due to stacking capabilities) it shapes are in forms of boxes (similar to Lithium Ion batteries 14 There are few strands of technological advancements in ultra capacitors namely the carbon based the graphene based as well as metal oxide based Each had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of the performance and economics For details please refer to studies by Burke (2009) 15 Thus far this is the smallest size that can be produced which is the smallest available in the market currently 13 \x0cshapes) it can be installed and operated in extreme conditions and environments and many other abilities that the batteries have As such effectively it can come together with the batteries as added component in almost all environments that the batteries could be applied in 16 What we could claim here is that the metal oxide ultra capacitor technology presented here would be the way to solve the needs of energy storage requirements today and as the technology is being further developed it could potentially satisfy the needs of the future As in most technologies in computers and electronics it could be moving on the path of the famous \xe2\x80\x9cMoore\xe2\x80\x99s Law\xe2\x80\x9d whereby it could be further decreased in sizes whilst increased in the capacities 17 2 2 How the deployment of the ultra capacitor technology could be commoditised One of the most important issues of any IPR is about its claim to the economic appropriations as explained in earlier sections Economic appropriations are measured by the economic performance which performs the final validation of such claims The question now would be what are the specific claims that the metal oxide ultra capacitors under study here could lay its claims on the performance as in comparisons to others in the same field (i e other ultracapacitors technologies) The answer lies in the basic feature of standard measurement in any ultra capacitors which is farad (symbol F) the SI derived unit of electrical capacitance which is the ability of a body to store an electrical charge Farad is derived from the English physicist Michael Faraday who first proposed such unit of measurement Farad could be measured in many ways and one of the most simplest measure is as follows 16 Such as Lithium Ion batteries Lithium Ion batteries are used as reference here since it is widely applied within the market and it represents superior technology when comes to batteries 17 The technology developments would involve continuous collaborations with various other developers research labs and universities in search of higher capacitance materials and processes of manufacturing of the ultra capacitors to achieve higher output capability and higher operating temperature sustainability Please see Burke (2009) for a summary of the technological advancements in ultra capacitors technology and its usage within the industries 14 \x0cf arad = Ampere \xe2\x88\x97 time in seconds V oltage (3) The capacitance is produced within the ultra capacitor from the materials used and the methods of its applications within any specific units In the case under study here the materials used are a mix of metal oxides namely Ruthenium Nickel and Titanium oxides combined with Tantalum a Rare Earth element Under the patents involved it had been documented that such materials being applied in a certain manner combined with the methods of constructing the anodes cathodes and electrolytes would produce a certain farad per gram of ultra capacitor cells These cells are the one being produced in the production lines which are directly observable and measurable First let us define the materials used in the manufacturing as x which is a unit measure of the combined weights in units of gram x = materials weights in gram (4) The metal oxides then are converted based on the technology into the capacitance in the ultra capacitor which is measured by the \xe2\x80\x9cCapacitance Conversion Ratio\xe2\x80\x9d represented by the symbol \xce\xb1(x) below \xce\xb1(x) = f arad x (5) The manufacturing process converts \xe2\x80\x9cessential raw materials\xe2\x80\x9d as its input y which is measured in its weights in gram into the ultra capacitor cells which produce its rated performance Such inputs of y would then produce the unit farads as its output based on a certain efficiency which is termed as \xe2\x80\x9cCapacitance Efficiency Ratio\xe2\x80\x9d represented by the symbol \xce\xb2 which could be described by the following equation 15 \x0c\xce\xb2(y) = y cell (6) Now we could write the farad equation for the ultra capacitor cells to be produced within the manufacturing process as f (\xce\xb1(x) \xce\xb2(y)) = \xce\xb1(x) f arad = \xce\xb2(y) cell (7) Essential parts of what\xe2\x80\x99s the technology contributes are the Capacitance Conversion Ratio and the manufacturing technology provides the Capacitance Efficiency Ratio In order for any of the formulas to have economic meaning the measures for \xce\xb1(x) and \xce\xb2(y) needs to be disclosed by the IPR claims which means that they are required to be made public What goes on in terms of the usage of exact raw materials to achieve those \xce\xb1(x) and \xce\xb2(y) are not revealed since it is hidden inside the f (\xce\xb1(x) \xce\xb2(y)) formula and effectively x and y as units in grams canceled each other out (and hence subsumed within the farad per cell unit measures) 18 These measures could be time subscripted to show improvements over time (i e as the technology progressed) and it can also be measured and tracked progressively The farad equation links to the cash flows from the production process could be determined by identifying the ratio of revenue from the farads produced over a set period of time This is done as follows Ft = ft \xe2\x88\x97 nt \xe2\x88\x97 qt (8) where nt = total number of cells produced during period t and qt is the revenue per farad to be assigned to each unit of farad produced during period t We could now say that Ft represents 18 Notice that in the formula x the exact amount of the \xe2\x80\x9cessential raw materials\xe2\x80\x9d conversion rates need not be disclosed publicly since it subsumed inside the formula That is neat since there are publicly disclosed claims and could be verified claim from the data (of performance) and yet the trade secrets could remain hidden 16 \x0cthe total value captured for the total farads produced by the production lines during the period t This total value could be priced in units of financial values depending on the denominations of qt financial terms which could be in any currency (such as US Dollar) The present value of all incoming cash flows Ft could be obtained simply by applying the discounted cash flows formula which is F ARADt=0 = T X Ft \xe2\x88\x97 Rt (9) t=1 where Rt is the discount rates vector for each period t used for discounting of the cash flows What F ARAD equation above does is to map the variables ft nt and qt to a single estimated value at time t = 0 The parameters such as ft nt and qt are disclosed to allow F ARAD to be calculated on real time once the production schedules are set within the total period T The production schedules here will be in units of cells to be produced and the measured capacitance per unit of those cells which are all could be published and announced publicly (and audited physically) The cycle from productions to the revenue flows if hard coded onto blockchain Smart Contracts on a full automata basis accomplished what is termed as \xe2\x80\x9cTuring complete\xe2\x80\x9d process 19 The links from physical manufacturing process to financial measures (which is the price representing expected present values) \xe2\x80\x9cmaps\xe2\x80\x9d the underlying process of generations of cash flows onto the what is termed as Arrow Debreu securities (as described by Arrow and Debreu(1954) 20 What is left now is to encode all inputs onto a \xe2\x80\x9ctrust less\xe2\x80\x9d system of Smart Contracts Financially what had been described in the above F ARAD formula is akin to a sum of the present value of forward sale of the securities it is a promise of contributions of future flows of values 19 The notion of Turing completeness is important even though the claim of 100% completeness here is still quite premature at the current stage of the technology 20 The notion of direct and exact mapping between Turing complete and Arrow Debreu complete is a novel idea We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t address this issue here as the subject requires much more rigorous treatment than what could be done in this paper 17 \x0cto F ARAD from the IPR owner or users based on specific performance So what had been accomplished is to securitise the future income flows into forward sale contracts whereby the deliveries (of the promised performance) delivered over the time period in the set time frames and periods These forward contracts could then be coded in the trust less systems as described in the previous sections 2 3 How Ethereum blockchain could be used to generate the Smart Contracts for FARAD cryptoken There are few major steps to create the smart contracts and cryptoken for FARAD First for the creation of FARAD ERC20 coding approach of Ethereum is deployed to create the smart tokens These smart tokens are then linked to the smart contract which is flows of revenue from the ultra capacitor production lines into an escrow box The smart contract codes are based on the precise formula for farad which at any time t = a the values of F ARAD could be determined as follows F ARADt=a = Escrowt=a + T X Ft \xe2\x88\x97 Rt (10) t=a+1 The valuation could be done by anyone simply by checking the data and developed their own forecast of future rates for the present value calculations (which could be obtained from market wide data such as a certain premium over prevailing interest rates) The market then decides what is the price of FARAD at time t = a based on views of the future Those views could be made on their judgment in regards to technological developments prices of ultra capacitors in the markets market competitions as well as the discount rates that they use to infer their present value calculations 18 \x0c3 Securitisation and commoditising of intellectual property rights on Ethereum blockchain via cryptoken This section discusses how the flows of Smart Contract using the Ethereum Network blockchain technology be applied to the idea of securitising the economic appropriation rights as described before 3 1 Ethereum blockchain Ethereum blockchain is among the leading blockchain platform which promotes the uses of \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d 21 The preferred development platform for developing Smart Contract for Ethereum is by using Solidity Platform22 on the Ethereum Virtual Machine 23 The architecture of F ARAD Smart Contracts The architecture of the F ARAD Smart Contracts is done by separating areas of concerns into their own contract These contracts are then assembled together to make a solid end contract All these intermediary contracts are designed to be reusable at a later time making the development of other smart contracts in the future to be easier and faster by using fully tested contract components Smart Contracts that are developed for F ARAD program are 1 Ownable The interface to define ownership of the contract 2 Owned The implementation of Ownable interface to change the ownership of the contract 21 The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d was coined by computer scientist Nick Szabo (see Szabo(1997)) with the goal of bringing contract law and related business practices to the design of electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet 22 Solidity is a Contract Oriented Programming Language for Ethereum Platform 23 EVM is a sandboxed runtime environment for Smart Contract on Ethereum Networks 19 \x0c3 ERC20 The Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) Issue 20 Smart Contract interface definitions to ensure fungibility of all ERC20 compatible tokens on the Ethereum Network 4 ERC20Token The implementation of ERC20 5 Administerable The Contract for administering manufacturing process and the escrow account management 6 Dashboard Implementing the F ARAD manufacturing data and escrow updates 7 Computable The safe implementation of add subtract and multiply on EVM to prevent overflows 8 Guarded A set of reusable modifiers for other contracts to use 9 FRDToken The F ARAD token implementation including the Dashboard contract 10 FRDCrowdSale The F ARAD crowd sale implementation The above relations are summarised in the diagram attached in the Appendix showing the relations on each of the contract defined above into a larger FARAD Smart Contract Key design criteria One of the important design criteria is the subject of updating values from the ultra capacitor manufacturing process as well as when payment to the Escrow Ledger is to be executed One thing for sure this should be a controlled process but should be seen by the public at all times That is why the design of the Dashboard contract is derived from Administrable contract Guarded and Ownable contract The implementations of all crucial functions can be executed 20 \x0cby the creator of the contract only Each time the production volume is generated the maintainer of F ARAD Smart Contract24 (the Maintainer) shall call the function that updates the production volume as well as the balance in the Escrow Ledger account All these operations are notified to all event subscribers and will be notified on the Blockchain through the event notification for each of the action by the Maintainer There are data inputs as parameters such as ft nt qt and T as described before But x and y are not shown in the data push In fact what will appear in the data push would only be t\xe2\x80\x99s which is the disclosed Production Schedules Ledger The coding of Ethereum Smart Contracts The main base of the coding of Ethereum Smart Contracts for F ARAD are as follows 1 Define the parameters of the Smart Contracts 2 Define the Data Push variables of the for the Smart Contracts 3 Code the Smart Contract from F ARAD to the Production Schedules Ledger of the ultra capacitors 4 Explain the flows from productions to F ARAD in terms of the Escrow Ledger 5 Explain how the Values within the Escrow Ledger represents the fundamental valuation of F ARAD As could be seen from the graph the first creation is by creating a cryptoken called F ARAD using ERC20 base codes of Ethereum which then could be used within a token issuance and sale process Via the Smart Contract the cryptoken is linked to the metal oxide intellectual 24 Virtue Fintech FZ LLC is the organisation to maintain F ARAD Smart Contract 21 \x0cproperty rights through the production process which will generate the cash flows based on the production of ultra capacitor cells within the factory production lines The records of the manufacturing process will be updated automatically onto the blockchain data which then triggers payment entry into the Escrow Ledger which will be made by in a fiat currency (which would then requires push data) or using another token such as Ether based on a predetermined formula 3 2 Novelty of the suggested approach The approach suggested should have lots of future development implications for any IPR developers and owners who would like to get their IPR funded In particular many IPR had reached beyond the pilot stage and had begun the industrial applications Which at such stage the pull and push between the push of the market demands for greater disclosures of the IPR and the pull of maintaining the advantage of secrecy within the IPR are the greatest This so called tug of war could potentially be reduced by taking the approach of the examples as we have developed for F ARAD There are ways to fill the demand from the market for greater and more transparent disclosures without the need of opening the whole IPR to deep technical scrutiny What is important are the claims that have economics appropriations attached to it must be disclosed and be measurable Many trade secrets could remain hidden and need not be disclosed and it can be wrapped within the \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology\xe2\x80\x9d boxes as long as the mapping from those boxes onto the financial measures are precise and could be determined before hand Furthermore the power of automata within the Smart Contract will ensure that there is no shirking from the part of IPR owners/users from the promises made and if they could not perform whatever claims and the financial results could be audit able from the blockchain data itself This element of audit ability on blockchain is a subject that has lots of future use and 22 \x0cbenefits Audit ability is important when coming to governance and compliance matters The limitations that the proposed approach thus far is on the automata part of the manufacturing process For example at the current stage of development the need to do a \xe2\x80\x9cdata push\xe2\x80\x9d at some of the data entry points rather than a pure automation are required This would open issues and questions of integrity and audit ability and some other sorts of questions This could only be answered by advancing the integration of blockchain programming within the manufacturing process itself that is by installing automata of data push from the process itself onto the blockchain This would be among the future stages of development 3 3 Future development of F ARAD Smart Contracts The only thing left now is to close some of the \xe2\x80\x9copen ended\xe2\x80\x9d part of the F ARAD Smart Contracts which among others are as follows 1 To further eliminate any push data onto the blockchain from the production process 2 To further eliminate the needs of push data from the production process revenue flows and the Escrow Ledger 3 To develop governance and audit functions within the blockchain in order to allow anyone (within the blockchain process) to perform any real time audit (market transparency) 4 To further develop and integrate the value chain and supply chain process into the blockchain ecosystem 5 To further develop whereby the \xe2\x80\x9cend users\xe2\x80\x9d of supply chain and value chain parties could use the F ARAD cryptoken as its currency of transactions related to the products and any related products produced from the F ARAD ecosystem 23 \x0cNevertheless we could claim that what we proposed here are novel approach towards linking directly Intellectual Property Rights to it\xe2\x80\x99s economic activities which could then be transferred directly to the end beneficiaries (i e the investors and end users) 4 Conclusions Investments in technological innovations require platform where the investors and the innovators could trade with each other by exchanging Intellectual Property Rights commodity For such commodity to have any economic values it must carry with it the economic appropriation rights claimed by the innovation The commodity as presented in this paper could be structured using the blockchain technology in forms of crypto token or cryptoken During the first instance the exchange is between the innovators and initial investors by having the cryptoken offered to the investors and thereafter the initial investors could trade such cryptoken in the market Later on if a market could be created the end products from the innovation itself could be a physical commodity to be traded using the cryptoken as its currency An example of how this could be done in practice is the creation of F ARAD the first cryptoken or cryptocurrency ever introduced to the market to have the benefits arising from the technology for manufacturing and production of metal oxide based ultra capacitors The economic valuation of F ARAD is tied and linked directly to the future cash flows arising from such production process in real time and automatic basis In doing so we answered the problems raised by a great economist Kenneth Arrow who brought the notion of such commodity to be created and for that we honour another great innovator Michael Faraday by naming such commodity in his name F ARAD Both great innovators had their name enshrined in the public domain and we wish that F ARAD would be generated in real life in their honour 24 \x0cReferences and
