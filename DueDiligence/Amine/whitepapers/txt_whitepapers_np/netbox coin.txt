Netbox Browser a web browser Currently there are several major well known web browsers and a few dozen less well known One feature is common for them all a high degree of centralization These browsers are owned and operated by large corporations most often commercial ones These corporations take decisions when developing their products due to commercial reasons aimed at getting benefits In these corporations issues of privacy personal data ownership and product development are resolved without the participation of the users themselves which creates certain concerns among the users The users do not have a clear idea of what data are transmitted by browsers to the corporate central servers just like there is no guarantee of lack of breaches The Netbox Browser is an application for PC and mobile devices the main function of which in addition to access to web resources is to maintain the functioning of the Netbox Chain blockchain network The Netbox Browser is the first web browser that does not have a centralized infrastructure all personal data of users belong only to them and decisions on the areas of development of the product are made by the community The Netbox Browser infrastructure is completely transparent and distributed as it is stored without the use of central servers in the Netbox Chain blockchain structures An individual address in the blockchain network is assigned to each web browser this address can store Netbox Coins the currency of the Netbox Chain blockchain network The larger the active audience of the web browser is the faster and more reliable transactions are conducted in the blockchain All Netbox Browsers are united in the Netbox Chain blockchain network Each browser is a node of this network that stores and confirms the truth of the network blocks To confirm the truth the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism is used in which each member of the network (each web browser) can verify the blocks ensuring their truth with a certain amount of the Netbox Coin currency The node receives a reward proportional to the amount of currency issued as a guarantee To verify the blocks the Netbox Chain network shall have as many online nodes as possible To do this the Netbox Chain network encourages the users of the Netbox Browser working online by charging them fees in the Netbox Coin currency proportional to the time 6 \x0cof the browsers being online and the user activity in these browsers Rewards are accrued in each new network block and distributed among the participants 7 \x0c2 Netbox Chain a blockchain network 2 1 Main and test networks The Netbox Chain network is a distributed transaction ledger with transactions written in sequential order into data structures called blocks Each block points to the previous one so it is always possible to know the state of the network at any point in time in the past Each block added to the blockchain is verified through a procedure known as Proof of Stake each user can put out a certain amount of Netbox Coins to participate in the validation of blocks and receive a reward for it (see PROJECT ECONOMY) The Netbox Chain functions both in the test mode and in the main mode The Netbox TestChain test network is designed for developers and blocks added to this network are validated without using Netbox Coins from the main Netbox Chain network The Netbox Chain is based on the PIVX open source blockchain (https //pivx org/) 2 2 Network blocks In the Netbox Chain two types of blocks are possible ordinary blocks and superblocks Superblocks are the first 200 blocks on the network in which transactions required to bring the network to its initial state are enclosed the premine emission is carried out in the amount of 72 000 000 coins (see PROJECT ECONOMY) 2 3 Transactions and rate The amount of information recorded in one block can reach 2 MB the amount of memory in which information about 13 000 transactions can be stored Thus taking into account that the blocks are generated every minute we can declare that the maximum transaction rate in the network can be up to 220 TPS 8 \x0c2 4 Fees There are no transaction fees in the Netbox Chain The reward for a new block is always emitted by the network itself and is distributed among the nodes involved in finding this block through the Proof of Stake procedure Thus unlike for example the Bitcoin network users willing to conduct a transaction on the network do not have to pay fees that would be paid out to the nodes involved in finding the block (miners according to the Bitcoin terminology) 2 5 Network nodes In the Netbox Chain there are two types of nodes masternodes and ordinary nodes An ordinary node is any Netbox Browser running on the user\ s PC Masternodes require a separate dedicated server with a fixed IP address a Masternodes Masternodes have the following features \xef\x82\xb7 ensure regular income for their owners \xef\x82\xb7 ensure the privacy of transactions by mixing coins on masternodes \xef\x82\xb7 decentralized voting through the Netbox Vote mechanism \xef\x82\xb7 shall always be online have a static IP address and a fixed port \xef\x82\xb7 Netbox Coins allocated to enable the masternode are not stored in the masternode thus in case of a successful attack on the server where the masternode is located 10 000 Netbox Coin allocated by the user to create it will remain safe b Ordinary nodes The Netbox Browsers are ordinary nodes of the network that have the following features \xef\x82\xb7 the ability to find blocks putting out a certain amount of Netbox Coins into the Proof of Stake mechanism and get rewarded for it \xef\x82\xb7 9 the ability to receive fees for the activity in the browser \x0c3 Netbox Wallet a multi currency crypto wallet a Supported currencies The Netbox Browser has the integrated Netbox Wallet multi currency cryptowallet With the crypto wallet it is possible to store and conduct transactions both in the internal Netbox Coin cryptocurrency and in other popular cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin Ethereum) The Netbox Wallet also allows the user to have accounts in fiat currencies such as USD and EUR For all cryptocurrencies supported by the Netbox Wallet cryptographic keys and addresses are generated on the corresponding blockchain networks b Wallet features With the Netbox Wallet it is possible to store send receive and exchange all cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies supported by it For example the user of the Netbox Wallet can exchange Netbox Coins to Bitcoins or USD It is possible to replenish the fiat accounts both using a payment card and by direct bank transfer to the Netbox Wallet account c Exchange and trading transactions Within the Netbox Wallet it is possible to conduct exchange and trading transactions between all the supported cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies An exchange transaction is conducted using the current system rate for this currency pair Exchange transactions are performed in the shortest possible time with the main delay determined by the transaction rate in the corresponding blockchain A trading transaction is carried out by placing a trade request where the desired rate is set by the user The term of execution of a trading transaction depends both on the 10 \x0cterm of execution of the trade request and on the delay in the execution of the transaction in the corresponding blockchain d Security When creating a Netbox Wallet a pair of cryptographic keys are generated for the user public and private ones The private key is used for transactions to send Netbox Coins from the user\ s wallet For the convenience and security of the user the private key is stored only in an encrypted form The encryption key is the password assigned by the user The team does not and cannot have any access to the users\ private keys as they are stored only in an encrypted form The key is decrypted on the user\ s side to sign transactions related to sending cryptocurrency A password known only to the user is used for decryption The user bears the sole responsibility for keeping the password secure 11 \x0c4 Netbox Pay a payment solution a Payment cards Any user of the Netbox Wallet can order the issue of a plastic card to be used in any payment terminals A card is issued within a week and delivered to the client by mail A separate card account denominated in the fiat currency is created for the user The user can replenish the account from their both fiat and cryptocurrency accounts When replenishing from a cryptocurrency account an exchange transaction will be conducted automatically It is also possible to configure the rules for automatic replenishment of the card account For example when the account balance is reduced to the specified level the account can be replenished automatically with the specified amount The source for replenishment can be any account both fiat and cryptocurrency in the Netbox Wallet b Online purchase payments The issued plastic card can be used for shopping in online stores When the user is prompted to enter the payment card information on the product payment page the Netbox Browser automatically recognizes the situation and offers to fill in the data of the user\ s issued plastic card automatically All that is left to do for the user is to click Pay If there are not enough funds on the card account it can be automatically replenished including from a crypto account if the corresponding conversion rule is configured 12 \x0c5 Netbox Vote initiatives and voting Decentralization is the central idea in the philosophy of the Netbox Global team This applies not only to the ways of the technical implementation of the infrastructure but also to the ways of management and development of the products Netbox Global not being a corporate entity strives for active community participation in strategic and tactical decision making To do this the Netbox Chain blockchain includes Netbox Vote an initiative and voting tool Each member of the network can put forward their own idea of infrastructure development in general or of the implementation of specific aspects of the products Such an initiative is recorded in Netbox Chain and subsequently other users can support it by voting Users\ voices are also recorded in Netbox Chain to demonstrate transparency in making decisions about the further project development In addition to direct voting users can fund any idea When creating an initiative a separate address in the Netbox Chain is automatically created for it to which users can donate their funds to support its development and implementation within Netbox Global The funds collected for the implementation of initiatives become available to the team only after the team starts working on the selected initiative The funds donated for initiatives that have not been accepted for execution within two weeks are returned to the users in full The initiatives put forward the results of the voting as well as the collected amounts are available in the special Netbox Chain section of the Blockchain Explorer When drawing up a development plan and choosing the initiatives to be implemented the team is guided by the results of the users\ voting and taking into the funds collected for their implementation Initiatives for which the product of the number of votes and the amount of the collected funds is maximum are included in the priority development plan The development plan is published on the Netbox Global website and the development progress can be traced in our GitHub 13 \x0c6 Netbox Trust a web site trust rating From the information point of view the modern Internet is a very insecure environment In this environment there is a large amount of freely circulating low quality content that misleads users or that is dangerous or unpleasant for them For example Fake News has become an unpleasant trend of recent times and their originators use their privileged position to achieve their own political or commercial goals However the establishment of centralized censorship on the Internet would run counter to the principles of freedom of information Therefore the Netbox Trust product in which users will be able to evaluate the content to interact in the Netbox Browser was proposed for the Netbox Global infrastructure Low quality content will be labeled by the users of the Netbox Browser and these labels will be saved in the Netbox Chain to avoid the possibility of compromising them On the other hand when accessing the Internet via the Netbox Browser users will receive instant information on the quality of the content that has been rated by other users For example if a user visits a product page in an online store and other users have labeled that page as a low quality product or unreliable supplier the Netbox Browser will display an appropriate warning signal to the user The Netbox Trust can be used via the Netbox Browser by both those who want to evaluate the content as well as for the content consumers who want to get information about it from the community In addition to direct ratings users can leave their comments which are also recorded in the Netbox Chain and subsequently extracted from there to be demonstrated The content evaluation will be based on the following criteria information authenticity content safety suitability for children product quality (for online stores) supplier reliability (for online stores) 14 \x0cAs a result the Netbox Browser can be configured in such a way that a certain type of content is not displayed or displayed with a warning For example in case any content that is inappropriate for children is blocked via the Netbox Trust it is possible to have a browser in which the mental state and emotions of the child are not threatened 15 \x0c7 Netbox Video a distributed video hosting Advanced popular video hosting platforms such as YouTube Twitch and others are gaining popularity Availability and diversity of content are the main factors to ensure the stable demand on the Internet for the use of such video services However the main drawback of the existing video services is the high level of content censorship In many countries video hosting has to restrict access or remove certain content at the request of the authorities who often pursue their political or personal goals Also the content is constantly blocked by video hosting services if there are so called copyright items in it from the point of view of the administration For free and independent placement and use of the video content Netbox Global decided to create its own video hosting service Netbox Video Netbox Video does not include any central repository for video files Instead fragments of video files are stored on devices of the Netbox Chain users similar to the BitTorrent protocol The content availability will be directly dependent on the number of nodes online and at the same time a special algorithm will distribute the fragments of files so that the most popular content is best available At the same time the video content index is stored in the Netbox Chain and for this reason it cannot be compromised or changed by the administration at the request of a third party The internal economy of working with the Netbox Video is that some users of the Netbox Chain network lease out their storage space to store fragments of video files while other users who are watching this content (downloading file fragments) automatically pay them for it using the Netbox Coin cryptocurrency The reward for leasing out the storage space depends on the amount of time for which this content is available for download and on the channel capacity For consumers of the same content to pay for the Netbox Video will not be a serious financial burden and normally it will be compensated with accruals in Netbox Coins for using the browser 16 \x0c8 Netbox Drive a distributed cloud Storage of user files using cloud storage has become a popular service in the last few years Users utilize cloud storage to share photos videos and documents as well as to store them securely with no linking to the user\ s devices However the high degree of centralization of such cloud services is criticized by them Centralized storage is potentially unsafe information can be distorted or corrupted by attackers in case the cloud service is compromised Netbox Drive is a technology for distributed storage of user files the integrity of which is guaranteed by the Netbox Chain blockchain The 100% file availability in the Netbox Drive is guaranteed by a masternode network the main requirement for which is the maximum online time The masternode owners can lease out their storage space and the Netbox Drive users will make payments to the masternode owners using the Netbox Coin currency The Netbox Drive is integrated into the Netbox Browser in a web access mode as well as into the operating system to which the Netbox Drive is integrated in a format of a folder in the file system 17 \x0c9 Netbox Proxy a distributed proxy The main purpose of the Netbox Proxy creation is to provide users with the ability to use the Internet without any restrictions imposed by third parties who control the access In many countries access to Internet is partially blocked Unfortunately at the same time in many cases users are protected not only from information that is really dangerous for them According to the Netbox Global team the Internet is a free environment which fundamental principle is the maximum availability of information Another important principle of the free Internet is privacy which is currently almost not provided with standard tools available to users For example Internet service providers are required to disclose complete and detailed information about the user\ s activity on the Internet At the same time such actions are most often taken without any consent or at least notification of the user Taking into account the above Netbox Global considers justified the creation of the Netbox Proxy mechanism within the Netbox Browser to provide full and private access to the entire Internet using a distributed proxy system Compared to traditional proxies and VPN services Netbox Proxy is not centralized For example each particular proxy or VPN server can be blocked at the Internet service provider level This makes their work vulnerable and deprives many users of the ability to have full access to the Internet Unlike such services Netbox Proxy is based on the principle of providing by some Netbox Browser users of their Internet channels to other users Each request can go through a completely random channel while the traffic between the user and the point of exit from the Netbox Proxy network to the external Internet is encrypted Therefore a particular provider cannot see the sequence of actions of a particular user and consequently the user\ s privacy will not be compromised In addition users from countries where certain Internet resources are blocked will be given access to these resources through the Internet channels of users from other countries where this access is not restricted The internal economy of working with the Netbox Proxy is that some users of the network Netbox Chain lease out their Internet channel and other users use this channel to access the Internet A certain algorithm balances the loads on the Internet channels depending on their throughput capacity and the geography of users The reward for leasing out the Internet channel depends on the amount of time for which this channel is available 18 \x0cfor using and on its capacity For consumers who get access to the Internet to pay for the Netbox Proxy will not be a serious financial burden and normally it will be compensated with accruals in Netbox Coins for actively using the browser 19 \x0c10 Netbox Store a distributed application marketplace With the advent development and distribution of various blockchains so called distributed applications or dApps came into use They are distinguished from the classic computer and mobile applications by the absence of a central server and the use of blockchains to store application data as well as to implement the internal logic through smart contracts in the blockchain To use such applications users shall install special add ons in their web browsers through which dApps will be able to perform operations in the blockchain These add ons are already integrated into the Netbox Browser making it fully available to run dApps for all popular blockchains In addition to add ons required to operate dApps the Netbox Browser contains their store Netbox Store where the browser users can freely find and run dApps The dApp developers can for free and without restrictions place dApps in the Netbox Store that will make them available to the entire browser audience The Netbox Browser users can rate different dApps using the Netbox Trust tool Depending on the user ratings and popularity of certain dApps they are ranked in the store The most popular applications with the highest ratings occupy higher positions in the store dApps labeled by a significant number of users as unwanted or dangerous are automatically removed from the store 20 \x0cPROJECT ECONOMY 1 Transition from a centralized economic model to a decentralized one The Netbox Global team produces a ready to use product the development of which has been made entirely at their expense Netbox Global does not use any financial schemes that involve obligations to users (ICO with guaranteed income PreSell preICO etc ) Initially the team owns 100% of the project share but for the successful promotion and improvement of the product the following distribution of the shares of coins issued is planned max supply minimal mining amount premine team supply Airdrop (see Airdrop) 100 000 000 100% 28 000 000 28% 72 000 000 72% 66 000 000 66% 6 000 000 6% The team will gradually reduce its share of ownership by selling its coins according to the established sale conditions directing part of the proceeds to the project development According to the plan the process of transition to a decentralized economic model will take approximately 3 4 years 21 \x0cTransition to decentralized ownership of Netbox Coins will be implemented in two stages differing by the emission principles In the first stage (beta version of the NetBox platform) the block reward will decrease by 1% every week (10 000 blocks) The duration of this period will be 1 5 years The main objective of the stage is to ensure the sufficient liquidity for the network availability At the second stage the reward for the block will be formed dynamically (indefinitely tentatively starting with block # 770001) and determined by the following formula where N is the determinable constant for balancing the reward amount When running a dynamic reward calculation N=20 The main goal of dynamic emission is to create a mechanism through which the network will be able to determine the volume of emission itself depending on the intensity of use of internal tools of the Netbox Global platform 2 Relationship of the coin value with the services provided by the Netbox Global platform Coin burning To ensure a balance in the system economy a burning process is implemented which is reverse to the emission Burned coins are a kind of tax on the use of tools within the Netbox Global platform This tax will be automatically returned to the pre defined/defined addresses on the network and burned reducing the current amount of coins in circulation on the network At the first stage of the network existence the intensity of use of the platform services will be insignificant and will be completely covered with the preset emission formula ( 1% every week) In the second stage the amount of reward for new blocks will be calculated according to the above formula which will allow the network itself to increase or decrease the number of coins issued depending on the intensity of use of services of the Netbox Global platform 22 \x0c3 Investment risk minimization declaration The Netbox Global team undertakes to strictly adhere to the following rules 1) The team is not involved in mining including both masternodes and staking In case of technical need of mining to maintain the stability of the network by the team\ s efforts all coins obtained in this way will be burned 2) The team acts according to the roadmap and reserves the right to adjust it to optimize the efficiency of work processes The roadmap stages may not be linked to specific dates and may be expressed as a percentage of readiness 3) The team implements the functionality of the Netbox Global platform with the maximum degree of transparency so that everyone can get any information about the project the source codes are published in Git service blockchain addresses are published on the Netbox Global website and also there is the blockchain explorer available which allows analyzing transactions on the network 4) The team issues an annual financial report on its activities and publishes it on the Netbox Global website 4 Encouraging network members The mechanism for distribution of the reward for the found block is designed in such a way that not only masternode owners but also ordinary network users can receive the reward Since each network member performs the function necessary for the network the distribution of rewards inherent in each block is performed as follows 50% for owning a masternode 21% for coin staking 21% for active use of the Netbox Global platform tools 8% for the development team 23 \x0c5 Implementation terms Immediately after the start of the project two actions will be performed distribution of 6 000 000 Netbox Coins to the first users (see airdrop) and allocation of 6 000 000 Netbox Coins from the team\ s share for sale at the starting price of USD 0 4 per 1 coin According to the calculations such an amount will be sufficient to establish the initial infrastructure for the network operation The team undertakes to sell no more than 10 000 000 Netbox Coins per year in small amounts to minimize the price fluctuations Such sales will continue until the team loses financial control over the network to ensure the complete decentralization of the Netbox Global platform The team will make every effort to minimize the negative factors associated with the market value of the coin including the sale/purchase suspension and repurchase if necessary To ensure transparency and public control over the sale of the team\ s share the following is provided 1) All the team\ s coins are distributed over 6 addresses with 10 000 000 Netbox Coins on each 2) 10 000 000 coins will be an available annual amount to be sold by the team 3) All transactions related to these addresses are public everyone who wants will be able to get full information about the coin movement at these addresses at any time prior to the issue of the annual financial report 6 Burning and tax policy A variety of tools for different purposes are integrated in the Netbox Global platform from the ability to pay for goods around the world using cryptocurrencies (Netbox Pay) up to network add ons (Netbox Proxy) When using a tool the network automatically takes the fee denominated in the Netbox Coins and sends it to public addresses for burning thereby reducing the number of coins in circulation Consider the examples of the mechanism operation 1) The user pays for a purchase worth USD 1 000 using the Netbox Pay payment gateway Coins worth USD 1 will be transferred by the network to a public address for burning 24 \x0c2) User A gets access to the Internet using the Netbox Proxy mechanism through user B by paying the cost of the service worth 10 Netbox Coins User B will receive 9 coins and 1 coin will be transferred by the network to a public address for burning The success of the proposed economic model is based on the algorithm of dynamic change of reward for a block that will be activated at the second stage of the network operation (approximately starting from block #770001) In conjunction with the basics of the supply demand market model it is planned to create a pricing model which is more resistant to negative factors in contrast to the inflation based model The network will strive for balance issue as many coins as are being burned The revenue of the project collected as a fee for payment of services by the users within the platform is equal to the total cost of the coins burned Since the fee is a certain percentage of the service cost the following statement is true Burned_coins_price ~ service_cost * provided_service_amount Taking as an assumption as close as possible to the reality the fact that the amount of services provided is proportional to the number of users who have consumed them the above formula can be presented in the following way Burned_coins_price ~ service_cost * number_of_users The cost of the service with a small assumption is inversely proportional to the coin price if the coin price has increased then according to the supply demand market mechanism the cost of the service should fall Thus the following relation is true 25 \x0cBurned_coins_price ~ number_of_users / coin_price At the same time it is known that the system will issue as many coins as are being burned to ensure the system liquidity with a new emission Burned_coins_price = coin_price * emission_amount By equating the left parts of the above equations we come to the following relation Coin_price ~ sq_root (number_of_users/emission_amount) However it should be taken into account that there is a limit to the amount that can be emitted by achieving which it is not possible to increase the volume of the emission from the system and the demand continues to grow Hence we draw an important conclusion that the growth driver for the coin price will be the growth of the user base This economic model involves reducing inflation risks which is one of its main advantages The model is much less subject to price fluctuations depending on demand In contrast to the classical inflation based models where the value of each new issued coin is recalculated downwards this model proposes a paradigm in which the opposite vector is implemented The success of the project economy is based mainly on the number of the platform users all other processes will be directly regulated by the market 26 \x0c7 Initial infrastructure To ensure the network availability at startup the developers will put up to 20 masternodes into operation Upon reaching the total of 100 masternodes the developers\ nodes will be disabled and the reward received from them will be burned 8 Marketing 6 000 000 Netbox Coins is supposed to be distributed after the start of the project as follows 1 The first 125 000 browser users will receive 20 Netbox Coins each 2 Referral program budget will constitute 2 500 000 NetBox Coins 3 The remaining 1 000 000 Netbox Coins will be distributed among opinion leaders and mass media that will promote Netbox Global The marketing budget planned herein is a subject to change in accordance with the situation and opportunities that might occur during the campaign 27 \x0cTEAM The Netbox Global team includes like minded people working on a new paradigm of the Internet access via the Netbox Browser The team members have extensive experience in the development and distribution of web browsers for many years we have been making and distributing web browsers most of which were commercial products and therefore were not a perfect product for users Our clients included the largest Runet companies Mail Ru Group Yandex and Rambler Netbox Global is our initiative aimed at correcting all the shortcomings inherent in classic centralized web browsers
