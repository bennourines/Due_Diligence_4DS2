during the past several decades and is now rapidly moving into the Web 3 0 era with blockchain cloud computing artificial intelligence and big data as the core which are driving the change of business form organizational form and governance relationship With the development of 5G technology and the coming of connectivity era many industries including finance supply chain games storage traceability and content are accelerating the Block chain Economic Reform (hereinafter referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d and a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation have swept the world However there are still many problems to be solved in the course of Web3 0 and the evolution of block networks \xe2\x80\xa2 The lack of centralization inadequate sharing transaction congestion and expensive transaction costs \xe2\x80\xa2 The lack of interoperability and poor communication between different chains Value communication between different projects is inadequate and the island problem still exists \xe2\x80\xa2 Existing cross chain technology mainly focuses on asset transfer lacking a well defined cross chain infrastructure which will do harm to heterogeneous architecture integration \xe2\x80\xa2 The \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d is difficult to conduct with complex deployment The existing blockchain architecture cannot meet the needs of diverse and complex application scenarios in the future 5G era In order to solve these problems the Ladder Network comes into being Ladder Network is committed to becoming a cornerstone and a world leader of connectivity in the blockchain industry of the Web 3 0 era We ensure the validity of transaction 3 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper verification by introducing the witness mechanism of threshold signature We pioneered the cross chain investment model promoted the smooth flow of cross chain assets and introduced the predictor to open up the barriers between the chain and the real world Ladder Network has built a distributed decentralized safest and largest POS cross chain network with up to thousands of verification nodes and candidate verification nodes of more than 10 000 which are our key advantages to develop major projects such as data sharing security and privacy protection decentralized exchanges and Web 3 0 e commerce Through strategic cooperation with ABMatrix it is expected to directly attract tens of millions of IoT user traffic in the next three years Ladder Network can be used as the first layer protocol of blockchain industry interfacing with thousands of second tier blockchain protocols and building a value network covering multiple areas of enterprise collaboration through cross chain technology Ladder Network focuses on the markets of \xe2\x80\x9cMillion Enterprises\xe2\x80\x99 Chain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMillion Chain Interoperability\xe2\x80\x9d The BAAS blockchain service platform after being established will support the Initial Coin Offering(ICO) in fields of finance supply chain games and decentralized storage help to realize \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d and meet the needs of high throughput low latency high concurrency low power application scenarios in the 5G era so as to reshape the credit cornerstone and business form of the industry 2 Industry Background The essence of blockchain lies in a decentralized ledger with distributed data storage consensus mechanism encryption algorithm and point to point transmission Since January 3 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto dug out the first block Bitcoin has always been operating in a uninterrupted way With 10 years of 4 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper safe operation Bitcoin proved to the world the feasibility of blockchain technology In the past 10 years numerous blockchain concepts have emerged all over the world such as Ethereum ICO stable coin decentralized exchange IEO and super node economy which are subverting people\ s imagination 2 1 Development Path of Blockchain Hereby we put forward the following two pre judgments in terms of the future development of blockchain industry Firstly the world is witnessing the best time of the development of blockchain industry with urgent needs of all industries to implement the \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d In the future more BAAS blockchain service platforms will be born Driven by capital and technological assistance more and more companies and entrepreneurs have got involved in blockchain industry and the number of blockchain projects has grown rapidly On October 10 2018 IBM announced the official commercialization of IBM Food Trust In February 2019 Morgan Bank issued JPM a stable currency of bank system which is equally anchored with US dollar In March 2019 Bloomberg reported that Facebook with 2 billion users is strategically shifting its focus to blockchain industry and will use WhatsApp to launch a stable currency targeting the remittance market Blockchain technology is driving a new round of change of business model and is becoming an important support for building a credible social system There are two ways for different industries to get involved One is to develop independently and train internal blockchain talents to complete the Chain Reform The other one is to use existing blockchain platform services Considering cost and efficiency the latter one will be the main way for most companies to complete the \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d In the future many professional blockchain services namely BAAS product services will be born which will be a huge industry market and technology demand Secondly we believe that blockchain belongs to all people and the blockchain project should be a distributed one In the future there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any global 5 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper unified or area unified blockchain frameworks instead the future will be a world with numerous blockchains developing independently The diversified development and the coexistence of more than 10 000 chains will inevitably bring about problems such as heterogeneity interoperability and inefficiency of reuse Therefore the intermediate platform connecting different chains therefore emerge to boost the development of agreement technology and architecture between different chains which is also known as \xe2\x80\x9ccross chain technology\xe2\x80\x9d Cross chain technology is like the middleware of computer systems The Internet boosted the birth of distributed systems and network applications and that\xe2\x80\x99s when middleware is developed The existence of different systems and applications provided solid ground for the development of famous middleware such as IBM CICS So we believe that in the process of the million chain coexistence and the \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d the cooperation and interoperability between different chains will become more common and the cross chain technology will rise and prosper at a faster speed 2 2 Weakness of the Industry Each chain has its own logical structure block structure consensus mechanism mining model business model economic model and governance structure The first thing to consider in a million chain world is the interoperability between different chains In addition due to the diversification of application scenarios the integration of new business and existing systems should be taken into consideration which is a great challenge In terms of cross chain asset trading considering that the decentralization technology is not mature at the moment although current market centralized exchange have realized asset transfer and asset swaps it is a relatively weak cross chain scheme The disadvantage of centralized system is that users need to transfer assets to a three party as intermediary which may lead to users losing their ownership of assets and meanwhile bring security risks Exchanges that have 6 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper collected large amounts of user funds will easily become the targets of hackers The exchange prevented hackers by technical means but it also affected normal capital transactions and withdrawals At the same time transactions in exchanges are generally speaking unfair and this common phenomenon has urged people to find better cross chain solutions Speaking of cross chain information cooperation the network consensus mechanism differs from blockchain to blockchain causing problems like information non synchronization For example Bitcoin produces one block in every ten minutes and EOS 1 5 seconds So hackers will have opportunities to take advantage of it during the middle nine more minutes What\xe2\x80\x99s more the complexity of blockchain protocol and varied blockchain economic systems of different blockchain are also the main reason for the difficulty in communication between different blockchain networks In terms of the deployment of chains problems also exist the complexity of business logic leads to difficulties in \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d the real world cannot connected one by one with assets on the chain resulting in the distortion of the data the traceability system of supply chain cannot completely solve the problem authenticity verification the time span of Chain Reform is too long the technical difficulty is hard to cope with\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 2 3 The Existing Cross chain Technology There are three general types of decentralized cross chain technologies Notary schemes Sidechains/relays and Hash locking Notarization technology Interledger protocol launched by Ripple Lab is a typical notary technology which aims at connecting different ledgers and achieves synergy between them Interledger can be adopted in all kinds of ledger systems and is able to accommodate the differences between them The goal of Interledger is to create a globally uniform payment standard and a unified network financial transport protocol It\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage is that the degree of decentralization is low and it is controlled by 7 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper some particular institutions Sidechains/relays The blockchain system can read the status of the chain which means that it can support SPV (Simple Payment Verification) and verify the information of Header and Merkle tree on the block Its essential feature is that the structure and consensus characteristics of the chain are highly emphasized Generally speaking the main chain does not know the existence of the side chain but the side chain needs to know the existence of the main chain the double chain does not know the existence of the relays but the relays need to know the double chain Hash Locking The Lightning Network provides a scalable bitcoin micro payment network that greatly enhances transaction processing capabilities outside the Bitcoin network If both parties of the transaction have a payment channel on the blockchain in advance they can realize two way fast recognition and micro payments for many times in a short time If there is no point to point payment channel between the two parties as long as there is a payment path that connects them and the path is formed by multiple payment channels the Lightning Network can use this path to achieve reliable transfer of funds between the two parties Notary schemes Sidechains/relays or Hash locking are theoretical framework techniques for achieving cross chain operability At present products like Cosmos and Polkadot can realize cross chain technology In terms of cross chain technology the Ladder Network similar with Cosmos and Polkadot is a typical relays The Ladder Network is developed based on Substrate framework which is similar to Polkadot 3 Solutions 3 1 Project Vision Ladder Network is committed to building the world\ s most distributed secure and largest POS cross chain network building a trusted cross chain platform in the parallel world of blockchains connecting every island of chain to realize free circulation asset interoperability and value interoperability 8 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper Through the operability and configurable module design the Ladder Network provides ICO function helping enterprises to complete Chain Reform and add to business value and finally provides the projects of \xe2\x80\x9cMillion Enterprises\xe2\x80\x99 Chain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMillion Chain Interoperability\xe2\x80\x9d with the safest most reliable and pluggable blockchain infrastructure services and contribute to the global revolution of blockchain industry 3 2 Goals of Design In order to achieve the vision mentioned above the technical requirements of Ladder Network mainly come from two aspects namely cross chain technology and blockchain services Its goals of design are as follows \xc2\xb7 Realize interopera Interopera is the most basic requirement for cross chain technology The reason for the poor interoperability is that the underlying protocols of each project are not uniform and the heterogeneity leads to isolation between chains The Ladder Network will provide standard communication mechanisms network protocols asset communication and service semantics to facilitate the interoperability of different chains \xc2\xb7 Hiding heterogeneity of system Based on the layered system of TCP/IP protocol a logical layering is established on the Ladder Network which can rank the modules that have same processing function Communication between different layers is achieved through service language Communication cannot be achieved directly across different levels Thereby we can resolve heterogeneity address differences like consensus algorithms governance architecture and block structure \xc2\xb7 Trusted isolation 9 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper We will define the trusted computing module of the smallest security facility in the chain establish a security perimeter and divide the trusted and untrusted boundaries clearly unifying the security interface By using reference monitors we will ensure security to the greatest extent and make sure that the access can be confirmed verified secured and trusted \xc2\xb7 Common Condensation and Reuse Many basic functions and structures between blockchain services in the same field are very similar Developing a system from zero every time is definitely not a good method and will do great harm to the quality and efficiency Therefore the Ladder Network should be divided into different modules according to different application scenarios and build a highly reusable blockchain service platform to achieve user oriented blockchain service parameterized service management and configurable functional support 3 3 Ecological synergy The Ladder Network is developed based on the Substrate framework protocol At present Substrate is also adopted in Polkadot project Substrate is a framework that is similar to Express or other web applications which are primarily used to build frameworks for distributed or decentralized systems such as cryptocurrency projects or message bus systems The Ladder Network uses Substrate for the purpose of firstly enabling the project to inherit the functionality security and scalability advantages of Substrate and secondly focusing the team\ s efforts mainly on the development of cross chain platforms and blockchain business services Just as most web applications that don\ t need to reimplement their own HTTP protocol with Substrate there is no need to step through the network and consensus code when creating a new chain The Ladder Network uses Substrate which combines three technologies La_WebAssembly La_Libp2p and La_GRANDPA consensus protocols By quickly building a new blockchain library the key framework of blockchain client can be 10 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper synchronized to any chain of Substrate based technology development By using Substrate the Ladder Network will directly inherit the following advantages \xef\x81\xac Implementing blockchain consensus algorithms final determinism and block voting logic \xef\x81\xac Having P2P network library with functions of node discovery data synchronization and replication \xef\x81\xac Smart contracts and other projects based on Substrate development and be run based on WebAssembly mechanism which is efficient deterministic and sandboxed \xef\x81\xac Ability to seamlessly run a node in the browser that can communicate with any desktop or cloud node \xef\x81\xac Cross platform database/file storage \xef\x81\xac Seamless client updates Quick and secure deployment of local code without problems like hard forks and other consensus issues 3 4 Technical Architecture The Ladder Network provides infrastructures for inter chain asset transfer It is a distributed system that interconnects different blockchain networks through cross chain protocols complete record of cross chain transactions and intra chain transaction detail maintenance 11 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper Picture 1 Architecture Diagram The edge chain refers to chains that carry the Ladder Network protocol such as Ethereum Bitcoin EOS traceability chain and so on The main chain is the core chain of Ladder Network which can operate independently or as a bridge chain The main chain of Ladder Network provides a registration module and the name is registered on it Through Rule Audit one can be officially added to the Ladder Network to become a legal edge chain sharing the cross chain service provided by Ladder Network Each edge chain has a 64 bit address space In order to prevent developers and users from identifying complicated and difficult addresses the Ladder Network provides Chain Name Service (CNS) being responsible for bidirectional mapping of the address space and the project name For example the name of BTC edge chain in 12 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper the network is Ladder_BTC Blockchain systems are relatively independent from each other Information flows within a single blockchain system are trusted but the flows between chains need to be verified by bridging interrupts So messages in the edge chain are stored and verified through the main chain and then is forwarded to the target edge chain by the main chain to ensure the reliable circulation of information between chains A simple process of running cross chain In edge chain A users initiate a transfer operation to the B chain User A obtains the project name of B chain through CNS and then queries whether there is a conflict by using Request Resposey method If there is no conflict it can be proved that the user obtains the transfer certificate from the edge chain and submits the transfer information to the main chain The main chain will check the information and send it to edge chain B Then an cross chain information operation is completed In the future the Ladder Network will also launch BAAS module to provide one click coin transfer function for enterprises and entrepreneurs BAAS module provides parameterized and configured blockchain services and develops financial SDKs Chain SDK game SDK storage SDK and other component interfaces according to different business areas Enterprises will be able to access BAAS with zero programming share the main chain service and provide a business ecosystem for the \xe2\x80\x9cChain Reform\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCoin Reform\xe2\x80\x9d of enterprises 3 4 1 Consensus The Ladder Network uses the POS based BABE+Grandpa consensus algorithm In terms of choices of the blocker BABE+Grandpa randomly selects blockers based on VRF algorithm which can guarantees fairness There are three types of nodes on Ladder Network authoritative nodes oracle machine proof nodes and ordinary verification nodes Authoritative node mortgages a large amount of margin Bigger margin brings greater equity of the block If no block is dug the deposit will be deducted The oracle machine proof node is one that 13 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper collateralizes a certain margin A set of nodes is selected by a random algorithm They acquire data from the edge chain and then send it to the main chain with sign on it to obtain the exchange rate If a fake transaction is sent or the transaction is not sent the Ladder Network will deduct the deposit and reduce the number of cross chain transaction certification nodes Only by controlling enough rights can it become a normal verification node which verifies the behavior of the first two types of nodes and sends false behaviors 3 4 2 Cross chain Atomic Trading To ensure the atomicity of the transaction we designed the following protocol Figure 2 Atomic Trading Agreement The user initiates a cross chain transaction on edge chain A The main chain will automatically monitor and record the transaction (Because the multi sign checker 14 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper method is adopted The transaction records may be redundant Solutions will be introduced latter on) The main chain verifies the events on A chain and forwards them to the edge chain B Because the release on B chain requires sufficient funds there are two situations when the funds are sufficient to meet the release standard the transaction is successful and will be recorded on the main chain if the funds are insufficient the transaction will fail and the main chain will return the transaction assets back to the user that is to initiate a transaction retreat User\xe2\x80\x99s assets are locked on the edge chain for a period of time throughout the whole transaction process If the transaction fails the asset will be returned on the edge chain if the transaction is successful the assets will be put into the fund pool which will be used to release transactions initiated from other chains Trading volume per second\xef\xbc\x88TPS\xef\xbc\x89 TPS = Sb / St / tb \xe2\x80\x9cSb\xe2\x80\x9d is the size of the block The size of main chain block is 4M \xe2\x80\x9cSt\xe2\x80\x9d indicates the volume of the transaction usually trading at 250 bytes \xe2\x80\x9ctb\xe2\x80\x9d indicates the block time which is usually 3 seconds Transaction delay In order to ensure the security of transactions all transactions need to be recorded on the Ladder Network and \xe2\x80\x9cTa\xe2\x80\x9d referrs to the block time The block time of edge chains are T1 and T2 respectively At least four transactions are needed to complete a successful cross chain transaction One transaction on each of the two edge chains and two transactions on the main chain referring to transaction request and transaction confirmation Based on the transaction process we can give the following formula 15 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper L = Ta * 2 + T1 * D + T2 * D Failure of processing When cross chain mortgage verification fails on Ladder Network or fails to be released on B chain the assets of A chain will be backtracked to achieve atomic operations so as to avoid the loss of A chain assets If the multi signing verification on Ladder Network fails the Ladder Network will directly record the failure of verification If the verification node fails to receive the reply of the successful asset mortgage verification the transaction will be recorded as \xe2\x80\x9cdeleted\xe2\x80\x9d and the asset will be returned to A chain Storage structure of multi sign verification Transaction <=> [Signature send or not send] Transaction <=> Verification passed or not passed When the number of signatures reaches to a certain amount the mortgage request will be confirmed and the cross chain mortgage transaction which is recorded by Ladder Network when it accepts the verification node will be stored An unsuccessful transaction will be deleted directly At the same time parameters will be modified to prevent repeated transaction caused by network delay 16 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper Figure 3 Process of asset return when both atomic operations fail to be verified 3 4 3 Bank Module Cross chain is usually completed through asset mapping such as centralized exchange where users need three steps to convert assets Our goal is to simplify the process of asset transfer where only one operation covering target chain and the address of the account is needed Considering the impact of total assets on real time conversion we introduce a bank module to address the problem of liquidity In the edge chain the bank module manages the user\ s investment assets through contracts and can earn revenue on the main chain after a certain period of time Users on chain can take out assets at any time and we won\xe2\x80\x99t lock any transactions Investors can operate on edge chains providing investment in assets and liquidity to the across chain and as a return investor can benefit from the main chain 17 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper The investment operation is just like deposits in banks so we call it Bank Module Multiple chains and nodes are involved in this operation taking Ethereum as an example its main process and distribution diagram are as follows Figure 4 Operational Node Division and Process of Ladder Network The bank module system can be decomposed into five parts Takes Ethereum as an example the operation generates a mortgage transaction T After relevant verification nodes record this information the signature can be finished and forwarded to the chain for verification Step 1 Intended mortgagor send a transaction each verification node record the transactions containing the chain account and the mortgage amount 18 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper Txn n=1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 Step 2 Verify node captures and sign each transaction Tsn = sign(Txn) n=1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 Step 3 Pack up the transaction and upload the data to Ladder Network \xe2\x88\x91Tx(Tsn\xef\xbc\x8cdata) n=1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 Step 4 Each node on ladder network participates in verifying the validity of the signature and the data (determine whether the data is uploaded separately by the unconfirmed verification node through multi signing) The verification process is guaranteed by modules that have signature Check\xef\xbc\x88\xe2\x88\x91Txn\xef\xbc\x89 n=1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 Step 5 The data will be saved on the chain after being verified And the mortgage process is therefore completed Prase_update(T data) 3 4 4 Exchange Rate Module In order to achieve rapid exchange of different assets asset pricing should be taken into consideration As the blockchain is a deterministic and closed system environment at present only the on chain asset can be obtained The blockchain is separated from the real world and the real world data outside the chain cannot be obtained To solve this problem we deploy an oracle machine contract on the chain The exchange rate module periodically forwards the asset price to oracle machine contract which will obtain external data through the off chain API interface The technical process is that external data is sent to the chain predictor contract which will transmit 19 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper the data to the exchange rate module Figure 5 Exchange Rate Module The verification node of the Exchange Rate Module obtains real time exchange rates of the external encrypted asset through multi signing and the information is processed by the encrypted signature and cannot be changed Through real time exchange rate chain A and chain B can complete the cross chain asset conversion which is similar to a centralized exchange The process is as follows Step 1 Judge whether the current account is the associated account id of the oracle node Is_validator(id) Step 2 If yes call the external API to get the real time cryptocurrency exchange rate Tx = http_get(url) Step 3 Send the exchange rate signature to the multi sign verification module Txsn = \xe2\x88\x91Sign(Txn) n = 1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 Step 4 If the multi signing is verified as valid the exchange rate can be recorded Check_save(Txsn) n = 1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 20 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper 3 4 5 Risk Control Module In the cross chain protocol mentioned above one problem should be considered carefully that is the transaction retreat caused by insufficient liquidity If the system is liquid and there are enough investors and users theoretically speaking there is no trade retreat But our system consider all possible situations including initial and extreme conditions such as very little financial support in the early stage and poor user experience On the other hand the deposit and redemption operations by investors on edge chain will affect liquidity so a risk control module is introduced to deal with this problem The role of AI risk control module \xef\x81\xac Ensure sufficient funds on edge chain through interest rates \xef\x81\xac Ensure the success of cross chain transactions and reduce useless operations \xef\x81\xac Ensure the liquidity of the system The impact of AI risk control module \xef\x81\xac Control changes of interest rate in the Bank Module \xef\x81\xac Control floating costs of cross chain transactions \xef\x81\xac Control the price stability of the edge chain assets By monitoring the transactions on the main chain and the balance of funds on the edge chain we can predict whether a transaction can be successfully completed in the future so as to reduce trade retreat and system pressure The formula of maximum cross chain transaction amount Vmax is as follows The average of capital inflow Vi = \xe2\x88\x91(Vt / St) / n / L\xef\xbc\x8c n = 1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 n < 100 21 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper The average of capital outflow Vo = \xe2\x88\x91(Vt / St) / n / L\xef\xbc\x8c n = 1 2 3 4 5 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 n < 100 Vmax = R Vi + Vo T Single transaction L Transaction delay time unit second Vt Value sent by T transaction St The time span since T transaction is sent unit second R The balance on the current edge chain 3 4 6 Plasma Arbitration Protocol Plasma was originally designed to reduce the burden on the main chain by combining different chains to realize Ethereum expansion Plasma provides a basic guarantee for returning assets that is you can always return your assets and funds back to the main chain Regarding how to ensure the return of assets Plasma introduces a fraud certification mechanism namely users submit evidence of asset freeze to the main chain and anyone can submit a \xe2\x80\x9ccheat certificate\xe2\x80\x9d to challenge the return of assets But asset return is inherently a risky practice One of the problems is that if users of sub chains submit asset return requests to the main chain at the same time but the main chain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough capacity to handle the transaction a possible result will be the loss of funds We put the game of users on high performance ladder network and then introduce the board mechanism to ensure the notarization of arbitration so as to avoid the loss of funds caused by performance problems on the main chain 22 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper Figure 6 Ladder Network Plasma structure The process is as follows Step 1 Supplier register and open the mapping channel on Ladder Network Step 2 Users map the assets on the main chain and Ladder Network record the operation Step 3 Assets on sub chain is released by Ladder Network Step 4 Users apply for a fund return on the sub chain the application will be arbitrated by Ladder Network Step 5 The ladder network releases assets on the main chain 4 Security Guarantee 4 1 Threshold Signature Protocol Based on VRF Algorithm The disadvantages of the single witness pattern are the lack of security and the low degree of decentralization Therefore we use Threshold Signature Protocol based on 23 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper VRF Algorithm to compensate for the defects We will randomly select a new signature group based on VRF algorithm and reset it on each edge chain That is to say the multi signature on the main chains are updated synchronously In this way secure synchronization can be guaranteed 4 2 Dynamic Multi signing The total collateral of all verification nodes must exceed the total circulation of the ladder network Ladder Network by x% If no one can control these part of circulation the number of signatures required by the on chain multi signing verification will be decided in accordance with the value of x% 5 Fields of Applicati With the advantages of cross chain network and more than 10 000 candidate verification nodes the Ladder Network is developing some major projects including data sharing security and privacy protection decentralized exchanges and Web 3 0 e commerce When the BAAS blockchain service platform is established Ladder Network will provide SDK components in various fields including finance supply chain games and decentralized storage platforms to meet the needs of high throughput low latency high concurrency and low power complex application scenarios in the 5G era 5 1 Data Sharing Security and Privacy Protection Data sharing security and privacy protection are important application areas of blockchain technology and data featured projects usually belong to this field In this regard Ladder Network has a well designed solution On the one hand including the cross chain verification nodes into an all in one machine by integrating available resources can reduce the cost of deploying Ladder Network verification node and meanwhile it can make the nodes highly dispersed and stable The node sharing 24 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper model has obtained the invention patent of the State Intellectual Property Office On the other hand through the combination with edge computing technology the security and privacy of enterprises\xe2\x80\x99 data can be better protected and the sharing and exchange of data values will be realized so that the quantifiable value flow can be traced and verified and settled clearly At present the Ladder Network and ABMatrix have reached a strategic cooperation agreement and the two parties are cooperating to help enterprises build a multi party data value network based on IoT technology and blockchain technology Through close cooperation the Ladder Network will be involved in fields like data sharing security and privacy protection in an extensive way Strategic cooperation with ABMatrix is expected to bring tens of millions of user volume in the Internet of Things in the next three years Figure 7 Case of Industrial Internet Architecture of Ladder Network Founded by technology developers and computer researchers from Zhejiang University ABMatrix is an industrial Internet platform specializing in 25 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper cutting edge technologies industrial upgrading covering industrial equipment edge computing the Internet of Things blockchain big data and cloud computing It provides internationally renowned companies with comprehensive solutions including fault diagnosis fault analysis and prediction reliability analysis optimization of production line and capacity improvement covering more than 100 industrial enterprises 5 2 Decentralized Exchange Decentralization is the future trend of exchanges Both Binance and Huobi have been deployed projects in this field In the future the public chain with project resources will be able to realize decentralized transaction which is actually a typical cross chain application The Ladder Network transforms the inter chain assets in a decentralized manner Any chain can establish asset interoperability with other chains as long as it is connected with the Ladder Network at the mean time enjoy privacy protection which will soon be available in the Ladder Network wallet Once the main network is online the Ladder Network\ s decentralized transaction agreement will be officially put into use provide technical supports for centralized exchanges where LAD can be used as a platform currency Due to the gas burning and deflation the more the exchange uses Ladder Network platform the stronger the support will be for LAD value 5 3 WEB3 0 E commerce In the traditional retail era \xe2\x80\x9ccentralized e commerce\xe2\x80\x9d is the main way for merchants to connect to the Internet So all businesses from merchants are concentrated on one platform which is therefore the only shopping entry for consumers However in the new retail era where user traffic is highly valued retailers are gradually realizing the 26 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper importance of their own traffic Having an independent e commerce platform and \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized e commerce\xe2\x80\x9d has become a new appeal of merchants The Ladder Network can meet this demand In the Ladder Network user browses the e commerce DAPP selects a certain item and places an order The e commerce DAPP requests the user\xe2\x80\x99s identity information through cross chain network The payment request after being verified is initiated to the payment chain and the payment is therefore completed After that the order will be synchronized to the logistics chain which will obtain the order information and then pick up the items stored in warehouse and delivers them to the users All the off chain information is synchronized to the logistics chain through the Internet of Things (as shown in Figure 7) After being remade by Ladder Network all information of the e commerce platform users including request payment logistics and capital flow are transferred in a trusted network and the users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy and data are controlled by themselves so the monopoly fraud and other issues of centralized e commerce can be avoided Figure 8 Ladder Network e commerce case 27 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper 6 Token Model The token of Ladder Network is LAD with a total volume of one billion The volume of issuance of mining pool is reduced by 50% for every two years The user can enter Ladder Network\ s various assets through the cross chain system which will automatically convert the LAD market value according to the daily average price and distribute the issued Ladder Network according to the total market value of the held assets Exchange of Token 15% Include early participant of Token exchange and the incentive plan launched in exchange Development team 10% After LAD is online 2% is unlocked each year for operation maintenance expenditure and sustainable development Foundation 10% In the early stage 2% is used for early strategic layout and high cooperation and then every 2% is unlocked each year Ecological construction 15% In the early stage 3% was used for early ecological construction and resource introduction and then every 3% is unlocked each year Reservation of mining pool 50% The volume of issuance of mining pool is reduced by 50% for every two years Nodes and mining machines that are connected to the network are used for incentives and ecological circulation The Ladder Network obtained by user mining can be used to \xe2\x80\xa2 pay for miners \xe2\x80\xa2 become a node through mortgage \xe2\x80\xa2 vote for election nodes \xe2\x80\xa2 function as an intermediate currency for redeeming certain niche assets 28 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper \xe2\x80\xa2 connect locked tokens with BAAS platform The increase of edge chains user transactions and the increase of projects that are connected with BAAS platform will consume LAD So the value of LAD will increase when the total amount of LAD is constant 7 Roadmap 1 In July 2018 the Ladder Network project was initiated 2 In September 2018 the Ladder Network proposed multiple technical routes and the white paper 1 0 was released 3 In December 2018 the technical route of Ladder Network was optimized and the direction of ecological construction was established 4 In May 2019 launch the test network and realize the cross chain interconnection of Ethereum and ABOS chain 5 In September 2019 link to some mainstream main network such as BTC ETH and EOS open the Ladder Network in a full scale and launch the cross chain ecological navigation plan 6 In December 2019 launch the main network of Ladder Network activate the BPOS mining mechanism and start the node campaign 7 In March 2020 build the BAAS platform which will provide a large number of basic SDK modules 8 In June 2020 connect the supply chain module and game module with BAAS share the Ladder Network cross chain service 9 In July 2020 fully launch the cross chain ecological navigation plan 10 In September 2020 launch the Ladder Network de centralized exchange 1 0 and realize the free flow of cross chain assets and information LAD will become the Token of platform circulation 11 In December 2020 realize the decentralized autonomy of community nodes 29 \x0cLadder Network Whitepaper 8 Governance Body 8 1 Establishment of the Foundation Aiming at building the world\ s most dispersed secure and largest POS cross chain network Ladder Network will set up a foundation that is committed to the development construction and operation of Ladder Network It will promote the decentralization of the project strengthen transparent management promote the safe and harmonious development of the eco society and contribute to the development of blockchain industry The Foundation\ s decision making committee consists of eight members including five on behalf of the team and three on behalf of the early investors After the expiration 10 representatives will be selected through community voting The members of the early committee will select 8 core members of the decision making committee according to the contribution of
