 1 1 INTRODUCTION 
 The SCRIV network can verify the existence of digital data at any point in time This data is linked 
 with a publicly veriable date and time (timestamp) to provide data assurance This link can be 
 veried without the need for a centralized service or third party authority The data assurance 
 of the SCRIV Network allows users to verify data ownership and its originality 
 
 1 2 TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVED 
 1 2 1 Hashing 
 Hashing is the process of submitting data to the input of a hashing algorithm which returns a 
 short hash identier (that allows for the data to be uniquely distinguished) as output This 
 output is called a hash 
 
 The hash is used to quickly distinguish datasets without having to compare the entire contents 
 This single process of comparison occurs only once and is much faster than comparing every bit 
 of data If the hashes are dierent the data is not the same If the hashes match then with a 
 probability of 99 99% the data is the same 
 
 The hashing algorithm meets the following criteria 
 
  Matching data always returns the same unique hash 
 
  Non matching data sets return a unique hash for each set However this 
 
 condition is not always fullled completely When a hash is assigned to 
 
 non matching data it is 99 99999% unique

 1 2 1 Proof of work 
 Also referred to as POW the proof of work system is very eective at protecting the network 
 from abuse (i e DoS attack) With POW complicated operations are solved on the client side 
 and then easily and quickly veried on the server side The primary benet of POW is the 
 validation of the asymmetry of the time expenditure The network timestamps transactions by 
 hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash based proof of work forming a record that cannot 
 be changed without redoing the proof of work [1] 
 
 1 2 3 Masternodes 
 Typical blockchain nodes are servers which run on a decentralized P2P network These nodes 
 allow peers to send and receive updates across the network The nodes require the ability to 
 handle signicant amounts of trac and other resources and carry substantial cost with little 
 reward It is for this reason that the number of Bitcoin nodes has decreased continuously Much 
 of the reason for the decrease of full nodes on the Bitcoin network is the lack of incentive to run 
 one Over time the cost of running a full node increases as the network gets used more creating 
 more bandwidth and costing the operator more money [2] 
 
 Masternodes solve this problem Masternodes are full nodes just like in the Bitcoin network 
 except they must provide a level of service to the network and have a bond of collateral to 
 participate Collateral is never forfeit and is safe while the Masternode is operating This allows 
 investors to provide a service to the network earn interest on their investment and reduce the 
 volatility of the currency [2] 
 
 1 2 4 IPFS Network 
 What is IPFS IPFS is a distributed le system which synthesizes successful ideas from previous 
 peer to peer systems including DHTs BitTorrent Git and SFS The contribution of IPFS is 
 simplifying evolving and connecting proven techniques into a single cohesive system greater 
 than the sum of its parts IPFS presents a new platform for writing and deploying applications

 and a new system for distributing and versioning large data IPFS could even evolve the web 
 itself 
 
 IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm exchanging objects within one Git repository 
 In other words IPFS provides a high throughput content addressed block storage model with 
 content addressed hyperlinks This forms a generalized Merkle DAG a data structure upon 
 which one can build versioned le systems blockchains and even a Permanent Web IPFS 
 combines a distributed hashtable an incentivized block exchange and a self certifying 
 namespace IPFS has no single point of failure and nodes do not need to trust each other [3] 
 
 IPFS is an ambitious vision of new decentralized Internet infrastructure upon which many 
 dierent kinds of applications can be built At the bare minimum it can be used as a global 
 mounted versioned lesystem and namespace or as the next generation le sharing system At 
 its best it could push the web to new horizons where publishing valuable information does not 
 impose hosting it on the publisher but upon those interested where users can trust the content 
 they receive without trusting the peers they receive it from and where old but important les 
 do not go missing IPFS looks forward to bringing us toward the Permanent Web [3] 
 
 1 3 NETWORK STRUCTURE AND OPERATION 
 The SCRIV Network s operation algorithm is as follows (See g 1) 
 
 1 User load data to be veried (PDF JPEG ZIP) in the wallet 
 2 SHA3 Hash is generated 
 3 Wallet checks the SCRIV blockchain to determine if this is new data or if has it already been 
 established on the blockchain in the past 
 New Data > Launch Data Assurance Process 
 1 User pays assurance fee [see Additional Rewards] 
 2 Data is saved to IPFS network (generation of 
 service data)

 3 All required verication data is inserted into the 
 next block of the SCRIV blockchain 
 SCRIV NETWORK
 
 Previously Assured Data > Launch Verication process 
 1 Search the SCRIV blockchain for the service data 
 2 The algorithm returns IPFS address of the data 
 Veried data can be accessed on the IPFS network through the SCRIV block explorer when the 
 necessary conditions are satised [see Privacy and anonymity]

 1 4 ADDITIONAL REWARDS 
 In addition to the rewards paid for block generation miners and masternode operators receive 
 assurance fees These fees are paid by the user [see Network structure and operation] The rst 
 part of this reward is included in the next block and paid to the miner who found it The second 
 part is distributed equally among all running masternodes 
 
 This procedure greatly reduces ination and ensures that the natural circulation of SCRIV will 
 occur 
 
 1 5 PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY 
 All user dependent SCRIV operations are available within the wallet The SCRIV network 
 provides a fast and secure connection between the user the blockchain and the IPFS network 
 
 Our blockchain is built upon the Dash source code and all network transactions and le 
 transfers are secured with high level encryption 
 
 By default public keys are private However a user can request to link his identity to his public 
 key This requires that personal information is conrmed Once this information has been 
 veried the users public key will then be appropriately labeled 
 
 By default all veried data is encrypted before it is saved to the IPFS network However it is also 
 possible to save it as is so that it will be publicly available

 2 USE CASES 
 The SCRIV network is open to everyone From emergency operations to everyday use from 
 large companies to educational institutions It can be used by lawyers copywriters artists etc 
 Here are some potential use cases 
 
 2 1 DEMONSTRATING DATA OWNERSHIP WITHOUT REVEALING ACTUAL DATA 
 This can be used to help protect content creators as well as retailers who sell digital goods The 
 content creator can protect his content by assigning a unique identier (hash) on the SCRIV 
 network which he can then give to authorized resellers The customer can then be condent 
 that the reseller owns the rights to sell the content by checking the assigned hash on the SCRIV 
 network 
 
 2 2 DOCUMENT TIMESTAMPING 
 This functionality can be used within the sphere of law where determining the originality of 
 data plays a signicant role The SCRIV network can verify that digital data (documents photos 
 videos etc ) has not been altered or modied since being immutably registered and 
 timestamped on the SCRIV blockchain 
 
 2 3 VERIFYING DOCUMENT INTEGRITY 
 The SCRIV network can be used to ensure the integrity of business documents and contracts 
 When a document is registered on the SCRIV network it will be impossible for changes to be 
 made without the knowledge of both parties If changes are made the document will fail 
 validation 
 
 2 4 PREVENTING UNWANTED DUPLICATION AND OVERWRITING 
 The usage of the SCRIV blockchain in combination with the IPFS network protects against 
 unwanted storage duplication and the overwriting of documents

 CONCLUSION 
 
 SCRIV NETWORK 
 
 
 
 
 
 The SCRIV network provides a state of the art solution to the problems of human error and 
 the high costs of data verication It also provides a viable data verication process that spans 
 across a plethora of industries and provides long needed innovation in the data storage 
 real time data verication and protection of content authorship space 
 
 The network is fast It can process more than 100 data sets/second extract their unique secure 
 cryptographic identiers build a cryptographic tree with all this data in real time and publish 
 the result to the SCRIV blockchain 
 
 SCRIV also proves privacy All the data sent to the network is encrypted with cryptographic 
 identiers (hashes) before hitting the SCRIV blockchain Since hashes are oneway cryptographic 
 algorithms users can prove that a determinate hash relates to their data but no one 
 will ever be able to obtain that data by only having its hash 
 
 SCRIV is an industry disrupting technology which eliminates the necessity of scriveners and 
 lawyers The SCRIV blockchain performs these jobs with greater speed safety and cost eciency
