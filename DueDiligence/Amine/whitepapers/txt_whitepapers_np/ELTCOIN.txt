b ELTCOIN \xe2\x80\x8bWHITE\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bPAPER Ethereum Limited Total Coin Version 3 March 17th 2018 \x0c2 What is ELTCOIN ELTCOIN or \xe2\x80\x98Ethereum Limited Total Coin\xe2\x80\x99 is a community driven limited supply token on the Ethereum blockchain Launched in November 2017 as the largest Airdrop token of its time the ELTCOIN community has been making strides to add real value and utility to the Ethereum Network Since November 2017 the ELTCOIN development community has published open source Apollo App wallets staked for both in the iOS and Android groundbreaking partnered HODL vc with crypto the Venture Capital fund behind \xe2\x80\x98Moon Lambos\xe2\x80\x99 and is driving the development of PocketBook\xe2\x80\x8b the world\xe2\x80\x99s identity platform\xe2\x80\x8b first decentralised cross chain sovereign \x0c3 ELTCOIN Mission The ELTCOIN mission is individual sovereignty accessible to all built on crypto For some time crypto technology has been open to those who have reason to use it We have seen p2p trustless networks made up from decentralised nodes we observe the mutual benefits freedom from trust affords us this is foundational A picture of the future as we transition to crypto platforms environments will form where trust will be redefined as an implicit transaction parameter This is a future where individual sovereignty can actually be realised It is of this future ELTCOIN dares to dream ELTUniverse an ecosystem consisting of DAO communities detailed in this paper we demonstrate the bootstrap nature of such organisations Staking ELTCOIN to exercise the freedom granted via the very nature of the ELTUniverse economy is the how and also the why The future we create is fundamentally incompatible with hierarchical structures of governance Our model is open source and decentralised the mission is simple Stake your claim to freedom \x0c4 ELTWallet ELTWallet is an open source mobile wallet app available for iOS and Android The wallet has all the essential functionality required for a Ethereum and ELTCOIN holder and supports other ERC20 tokens ELTWallet will not transmit your private key over the network your private key is securely stored on your device Features include 1 Generate a new Ethereum wallet 2 Import an existing wallet with your private key 3 View ETH and tokens transactions 4 Send ETH and tokens 5 Share your wallet address to receive ETH and tokens 6 PIN code and biometric authentication More features to come such as new transactions notifications Ethereum forks support and PocketBook integration (see below) Screenshots of the ELTWallet https //github com/ELTCOIN/eltwallet PocketBook section \x0c5 ELTCard ELTCOIN has a unique and innovative approach to offering liquidity through payment cards Traditionally companies have partnered with the likes of VISA and MASTERCARD to produce a prepaid card These prepaid cards are typically expensive and only less than hundred thousand are issued Either the company absorbed these costs and shuts down after they release the model is unsustainable or the cost is passed on the consumer Enter the challenger banks ELTCOIN is integrating with the world s most popular banks Utilising open API\xe2\x80\x99s to provide seamless liquidity to our users existing card prepaid cards As you spend money on your card ELTCARD liquidates your crypto in real time using Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure and tops your card back up in Fiat Transactions made through ELTCard will show in your ELTWALLET app in real time ELTCard is currently being beta tested in the wild with challenger banks in London and New York City Screenshots showing the ELTCARD integration with the Monzo bank \x0c6 PocketBook PocketBook is a censorship immune decentralised human network implemented as a block explorer Spanning all Ethereum forks such as Ethereum Classic Expanse Ubiq to name just a few The key principles of PocketBook 1 Multichain compatibile explorer 2 Individual sovereignty via cryptography 3 Distributed & trustless identity platform 4 Web of trust key signing 5 Easy deployment of standardised cross chain smart contracts 6 Standardised individual trust tokens implementing a trustless rating system 7 Decentralised asset exchange dApp in which traders interact directly with vendors either on chain or via escrow contract \x0c7 Multichain Compatibility Each Ethereum fork use the same public & private key pairs which PocketBook pulls together from each chain into one address Leveraging their the coins multichain across the compatibility chains at a users click of of a PocketBook button move without compromising the security of their private key Current process of moving coins across Ethereum Forks (left) vs new User Interface (right) \x0c8 A Human Network PocketBook is a new kind of network where you have total control over your information by authenticating via signature with your private key Users can claim addresses including for contracts on PocketBook using their private keys Once claimed an owner of the address can add metadata to public profile This is unique to PocketBook and does not exist elsewhere to date PocketBook illustrating a claimed address \x0c9 Web of trust PocketBook uses a decentralised web of trust to avoid pitfalls of centralised key signing authorities maximising user security without compromising privacy The trust balance of an address is regulated by a voluntary trustless rating system All parties must agree to issue positive or negative token rating with each transaction \x0c10 User Friendly Contract Deployment PocketBook has a friendly user interface for its users to build and deploy smart contracts Currently building smart contracts requires expensive engineering resources who write code which is notoriously hard to debug Illustration showing smart contract code vs PocketBook UI Building smart contracts via a user interface reduces the likelihood of bugs reduces engineering time and time spent deploying distributed applications Smart contracts have endless possibilities such as 1 Fulfilling orders \xe2\x80\x8b Whitelisted crowdsales 2 Multisig wallets \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bJoint accounts corporate governance\xe2\x80\x8b 3 Tokens \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bInitial Coin Offerings 4 Escrow 5 Secure contracts [\xe2\x80\x8bZK snarks linkable ring signatures etc] \x0c11 Decentralized Assets Exchange The PocketBook marketplace consists of crowdsale contracts issued by vendors simply contracts issued asset from holders who issue standardised order/offer their addresses Additionally users have the choice to register their contract with our crowdsale tracker contract The exchange automatically pulls together all crowdsales registered with our tracker contract The interface applies filters and organises the information to form an exchange UI Typical tools such as trading pairs depth charts and prices are folded into a modern user interface which beneath the surface is radically different to both other centralised and decentralised exchanges PocketBook makes use of asset relay contracts so multichain trade is to be supported Support is not limited to only Ethereum forks for example a BTC relay can be deployed The design intention is to build relay contracts on each supported chain to create an open cross chain asset relay contract standard PocketBook tokens will be of a limited supply and can only be issued by staking ELTCOIN and cannot be traded When PocketBook beta is released these tokens will grant hodlers early access after v1 is released PocketBook originally staked tokens can be burnt returning the ELTCOIN \x0c12 Partnerships ELTCOIN has partnerships with leading cryptocurrency organisations who have significant holdings in the currency which is staked
