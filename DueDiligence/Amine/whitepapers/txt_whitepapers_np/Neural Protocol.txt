purpose features application and usage functions in a cryptography Our project will be based on cryptographic market technology which helps bring together sellers and buyers so that it can facilitate the buying and selling process on both sides \x0cPage 2 INTRODUCTION NEURAL PROTOCOL (NRP) is a decentralized blockchain based payment instrument that aims to bring together buyers and sellers in a marketplace Our technology is based on true experience where there are still many conventional sellers who have difficulty when they want to sell their belongings NRP itself combines neural technology with artificial intelligence to be able to create a perfect system In the marketplace users can use Token NRP to transact safely and comfortably 1 NRP TOKEN FUNCTION Cryptographic currency functions as a substitute for banknotes that can facilitate the transaction process 1 1 MAIN PAYMENT FOR TRANSACTION IN MARKET PLACE Payment is the most important thing in a marketplace or digital market in the internet world therefore it is necessary to have a security system that can protect buyers in transactions Therefore NRP was created as a solution to overcome this problem NRP is present as a way to give a sense of security to \x0cPage 3 everyone who wants to make transactions in the marketplace for the process of buying and selling 1 2 CRYPTOCURRENCY IN TRADE Cryptocurrency is a digital asset being hold by individuals it can be relied on and can be easily traded around individuals Therefore it can be used as payment tool to transact on the marketplace NRP itself can perform all this factors and can be easily traded on all exchange so that it can provide benefits for investors and create a market trading platform among individuals 1 3 ALTERNATIVE TO FIAT MONEY In today\ s modern and advanced era with various technological developments we are required to always follow and can play an active role in it Therefore in real life to process payments sometimes someone has difficulty in making transactions NRP is present to be an alternative fiat money in the NRP marketplace which functions as a medium of exchange \x0cPage 4 PROBLEM In today\ s era the development of technology is very rapid and modern the community is required to always follow the development of existing technology because some people cannot adapt to the current conditions For example in the ease of transacting the majority still experience problems or difficulties in making every transaction that they do when they which to purchase goods or sell commodities Besides they also have difficulties in marketing or selling their products because of the limited knowledge they have about the available marketplace platform Sometimes in the use of fiat money people still experience difficulties in terms of mobilization to make each transaction \x0cPage 5 SOLUTION Neural Protocol (NRP) is here to be a solution to the above problems In the Marketplace platform NRP will provide many conveniences for users both as sellers and as buyers Users of NRP token does not need to bother about transaction sequence because use Marketplace NRP does not need to bother about every transaction process Because NRP comes with the concept of Blockchain technology supported by smart contracts in the Ethereum network So that every user who will use the NRP simply has an Ethereum wallet to send or receive the NRP as payment at Marketplace \x0cPage 6 MARKET The development and volume of trade show a rapid rate of progress The market potential is very large because it is one of the markets that are currently promising NRP as a cryptocurrency that has a vision and mission in that field would want to be able to contribute even more Where later we will be able to function as a forum that brings buyers and sellers in our platform to transact with each other \x0cPage 7 NRP TECHNOLOGY 1 PAYMENT GATEWAY In a marketplace of course regarding payment is one of the vital factors that are considered Indirectly the payment gateway plays an active role in making transactions successful in a marketplace Therefore NRP is committed to providing solutions for users in transacting with the creation of Marketplace 2 PRIVATE & SECURE NRP Marketplace is designed using blockchain technology that has been tested for security In the marketplace each transaction will be encrypted using an algorithm that is cryptography that can prevent unwanted problems from happening 3 CLOUD DATA STORAGE Cloud is a very popular storage technology lately In the cloud infrastructure there are all the factors that can store a data safely In the Marketplace we would like to bring cloud technology to store user data and transactions so that all data is expected to be safer and safeguarded \x0cPage 8 4 ONE CLICK APPLICATION The factor of ease and comfort of users in operating the Marketplace application is a top priority that we pay attention to In the application later we will make it as easy as possible so that we can help users to be more comfortable for user in transacting 5 AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL In the NRP Marketplace to better maintain data security for users we also present the Authentication Protocol feature in it to add network security and avoid hacking user data 6 INTEGRATION EXTERNAL NRP Marketplace will also be integrated with the Ethereum Wallet (ERC20) which supports NRP Tokens that our Marketplace users can use to process payments in transactions \x0cPage 9 TOKEN ALLOCATION ICO 14% AIRDROP 4% FOUNDER 45% 10% TEAM DEVELOPMENT 15% ADVISOR & PARTNER 10% 2% LOCK UP Smart

cannot be separated from human life every day people will definitely do the process of buying and selling and transactions to fulfill their needs Therefore NRP wishes to simplify and provide the best solution by combining blockchain based technology that is supported by neural systems and IoT so that it can benefit all users \x0cPage 11 TEAM Risfani Kusuma (Founder & CEO) Adewale Ajibola (Project
