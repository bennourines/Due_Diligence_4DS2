(Internet of Things) is the network that enables interconnection between all ordinary physical objects which can be located independently IoT has three key features the equalization of ordinary objects interconnection of automatic\xe2\x80\x90management terminals and intellectualization of pervasive services Through IoT all the things can be connected to the internet for information exchange and communication to achieve the goals of intellectualized recognition location tracking monitoring and management There are two implications of IoT First the internet is still the core and foundation of IoT which is extended and expanded on the former Second the user\xe2\x80\x90 end of IoT has extended to information exchange and communication between all things namely the thing to thing interconnectivity IoT has been applied widely in network convergence by means of communication perceptive technologies such as intelligent perception recognition and pervasive computing Consequently IoT has been called the third wave of the world\xe2\x80\x99s information industry development following the first and second waves of computer and internet respectively Since IoT is an expansion of the internet it should more correctly be referred to as business and application rather than network Hence innovation of application is the core of IoT\xe2\x80\x99s development and creation centered on user experience is the soul 2 Market scale of IoT Since the development policies of IoT were brought up by America European Union and China in 2009 IoT has been developing at a rapid pace Traditional enterprises and IT magnates have all made efforts to engage with IoT which has penetrated rapidly into many fields such as the manufacturing retail and service industries and public utilities Currently IoT is on the eve of an explosive growth on a large scale According to the 2016 China IoT\xe2\x80\x99s Market Scale and Development Trend 1 \x0cIo oT Chain issu ued by Wulian

Asia will have the fastest growth and comprise an estimated 35% of worldwide IoT expenditure in 2021 4 \x0cIoT Chain 3 Challenge Challenge 1 Traditional attack techniques damage IoT devices wantonly \xe3\x80\x90Challenge\xe3\x80\x91The Botnets of Things created by Mirai was entitled as one of the Ten Breakthrough Technologies in 2107 by MIT Technology Review According to the statistics the Botnets of Things have infected more than 2 million IoT devices for example the cameras The DDos attack launched by this made the network of American DNS service provider Dyn break down and users could not visit several popular websites such as Twitter and Paypal during a short period Afterwards more botnets appeared including the one that hijacked the IoT devices to mine Bitcoins and the http81 which has larger scale and is more active Centralized management structure cannot prove its innocence and individual private data leak has happened occasionally For example in May 2017 the People\xe2\x80\x99s Daily Online once reported that 266 cameras in Chengdu were enforced for webcast At present the security model based on closed source (often called \xe2\x80\x9csecurity through obscurity\xe2\x80\x9d) has exposed its potential safety hazards and will be abandoned gradually and be replaced by a new security model \xe2\x80\x9csecurity through publicity\xe2\x80\x9d To realize this it is necessary to upgrade the model to open source software Though the current open source systems are still vulnerable to accidents and are of low availability they are less prone to government interference and other targeted attacks Therefore the open source systems will play an important role in home automation as well as networking of vehicles and other devices \xe3\x80\x90Solution\xe3\x80\x91IoT Chain (ITC) has adopted the asymmetrical encryption As long as the private key is kept properly the data cannot be cracked even if it\xe2\x80\x99s collected At the same time all the nodes in ITC are equal which protects the users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy Moreover based on the character that blockchain cannot be tampered the manufacturers and service providers will not be able to tamper with users information 5 \x0cIoT Chain Challenge 2 High cost of centralized architecture \xe3\x80\x90Challenge\xe3\x80\x91Even before the revenue of IoT reaches market expectation the costs of IoT are still extremely high Most exiting IoT solutions require huge investments apart from the commission for intermediaries of these services building and maintaining the infrastructure related to centralized cloud and large\xe2\x80\x90 scale server clusters represent a significant capital outlay Unfortunately current IoT solutions fail to meet the service supply and continually miss customer\xe2\x80\x99s expectation In the past the cost and revenue of the IT industry were always consistent A large\xe2\x80\x90scale server during its long lifespan would receive long\xe2\x80\x90term service since the manufactures and the buyers have signed support contract For personal computers and smartphones athough there is typically no high\xe2\x80\x90profit support plan this is generally not a major issue due to their relatively short lifespan However for IoT the equipment manufactures typically work on small margins to the extent that they don not generate enough profits to support and maintain the equipment for an extended period Meanwhile it will require a huge sum of money to serve hundreds of billions of smart devices let alone the high maintenance fees associated with a centralized server for distributing and updating software The operating costs of WeChat servers for 600 million users have reached above 300 million Yuan per month Now there are 4 9 billion devices online the annual operating costs of servers will be 29 4 billion Yuan and the number is still increasing rapidly every year \xe3\x80\x90Solution\xe3\x80\x91The future ITC shall have tens of thousands of nodes and they will be absolutely adequate to meet the needs of IoT data storage with a combination of blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s distributed ledger technology Thanks to the de\xe2\x80\x90centralization of blockchain there is no need for highly\xe2\x80\x90intensive computer clusters Both technologies have dramatically reduced the operating and maintaining costs of the whole IoT 6 \x0cIoT Chain 4 Solutions (1) The concept of blockchain Blockchain is an important concept introduced with Bitcoin and its essence is a decentralized database In a narrow sense blockchain is a sort of chain\xe2\x80\x90data structure where data blocks are linked in accordance with time sequence It is also a distributed ledger which cannot be tampered or counterfeited under the protection of cryptology methods In a broad sense blockchain technology is a brand new distributed infrastructure and computing paradigm which uses chain\xe2\x80\x90data structure to verify and store data uses distributed node consensus algorithm to generate and update data uses cryptology methods to guarantee the safety of data transmission as well as data access and utilizes smart contract composed of automatic script code to program and operate data In a more colloquial way blockchain technology enables everyone to take part in the bookkeeping There is a database behind every system and if we regard the database as a large ledger the person in charge of bookkeeping is quite important Under the current technical situation the person who owns the system is responsible for the bookkeeping For example Tencent is in charge of the bookkeeping of WeChat and Alibaba is in charge of Taobao In the blockchain system everyone will have the chance to be involved in the bookkeeping process During a specific period of time if there is any change in the data everyone in the system can participate in bookkeeping The system will select the fastest and the most qualified user to write his record on the ledger and then distribute the updated ledger copies to other users in the system as backup Therefore everyone in the system will have a complete ledger This kind of bookkeeping method is called the blockchain technology (2) The advantages of blockchain technology The idea of everyone in charge of bookkeeping has brought obvious advantages 7 \x0cIoT Chain 1 High security The basic architecture of blockchain is immune to traditional internet attacks The feature of IoT\xe2\x80\x99s information encryption and secure communication is security through publicity and this will help protect users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy Management of identity access and multi\xe2\x80\x90party consensus will contribute to the recognition of misbehaving nodes and prevent malicious nodes from accessing or destroying the network The structure based on chain data will be conducive to building electronic evidence which can be verified and traced 2 Low costs The features of decentralization multi\xe2\x80\x90centers and weakening centralization will reduce the operating costs of centralized architecture (3) The barriers to blockchain application Objectively speaking although blockchain has many distinctive merits there are still quite a few barriers to its widespread application Using Bitcoin as an example 1 Resource consumption Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s POW (Proof of Work) is consensus mechanism with high resource consumption while most IoT devices have problems associated with low computing and network capability as well as short battery life 2 Data expansion With the growth of blockchain comes the question of \xe2\x80\x9cCan IoT devices provide enough storage capacity \xe2\x80\x9d Currently Bitcoin needs 100 G physical storage space and that number keeps increasing If blockchain technology were widely used the associated demand for storage space would be enormous 3 Performance bottleneck The limit speed of a traditional Bitcoin trade is 7 transactions per second and it will take approximately one hour to write in the blockchain plus the time for consensus confirmation This will lead to feedback and warning delays which is not infeasible for delay\xe2\x80\x90sensitive industrial IoT 8 \x0cIoT Chain 4 Partition tolerance The industrial IoT emphasizes that the nodes should be \xe2\x80\x9calways online\xe2\x80\x9d but it happens all the time that ordinary IoT nodes fail and rejoin the network back and forth This will generate network shocks which consumes a lot of network bandwidth and may even cause \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork partition\xe2\x80\x9d All of the above stated issues are not immediately obvious when the blockchain is used on a small scale but they will be big headache in large\xe2\x80\x90scale applications So how can we solve these problems 9 \x0cIoT Chain Chapter II Project Exposition 1 Brief introduction Due to the centralization design of traditional IoT architecture the users\xe2\x80\x99 behavioral data is stored on the central servers controlled by merchants Thus the users\xe2\x80\x99 data is prone to be leaked out and the users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy as well as safety will face severe threats The blockchain has provided decentralized ideas and technology which are very suitable for the self\xe2\x80\x90service self\xe2\x80\x90maintenance self\xe2\x80\x90transactions and shares between machines in IoT industry [1] But there are still some key problems to be solved when applying the blockchain technology in IoT such as the form of consensus quick and efficient payment processing on small amounts and the protection of data privacy For these challenges IoT brings its own solutions including PBFT SPV DAG CPS cluster technology big\xe2\x80\x90data\xe2\x80\x90analysis smart contract ChainCode to name a few ITC adopts the main chain of PBFT consensus the DAG network which supports high performance by nature as side chain and the multi\xe2\x80\x90tier architecture to build an IoT operating system which is safe decentralized and can support high levels of concurrency 2 Technical architecture (1) PBFT One of the core problems of Blockchain is establishing consensus between nodes Different consensus algorithms will create different performance ITC applies the PBFT consensus algorithm to achieve main chain consensus (See Figure 4) Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a state machine replication algorithm based on the consistency of message passing [2] Through three stages namely pre\xe2\x80\x90 prepare prepare and confirm stage this algorithm provides a fault tolerance of (N\xe2\x80\x90 1)/3 (N is the total number of nodes) on the premise of ensuring the activity and safety [3] 10 \x0cIoT Chain Figure 4 The process of achieving consensus of PBFT algorithm Though using PBFT algorithm may cause some losses in the extensibility of nodes both extensibility and performance needs can be balanced by adjusting the weight The blockchain technology based on PBFT consensus algorithm has already been applied in the digital currency of Central Bank of China Bumeng Blockchain and IBM\xe2\x80\x99S hyperledger Recently the HoneyBadgerBFT consensus protocol has been proposed which is said to have realized asynchronous BFT protocol [4] By adopting PBFT consensus protocol ITC has greatly improved the main chain\xe2\x80\x99s processing performance on the premise of achieving consensus of the main chain\xe2\x80\x99s decentralization (2) DAG Bitcoin has recently had a hard time with the SegWit expansion solution Owing to the linked\xe2\x80\x90list data structure of blockchain itself Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s transaction performance has become worse and transaction fees are increasing DAG is a distributed architecture without any block and it applies Directed Acyclic Graph architecture [7] (See Figure 5) instead of the heavy linked blockchain structure Compared with Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s longest\xe2\x80\x90chain consensus DAG changes this into the heaviest\xe2\x80\x90chain consensus mechanism confirming a new deal through transaction weight and partial consensus among nodes which binds proof of work with each deal skillfully This not only solves the current problem of centralization of 11 \x0cIoT Chain Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s mining but also greatly improves the whole distributed network\xe2\x80\x99s throughput capacity thereby lowering the transaction costs After extensive analysis we believe that DAG will become the basic data structure for the next generation\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain Figure 5 DAG topological structures In the DAG network in order to start a transaction the node needs to do simple proof of work and pack several unconfirmed transactions into its own transation When new child transactions confirm the parent transactions partial consensus will be established The more nodes that are related to the parent transaction the easier it will be for the transaction to be confirmed All transactions issued by these nodes form this Directed Acyclic Graph set The confirmation of a new transaction is determined by the former transaction\xe2\x80\x99s weight By optimizing the node selection algorithm and setting the transaction weight the over dispersion of DAG and hashrate attack of illegal transactions can be avoided to protect high efficiency and security of transactions on the chain ITC adopts DAG\xe2\x80\x99s data structure to solve performance problems On the one hand the transaction performance can be improved On the other hand ITC can resist quantum attack 12 \x0cIoT Chain The DAG\xe2\x80\x99s twisted structure can naturally suit the IoT\xe2\x80\x99s message passing mode and can bring extremely high performance for ITC and satisfy blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s decentralization and safety at the same time ITC applies distributed POW and POS ideas \xe2\x80\x94different IoT devices nodes can adopt different security levels according to their requirements \xe2\x80\x94 to satisfy various scenes in IoT ecosystem (3) SPV SPV \xef\xbc\x88Simple Payment Verification\xef\xbc\x89 is a technology which can conduct payment verification without maintaining complete blockchain information as long as the blocks\xe2\x80\x99 headers are preserved This technology cannot only reduce the cost of blockchain payment verification but also reduce the overhead on users The design principle of SPV was first introduced in Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s Bitcoin A Peer\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90Peer Electronic Cash System [5] Taking Bitcoin as an example payment verification can be conducted if the nodes preserve all blocks\xe2\x80\x99 headers If not payment verification cannot be accomplished independently but necessary information of payment verification can be obtained from other nodes of the blockchain to finish transaction payment verification and get the number of verified transactions in the whole blockchain network [6] (See Figure 6) ITC nodes use SPV technology to solve the data expansion problem of major network and DAG Improving payment verification efficiency is the key method to ensuring the whole network\xe2\x80\x99s performance Figure 6 SPV verification principles 13 \x0cIoT Chain (4) Security Big\xe2\x80\x90data Intelligent Analysis\xe2\x80\x94Smart Contract ChainCode1 ITC will become the most abundant data ecosystem in the generation of IoT and generate large amount of data based on smart devices and users\xe2\x80\x99 behavior Currently the users\xe2\x80\x99 data are monopolized by magnate companies and often leveraged and violated in business models that abuses users\xe2\x80\x99 data privacy such as advertisement recommendation and information reselling 1 ChainCode was first brought up by IBM and it refers to smart contract mentioned on Ethereum 14 \x0cIoT Chain In ITC users\xe2\x80\x99 data belong to themselves Any company who intends to do big\xe2\x80\x90data analysis or algorithm model training of advertisement recommendations will need to submit Chaincode to ITC Using a probability model algorithm such as hyperloglog bloomfliter and zero\xe2\x80\x90 knowledge proof we can provide the necessary interface api for ChainCode data analysis With the restriction and assignment of these interfaces contracts submitted to ChainCode cannot steal the users\xe2\x80\x99 initial data but can obtain aggregated data used for smart business decision After execution of ChainCode the companies need to pay ITC token to users who then provide the data according to the data value In this way ITC provides a big\xe2\x80\x90data analysis ecosystem where both users and companies win (5) CPS2 An \xe2\x80\x9cITC + Intelligent analysis platform\xe2\x80\x9d big\xe2\x80\x90data value\xe2\x80\x90creation system will be required if traditional production system is to be transformed into smart factories producing intelligent products To meet this command smart systems focused on the Cyber Physical System (CPS) have emerged In essence CPS is a multi\xe2\x80\x90dimensioned smart technical system based on big data network and mass computation Through core technologies including intelligent sensing analyzing mining assessing predicting optimizing and cooperation CPS can integrate computing communication and control for deep collaboration to realize a profound integration between physical space and cyberspace involving the object\xe2\x80\x99s mechanism environment and community [8] The architecture of ITC refers to CPS cluster and builds the CPS technical system structure on networks of five levels including connection conversion cyber cognition and configuration) On this system architecture pluggable and independent blocks of network communications data analysis and value transfer can improve the stability of IoT\xe2\x80\x99s ecosystem in ITC and make it more intelligent (See Figure 7) 2 CPS refers to the architectural design for the IoT ecosystem of ITC rather than specific technical details 15 \x0cIoT Chain Figure 7 The interactive network of CPS technical system In summary with the application of SPV technology in nodes the PBFT consensus algorithm in the main chain as well as a reference to the CPS IoT layered architecture and an innovative combination of DAG technology with main chain ITC has achieved a the big\xe2\x80\x90data analysis ecosystem which can satisfy IoT\xe2\x80\x99s high\xe2\x80\x90 concurrency explosive usage scenarios providing an intelligent data analysis API and produce a win\xe2\x80\x90win situation between users and customers on the premise of safety as well as decentralization Compared with traditional blockchain ITC has distinctive advantages in system configuration and transaction performance (See Chart 1) Chart 1 Comparative analysis

nature however our ITC project has remarkable technical superiorities (See Chart 2) which will ensure the success of our project and mission 20 \x0cIoT Chain Chart 2 Comparison with similar project 4 Product planning Currently the IoT ecosystem is a centralized intelligent device system and ITC is a P2P node network in essence Within this network sufficient numbers of nodes are an essential element in order to ensure the whole network\xe2\x80\x99s stability Nodes can be divided into normal type and non\xe2\x80\x90normal type Normal\xe2\x80\x90type nodes refer to devices which remain open but their operational capability is not utilized But for non\xe2\x80\x90normal devices once they are open they will start operating To avoid power wastage and inefficiency caused by POW we need to find more stable normal\xe2\x80\x90 type nodes Taking lighting as an example the rotation of earth brings us day and night and light is necessary at night In modern societies light comes from lighting equipment which is a normal\xe2\x80\x90type device of huge amounts and can be used to maintain ITC\xe2\x80\x99s 21 \x0cIo oT Chain stab bility For in nstance wh hen using Zhuonian ligghting cloud d

decentralized IOT networking operating systems ITC is a measure of the value circulation in the ecosystem of IoT Chain Anything involving the use of smart devices ownership and the value of the content ecosystem on smart devices requires ITC billing The following two points ensure that the demand for ITC in the ecological environment continues to grow 1 Every smart device that joins the ecosystem of the universe must have a built\xe2\x80\x90in ITC As more and more smart devices join the IoT Chain system the demand for ITC will continue to rise 2 In the IoT Chain system data sovereignty belongs to users In the era of big data there will be a steady stream of big data analysis needs and each big data analysis request will need to consume ITC and be allocated to users according to each user s data contribution With the sound development of the data ecosystem in IoT Chain the demand for ITC will continue to grow 32 \x0cIoT Chain References [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
