b Rally An incentivization platform built for the content sharing economy on blockchain Version 2 0 1 \x0cAbstract Rally is a platform that builds communities around a business or message using content sharing with crypto token rewards Rally combines concepts from traditional word of mouth and influencer marketing with gamification and tactics that have built cryptocurrencies and their communities Essential Terms User any individual engaged online who communicates with their social network on social media platforms and private channels Advertiser any publisher marketer business organization or charity that needs to promote themselves and are willing to pay for it Social media platforms such as Facebook Twitter and Instagram where the user has friends fans or followers and the advertiser pays to distribute their content Private channels private communications and content sharing via text and email or on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and WeChat Social network\xe2\x80\x8b the people that a user knows where the relationship is managed on any online channel It does not refer to any particular social platform Content anything shared by a user to their social network including text photos videos announcements contests discounts free offers flash sales or other incentives Content sharing economy similar to the gig economy a system where users are rewarded by advertisers for sharing content to their social network Smart contract \xe2\x80\x8bbusiness instructions that are programmed in the blockchain and executed along with a transaction to enforce the terms of a relationship Offer\xe2\x80\x8b an incentive sent by an advertiser to users to share a specific piece of content or engage in a specified way on the advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s behalf backed by a smart contract 2 \x0cIntroduction The discovery and sharing of content are intrinsic to the human experience and have been a central part of the internet since it began As the internet matured that process became centralized under powerful social media platforms While users are increasingly concerned about privacy and how information about them and their behaviors are collected analyzed and sold the digital monopolies have exploited user contributions and their data to generate billions of dollars of profit The same forces that created the sharing economy will shift this dynamic creating a new market out of underutilized assets that empower the user and rewards the true value of their contributions This will be the content sharing economy the next phase in the evolution of the sharing economy enabled by blockchain and managed by users on their smartphones 3 \x0cThe Opportunity Word of mouth or direct peer to peer communications is the most trusted way we share information and communicate The content sharing economy leverages the strength of word of mouth to fundamentally shift how power and profits are allocated in the digital advertising ecosystem Advertisers pay a lot of money to centralized platforms to get their message distributed to their target audience The individual social network that a user has is an unrecognized and underutilized digital asset that has significant value and will become a distributed profit center in the content sharing economy The content sharing economy incentives users to distribute an advertisers content to their own social network easily managed on their smartphones This allows the advertiser to shift their ad budget to the user who by sharing the content gave it their recommendation and increased its effectiveness The user is able to create value by sharing wherever they engage with their social network Most interestingly private channels are a bigger opportunity than social media platforms They represent 84% of publisher and marketer content sharing and have almost no direct marketing spend or an established value chain 1 At its core the opportunity in front of the Rally platform is about reclaiming content sharing taking it back from corporations attributing fair value to it decentralizing it and putting power back in the individual s hands Recognizing the value of word of mouth as a marketing channel is the foundation of the content sharing economy Word of mouth is one of the oldest and most effective forms of advertising Today who the message or content comes from matters now more than ever \xe2\x97\x8f 1 2 75% of people don\xe2\x80\x99t believe ads but 90% believe friend recommendations2 Source \xe2\x80\x8bRadiumOne Source \xe2\x80\x8bHubspot 4 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f 92% of consumers trust recommendations from friends over all other sources3 The strength of this channel can also be seen by how advertisers rate it \xe2\x97\x8f 64% of marketers believe word of mouth marketing is more effective than traditional marketing4 \xe2\x97\x8f Word of mouth generates 2x the sales of paid advertising5 \xe2\x97\x8f Customers acquired through word of mouth have a 37% higher retention rate6 Digital word of mouth marketing primarily takes the form of a user sharing an advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s message to other individuals in their social network Private content sharing is an untapped opportunity that is growing rapidly and is substantially bigger than social media platforms Private sharing channels are where users are spending most of their time and manage their closest communications \xe2\x80\x9cMore than three quarters of what people share is outside of these public networks It\xe2\x80\x99s actually growing over time and fairly rapidly as well \xe2\x80\x9d 7 Source Nielsen Source American Marketing Association 5 Source \xe2\x80\x8bMcKinsey 6 Source \xe2\x80\x8bDeloitte 7 Patrick Darcy Commercial Director Asia Pacific RadiumOne 3 4 5 \x0cThis shift toward trusted private channels is a direct consequence of the distrust of large social media platforms Users share content on both social media platforms and in private communication channels however they view these channels differently Today where content gets shared matters more than ever While private content sharing does shift power away from the centralized platforms it still lacks transparency and an attribution of value Recognizing and rewarding the value that users are due and advertisers would gladly give is the central purpose of the content sharing economy and the Rally platform 6 \x0cOpportunity Trend Summary Growing economic inequality and wealth concentration in the 10 years since the global financial crisis has eroded trust in government and society a dynamic that can also be seen very acutely in the distribution of power and profits in the online advertising ecosystem As jobs were lost and wages stagnated people innovated new ways to create income from underutilized assets and created the sharing economy Technology and the trust that it enabled propelled this new economic system Blockchain and smart contracts will enable further growth of the sharing economy and the emerging content sharing economy by establishing a foundation of trust between users and advertisers Shifting user behavior the smartphone and blockchain enable network effects driving the Rally opportunity that were previously impossible Note see the Appendix for a detailed review of the trends driving the Rally opportunity 7 \x0cThe Rally Solution The Rally platform rewards users to distribute an advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s content to their individual social network This allows the advertiser to shift their ad budget to the user who by sharing the content gives it their recommendation and increases its effectiveness Content and Value Flow Rally unites users with advertisers and utilizes a crypto token to create a marketplace that empowers the user and rewards the true value of their contributions Rally benefits all platform participants \xe2\x97\x8f Users recognizing and rewarding the value they are due permission based opt in communications and a share of tokens 8 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Advertisers direct to audience content distribution increases advertising effectiveness and lowers costs Why blockchain Utilizing blockchain will allow Rally to record user contributions to the platform and reward them for actions that drive platform value To realize the full potential of the content sharing economy and the requirements of transparency security incentives and attribution the Rally platform is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain Rally has developed an attribution model called SmartLinks they are immutably tied to smart contracts SmartLinks establish a smart contract directly between advertisers and users to create a decentralized secure and transparent marketplace with a record of engagements and incentives written into the blockchain Rally anticipates upgrading to exist on its own blockchain mainnet becoming a native coin Rally Token The incentive currency of the platform is the Rally Token (RALLY) a universal currency that can be used seamlessly across borders allowing advertisers to compensate hyper local influencers ambassadors and users anywhere in the world The value of the Rally community is driven by both the number of users and advertisers on the marketplace as well as \xe2\x80\x8bhow engaged users are in offers Rally Token will empower users to interact with the Rally platform and build its community while facilitating the distribution and sharing of rewards and benefits to all of its stakeholders Advertisers use the Rally Token as part of their offers Once users have earned tokens the advertiser can offer goods or services to get it back from the user How users earn tokens \xe2\x97\x8f Joining token can be earned for joining the Rally platform authenticating a user\xe2\x80\x99s profile

issued by way of an airdrop as an incentive for users to join get authenticated refer new users and engage with offers from advertisers 10 \x0c11 \x0cRally Platform The functionality of the platform can best be experienced by joining the Rally community and engaging in activities to earn tokens This webpage is a demonstration of Rally using its own platform to promote Rally and the Rally Token in the same way that any advertiser could Rally will develop in two partially overlapping phases Launch Today the Rally platform consists of a marketplace that connects advertisers with users Advertisers are able to create and send offers to users and engage with them Rally tracks attributes and rewards users that take action Additionally users are able to opt in and out of what messages they receive on a secure platform that is designed to ensure privacy During this phase the Rally Token provides a strong incentive for new users and advertisers to sign up get authenticated and refer others to Rally Authenticated users receive ongoing rewards from the activity of those that they refer to Rally These rewards are the community royalties that are generated whenever a user earns tokens Expansion Once the launch phase has reached a critical mass of users and advertisers a market for content sharing will emerge on Rally Each time an offer is sent the Rally Token gains utility as it is the internal currency or the Rally marketplace New initiatives and features will enhance the utility of Rally for both users and advertisers \xe2\x97\x8f Increased gamification new tools such as user level gamification and leaderboard incentives will drive further user engagement and adoption \xe2\x97\x8f User channels Rally chat will evolve to allow users to create manage and opt in or out of chat channels organized around offers they are interested in \xe2\x97\x8f Off platform tools \xe2\x97\x8b Activity based these will allow advertisers to refer new participants to Rally and run contests from their existing websites and social accounts 12 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8b Redemption based plugins for ecommerce websites to allow Rally Token holders to redeem tokens as part of a purchase \xe2\x97\x8b Opportunity based for opt in users Rally will create browser plugins and app integrations to notify users of opportunities during their regular web use \xe2\x97\x8f Community managers a rewards initiative similar to community royalties that rewards heavily engaged users for managing channels curating offers and the overall community experience \xe2\x97\x8f Community events the Rally community will gather and provide input on new product development in conferences located where the community is concentrated Use Cases Rally delivers value to advertisers by providing a flexible solution that engages the friends fans followers customers employees and other stakeholders around their business to promote their content Rally was designed for maximum flexibility to support a wide range of advertiser goals A few examples of how businesses can use Rally include Community Building Through the Rally platform advertisers are able to reward users for engaging in activities that build their community An advertiser runs a contest that incentivizes actions such as signing up for an email list following them on social media or downloading their app This broadens and deepens the relationship between and advertiser and its community Event Promotion A concert creates a VIP package to give away as part of a contest to build awareness and sell tickets To increase the number of entries in the contest the incentivized action is to share the contest and users get more entries with each referral Awareness of the event and ticket sales are increased by incentivizing users to promote the event for them 13 \x0cCharitable Causes A charity creates an ongoing contest to increase the engagement of its supporters Users that are enrolled in the contest are rewarded for referring new donors and sharing important cause content This deepens the relationship that the charity has with its supporters and celebrates their success Employee Advocacy The advertiser uses the employee through sharing content to their social network to benefit the company in many ways Benefits include raising awareness of the organization through positive exposure the recommendation of products or services and recruitment of new employees Local Businesses A local business creates a contest to promote a new service The contest includes a promotion or deal for example a discounted pre paid voucher The business sends notification of the contest to their email list and social feeds users that share the contest to their networks are rewarded and the business get increased awareness and new customers Competition Rally is differentiated from blockchain based businesses noted below in that it is not focused on one form of advertising (display) one communication platform (social) or one media type (entertainment content or UGC) Notable blockchain projects in related areas \xe2\x97\x8f Steem (STEEM) a new social media platform without traditional advertising that seeks to redefine social media by building a growing social economy where users receive token rewards for their attention and contributions to the platform \xe2\x97\x8f Brave Networks (BAT) a new browser that disintermediates the online display advertising market by blocking display ads on websites and uses a token to exchange value between publishers advertisers and users 14 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Tron (TRX) a decentralized entertainment content sharing platform that is focused on allowing creators of digital content to cut out middlemen such as the Apple Store and Google Play to obtain funds directly from consumers \xe2\x97\x8f Friendz (FDZ) is a content creation platform that incentives users to create content for multinational companies and share on their social networks While there is some overlap with companies in the influencer marketing referral marketing and employee advocacy areas each of these focuses on a specific type of user or desired result Rally is committed to a platform where anyone can take part and is focusing on incentivized peer to peer communications wherever they are taking place 15 \x0cAppendix Opportunity Driver Discussion These are the forces trends proof points and patterns that give clarity to the path forward for Rally and the content sharing economy Increasing social inequality has led to the creation of the sharing economy allowing ordinary people to be micro entrepreneurs Never before has so much wealth been created and power consolidated in such a short time than the last decade The beneficiaries of this expansion since the 2008 financial crisis have been a small segment of the population and the largest companies The reality for most people outside the top 1% is that wages are stagnant and job security is at an all time low This dynamic has created an unprecedented loss of trust in society The Edelman Trust Barometer8 found that for the first time media became the least trusted institution defined as both content and platforms More broadly 75% of people believe the system is rigged against them One way that people are reacting to this situation is an increasing interest in the \xe2\x80\x9cgig economy \xe2\x80\x9d an alternative term for the sharing economy as it allows ordinary people to be micro entrepreneurs and it is economically empowering Niche word of mouth marketing tactics demonstrate how powerful word of mouth is and advertisers interest in secure and trusted advertising channels There are three primary forms of marketing that seek to capitalize on the power of word of mouth influencer marketing referral marketing and employee advocacy These tactics are all different segments of the content sharing economy They are unified in their recognition of the value of word of mouth and place the user or distributor of the content at the center of the value chain 8 Source https //www edelman com/trust barometer 16 \x0cInfluencer marketing has received a significant amount of attention and investment as it benefits from both the trust of word of mouth communications and the influencer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to deliver a large relevant audience Even though this is a one to many format research indicates that most users trust this relationship almost as much as word of mouth \xe2\x97\x8f A survey of Twitter users showed that 49% of users rely on recommendations from influencers vs 56% indicating that they relied on recommendations from friends 9 Some of the initial excitement about influencer marketing has declined as social media platforms have changed their algorithms decreasing the reach that influencers get from their large followings in favor of content from other users where there is a direct relationship Accordingly the focus of influencer marketing is now more about influencer content creation vs advertiser content distribution Referral marketing targets an advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s existing customers with incentives to recommend their products and services to new customers While it capitalizes on the strength of word of mouth communications between users referral marketing\xe2\x80\x99s ability to scale is fundamentally limited by the number of customers that the company has Employee advocacy is the promotion of an organization by its employees It recognizes that the employee through their social network has the ability to benefit the company in many ways Some focuses of employee advocacy programs include \xe2\x97\x8f Raise brand awareness of the organization through positive exposure \xe2\x97\x8f Recommending products or services \xe2\x97\x8f Recruit new employees and increase awareness of the organization\xe2\x80\x99s culture Employee advocacy programs are typically gamified with incentives that range from social recognition such as \xe2\x80\x9cemployee of the month\xe2\x80\x9d to a giveaway of a significant prize The organization leverages the employees\xe2\x80\x99 social media networks to exponentially increase the reach of their message 9 Source \xe2\x80\x8bAdWeek 17 \x0cDigital monopolies consolidate power and grow in value while the users that created the platform value receive no compensation A few very large companies effectively control the Internet Google Facebook Apple and Amazon intermediate our online purchases and communications conduct our searches and store data about us Facebook and Google in particular are platforms that collect data about us in exchange for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d services In fact these services are not free at all While we may not pay these companies directly we give them our personal data that is vastly more valuable than what we get in return In our modern information economy whoever collects stores and shares data about its users has power This valuable personal data is part of a new asset class that The Economist described as a 21st century resource on par with oil in the previous century Additionally as these companies collect more and more data there is an ever present risk of misuse as evidenced in the most recent Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal Since 2011 Facebook has grown the annual revenue that it yields from each user by 4 \xe2\x80\x8b x\xe2\x80\x8b Most astoundingly over five years through May 2018 the market caps of these four companies have grown by \xe2\x80\x8b$2 0 trillion\xe2\x80\x8b 18 \x0cIn the current online economic value chain marketers need to pay the centralized platforms to reach their audience while the users that created the platform value and are the most important part of the digital media ecosystem receive no compensation for their attention and actions There is a growing awareness of how unfair this distribution of value is Reddit the 4th largest site in the US according to Alexa has considered issuing a cryptocurrency backed by a portion of a $50 million equity financing as a way to reward the users that contributed to the site\xe2\x80\x99s success and ultimate value 10 Additionally digital marketplaces are gaining significant traction connecting buyers and sellers and are consolidating power in their individual sectors as another form of digital monopoly As these businesses scale the network effects of where the service improves with each incremental user creates monopoly power for the winners This power can be seen in the take rate or percentage each company charges per transaction on its platform 10 Source F \xe2\x80\x8b orbes 19 \x0cA growing sense of economic inequality combined with privacy concerns is causing users to shift their most trusted communications to private channels Smartphones empower users and will enable the redistribution of power and value away from the centralized online platforms Our mobile devices are supercomputers where we control our communications with our social network Online communications on mobile devices make word of mouth easier than ever The combination of a user their smartphone and their social network creates an incredibly powerful network node that gives each user the ability to regain power from the centralized online platforms and is the access point to the most powerful and trusted marketing channel there is It has never taken less time or effort for the user to perform high value actions that distribute content to their contacts and create value for the advertiser or content creator The sharing economy through community and technology allows users to monetize underutilized assets The sharing economy is the first new economic system since capitalism and socialism It is based on trust transparency human connection and propelled by technology The system 20 \x0cuses excess inventory either assets or services to allow ordinary people to become microentrepreneurs Within this system power is distributed to the user and defined by the networks that they are engaged in and who they are connected to The shift of power it creates distributed profit centers across an open network The sharing economy shows how user behavior has changed and how users perceive themselves as part of a broader network where everyone\xe2\x80\x99s meaningful contribution to a community should be recognized for the value it adds This forms a cooperative group around a common objective It is economically empowering and democratizes the economy The content sharing economy will be the next phase in the evolution of the sharing economy enabled by blockchain and managed by users on their smartphones Blockchain establishes transparency trust and eliminates the need for central intermediaries to control exchanges of value The next phase of the internet will be a period where multiple profit centers share value across an open network shifting power and value away from centralized platforms This phase is only possible with the emergence of blockchain technology In the content sharing economy blockchain creates transparency and a foundation of trust between users and advertisers such that they can securely interact and exchange value with each other without the need to go through an intermediary User participants need to be able to trust that their identity and profile are secure while they have the ability to easily opt in and out of ongoing marketing offers On the other side of the marketplace marketers need to know that they are incentivizing real users that have been authenticated All of these requirements to unlock the potential of the content sharing economy are made possible by blockchain 21 \x0cBounty programs demonstrate what is possible when a compelling cause is backed by incentivized activity Online bounty programs began with online gaming platforms that asked their community members to aid in the development of the game in exchange for rewards These rewards were very often digital assets within the game itself This concept of incentivizing a community around a desired action has been adopted by the first blockchain application Bitcoin It is already the largest decentralized sharing economy in the world where participants exchange computing power for the value of mined tokens To receive tokens without purchasing them a user has three options 1) support the blockchain application by way of mining which carries significant hardware and electrical costs 2) improve the security and function of the application through a bug bounty program which requires significant technical expertise or 3) promote the digital currency prior the ICO which requires getting involved at the right time For digital currency applications that have raised funds through an initial coin offering (ICO) bounty programs expanded to include incentives for building a community and marketing the ICO itself These programs incentivized individuals to promote the ICO by word of mouth through their social networks and in forums The practice of getting free tokens for promotional activities has had widespread appeal to a lot of members of the crypto community However once the bounty program window is closed people with significant promotional and community building capabilities have no ongoing way to contribute and be rewarded While Rally will not be doing an ICO it will have a bounty program as part of the first phase of its platform launch Beyond the bounty program Rally will provide an ongoing incentivized way for users to continue to be rewarded for community building and content sharing activities 22 \x0cThe rise of the direct to consumer retail model shows how value can be captured and redistributed by cutting out the middleman By disintermediating retail channels direct to consumer (DTC) brands are showing how disruptive a direct connection with the end user is and how that disruption creates value that can be shared between brands and customers Direct to consumer brands are products or services that are designed marketed distributed and sold by the same company They bypass the middleman (retail stores) and connect directly to consumers online shifting how power is distributed along the value chain and how profits are shared Notable examples such as WarbyParker DollarShaveClub and Casper all $1 billion+ brands have taken on huge markets and won over customers by creating a direct connection with their audience Even legacy and well known brands such as Nike are focusing on ways to bypass traditional retail distribution channels Nike predicts that they will grow their direct sales from $6 6 billion in 2015 to $16 billion in 2020 11 Distributing product directly to the consumer allows DTC companies to reduce costs that they can pass along to the customer and collect valuable customer data and direct feedback The result for the customer the end user is that they benefit from improved economics and a highly personalized experience The benefits of lowered costs and a deeper relationship with their audience are available to advertisers who cut out the middlemen and share value with end users 11
