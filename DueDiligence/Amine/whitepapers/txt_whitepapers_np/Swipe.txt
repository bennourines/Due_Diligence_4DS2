cryptocurrencies have been used as a store of value fuel in an ecosystem or used as securities With these new mix purpose functionalities Swipe believes that it is important that cryptocurrencies should all inherently have a digital cash capability and have the ability to be spent The first transaction was actually quite expensive and maybe was a catalyst of fear of not to spend cryptocurrencies in the infamous pizza bitcoin purchase4 One of the first major companies to build the bridge in spending Bitcoin was BitPay BitPay first enabled merchants to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment to shop on their stores The second product BitPay launched was the BitPay Visa Card that enables their users to load a Visa debit card with fiat funds converted from Bitcoin building the first payment instrument that enables spending cryptocurrencies BitPay helped realize Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s original intentions with Bitcoin and it enabled a cash system to be used via a traditional Visa card and between merchants who wanted to process bitcoin as a payment method Since the launch of these two products from BitPay many companies are now attempting to launch products aimed to make cryptocurrencies more easily accessible and useable in our real world Companies like Coinbase have launched trading platforms that include fiat on/o ramps for users worldwide through their website and banking relationships Crypto dot com launched a Wallet and Visa card aimed to make crypto top ups accessible to users in Singapore \x0cMany others have taken their sights to build bridges of cryptocurrencies in everyday use with a constant growth of the market capitalization5 as more usage users use cases and more are released Popularity has grown through institutional entities now as well with the launch of regulated entities6 such as Bakkt With these new products being released there are new doors being opened to both financial institutions and also to third world markets such as in Africa to bring financial inclusion powered by cryptocurrencies Blockchain based cryptocurrencies are designed by nature to be transparent on the blockchain and to eliminate fraudulent transactions which we typically see done by Credit Cards and Bank Accounts In the United Kingdom alone it su#ered over \xc2\xa3600 million in credit card fraud losses7 Cryptocurrencies by nature are designed to be cryptographic and possibly prevent losses like this from occurring in our markets Swipe strongly believes that blockchain technology and a society where we operate without cash is important to growing our financial sectors to the next step The focus will be on facilitating the adoption of cryptocurrencies to millions of users worldwide by creating solutions that meet the standard of what the expectations of the user audience is Through understanding the need of our user\xe2\x80\x99s needs Swipe has studied the market to understand the current landscape A majority of the of the volume and services provide to users are from a select handful of platforms such as Coinbase Bitstamp and BitPay \x0cThese platforms are known for their robust security high liquidity and technical infrastructure which enables the services users need while maintaining their level of comfort using these services with trust and safety in mind However each of these platforms has their specific niche market they target and don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily o er the a\xe2\x80\x99 la carte selection to bring a multi use services o ering in one product or platform The objective is to understand the background of the market and how Swipe can come into it at this stage and make presence will require the vision to be executed in a fashion where we can o er a vast need of services to users Swipe will focus on o ering a first class customer service with a secure platform that focuses on payments and serviced tailored around cryptocurrencies 2/ ISSUES The current landscape of the crypto markets today lacks companies that o er the ability of cryptocurrencies to be actually spent Currently there are only a handful of companies that are approved to issue cryptocurrency debit cards due to the issues done by bad actors Prior to the crackdown there were issuers abusing their licensing agreement and doing crossborder issuance without the necessary approvals This caused Visa and MasterCard to terminate relationships which left cardholders stranded Thereafter it is a requirement from the issuing schemes to get a necessary approval per region you are issuing in \x0cThe companies that are issuing with compliance in mind are only in Singapore and a few countries in the Asia Pacific area The companies issuing in the United States are limited to the assets available and require significant licensing to o er their products With these issues and more there have been solutions developed over the course of the last 5 years bridging the gap of bringing cryptocurrencies to our real world commerce which has slowly been established However custody and control seem to be a common issue with numerous exchanges being hacked for billions of dollars8 These exchanges and providers have lacked the necessary infrastructural security to help protect user assets and safeguard them from hackers and malicious attackers Some of these exchanges and providers have su ered enormous breaches at the expense of their users Even with some of the newer providers who are aiming to solve these issues they lack any incentive for the user in comparison to other traditional financial platforms from cash back percentages to actual bonuses o ered Some even have high entry of barriers such as monthly maintenance fees initial deposit requirements and limitations in services \x0c3/ MARKET The overall market condition has allowed companies like Swipe enter the ecosystem and o er products that will be actually used due to a need of these services and selections of providers Swipe is a niche market with its planned o ering of the Swipe Wallet and Swipe Card There are currently only a few other companies o er similar products and from their overall o ering they lack certain features or regions that Swipe will intercept with its product o erings Swipe believes that blockchain based payments and cryptocurrencies will become a tool for the unbanked population \xe2\x80\x93 currently at around two billion people worldwide However this technology not only benefits this group of people but at the same time blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has changed the entire e commerce ecosystem by o ering highly beneficial systems to both customers and merchants in developed and developing regions The $3 trillion global retail e commerce market is ever growing with now more than 20% year over year This market is currently dominated by Visa and Mastercard but is being disrupted by the potential of this new market of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies Companies that can piggy back o these existing market leaders while providing their own services will propel their services forward at a much quicker rate than someone entering the marketing with a completely new product o ering and no back bone integrations to spearhead its marketing \x0cThe opportunity and features that these new emerging systems provide will o er a substantially more e cient method of providing instant and lower cost remittances and services worldwide Currently the market is in the need for a tool and system in place to lower these transaction fees and o er the same feel of services which blockchain and cryptocurrency as a whole can solve The users in this market need to become aware that Swipe will o er its product line in a cheaper more e cient and more selective range of services versus its competitors A few ways that Swipe plans to do this are the following \xe2\x80\xa2 Social Media Advertisements \xe2\x80\xa2 Search Engine Advertisements \xe2\x80\xa2 Press Releases and Media Articles \xe2\x80\xa2 Influencer Marketing \xe2\x80\xa2 Aggressive Referral System \xe2\x80\xa2 Events and Trade shows \xe2\x80\xa2 Global Meet ups \x0c4/ INTRODUCTION TO SWIPE
