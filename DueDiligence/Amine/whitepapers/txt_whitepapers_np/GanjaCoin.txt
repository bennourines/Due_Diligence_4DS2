b Marijuana on the Blockchain Stability through Proof of Stake 01 30 2018 \xe2\x94\x80 GanjaCoin (MRJA) \x0c1 Abstract 2 Overview 4 Unique Value Proposition 4 Token Information 4 Proof of Work and Proof of Stake 5 Problems 5 Solutions 6 Road Map 8 Current Competition 9 Milestones\xe2\x80\x8b and Info 11 References 12 \x0c2 Abstract In 2012 Marijuana became a legal substance in Colorado and Washington state This marked the start of a new industry with new growth and new opportunities As time went on new laws new businesses and jobs flooded throughout America Slowly state by state marijuana began to be accepted and legalized Now more than ever individuals are open to the legalization of marijuana with 70% of millennials supporting it As of 2018 10 states have legalized recreational marijuana along with 34 states having some sort of medical marijuana laws Now by 2020 it is predicted that the new Marijuana industry will create jobs for over a quarter million of Americans Although certain states have allowed the usage of marijuana the federal government still counts marijuana as a category one substance making it still illegal on a federal level The illegality yet legality of marijuana complexifies processes for business such as dispensaries Dispensaries annually sit on millions of dollars in cash due to them being unable to legally store money in a bank Hundreds of dispensaries nationwide have no ability to take credit or debit cards leaving customers unable to pay unless they are paying in cash Overall things end up complicated for both the consumer and the producer GanjaCoin strives to solve these problems through the utilization of blockchain technology GanjaCoin allows consumers to quickly and efficiently make digital purchases at marijuana dispensaries Those who feel safer using digital payment methods are finally acknowledged Producers are able to save money on security and easily keep track of their revenue Fees also disappear before they are able to appear with debit and credit cards \x0c3 GanjaCoin is not the first marijuana based cryptocurrency but it is unique in its own way GanjaCoin has the lowest supply out of all major marijuana cryptocurrencies Also although practically all the major competitors are run on proof of stake systems GanjaCoin provides the largest rewards from staking and also allows user to own masternodes The most unique value of GanjaCoin is the plan to eventually open a marijuana dispensary where each gram of marijuana will be backed with the value of one GanjaCoin Currently listed on two exchanges as of January 2018 GanjaCoin has big plans GanjaCoin plans to continue expanding its reach to multiple other exchanges such as Cryptopia and Kucoin eventually reaching Bittrex Also GanjaCoin will be focusing on creating a wallet for both Android and Apple devices so that purchases at dispensaries are closer to becoming possible Also to progress the possibility of these purchases GanjaCoin will need to be accepted by dispensaries so the team will contact dispensaries in marijuana legal states and provide the benefits of accepting GanjaCoin GanjaCoin strives to be the best marijuana cryptocurrency on the market delivering efficient digital storage and digital payments in the developing industry of marijuana With a headstrong team and community the coin is constantly developing and bettering itself The marijuana industry needs a digital way to process transactions and GanjaCoin is here to do just that \x0c4 Overview On February 5th 2017 GanjaCoin was released to the public Its main purpose is to utilize the decentralization of the blockchain system to help Marijuana users and dispensaries alike GanjaCoin is also meant to become the primary currency for marijuana purchases and the first to be backed by feminized seeds In the future GanjaCoin will most likely be backed by the value of one gram Located in Massachusetts the team is progressively bettering the coin everyday as the marijuana industry throughout the United States continues to grow Unique Value Proposition Efficient digital storage and digital payments in the developing industry of Marijuana GanjaCoin will be able to offer storage and digital transactions for dispensaries with quick transactions and low fees Current problems with the lack of digital storage will be remedied by GanjaCoin through persistent development and constant innovation Token Information \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Proof of Stake (PoS) coin Backed 1 1 by feminized seeds (female seed ready for planting) 42 000 000 coin supply 0 0001 MRJA fee per transaction Instant transaction time using InstaX \x0c5 Proof of Work and Proof of Stake When looking at coins in the cryptosphere different coins have different ways of processing transactions and \xe2\x80\x9cfinding\xe2\x80\x9d coins \xe2\x80\x8bOriginally Proof of Work (PoW) dominated the cryptocurrency world Bitcoin is built on a PoW system making it the most popular and original method For many this is known as mining By using a computers GPU (graphics processing unit) CPU and ASIC a miner confirms a transaction and earns a reward for this These are the fees that are associated with bitcoin transactions The miner using their GPU also \xe2\x80\x9cmines\xe2\x80\x9d through data blocks that contain code for some bitcoin If the miner finds the code they are rewarded with the data called a block reward Overtime as more blocks are mined the difficulty to mine through each block increases and the reward decreases The process of running a GPU all day and night presents the problem of excess usage of electricity and simply is not sustainable PoW networks are prone to becoming congested causing fees to rise and transaction to slow GanjaCoin uses a Proof of Stake system to confirm transactions on the network The conformation of the transactions are not done with hardware the GPUs in the miners case but rather with the already owned coins By staking coins the individual who is staking them earns a reward relative to the amount of coins that they are staking They also earn coins off of the transaction fees in the network PoS coins are considered to be more stable due to their nature where the individual staking the coins holds onto their coins This way less coins are flooding the market constantly In a PoW system the miners mine the coins and due to self interest they sell off their coins overall causing the market to fluctuate Staking nurtures the network by handling transactions and stabilizing it through the retention of coins from the market Problems 1 Federal Banks Can\xe2\x80\x99t Take Marijuana Dispensary Cash Federal law prohibits any banks from taking money from legal marijuana dispensaries Marijuana is still illegal on the federal level so any banks processing money from Marijuana dispensaries are considered to be laundering money Since banks are federal and marijuana laws are state vendors and owners of dispensaries are left sitting on cash unable to store it legally in digital form This burdens owners with the task of paying tax collectors in large sums of cash and overall makes it harder to track their earnings Not only does this burden owners but it poses a massive security risk Holding liquid assets is risky \x0c6 for dispensaries which means a lot of money must be spent on security to make sure the owner\xe2\x80\x99s earning are safe 2 Currently no digital way to purchase Marijuana legally Banks are not able to store or transact any money that flows into a dispensary so an average consumer outfitted with a debit or credit card may not simply walk into a dispensary and make a purchase This poses a problem for consumers as some prefer to carry debit or credit cards Whether it is because they feel safer carrying a card instead of cash or they would rather purchase using credit there is no solution for them This also makes it harder for owners to keep track of their revenues and pay taxes at the end of each quarter No digital purchases means no digital logs of purchases unless manually inputted Manual entry of millions of dollars can be stressful and time consuming for owners Focusing on cash logs and keeping track of purchases can overtime deteriorate the businesses focus and detract from the customers satisfaction Also if marijuana becomes legal on the federal level and banks are able to process transactions they will take a fee of 1 55 3 5% from every purchase while GanjaCoin has a set transaction fee of 0001 MRJA which is 001% of a single GanjaCoin for every purchase 3 Affordable Marijuana At times marijuana for some might be out of their budget or they might not be satisfied with the amount of money it is taking out of their budget The average income for an American citizen is \xe2\x80\x8b$56 516 nationwide (not a marijuana state statistic) An ounce of Marijuana can range from $130 to $250 which can cost yearly from $3 120 to $6 000 assuming that two ounces are purchased every month This is 6 11% of the average Americans income Whether it be for medical or recreational purposes this can use up a large percentage of a customers budget without their realizatio\xe2\x80\x8bn Solution 1 Staking of GanjaCoin Helps Customers Make a Passive Income for Future Purchases Customers who find problems with the amount of money that they are spending on marijuana can stake coins in order to earn GanjaCoin that they can use for future purchases This is called Proof of Stake (PoS) and is similar to earning interest An individual will put their coins into a GanjaCoin wallet on their desktop and let it stake Based on the amount that they have staked they will earn an amount in rewards relative to that The \x0c7 rewards come from confirming transactions and block rewards (See section \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Stake and Proof of Work\xe2\x80\x9d) The individual can then further stake these coins and earn more or they can use what they have made to purchase marijuana at their dispensary Simply put the customer will be investing marijuana spendings to earn future marijuana spendings Once the coin supply reaches 42 million the staking will stop as no more new coins are able to be staked but individuals will still be able to contribute to the network through masternode sharing They will be able to contribute a part of their income to support a masternode which process transactions and in return earn a percentage of those transactions This percentage will incentivize users to support the network through their contribution and patience 2 Dispensaries can use Ganjacoin to Digitally Store Their Earnings Instead of using traditional banks to store their money dispensaries can use a GanjaCoin wallet to store their liquid assets The GanjaCoin will act as a digital storage of value for these dispensaries who otherwise can\xe2\x80\x99t store their cash In the future GanjaCoin will be developing methods for dispensaries to store these coins even more securely GanjaCoin will also eventually develop a way for dispensary owners to change their GanjaCoin into fiat and bitcoin easily and seamlessly without having to go through coinbase or other companies The ability to digitally store the money that they earn will make it easier for owners to focus on their business in other areas such as customer service and product quality With GanjaCoin being utilized by businesses they will find it easier to keep track of their money and where it is going They will feel safer and more confident knowing that their money is safe digitally rather than physically Working with GanjaCoin will also be beneficial for dispensaries during the staking stage Any digital holdings that they have will stake and earn coins until the cap of 42 million coins is reached 3 GanjaCoin Users can use Digital Payment to Purchase Marijuana Once dispensaries are able to store GanjaCoin at their stores users will be able to use it to complete their purchases Initially customers will send GanjaCoin payments simply by scanning a dispensary wallet QR code and transferring over their funds The payment will immediately show up in the store wallet and the customer is on their way There will be no change and it will completely mimic the familiar feeling of using a debit card GanjaCoin will bridge the gap between the marijuana industry and digital transactions simply and efficiently by providing a legal way for customers to digitally pay for marijuana purchases \x0c8 Road

Cryptopia Along the line our website will be updated so it is easier to process the information on it and so that it is more aesthetically pleasing We will also be pursuing dispensaries nationwide that need a form of digital payment GanjaCoin will work with these dispensaries to smoothly implement payment systems so that customers and owners alike have a new way to share value Current

\xe2\x97\x8b Max Supply Uncapped \xe2\x97\x8b 5% staking return For GanjaCoin these are the five primary competitors All of these coins other than cannabis coin work on PoS concepts and have staking rewards Although all of these coins have staking rewards the rewards for staking GanjaCoin are significantly higher at 20% Also in comparison to these coins GanjaCoin is the only one to have masternodes This allows users even after the staking stage is done to still earn GanjaCoin Another unique \x0c10 feature of GanjaCoin is that it is currently backed by feminized seeds The only other coin to be backed by something of value is CannabisCoin which runs on a PoW system All of these coins have supplies ten times greater than GanjaCoin meaning that upon integration into the Marijuana industry each coin will have less face value Ganjacoin will also be offering a program to individuals in the future so that they can easily split a masternode with and get paid an equivalent of their percentage holding Milestones and Info \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f There was no ICO for GanjaCoin GanjaCoin had a small premine of 75 000
