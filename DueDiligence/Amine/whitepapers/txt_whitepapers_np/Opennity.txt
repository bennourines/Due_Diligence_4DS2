important industries from healthcare to politics As blockchain technology continues to emerge traditional industries are beginning to explore the possibility of integration into their respective fields However finding the appropriate talent can be difficult for both blockchain and traditional companies There\xe2\x80\x99s the issue of not knowing where to look or if they found a person being able to verify their accomplishments in previous blockchain roles Opennity is a new community and referral economy which connects global professionals in the blockchain industry Users can monetize their connections by using Opennity\xe2\x80\x99s incentivized program that encourages users to refer valuable connections for financial rewards The Opennity community is built on a decentralized platform to assure transparency and authentic transactions The platform gives projects and service providers the opportunity to find the best matches and promote themselves in order to accomplish genuine blockchain projects that will bring positive change to real world businesses 3 \x0cOpennity allows an easy to use referral service for companies and service seekers all the while assuring referrers their rewards through the blockchain Referrers get the chance to pick the offers that best fit their connections/network and are incentivized to bring up the best match in order to climb up our community rating system Opennity changes the act of making a referral into a financially rewarding task Every time companies and candidates/service providers connect through the recommendation from a community member the referrer gets rewarded by our Opennity token upon the occurrence of a completed match Users see the listings of job openings or services requests from companies and pick the best offers for their existing reference pool of candidates or service providers and refer them Companies on our platform are expected to spend less resources than through typical offline referrals to acquire high quality matches that get the job done Our platform will expand through satisfactory matches community growth and development of our ecosystem The Opennity token will therefore allow the holders to 1 Get referral suggestions from our community 2 3 4 Acquire information of candidates / service providers Promote through media and advertisements and Rate service providers 4 \x0c2 Opennity Community and Referral Economy on Blockchain 2 1 Vision Opennity aims to l Create job opportunities for users in the blockchain industry l Help enterprises to apply blockchain technology in their business l Encourage the community\xe2\x80\x99s active contribution to develop a community economy l Allow cross border and cross industry transactions l l Enhance the efficiency of locating global professional services providers Ensure proper automated settlement and transparency through Blockchain 5 \x0c2 2 Problem Lack of a Reliable Source Even though many companies have some sort of referral program for recruiting talent through internal staff very few of them if any are working efficiently By merely offering an incentive to internal staff for referring suitable candidates to open positions means a limited pool of referrers and job offers where low effectiveness of these referral program is easily expected Moreover the existing referral programs are centralized without any transparency This traditional way of referral can lead to problems like referrers having no idea of the hiring status of job offerings limited choices for both referrers and the company and referrers caring only about the one off incentives but not the quality of referral Nowadays for companies who would like to recruit blockchain talent or engage blockchain related service providers they will usually need to reach out to \xe2\x80\x9cone stop shop\xe2\x80\x9d advisors where one would need to get each and every service through the advisor\xe2\x80\x99s connections which of course involves a marked up fee Companies can only rely on the recommendation and profession of the advisor to pick the service providers (either as an individual or corporation) and there is no reliable data or statistics on the performance of the service providers Since there is currently no good marketplace to provide trustworthy industry intelligence for companies that don\xe2\x80\x99t prefer hiring employees or engaging service providers through an advisor they are left only with the choice to conduct independent research which is extremely time consuming and inefficient Without a comprehensive method of verifying the legitimacy of parties involved and discerning if it\xe2\x80\x99s the right opportunity for them customers are left with no easy way to make decisions limiting the potential growth of the market out of the gate With many businesses poised to integrate blockchain into their existing business it can be a struggle to identify the blockchain talent service providers and the opportunities that best fit their needs 6 \x0c2 3 Solution Opennity changes the act of making a referral with the addition of financial rewards for genuine and successful referrals On Opennity\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized platform where job and task offers are listed everyone from our community will act as referrers to hunt for the best matches for our customers These referrers will frequently be rated by our community rating system to assure their professional and trust level Users will be able to seek out professional blockchain talent and service providers through referrals in which the referrers get rewarded in the form of tokens Our community will create a world of trust for blockchain users talent and service providers by allowing interactions with other blockchain experts 2 4 How Opennity Works Verified Registration Individuals or businesses will create their accounts and get verification through SMS After the approval and verification of the account information an activation link will be sent to create a default wallet for the account If the user has an existing wallet they can input the address to their wallet manually If the user does not have an existing wallet they will need to input a secret phrase length between 16 to 32 characters which they would need to save separately 7 \x0cNext the user can click the \xe2\x80\x9cgenerate wallet\xe2\x80\x9d button and our platform will show the wallet information such as Ethereum address and private key Finally the user will finish this registration when clicking the submit button If the user loses their private key they can type in their secret phrase to recover the private key back 8 \x0cListing a job In order for a business \xe2\x80\x98offerer\xe2\x80\x99 to list a job they must have an account and have gone through the verification process at registration to confirm the legitimacy of the company After filling out the description for the job listing the listing will go through a review process to verify that it is a legitimate listing Offerers will then include the reward in Opennity tokens they will offer to \xe2\x80\x98referrers\xe2\x80\x99 the community blockchain influencers and advisories for finding suitable candidates The offerer will put their reward amount in stablecoin or any cryptocurrency with our platform in an escrow If a match is completed successfully Platform transfers the reward to the referrer after deducting 5% 9 \x0cIf a match doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen Platform transfers back the reward to the Offerer A 5% fee will be deducted if referrals are referred to the job listing even if the offeree rejects the candidates The 5% fee will not be deducted if there are no referrals that apply From the user side the referrers can share a listing by inputting their referral\xe2\x80\x99s email or telephone number Opennity will share the listing to the inputted email or telephone The referral can then apply for the listing The referral must have an Opennity account prior to applying After the referral has completed their application the referrer will be able see the status between the referral and offerer Existing Platforms There are a number of platforms out there that provide their users with incentivized matchmaking for job postings However these platforms lack transparency trust and do not have a specific focus on the blockchain industry There is currently no platform for businesses to connect with blockchain talent and service providers based on referrals from a genuine community Talent and Service Providers Can Get Discovered With Opennity\xe2\x80\x99s easy to use portal users will be able to start finding reliable and verified talent and service providers through our community referrals effectively They will have access to our reliable pool of powerful community referrals Through our community discussion and rating referrers and service providers that are recommended will be easily accessible For corporate service providers they can further be discovered on our platform through analysis reports provided by the community and through featured promotions 2 5 Why are Companies Moving Towards Blockchain Application Blockchain Eliminates Agencies Enhances the Efficiency of Transactions and Allows Transparency The disruption that blockchain brings is that trust is established through collaboration and code rather than a central authority Agencies and third party intermediaries that act as middlemen will no longer be needed One would no longer need a bank to make a money transfer around the world An escrow account would no longer be needed to buy a home or 10 \x0ceven a real estate agent to facilitate the transaction Transactions of any kind no longer need a company or central authority to be facilitated This is what is revolutionary about blockchain and has the potential to revolutionize nearly every industry By eliminating third party intermediaries and related overhead costs transaction rates are increased and transaction costs are virtually non existent Not only can anyone check an entry at any given time but this verification can be done in a very transparent manner One of the most appealing aspects of blockchain technology is the degree of privacy that it can provide In a blockchain the identity of a user is concealed behind powerful cryptography meaning that linking public addresses to individual users is particularly difficult to achieve Although this may make blockchain sound the opposite of transparent the transparency of a blockchain stems from the fact that the holdings and transactions of each public address are open to viewing Using an explorer and equipped with a user\xe2\x80\x99s public address it is possible to view their holdings and the transactions that they have carried out This level of transparency has not existed within financial systems before especially in regard to large businesses and adds a degree of accountability that has not existed to date The applications of developing such a system of integrity are limitless and blockchain is the technology that is laying the foundation to a more transparent and positive society This goes further than creating a world of trust but rather giving a platform to a trustless framework one where trust is not even needed as the system itself is unchangeable and incorruptible The Blockchain is the Future While blockchain is most famous for its role in facilitating the rise of digital currencies over the past several years there are also many other non cryptocurrencies uses for this technology Indeed some advocates of the blockchain believe that the technology could far outpace cryptocurrencies themselves in terms of its overall impact and that the real potential of blockchain is only just now being discovered Therefore it s likely that financial advisors and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come whether it is linked with a 11 \x0cspecific cryptocurrency or if it s being utilized in any number of other applications Below are some of the most exciting and popular use cases likely to bring blockchain further into the world of mainstream business and finance Cross Border Payments Traditionally the transfer of value has been both expensive and slow and especially for payments taking place across international borders One reason is when multiple currencies are involved the transfer process typically requires multiple banks in multiple locations before the intended recipient can actually collect his or her money There are existing services to help facilitate this process in a faster way but these tend to be quite expensive 1 Blockchain technology has the potential to provide a much faster and cheaper alternative to traditional cross border payments methods Indeed while typical money remittance costs might be as high as 20% of the transfer amount blockchain may allow for costs as low as 2% as well as guaranteed and real time transaction processing speeds There are hurdles to be passed including regulation of cryptocurrencies in different parts of the world and security concerns However this is one of the most promising and talked about areas of blockchain technology application Smart Contracts Smart contracts are often seen as a highly powerful application of blockchain technology These contracts are actually computer programs that can oversee all aspects of an agreement from facilitation to execution When conditions are met smart contracts can be entirely self executing and self enforcing For advocates of smart contracts these tools provide a more secure more automated alternative to traditional contract law as well as an application that is faster and cheaper than traditional methods The potential applications of smart contract technology are essentially limitless and could extend to almost any field of business in which contract law would normally apply Of course while highly touted smart contracts are not a magical substitute for old fashioned diligence In fact the case of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a cautionary tale and a warning to investors to not assume that smart contracts are any better than the information and organization that a user puts into them Nonetheless smart contracts remain one of the most exciting ways that blockchain technology has already extended beyond the cryptocurrency space and into the broader business world 12 \x0cIdentity Management One of the most problematic results of the internet age has been identity security As diligent as many individuals and organizations are in maintaining their online identities and securing private information there are always nefarious actors looking to steal and profit off of these digital items Blockchain technology has already demonstrated the potential for transforming the way that online identity management takes place Blockchain offers a tremendous level of security thanks to independent verification processes that take place throughout member computers on a blockchain network In digital currency cases this verification is used to approve transactions before they are added to the chain This mechanism could just as easily be applied to other types of verification procedures including identity verification and many other applications as well At this point blockchain is a technology with an exceptionally broad set of potential uses Although blockchain is most famous for its connections to the blossoming cryptocurrency world several other applications have already been explored Perhaps even more exciting though is that new ways of utilizing blockchain emerge every day As such whether you are directly involved in the digital currency space or not it s essential to develop an understanding of blockchain and how it may be used to transform the business and investment worlds Global Markets Respond to Blockchain Global financial markets today are being forced to respond to the impact made by the $200B crypto market A World Economic Forum survey suggested that 10 percent of global GDP will be stored on blockchain by 2027 Multiple governments have published reports on the potential implications of the blockchain and the past two years alone have seen more than half a million new publications on and 3 7 million Google search results for blockchain 2 Blockchain technology holds the promise of revolutionizing many of the transaction based processes that underwrite much of the global economy IDC has estimated that global spending on blockchain solutions will reach a total of $9 2 billion by 2021 This shift beckons the need for a new vehicle for crypto collaboration as blockchain integration is the next stage of the crypto market 13 \x0cDespite the hype blockchain is still an immature technology with a market that is still rudimentary and a recipe for success has not yet emerged Many companies will not see a return on their investments due to unstructured experimentation of blockchain solutions without strategic evaluation of the value at stake or the feasibility of capturing it With this in mind companies from a variety of industries need to determine if there is strategic value in blockchain that justifies major investments 2 6 Opennity Brings Blockchain to Traditional Industries Traditional industries are trying to apply blockchain technology to improve their business performance Opennity will aid in bringing the resources necessary for these industries to implement blockchain technology Characteristics of blockchain such as transparency legitimacy tokenomics traceability of transactions smart contracts bypassing agencies and third parties and automation of transactions can help different industries improve Banking The blockchain would be a more secure way to store banking records It is also a faster and cheaper way of transferring money through the decentralization provided by blockchain Bitcoin transactions can take 30 minutes or up to 16 hours (in extreme cases) to settle Which is still not perfect but it represents a leg up from the average 3 day processing time for bank transfers There s minimal risk of a run on a blockchain system or a collapse as there s no central vault With blockchain it would be as though each person s money has its own private vault in which no one else can access Security The whole basis of blockchain is to create decentralized and ultimately secure ways of storing verifying and encrypting data naturally security is going to feel the force of this technology Decentralized data storage in the cloud eliminates many of the problems of data hacks that many businesses of any kind are vulnerable to Advanced cryptography based on blockchain technologies can create virtually unhackable data encryption Government Aside from voting systems blockchain technologies could be used to help reduce and eliminate bureaucratic red tape and corruption in government agencies For example welfare disability veterans and unemployment benefits could be more easily verified and distributed 14 \x0celiminating fraud and waste Smart contracts could ensure that government funds are only released when certain conditions are met whether to contractors or foreign governments in the form of aid And security efficiency and transparency in government functions could be increased across the board Healthcare Some of the biggest challenges in healthcare could be solved by a blockchain system allowing all doctors and healthcare providers to access your health records securely and easily Unlike the days of paper records or even today when digital health records can be\xe2\x80\x94 created and stored in countless different systems your health records could be singular complete and travel with you from birth to death regardless of how many times you change doctors or insurance systems Additionally your health information could be accessed immediately at any time potentially offering doctors lifesaving information in an emergency This demand for new processes has created room for new legitimate platforms and service providers to enter the space With Opennity\xe2\x80\x99s strong network and connections in blockchain and traditional finance fields it will build a trustworthy marketplace for traditional industries to source reliable service providers media to promote quality services token incentives for the community and users to contribute to our ecosystem 15 \x0c3 Expansion Strategy 3 1 Global Market The platform will first target Asia including regions such as Japan Taiwan Korea and Southeast Asia Further expansion will be into the United States and Europe The reasons for picking these regions in Asia first are due to two factors First being that Opennity has a great network of connections through its team and advisors in these regions Second there is a lack of high quality players providing similar services in these regions A lot of companies in these regions are seeking to improve their business performance through the application of blockchain and are ready to learn more about the tech and tokenomics Businesses also looking to supply the demand of the Asian crypto economy In Hong Kong and other areas of Asia Pacific for example the average consumer is willing to spend $10 000 to $100 000 Whereas in the U S the average consumer is only willing to invest $1 000 in crypto (source) Compared to adoption rates in the United States it is calculated that Asian customer adoption rates are almost tenfold As blockchain technology reaches the brink of mainstream integration Asian markets will continue to lead the pack in actualizing once unattainable blockchain concepts 3 3 2 Revenue Model l l l Job Postings n When companies list a job posting they will need to pay a fee Referral Fee n Each referral transaction will occur a 5% fee Advertising n Service Providers and businesses can purchase banner ads displayed on the platform 16 \x0c4 Opennity Token The Opennity token is to replace a fiat based system The token will be the sole currency in which any referral transaction is done Companies will each pay with Opennity tokens for each referral that successfully leads to a match and the referrer will earn tokens 4 1 Token Issuing The token issuing entity is a Cayman Islands based company operating under the laws of the Cayman Islands Token Distribution With the hard cap set at 1 billion tokens it will be broken down as follows Token type ERC20 Token Total Token Supply 1 billion Token distribution 30% community reward 30% strategic partnership 40% reserve retained by Opennity Token (OPNN) price at issue $0 03 USD Note There is no plan for an Initial Coin Offering 4 2 Tokenomics With 40% of the 1 billion tokens to be held by the company there will be approximately 600m in circulation Approximately 50% of the tokens in circulation are eventually estimated to be held by the referees Referrers will hold only around 10% given that many of them will cash out their tokens once they are able to The remainder are assumed to be split fairly equally between vendors offering services for OPNN and held in the exchange for purchases 17 \x0c4 3 Token Revenue The core tokenomics are rather straightforward The users making the referrals earn Opennity tokens (OPNN) while those benefiting from the referrals \xe2\x80\x93 earn OPNN In the diagram below the flow of OPNN around the system is shown Starting from the Opennity Platform the people acquiring OPNN are the people benefiting from the OPNN or the \xe2\x80\x98referrees\xe2\x80\x99 who acquire the OPNN from the Opennity platform The platform allows them to purchase OPNN by either crypto and fiat currency The users that do the work the \xe2\x80\x98referrers\xe2\x80\x99 take OPNN out of the system Each time a successful transaction is made a referrer earns some OPNN as does Opennity Opennity\xe2\x80\x99s OPNN is fed back into the platform There is also a network of service providers selling services on the platform The service providers accept OPNN from both referees and referrers Service providers pay Opennity OPNN for the right to be on the system as well as some commission with each transaction 18 \x0c4 4 Token Usage \xe2\x80\x93 Utility For Service Providers l l l Advertising Service providers can use tokens in order to purchase advertising space on the platform in the form of banner ads Tokens can also be used to purchase a higher ad rank when being listed on the platform Media Promotion Tokens can be used to purchase different forms of media promotions with Opennity\xe2\x80\x99s media partners Promotions can be in the form of articles videos and even live meetup events Build Community Using tokens to start groups and building of communities in different regions of the world For Community l l Rating Service Providers Users can use tokens to review service providers they would recommend A rating system will display each service provider based on the ratings they receive from the community with the highest rated service providers appearing first Acquisition of services Tokens are used to create listings for types of services being sought after For Companies l l Listing the Job Offering When companies are trying to employ a blockchain professional they can use the tokens to list the job vacancy in Opennity with a smart contract The tokens can be used as the reward given to referrers for helping find candidates Getting Service Providers If there is any tasks about blockchain development marketing and community building etc the companies can use the tokens to seek any service providers 19 \x0cAcquisition of Token l l For Community Service provider referral If the two parties engage in a business transaction from a referral the referrer earns tokens Categories of referrals 1 Employment 2 Freelance Opportunities 3 Business development 4 Community building Contribute reports about service providers Anyone in the community that has knowledge of a specific service provider can contribute their knowledge in order to receive tokens Published reports on service providers that provide statistics on the performance of the service providers will be verified and result in tokens upon being published 20 \x0c5 Platform Features Search and Rating System Users can filter through top tier service providers and by category This allows users to track and compare such service providers \xe2\x80\x94 an ability which does not currently exist in the crypto space and is much needed to ensure a functional future for blockchain integration Information Database of Service Providers Similar to how some fiat investment platforms operate users can use our platform to set up and personalize service provider profiles by linking their accounts to the platform\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio management system Users will have a dashboard where they can easily view their portfolios and upload documents to a secure storage area based on their interests activity and longand short term financial goals News and Media Sharing of most important news in the market connecting readers to the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors Resources to promote projects in the blockchain ecosystem Community An active mix of individuals in the blockchain space wanting to further the development and integration of blockchain technology and service providers Through different interactions such as rating referrals and reviews the platform allows for them to create a community economy through verified contributions Talent and Service Providers from different blockchain fields including l l l l l l l l Community Building Exchanges PR / Marketing Technology / Blockchain Tech Audit Advisory Legal Human Resources 21 \x0c5 1 Smart Contract OPNN is an Ethereum token It complies with and extends ERC 20 a de facto standard and common token API The Opennity Smart Contract guarantees Transparency Balance It is public information on the number of tokens held by any user Transfers All information on transfers is public and can be traced back in time Token Supply Single issuance Tokens are issued only once at the time of deployment Supply The token supply is set at the time of deployment Ownership Uniqueness Each token belongs to one user owner There are no shared tokens Contract Management Replacement The contract owner can waive the ownership in favor of any other Ethereum user or contract Miscellaneous Recovery Any call to the contract which results in an error does not change the users\xe2\x80\x99 tokens or Ether balance except for the gas spent on the transaction Safe Approval The token contract supports two approve () functions a 2 parameter approve() (the ERC 20 standard) and a 3 parameter approve () which guarantees that spender gets new allowance only if current allowance equals presumed allowance It is recommended to use the 3 parameter approve for all approve () calls taking the presumed allowance as the second input Opennity Contract The community at large can participate or audit all Opennity smart contracts on Github 5 2 Technology In Opennity hub we adopt the MAM and IOTA technology to record the member\xe2\x80\x99s information such as rating score and comments Unlike other centralized reviewing 22 \x0csystem where the system owner can manipulate from behind the scenes In IOTA technology it\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized and user can fully trust our result by tracing the record in the DAG IOTA is a distributed ledger technology that allows computers in an IOTA network to transfer immutable data and value among each other IOTA aims to tackle Blockchain s main problems such as \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction rates One of the biggest issues with the blockchain as originally developed for Bitcoin is its slow transaction times IOTA employs a system wherein the transaction rates increase dramatically as more customers begin to use its native platform Not only that through the use of an innovative consensus protocol IOTA is able to provide its customers with shorter confirmation times \xe2\x80\xa2 Micro payments When using blockchain based payment portals the transaction fees are usually set by the sender/initiator of the transaction It is unfeasible to process smaller payments amounts One of the biggest advantages of IOTA user don\xe2\x80\x99t need to pay any transaction fees with small payments by approving previous two transaction records \xe2\x80\xa2 Scalability IOTA uses a processing module that becomes faster as its number of subscribers and transactions increase It is also worth mentioning that when using IOTA the time between placing a transaction and its validation starts to become zero as soon as a certain data size is achieved IOTA addresses these issues and offers an entirely new technology Tangle which is still decentralized but can process an infinite amount of transactions as well Tangle retains the blockchain features of the distributed ledger and secure transactions by the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) DAG enables various features like zero cost transactions high scalability or offline transactions that blockchain cannot do IOTA whose goal is to become the very fundamental layer of such society is the most provident project of the time that challenges looming paradigm shift And MAM Masked Authenticated Message a genius protocol described by Paul Handy is one 23 \x0cof IOTA\xe2\x80\x99s most potent IXI Modules And MAM is its core driving force which distinguishes IOTA from other distributed ledger by making data flow and transactions much cheaper more secure and ubiquitous Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is a second layer data communication protocol which adds functionality to emit and access an encrypted data stream like RSS over the Tangle (IOTA\xe2\x80\x99s distributed ledger) regardless of the size or cost of device Masked Authenticated Messaging means The message is encrypted (Masked) The message is confirmed to be coming from the device (Authenticated) A continuous message stream is created on the Tangle and will carry on until the device stop publishing the data (Messaging) Masked Authenticated Messaging is a module build on top of IOTA that makes it possible to send messages fully encrypted from authenticated parties with Merkle tree based signature scheme The root of the Merkle tree is used as the ID of the channel Knowing this root you can decrypt the message and validate its signature 24 \x0c6 UNCERTAINTY PROVISIONS The Opennity Smart Contract does not guarantee the following 1 User validity Details an Ethereum address with positive token balance may not correspond to any actual user or a private key as it can be a result of a mistake Tokens transferred to such users will likely be lost 2 Zero Ether balance Details the contract prohibits most but not all means by which Ether could be sent to it by users who are not contract owners 3 Complete registry Details The contract does not provide a list of all token holders However it is guaranteed that every token holder is either the contract creator or a token recipient in the Transfer () event The list of token holders can be obtained by checking all these events or by exploring the contract storage using blockchain explorers 25 \x0c7 Roadmap 2019 Q1 User Registration Platform Testing Website Launch 2019 Q2
