 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 INTRODUCTION
 Derivatives trading is the largest market in the world at an estimated 1 2 quadrillion dollars1 with a current growth rate of 30% per year2 The cryptocurrency market is growing at an even faster rate and is eager for a full derivatives ecosystem that exists within the traditional financial systems Current growth in centralized cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges which is at $1 billion daily notional value3 indicates massive potential for the industry 
 CHALLENGES
 Efforts to establish markets for leveraged cryptocurrency derivatives have focused on centralized exchanges that traders must trust as the custodians of their funds In an environment where even the biggest (Bitfinex) and most security conscious (Shapeshift) exchanges experience loss of funds to hacking a focus on security using blockchain and cryptography becomes imperative 
 While decentralized exchanges are nothing new most of them offer poor user experience low liquidity and scant traction Most of these systems subsequently fail to be adopted at scale 
 SOLUTION
 Leverj decentralizes the most security critical features of derivatives trading by implementing them in smart contracts Leverj focuses on derivatives trading and the supporting ecosystem We plan to build an ecosystem of features that will enable institutions to move into the cryptocurrency world 
 PROBLEM
 Traditional finance is bogged down by heavy regulation excessive cost and censorship among other issues The cryptocurrency world has inherited some of these failings and added a few of its own including counterparty risk account security identity protection exchange centralization and exchange instability Taken together these points of friction make it inefficient and suboptimal 
 OPPORTUNITY
 Blockchain based financial systems challenge the status quo by providing censorship resistance non repudiation counterparty risk reduction and many other desirable properties to financial contracts Cryptography and game theory offer an opportunity to build regulatory benefits into blockchain products 
 A trading system has efficiency and risk management requirements that make it usable and practical however these requirements are currently only satisfied in centralized systems Current decentralized exchanges are unsuitable for trading and barely acceptable for hedging risk Leverj aims to satisfy the requirements for practical trading in a decentralized system by implementing a distributed exchange protocol executing off chain yet verifiable on chain By supporting derivatives contracts classical hedging strategies can be combined with financial applications on Ethereum The degree of centralization may be tunable without compromise of the distributed nature of the protocol This leaves room to explore decentralized variants of initially centralized algorithms both of which remain distributed

 2 THE LEVERJ PROTOCOL
 Leverj consists of on chain Custody and Staking
 contracts along with an off chain centralized order
 book and matching engine The exchange provides
 various aspects of the trading experience the
 user interacts with such as a UI API integration
 with other platform services etc 
 SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS
 Custody contract implements the non custodial
 model of Leverj Its purpose is to hold funds and
 ensure that only the owner can deposit or withdraw
 from it When a user deposits into the smart
 contract (1) Custody allocates any tokens or ether
 received against the sending address and enables
 withdrawal only up to the balance an account holds 
 This ensures that its not possible for any malicious
 actor to take control of all the funds 
 ORDER BOOK
 AND MATCHING ENGINE
 Order book and matching are centralized and are
 off chain The order cancel match critical path

 is optimized for speed and are designed to not
 depend on the blockchain 
 The user signs orders with their private key and sends
 orders to the exchange(2) This ensures that the key
 that controls the account is the same key that authorized
 the order or other operation The updated
 order book is streamed to all users off chain like any
 other centralized order book As orders are matched 
 executions are also streamed to all users Executions
 are periodically synced(3) to the blockchain The
 Custody smart contract verifies the integrity of the
 fills and updates user balances(4) 
 To ensure any pending executions are synced and
 balances are updated withdrawals are gated by
 the Exchange The user submits a signed request
 to the exchange which ensures there are no open
 orders or unsynced transactions and submits the
 request to the Custody contract However after
 10 000 blocks of inactivity the user can withdraw
 directly(5) from the Custody contract even without
 exchange involvement

 STAKING
 Custody contract accumulates fees and sends it to
 the Staking contract The staking contract periodically
 calculates the allocation for everyone based on
 the amount and duration of the stake according to
 the staking formula Staking generates new tokens
 as needed Fees paid in ether are sent to the owner
 of the staking contract (Leverj) and the appropriate
 amount of FEE is generated and distributed 
 ATTACK VECTORS
 There are two main kinds of attack on custodial
 models The first is the heist where a significant
 portion of the funds is taken at once The attacker
 does not expect to be able to repeat the attack
 and would generally not care if the theft is detected
 immediately The second is skimming where small
 amounts of funds are taken repeatedly over a longer
 duration The attacker generally would like to
 go undetected since repeating the attack as many
 times as possible is key to a big payout Our model
 aims to provably prevent heists and prevent or detect
 most types of skimming using fraud proofs 
 MALICIOUS USER
 Since the only avenue to extract assets is via a user
 account a compromised exchange would have to
 set up a malicious user and collaborate with it to
 move all assets into that user by supplying data in a
 way to overcome the checks of the custody contract 
 Since all executions need signatures from users and
 executions without assets backing them would be
 rejected the exchange would have to rearrange existing
 legitimate orders to favor the malicious user 
 These can only occur in small pieces and are skimming
 attacks 
 PROTOCOL
 Instead of matching peer to peer users can submit
 their orders to one or more matching entities (exchanges) 
 which can do the matching and submit
 PREVENTING HEISTS fills to the smart contract 
 For heists to be possible the possibility for one person
 to control all coins in custody must be possible 
 Segregated accounts that only enable the depositor
 to withdraw only their own balance eliminate this
 possibility since the attacker would now need the
 keys of most users of the platform Ensuring that
 the user‚Äôs keys are never sent across the network
 is also a fundamental requirement for this to work 
 Therefore all authentication must be using public/
 private keys only Password or other shared secrets
 should never be used 
 TRADING SETTLEMENTS
 Movement of assets between users as part of
 trade settlement requires that both users sign the
 amounts and price they are ready to exchange Although
 the exchange performs the match the custody
 contract transfers assets after verifying user
 signatures and integrity of all changes Executions
 need to meet specifications set by both users according
 to the signatures from their private key for
 the smart contract to move assets among users

 FEE tokens as needed 
 PROTOCOL SECURITY
 The exchange cannot synthesize or alter orders with
 the signature of a legitimate user and the protocol
 constraints prevent catastrophic theft A compromised
 exchange however may collude with and favor
 a malicious user using a variety of skim attacks 
 To favor a colluding user the exchange would need
 signed orders from victim users which would be
 filled at an adverse price Since the exchange cannot
 synthesize or alter orders it may try to manipulate
 legitimate orders to use them for victimization 
 Note that even a coarse expiry time on the orders
 greatly reduces the impact and detection burden of
 the attack Note that this is not a comprehensive list
 of all possible attacks but a framework to quickly
 address them by quickly adding fraud proofs when
 a new defect is discovered 
 REPLAY ATTACK
 A simple way to synthesize a victim order is to simply
 remember a past order and use it when the
 price is adverse for the victim The exchange simply
 duplicates an order and fills it at a price favoring a
 colluding user Custodian contract prevents replay
 attacks by the tracking order ids of all matched orders
 and rejecting duplicates 
 CANCELLED ORDER ATTACK
 A variant of the above is when the exchange simply
 fills an order that was cancelled Storing cancelled
 order ids in the smart contract is impractical since
 cancels are numerous and cancellation need to be
 fast However proof of cancellation (exchange signature
 on cancel request) can be used as a fraudproof
 that can be submitted to the Custodian The
 custodian can verify that a cancelled order has been
 filled and halt the exchange 
 PRICE TIME PRIORITY
 VIOLATION ATTACK
 Even non cancelled orders can be used for attacks
 by simply withholding them from the order book
 and waiting for an adverse price movement and
 matching with a colluding user Such violations
 can be detected by the user using price time fraud
 proof an execution exists for an order with a better
 price but later timestamp than the victim order 
 NON ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ATTACK
 An exchange may refuse to accept legitimate orders
 from a user due to operational policies such
 as rate limiting or network issues these do not
 produce fraud proofs In contrast a non acknowledgement
 attack occurs when the exchange takes
 a user‚Äôs signed order and instead of replying with its
 own signature saves the submitted order for skimming 
 It then waits for the price to move and then
 matches it at an unfavorable price siphoning profit
 LEVERJ IO

 to a colluding user If this happens a user can detect
 immediately when he sees one of his unacknowledged
 orders filled The fraud proof for this is the
 same as the price time fraud proof 
 SUPPRESSED EXECUTIONS ATTACK
 While executions cannot be synthesized or duplicated 
 they can certainly be suppressed enabling
 a compromised exchange to simply suppress losing
 trades of a colluding user from being synced to
 the smart contract and withdrawing funds while
 the smart contract is still in the stale state This is a
 variant of TOCTOU attack4 Users who observe withdrawals
 being processed while the Custodian is in a
 stale state can submit a fraud proof preventing the
 attacker from withdrawing 
 MITIGATION OF SKIM ATTACKS
 The exchange would need to sync executions to the
 smart contract containing a fraudulent execution
 before the assets can be withdrawn The syncing
 will cause anyone monitoring the executions to detect
 the anomaly instantly and submit fraud proofs
 as described below preventing the attacker from
 stealing funds 
 A compromised exchange can rearrange orders
 that flow into and executions that flow out of the
 matching engine There are four possible rearrangements 
 suppress pass faithfully duplicate and reorder
 (i e pass after a delay)
 There are two possible order operations Cancel and
 create Updates are simply cancel and create

 Faithful passes are not attacks so we have the following attack matrix

 All these attacks are described above and have
 fraud proofs that can be submitted to the Custodian
 contract to disincentivize skimming attacks

 PRICE TIME PRIORITY
 For a compromised exchange to skim from the user 
 it would need to violate price time priority This can
 be detected in most cases 
 Consider the order book at time t0 and t1 Prices
 above spread are asks ones below are bids Price
 moves adversely to bid o1 An adverse move would
 have to put an ask below the victim bid for skimming
 to be profitable 
 t0 t1
 302
 301
 300 300
 (spread) 299
 298(o1) 298(o2)
 297 297(o3)
 296 (spread)
 295
 294
 293
 The exchange holds victim bid order o1 at 298 and
 waits for an adverse price move It then sells into
 the victim‚Äôs bid with its own ask o2 at 298 and buys
 from a bystander ask o3 at 297 Since the fraudulent
 order at 298 cannot be trusted detection of fraud
 should depend purely on the victim and the bystander
 orders 
 In general order time agreed between the exchange and
 non compromised user using signatures can be accepted
 by the smart contract to be sufficient for verification 
 In most cases when o1 is withheld for skimming the
 market moving adversely would cause an execution
 at a better price (<= o1 price) but with worse order
 time (>o1 time) enabling us to detect the violation 
 The time for an execution is effectively the time of
 the taker order Therefore price time priority has
 been violated if 
 1 There is an execution where the maker order o3‚Äôs
 time is worse than the victim‚Äôs order o1‚Äôs time
 2 o3 price is better than o1 price
 Detection for victim bids 
 for all executions Ei after o1 time
 Let oi = Ei maker
 isViolation = oi time > o1 time && oi price <= o1 price
 To prevent detection the exchange would have to
 prevent any ask hitting the price of the victim order 
 which would effectively halt normal trading 
 LIMITATIONS
 In a highly illiquid market there are many corner
 cases that the above may not catch For example 
 may be no market action for a long time followed
 by a sudden move (price gap) which can be exploited
 by a compromised exchange This is currently
 not detectable 
 MARKET ORDERS AND
 FRONT RUNNING
 Market orders skip ahead of the price time priority
 queue and front running market orders cannot be
 detected using the check above 
 Market orders are not currently part of the protocol 
 We hope to extend market order fraud proofs or
 go fully on chain once plasma or other high speed
 chain is operational

 SUBMISSION OF FRAUD PROOFS
 A malicious actor would need to withdraw their
 funds after a fraudulent action As long as there is a
 sufficient window of time to detect and submit fraud
 proofs the smart contract can prevent the withdrawal
 or disable further action on the Custodian Other
 users can detect the state change and withdraw
 their assets at their convenience We propose a waiting
 period for every user after a withdrawal request 
 sufficient enough for any fraud proofs to be submitted 
 The exchange and smart contract would not accept
 any transactions for a user until their withdrawal
 is processed This slight inconvenience is a justifiable
 tradeoff for the added safety On the verification of
 a fraud proof the exchange would halt The perpetrator‚Äôs
 balance could be awarded to the fraud proof
 submitter making compliance a form of mining 
 All attacks can be detected by the victim as soon as
 they occur and a fraud proof can be submitted to the
 smart contract which can be used to take corrective
 action such as disabling the exchange and allowing
 all users to withdraw their funds A small mandatory
 delay before withdrawal ensures there is sufficient
 time to submit fraud proofs before a malicious user
 can siphon money from the contract 
 COMPARISON TO OTHER DEX
 Leverage and Derivatives Most DEX are not focused
 on risk management and derivatives offerings 
 We hope to be the first exchange that offers
 derivatives with secure custody 
 High Speed Blockchain not involved in the critical
 create cancel execute path making Leverj highly
 competitive against other DEX in terms of speed 
 Congestion insensitive Leverj can postpone sync
 to blockchain during times of blockchain congestion 
 while enabling trading to proceed only impacting
 withdrawals On chain matching DEX cannot
 degrade gracefully during network congestion 
 Secure against on chain attacks There are a variety
 of attacks possible against pure peer to peer exchanges 
 For example a rouge taker can soak up all
 bids from makers and not submit trades Congestion
 and arbitrage attacks are also possible when
 market is moving fast 
 Low cost 98% of orders are cancelled in developed
 markets By not requiring storage costs for cancelled
 orders Leverj is nearly 2 orders of magnitude
 cheaper than nearly every other DEX Leverj can
 also hold off syncing to chain when during times of
 blockchain congestion without impacting trading 
 Only withdrawals are impacted This kind of graceful
 degradation cannot be matched by most DEX

 3 DERIVATIVES ON LEVERJ
 NON CUSTODIAL DERIVATIVES
 The major distinguishing requirement of leveraged
 exchanges over spot exchanges is risk management 
 Since users who owe money can simply walk away
 in a decentralized environment we need to ensure
 that no account goes into negative balance 
 In the traditional exchanges risk is managed by continuous
 monitoring of user balances and closing out
 positions forcibly when there is a risk of insolvency 
 This process is expensive and not reliable Clearing
 members are bound by legal obligations to make
 up for any shortfall of their member accounts 
 Replacing monitoring and ad hoc forcible closures
 with mandatory stop orders enables us to manage
 risk without a central exchange user The entire risk
 system is beyond the scope of this document but
 relies on the following 
 1 Atomic stops Stop orders that are guaranteed to fill
 within a max slippage These enable prevention of
 accounts going into negative balance 
 2 Auto Deleveraging Ensures integrity of system and
 no positions are dangling 
 To implement the above in a manner that makes
 trading enjoyable requires careful crafting of appropriate
 leverage offered reference index construction
 and handling of corner cases 
 DERIVATIVES OFFERINGS
 Our primary product offering will be ETH/USD inverse
 contracts based off a median index created
 from the highest volume spot exchanges This will
 enable hedging Ether against fiat using only Ether 
 We can also offer a variety of products denominated
 in ether for which a reliable reference index can be
 constructed 
 ERC20 spot and derivatives on highly liquid tokens
 will also be offered including options and futures including
 on Token index prices 
 4 THE LEVERJ (LEV) TOKEN
 BI LEVEL TOKENS VS REVENUE SHARING
 Most revenue sharing systems have the following challenges 
 1 Building liquidity is difficult 
 2 Attracting other service providers to grow a rich ecosystem is extremely challenging without liquidity 
 The two level Leverj token system has been carefully crafted using economics and game theory to incentivize liquidity and quickly grow a rich ecosystem 
 USER PERSPECTIVE
 From the user‚Äôs point of view bi level tokens have the following advantages 
 1 The second level token holds fees stable in ETH terms to ameliorate cryptocurrency fl uctuations For example when the ETH exchange rate is very high in USD terms it makes sense to sell your full ETH position instead of using part of it to pay fees 
 2 The ability to sell excess capacity when trading activity
 LEV AND FEE TOKENS
 The Leverj DApp is designed with a bi level token structure a two level tokens The primary token is of fixed supply and represents a license to transact on LEV platform proportional to the percentage ownership of the token supply The secondary token FEE is the accounting mechanism to ensure the rights of LEV can be exercised fully in a decentralized manner 
 LEVERJ IO
 11
 0 0001 ETH
 LEV is an ERC20 token that represents the participation to trade on Leverj LEV is not a requirement to trade on Leverj and a trader can choose to simply pay fees in ether However regular traders will benefit from holding and staking LEV since its economically attractive to do so is low This allows the trader to sell FEE tokens generated when for example the trader is on vacation without giving up possession of LEV tokens This is equivalent to a temporary transfer of the right to use LEV Indeed some investors may have a strategy of simply selling generated FEE as a steady source of income 
 SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE
 From a systemic point of view two level tokens have enormous positive consequences 
 1 The accumulation of FEE tokens over time will increase trading pressure This is analogous to typically higher volume on no fee exchanges simply because more trading strategies are profi table This increased trading pressure increases volume and liquidity greatly enabling tight spreads and predictable fi lls without slippage and helps facilitate generally healthy markets 
 2 A secondary effect of FEE accumulation is that it enables a rich ecosystem with many other participants The ability to pay for additional services from auto generated FEE tokens means that traders are more likely to purchase and providers more likely

 LEVERJ IO
 LEV TOKEN
 The token sold during the token launch is known as the Leverj LEV token This token is created only on the ICO issuance and it‚Äôs supply is permanently fixed 
 FEE TOKEN GENERATION
 LEV tokens may be used to generate FEE tokens LEV holders will not automatically generate fee however token holders can ‚Äúlock‚Äù their tokens into a smart contract which applies the user selected lock duration to a formula designed to regulate the total supply of FEE tokens Longer lock periods generate larger amount of FEE tokens 
 Once users execute the contract depending on how much trading activity there is on the platform ‚Äî as well as the FEE market mechanics ‚Äî they will receive a proportionate amount of FEE 
 Once the lock duration expires the locked LEV ceases to generate FEE and becomes freely transferable by the holder once again There is no limit (other than duration) to how many times LEV tokens may be used to generate FEE 
 GAME THEORY
 The main goal is to create a functioning market for FEE in ETH (Ethereum) so that LEV holders have access to a liquid market for their disbursements and Leverj platform users can get a discount on the fees they would otherwise pay in ETH Connecting these two major users in the Leverj ecosystem will help foster an economy within the community that pairs groups with overlapping interests FEE will be maintained as a market that maximizes utility for the stakeholders 
 FEE TOKEN GENERATION
 LEV tokens may be used to generate FEE tokens LEV holders will not automatically generate fee however token holders can ‚Äúlock‚Äù their tokens into a smart contract which applies the user selected lock duration to a formula designed to regulate the total supply of FEE tokens Longer lock periods generate larger amount of FEE tokens 
 Once users execute the contract depending on how much trading activity there is on the platform ‚Äî as well as the FEE market mechanics ‚Äî they will receive a proportionate amount of FEE 
 Once the lock duration expires the locked LEV ceases to generate FEE and becomes freely transferable by the holder once again There is no limit (other
 to supply services to the system High liquidity and a rich ecosystem are value multipliers and we believe the overall system would be worth much more than a simple revenue sharing/fee rebate system 
 13
 LEVERJ IO
 ECONOMICS
 Market forces are at work in the pricing of any asset and the FEE token is no exception An increase in supply ceteris paribus will increase the quantity provided by the market and lower the price Therefore an unexpected supply increase will adjust the price downward whereas an unexpected demand increase will adjust the price upward 
 Using a diverse set of tools to influence the FEE demand and supply mechanisms both directly and indirectly the system will target a FEE price that is approximately equal to the coupon value for covering Leverj exchange fees 
 DEMAND PRESSURE
 When the economic activity on the platform grows there is likely to be demand pressure on FEE This pressure will not only affect LEV holders who might wish to generate additional FEE there may also be significant secondary market demand that drives the price significantly above the targeted coupon rate 
 To counteract this effect more FEE is produced when fees are paid in ETH and distributed to LEV holders easing the demand pressure and bringing
 SUPPLY PRESSURE
 The opposite situation can also occur an imbalance arises from too much FEE supply resulting in a price decline In response to this the self regulating system for FEE production will adjust such that the FEE supply is slowed to bring the price back up 
 PRICE STABILIZATION MECHANISMS
 The price of FEE will be managed by a series of Price Stabilization Mechanisms (PSMs) 
 SYSTEMIC PSMS
 The primary systemic PSMs are parameterized by platform activity and supply generated by the same platform activity 
 The most important source of demand for FEE tokens will be the users who are purchasing FEE to pay the Leverj trade fees which are denominated in Ether The platform will accept FEE and it will be tradable in a FEE/ETH order book 
 To give a simple example if an individual is going to make a trade worth 100 ETH and the fee charged is 1% (in practice it will be much less than this) then the user needs to pay 1 ETH or 10 000 FEE (1 FEE = 0 0001 ETH) Assume that the price
 than duration) to how many times LEV tokens may be used to generate FEE the market back into equilibrium 
 LEVERJ IO
 14
 currently trading at 0 00008 in the FEE/ETH order book meaning it is 20% cheaper to pay your trading fees in FEE than ETH The trader on Leverj can merely check a box preferring to pay for fees in FEE token instead of ETH and platform will automatically buy 10 000 FEE from the market at 0 00008 (for 0 8 ETH) and cover the 1 ETH fees saving 0 2 ETH in the process 
 In this model if the FEE/ETH book is trading above 0 0001 ETH (at say 0 00012 ETH) due to excessive speculative demand then the platform demand will dry up and LEV holders who receive FEE will be able to get above par returns on the FEE they sell into the market for ETH 
 On the supply side when FEE is generated it is done so based on a formula that attempts to target FEE price to be near 0 0001 ETH Thus LEV holders will be able to receive FEE and use it to pay for trading activity on Leverj save it for future trading activity or sell for ETH immediately Our primary concern is that FEE retain proper demand and a reasonable price should LEV holders choose to sell The risk of the FEE price being abnormally low out weighs the risk of it being abnormally high 
 Thus if the price becomes low based on a criteria we make open source it will trigger a mass staking by the team‚Äôs LEV This will mean less FEE distributes to LEV holders who are selling large amounts in the FEE market This will help reduce the supply pressure while the demand remains the same guiding prices closer to the par value 
 LEV AND FEE TOKENS
 Leverj is designed around a bi level token structure The primary token (LEV) is of fixed supply and represents a license to transact on the Leverj platform proportional to the total token supply The secondary token FEE is the accounting mechanism to ensure the rights of LEV can be exercised fully in a decentralized manner 
 STAKING
 Fair distribution of FEE tokens is ensured by staking LEV tokens Users who stake for longer durations get more FEE tokens This ensures that users committed to trading on the platform can be assured that they can exercise their license compared to users who are holding LEV simply for speculation 
 Leverj uses economic pressure instead of a mathematical model to compute the proper amount of FEE required to be in circulation This is because a mathematical model will always have elaborate that no model can perfectly account for An economic pressure relieves us of the need for modeling and we simply use actual demand pressure which can be reduced to simple computation 
 In an equilibrium where the volume traded on the exchange does not change there is sufficient FEE tokens that circulate among market participants enabling trading without paying fees to the exchange This is the ideal execution of LEV as license to trade on the platform and FEE as its accounting mechanism 
 When the volume falls excess FEE tokens may be destroyed (or simply stored) and users can continue to trade without paying additional fees 
 When the platform is ramping up increasing volume is likely to result in a situation where there are insufficient FEE tokens to satisfy the trading volume This may give rise to a premium on FEE tokens and may result in undesirable behavior such as hoarding To prevent this fees can be paid in ether and the equivalent FEE tokens are generated and distributed to LEV stakers 
 The amount of FEE tokens charged can be lower (say 0 1 FEE) or higher (say 1 5 FEE) based on the product traded Leverj can also adjust the coupon value based on market conditions such as price of ether 
 LEVERJ IO
 STAKING CADENCE
 To simplify the UX and security of the staking contract 
 there is a fixed staking cadence which computes
 the number of tokens staked and the duration
 of the stake This enables a simple calculation
 that allocates the FEE tokens to the traders 
 EXPIRY
 At the end of the staking period all LEV are returned
 to stakers and FEE tokens proportional to
 their stake are distributed to stakers

 STAKING FORMULAS
 For single stake 
 Let L => Number of lev to be staked (passed by user)
 Let T => the expiry block number
 Let t = T current_block => number of blocks to stake
 Then Lt => Number of Lev blocks staked
 stake[user] += L
 evblocks[user] += Lt
 total_levblocks += Lt
 FEE events (periodic aggregated) could combine
 with expiry 
 Total_Fees += FEE sent for trading fees + ETH sent
 for trading fees * ETH_FEE_RATE

 If Total_Fees > FEE_supply 
 Generate (Total_Fees FEE_supply) FEE tokens
 At expiry (for all users)

 6 POST SALE CONSIDERATIONS
 TOKEN DISTRIBUTION
 The following pie chart provides the breakup of the
 tokens distribution All tokens including pre sale 
 are distributed via smart contract audited by ConsenSys 
 and managed by the independent escrow
 providers BraveNewCoin com (BNC) 
 SECONDARY SALES
 Leverj holds 30% of tokens for liquidity and operations 
 Leverj will stake most of these tokens in order
 to get FEE tokens Leverj is therefore economically
 incentivized to hold on to these tokens and has
 no plans at present to sell large portions of these
 tokens on secondary market As part of business
 development some tokens may be given to financial
 institutions as part of partnership agreements 
 incentivize advisors and new employees In such
 cases we will require lockout periods of sufficient
 length to ensure there is no major disruption in
 market value 
 In case the Leverj team chooses to sell LEV tokens
 that it holds on the secondary market in the future 
 it will sell on or around the 1st of each month an
 amount of approximately USD 100 000 worth of
 tokens For any amounts exceeding this the public
 will receive notice at least one week in advance of
 the time and amount of tokens that may be sold 
 Liquidity operations require that a portion (up to 2%
 of supply) of the tokens will be made available on
 the order book Traders can buy from or sell into the
 book and this means our share of tokens will vary
 slightly based on market activity

 Disclaimer Our project is subject to several other
 considerations that require flexibility in how we
 spend the raise For example if we get an opportunity
 to partner with a legacy financial powerhouse we
 may need to invest significant resources for speedy
 implementation We may also have opportunity to
 work with regulators in untapped crypto markets
 such as the United States that may require unforeseen
 expenditures All in all since we have a centralized
 component we have need for operational and
 strategic flexibility unlike a pure protocol project 
 Converting to Fiat Most of the raise will be kept in
 ETH and be converted to fiat as necessary There will
 be an initial conversion of up to $5M USD to bootstrap
 the project 
 7 PLATFORM FEATURES
 BASE PLATFORM
 Centralized trading platforms have inherent counterparty and custodial risk User identity transaction history and funds are all ultimately controlled by the exchange operators The exchange custody of these valuables makes an attractive target for hackers lawsuits and state actors The risks and losses inherent in centralization can be substantial1 Leverj provides decentralized identity to avoid identity leaks 
 DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY
 A third party issued identity (such as an email ad dress) puts you at the mercy of a centralized exchange s competence fairness and integrity Every identity you use can be held hostage to the interests and whims of unpredictable actors such as hackers or governments 
 A decentralized identity can be used for authentication signatures on contracts attestation of documents messaging other traders and to share media 
 DERIVATIVES OFFERINGS
 Leverj focuses on derivatives products which distinguishes it from other DEX offerings Using non custodial risk management we can offer derivatives products without requiring an exchange user to take over losing positions for liquidations ETH/USD inverse futures will be the primary offering However we can offer futures on any market with a stable well developed market We can also offer a variety of options or futures on liquid ERC20 tokens 
 HARDWARE WALLET SUPPORT
 Cryptography has made remarkable financial products possible but at the cost of an ever present risk of compromise via malware security breaches or custodial issues in regards to private keys held on computers and backend servers Hardware wallet support greatly reduces the

 19chances of malware or other security breaches stealing coins on your trading computer 
 ON CHAIN SETTLEMENT
 With an on chain exchange there are no custody settlement and manual withdrawal processing steps since closing a position results in near instant settlement Elimination of exchange custodial responsibility to the exchange has the pleasant side effect of not requiring the exchange to perform any actions in order for you to access your profits We eliminate waiting for exchange action to settle trades process expiries and refi ll hot wallets Every change in your position automatically updates your equity in real time making your funds available for withdrawal subject only to blockchain latencies

 8 ENHANCED TRADING PLATFORM
 The privacy and security benefits of decentralization and the basics of reliable stops and position management facilitate trading but fall short of that is available on legacy financial platforms The Leverj enhanced trading platform brings these features to digital currency enabling rapid growth of the Leverj platform 
 PRICE ACTION ENTRIES
 The most common trading regret is taking a position due to fear of missing out (FOMO) FOMO entries are caused by hesitation due to a less than perfect setup and subsequent late reaction once price moves with unexpected strength Habitual FOMO trading makes it impossible to build trading discipline Price Action entries free the trader from absolute price levels and allow focus to remain on unfolding market structure For example you may want to enter on the breakout of a signal bar or want stops to trail below the low of the prior bar instead of a fixed number of ticks You may want to sell on the close of a bar on the third
 TRADE REPLAY VIDEO
 The best way to improve your trading is to observe yourself trading Trade replay videos allow the trader to view how a trade was planned and executed from placing the entry order to stop management to eventual exit Video replay can be used to document your trading share with and teach other traders or simply archive your greatest trading moments Even add audio commentary and background music Your video of making a killing on the big bear move would be fantastic with Carmina Burana as soundtrack 
 SUBSCRIBE
 Another great way to learn any highly specialized skill is to be mentored by someone who excels in that field Find the most respected traders subscribe to their feed and learn from them a lot faster than you would learn by trading (and possibly losing) your own money Open up your trade videos and reports and share with the world If you are a good trader you can build a following 
 MANAGED TRADING
 Many people desire the exposure to digital currency but are too busy in their professional lives to spare their attention for full time trading Managed trading presents an attractive alternative to those who have the capital but not the skill to trade Simply ‚Äúfollow‚Äù or replicate trades of highly skilled traders automatically in exchange for a percentage of the winnings In the beginning this is likely to be a fixed percentage but as the platform evolves we expect traders to set their own rates 
 LEVERJ IO
 AUTOMATED TRADE MANAGEMENT
 The most profitable professional traders use discretionary entry and mechanical trade management This approach enables them to focus their attention on market opportunities and delegate trade management to software modules This ‚Äúfire and forget‚Äù approach eliminates an entire class of trade management errors For example an order will be placed to enter on the breakout of a signal bar if the bar closes strongly Once filled a trailing stop will tighten below every new swing point once a new high is reached Partial profits are taken on every push and the position is closed on a parabolic move All of these are orchestrated routinely once the position is open relieving the stress of trade management and enabling the trader to focus on price action and new entries push rather than hoping you guessed the exit price correctly Leverj supports price action entries that enter and exit precisely reducing unexpected losses and suboptimal exits 
 PLUGIN FRAMEWORK
 A plugin framework enables quick composition of an ideal trading environment building on the work of others Plugin your own indicators trading strategies reports or anything else that enrich your trading experience The plugin framework is a foundational aspect of the marketplace 
 ZERO KNOWLEDGE API KEYS
 A trading or reporting service needs to be authorized to perform certain operations on behalf of the user In the centralized world this is accomplished through API keys Leverj provides Zero Knowledge API keys that enable integration with vendors and partners without relying on transport and storage secrecy This enables the creation of an ecosystem of decentralized services that can build a new value network on the blockchain 
 HISTORICAL DATA REPLAY
 AND TRADING
 Institutional trading is largely algorithmic and the ability to fine tune and harden a trading system depends on reliable historical data How would a trading strategy fare during the great bull move and subsequent crash of 2013 Harden trading strategies by replaying extreme market conditions and add safeguards to ensure sustainability in adverse conditions Leverj brings the advantages enjoyed by institutional traders to crypto trading enabling re playing market data to fine tune and perfect your home grown strategies 
 MARKETPLACE
 A marketplace for decentralized trading services is essential to a rich ecosystem Instead of building your own indicators and strategies buy them from a marketplace If you have developed a great indicator list it on the marketplace and get paid in FEE tokens

 SIMULATED TRADING
 The first few months of a new trader‚Äôs performance is unlikely to be profitable In addition there is substantial risk testing out unproven ideas with real money Simulated trading enables trying out ideas and fine tuning trading strategy with real time market data while avoiding market risk Once the trading idea or setup is proven it can confidently be executed on a live account 
 ISSUES WITH DECENTRALIZED LEVERAGED TRADING
 Leveraged trading adds risk management and position management capabilities required for practical trading Adding margin to a position or re leasing margin from a winning position to open a new position are practical necessities for trading Recent attempts at decentralized leveraged trading platforms have resulted in poor user experience due to lack of attention to practical exchange operation issues Leveraged trading adds another level of complexity to decentralized trading that must be carefully designed As exchange needs to be performant in addition to secure for trading to be enjoyable in addition to enabling the basic goals of decentralization The key issues with decentralized trading are latency finality and liquidity We address these by using the blockchain sparingly and relying on ancillary technology where possible

 STOPS
 Reliable stops are the hardest feature to get perfect even for centralized exchanges When a price spike can trigger a stop but never fi ll (or fi ll it at an undesirable price) it becomes imperative to your position This induces attention fatigue and causes unforced error that reduce your profitability Professional traders simply cannot afford to trade without reliable stops since they are vital to precise risk management Leverj provides atomic stops that are guaranteed to fi ll within predictable range 
 LIQUIDATIONS
 When a trader‚Äôs position moves into a losing area beyond its allocated margin the position needs to be liquidated Leverj is able to liquidate positions without the need for a centralized exchange user to take over the position 
 POSITION MANAGEMENT
 Good position management is often the only difference between a break even trader and a profitable trader A platform that facilitates good position management practices is essential to trade effectively 
 ADD/REMOVE MARGIN
 Current decentralized leveraged systems ‚Äúlock in‚Äù a margin until the contract expires or is settled This means profits cannot be taken when available if the market reacts earlier than expected Positions cannot be saved by adding margin if a pullback is deeper than expected All in all this approach to trading is essentially a gamble on direction at a point in time A sophisticated trader requires the ability to modify the margin backing any position based on price action Indeed the freedom to take profit and allocate it to a new opportunity should be smooth and natural to ensure that the trader can take profit when price action enables it Leverj enables addition and removal of margin with an intuitive stop order inter face that allows traders to manage position margin 
 SPLIT/MERGE
 It is a good practice to take partial profit on a windfall move in the trader‚Äôs favor The ability to split a large position facilitates this Once a position is split it is possible to manage each position differently for example a tighter stop on half to protect profits and a looser stop on the remaining for longer holding periods The converse is the ability to build up a position by many small entries (such as iceberg orders) and manage them as a single position by merging them Leverj provides splitting/merging of positions giving the trader flexibility to react appropriately to the market and manage exits leverage and stops for optimal profit 
 23
 LEVERJ IO
 CROSS/FIXED
 Traders who trade long timeframes and accumulate large positions need to use all available margin (cross margin) to ensure they can accumulate through large dips without being stopped out 
 However often they also wish to trade portions with fixed margin to protect profits on moves on a smaller timeframe Leverj is the only exchange that offers simultaneous fixed and cross margin while splitting a fixed portion out of the cross margin for partial exit 
 NETWORK CONGESTION
 Blockchains can suffer congestion for extended durations A severely congested network may mean that settlement transactions are confirmed with a significant delay but wont impact actual settlement amounts
