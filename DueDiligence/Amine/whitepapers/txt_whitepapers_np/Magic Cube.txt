b Magic Cube An open network for the development of an entertainment ecosystem Rudy Rong Andrew Bakst magiccube io March 24 2019 Abstract We describe a network that facilitates the peer to peer development of an entertainment ecosystem with an initial focus on the gaming industry The network has two primary components a utility token offering mechanism and an exchange mechanism to allow for liquidity and interoperability between utility tokens Both the offering and exchange mechanisms achieve incentive compatibility between all involved parties through the design of the MCC token 1

7 \x0cIntroduction The Magic Cube network (herein referred to as Magic Cube) is a blockchain based decentralized entertainment ecosystem Magic Cube is committed to asset binding all virtual consumer goods (games music film etc ) and implementing a new token economy that drives network effects for entertainment projects Magic Cube Technology Foundation Ltd (the Foundation) is putting these ideas into practice based on its own experience in distributing channeling and publishing games The promise of blockchain is a leap forward in the ability to engage in trusted transactions regardless of the surrounding institutional environment Magic Cube intends to use blockchain technology to circumvent existing unfair institutional environments and drive network effects among users with the goal of creating an entertainment ecosystem that fairly rewards producers and consumers of content Magic Cube will initially focus on the gaming industry due to our already established presence in the space Blockchains can benefit game developers and players in the following ways \xe2\x80\xa2 Reward the creators and early adopters of games \xe2\x80\xa2 Game development can be funded by the pre sale of utility tokens to players \xe2\x80\xa2 Players can have exclusive rights to certain features of their favorite digital media \xe2\x80\xa2 Network Effects \xe2\x80\xa2 Game developers can have an alternative marketing approach to the monopolistic channels that currently capture a large percentage of developers\xe2\x80\x99 revenue Scarce useful liquid tokens in the hands of players will encourage players to market new games Currently it is difficult for developers to incentivize players to try new games No one wants to play a game that no one else is playing Rewarding players for putting their \xe2\x80\x9cskin in the game\xe2\x80\x9d can turn players into early adopters and therefore marketers of the ecosystem similar to what we have seen in the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) market \xe2\x80\xa2 Game players may resale utility tokens on an open and fair secondary market potentially for a profit Currently players seldom receive benefits for being early adopters of a new game 8 \x0cThe Foundation will help game developers complete their own secondary IGOs (Initial Game Offerings) on the Magic Cube platform during which the developer releases a secondary utility token with provable scarcity that provides exclusive access to in game props and experiences After the completion of a game\xe2\x80\x99s IGO and the proven development of the token within the game (measured by the game\xe2\x80\x99s status on the Magic Cube Token Curated Registry) the game\xe2\x80\x99s utility token will be exchangeable on an open market with other tokens that also provide in game and out of game utility The Magic Cube platform consists of the following primary parts \xe2\x80\xa2 MCC Token Standards for Utility Token Offerings (UTOs) \xe2\x80\xa2 MCC7 for mobile game IGOs \xe2\x80\xa2 MCC15 for PC game and video console game IGOs \xe2\x80\xa2 MCC40 for AR/VR game IGOs \xe2\x80\xa2 More UTO standards will be listed for film music and other entertainment media An IGO is simply a type of UTO \xe2\x80\xa2 A mobile wallet/browser \xe2\x80\xa2 A decentralized exchange 9 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 A kit for developers to deploy smart contracts with minimal friction \xe2\x80\xa2 A decentralized voting model whereby holders of the MCC token would be able to vote (see below) on features of the Magic Cube platform Gaming Industry Overview In 2016 the global gaming industry\xe2\x80\x99s output value exceeded $100 billion USD for the first time exceeding the sum of that of the film and music industries It is estimated that by 2020 the global gaming industry output value will reach $129 billion USD Mobile games will account for 51% of the gaming industry\xe2\x80\x99s output surpassing the value of traditional gaming platforms such as remote controlled video game consoles In 2016 the number of Chinese gamers reached 600 million people and their market size reached $24 6 billion USD surpassing the $24 1 billion market size of the US market The AsiaPacific region accounts for 46% of the global game market In China 93% of local gamers play games that have been developed by Chinese game development companies For context 56% of US game players play games developed by American companies Chinese users\ demand for games continues to increase but small and medium sized game makers have been severely hampered by poor user traffic and fund raising obstacles driven by monopolistic middlemen and restrictive government policies The difficulties faced by small and medium sized game developers is specified below 10 \x0cPain Point 1 Funding In 2017 the CSRC (Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission) suspended the listing of numerous companies in the gaming and film industries In 2018 alone five gaming companies such as Suzhou Snail Digital Technology and Shanghai Green Bank Network have had their IPOs suspended Mergers and acquisitions as well as refinancing were also suspended Instead the CSRC encourages already publicly listed companies to develop gaming platforms themselves leading to monopolies over the gaming marketplace Without having a viable exit strategy fundraising for small and medium sized developers has become extremely difficult The poor financing environment has led to developers not having enough incentives to support long development cycles causing a drop in user experience which has created a compounding negative feedback loop Pain Point 2 Traffic Generation The cost to receive traffic continues to increase but the conversion rate of real users is extremely low Most games are sold partially to a publisher leaving the developer with the rights to only 10% of the future income of the game that the developer made him/herself The publisher buys users through channels such as Facebook the App Store offline marketing etc However fake accounts currently make up for approximately 62 5% of the users on boarded through marketing channels making the sale to the publisher highly unlikely to generate enough user growth for that 10% to amount to any substantial income Small and medium sized developers still have no viable alternatives to using a publisher Additionally the immediate selling of most of their rights disincentives developers to continuously update their games Pain Point 3 Retention Rates Because of the premise of the first two points the retention of new real users thus turning them 11 \x0cinto early adopters has become the key to survival However a lack of incentivizes for early adopters during early stage game development creates a negative feedback loop Game players do not wish to play a game that no one else is playing as most view it as a waste of time Small and medium sized game companies need to find a way to retain real users 12 \x0cOur Position Magic Cube LLC is an internet company headquartered in Hangzhou with its own game development team online and offline channels and offline wallet business Magic Cube LLC already has 23 games that are live with active product development Each of these games will likely IGO on the Magic Cube network Our games average a monthly active user rate of 150 000 people (per game) At present our total number of users exceeds ten million people We also have strong connections with other game developers and publishers allowing the Magic Cube ecosystem to expand significantly beyond Magic Cube LLC Architecture Magic Cube has designed the Magic Cube network to solve the pain points of the gaming industry outlined in the above the sections The primary design principles of the Magic Cube architecture are modularity (for ease of upgradability) trust and security Governance The governance module allows for token holders to vote on the features of the MCC ecosystem for example upgrades to the Generalized Proxy which in turn allows them to make upgrades to both the MCC token standard sub proxies and the MCC exchange module or add entirely new 13 \x0cmodules to the MCC ecosystem The execution of network upgrades has been designed to with a priority of avoiding any disruption to the security of user funds For the avoidance of doubt the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Magic Cube the right to vote does not entitle MCC Token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Foundation or its affiliates or their assets and does not constitute any equity interest in the Foundation or its affiliates 14 \x0cExchange The MCC Exchange is designed to minimize on chain transactions so as to satisfy the scalability requirements necessary to function at the same speed as a centralized exchange There are at least three parties in every trade a seller a relayer and a buyer A seller is the account that sends the initial order stating the exchange rate at which they wish to sell Token A for Token B A relayer broadcasts and matches trades through an order book A buyer is the account (or group of accounts) that fills an open order at an agreed up exchange rate with the seller The sequence of a completed trade goes as follows 15 \x0c1 The relayer cites its fee rate (for the inclusion of the sell order on its order book) to the seller The NEO blockchain does not charge fees for computationally light transactions thus allowing the relayer to keep any fees it charges Relayers decide their own fees creating a competitive market for the business of sellers 2 The seller creates an order and signs it with its private key thereby validating the data contained within the order and agreeing to the fee set by the relayer Relayers are expected to create orders that resemble today\xe2\x80\x99s user experience standards by providing interfaces that makes forming and signing an order as easy as possible 16 \x0c3 The seller sends its signed order to the relayer thereby paying the relayer a fee 4 After checking that the order is valid (the fee was properly paid all data was filled out correctly and signed) the relayer updates the order book with the seller\xe2\x80\x99s order listed Any valid order may be cancelled through the cancel function on the MCC exchange contract in which case the relayer would need to re update its order book If the order is not valid it is rejected and any fees paid to the relayer are kept by the relayer 5 Buyers receive an updated version of the order book that includes the seller\xe2\x80\x99s order 6 Buyers fill the seller\xe2\x80\x99s order by properly parameterizing and calling the MCC exchange contract on the NEO blockchain It is up to relayers both to provide the user interface for buyers to fill orders and to handle partial fills though modification of order books This set up may still not be secure enough to prevent the front running of orders by NEO block producers A NEO block producer could see the data contained in an already filled order decide to fill the order itself and then publish a block containing its purchase instead of the purchase by the original buyer(s) To prevent the possibility of front running by NEO block producers we are researching the computation viability of zero knowledge proofs such as zk SNARKs and Bulletproofs Ring Trading The MCC Exchange supports the mixing and matching of multiple orders in a circular trade known as ring trading By using multiple orders (potentially across multiple order books) instead of a single trading pair the MCC exchange achieves a dramatic increase in liquidity Ring trading is a feature of the MCC network and is not a requirement as it is computationally heavy for any relayers who choose to do it Ring trades can be satisfied under the following requirement where for any given order x is the amount Token A wanting to be sold and y is the Token B wanting to be bought 17 \x0cThis property ensures that all traders in the ring order are receiving an exchange rate equal to or better than the exchange rate they messaged to the relayer Below is an example of a ring order between three traders across three order books where each trader receives a significantly better rate than their ask price The pricing formula behind a ring trading rewards all buyers and sellers with the same discount percentage so as to ensure fairness in the multi partied transaction If r is the initial asking rate of an order and \xce\xb2 is equal to the discount that all traders in the ring trade received the ringtrading rate of each order would be and satisfy hence If the transaction involves n different orders the discount \xce\xb2 would be solved through the following formula This formula ensures the relayers that execute ring trades can fairly discount all traders involved 18 \x0cMCC Token Standards MCC Token Standard sub proxies set the rules for the funding contracts that allow for secondary IGOs on the Magic Cube platform as well as the rules that govern developer payout after an IGO has been completed Separate token standards exist for the purpose of creating appropriate rules for different types of entertainment utility token offerings Not all entertainment development cycles are the same a PC game may require thousands of dollars to upkeep while a film may require millions of dollars It may take 2 weeks to push a mobile gaming update but 2 years to create a film The rules governing these developer discrepancies should be allowed to be unique To achieve this The MCC token standards define not only different smart contract funding mechanisms but also different rules for their respective token curated registries (TCRs) Each TCR exists in the following structure Game Data [1] Status Data [1] Game Data [2] Status Data [2] Game Data [3] Status Data [3] Game Data [n] Status Data [n] Game Data contains the following data Token_Ticker (the unique identifier for the token launched on the MCC platform) Token_Supply (set by the developer at the time of IGO) Balance (funds currently locked in the TCR) Developer_Account_Address Timestamp_Proposed (showing (for the intermittent date the payments game was to the proposed to developer) the TCR) TCR_TokenStandard (a hash of all token standards taken at Timestamp_Proposed) Timestamp_Approved (showing the date the game approved to join the TCR) 19 \x0cStatus Data contains one of the four data options Proposed Challenged Paused Approved The goal of the TCR is to maintain community consensus around the state of the development of a game after the game has been funded through an IGO See the To Ensure that Developers Stay Truthful sub section below for more details Any token following an MCC token standard can be exchanged for any other token following an MCC token standard as all MCC token standards also follow the NEP 5 token standard Ecosystem Incentivization Through The MCC Token The goal of the native digital cryptographically secured utility token of Magic Cube (MCC Token) is to create a decentralized entertainment ecosystem that exhibits a high level of trust by making use of embedded incentives that reward good behaviors such as relayers\xe2\x80\x99 providing liquidity or developers\xe2\x80\x99 delivering promised updates to games and punish bad behaviors such as cartel formation amongst relayers or developers\xe2\x80\x99 fleeing the ecosystem with unearned funds MCC Token is a major component of the ecosystem on Magic Cube and is designed to be used solely as the primary token on the network MCC Token is a non refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of exchange between participants on Magic Cube The primary goal of introducing MCC Token is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on Magic Cube MCC Token does not in any way represent any shareholding participation right title or interest in the Foundation the Distributor its affiliates or any other company enterprise or undertaking nor will MCC Token entitle token holders to any promise of fees dividends revenue profits or investment returns and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction MCC Token may only be utilised on Magic Cube and ownership of MCC Token carries no rights express or implied other than the right to use MCC Token as a means to enable usage of and interaction within Magic Cube The following use cases of the MCC token describe our current framework for achieving this 20 \x0cTo Upgrade the Network MCC token holders may vote on features of the MCC Ecosystem To vote on upgrades to the network MCC token holders give a voting contract access to their coins for the time period of the vote with a 3 day buffer on both sides of the time period The purpose of the buffer is to give the network time to recognize potential malicious attacks and take the necessary steps to prevent jeopardizing the network\xe2\x80\x99s security For the avoidance of doubt the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of the MCC Ecosystem the right to vote does not entitle MCC Token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Foundation or its affiliates or their assets and does not constitute any equity interest in the Foundation or its affiliates To Reward Relayers A seller (the trader whose order is filled) on the exchange will pay competitive fees to relayers Sellers can pay their trading fees to relayers using the MCC token or any other token that the relayer accepts for payment To Avoid Monopolization Among Relayers Relayers will be incentivized to give other relayers access to their order books Relayers will set competitive fees (whose required payment is in MCC Token) for filling trades listed on their order books to reward themselves for providing other relayers with liquidity A percentage of these open order book fees (the exact amount of basis points will be determined by the MCC token holders) will be sent to an MCC burn contract A percentage of MCC tokens in the burn contract (the exact percentage will be determined by the governance module) will be randomly released to MCC token holders who partake in the maintenance of the MCC Token Curated Registry (more details in the To Ensure that Developers Stay Truthful sub section below) The purpose of burning MCC tokens is to prevent potential monopolization or cartel formation where select relayers wash trade between each other to give the illusion of decentralization Burning tokens makes Sybil attacks and cartel formation more expensive 21 \x0cWhen ring trading takes place the ring miner will be awarded a competitive fee (the exact amount of basis points will be determined by the MCC token holders) from all the relayers to which it helped find liquidity In this instance the relayers do not charge the other relayers fees Only the ring miner is awarded inter relayer fees with the token burn still in effect at the same rate as on all other open order book trades To Pay For Utility Tokens Secondary IGOs carried out on the MCC network must be completed using the MCC token as the base unit of exchange Upon completion of the IGO the game joins its respective token standard\xe2\x80\x99s TCR the game\xe2\x80\x99s status becomes Proposed and the timestamp of the proposal is recorded Similar to an ICO developers decide the percentage of their total game tokens they wish to sell at the IGO They could keep some for team to add additional incentivizes for continued development To Ensure That Developers Stay Truthful In order for a token to be listed by relayers after its IGO it must be listed on its appropriate MCC token standard\xe2\x80\x99s TCR with its status as Approved Once a token is listed as Approved it can always be traded on the Magic Cube network regardless of what happens to its status on its respective TCR Until the game\xe2\x80\x99s status is changed to Approved a certain percentage (dependent upon the MCC token standard that the token complies with) of those funds remain locked in funding contracts a certain percentage (dependent upon the MCC token standard that the token complies with) is immediately given to the developer and a certain percentage (dependent upon the MCC token standard that the token complies with) is staked in the TCR contract until the game\xe2\x80\x99s status is either changed to Approved or the game is removed from the TCR For a game\xe2\x80\x99s status to change from Proposed to Approved it must go a certain amount of time (dependent upon the MCC token standard that the token complies with) without being Challenged or it must survive a Challenge Period The remaining aspects of developer rewards will be uniquely specified by each MCC token standard Below is an example of how an MCC token standard could specify a payout timeline 22 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Upon completion of the IGO the developer immediately receives 5% of MCC funds raised while the Funding contract locks 80% and 15% is staked in the MCC7 TCR \xe2\x80\xa2 If the game\xe2\x80\x99s status is changed to Approved the developers could immediately receive the 15% that was staked in the MCC7 TCR Contract The remaining 80% of the raised funds could be awarded to the developer on a linear basis with 10% released at a constant monthly time interval The funds are released at the slotted monthly intervals only if the game\xe2\x80\x99s status remains Approved Funding is paused if the game\xe2\x80\x99s status is Challenged or Paused If the status is reverted back to Approved after a Challenge Period the developer receives any funds that were missed during the Challenge Period If the game\xe2\x80\x99s status becomes Paused the developer payout time schedule is also paused and only resumes if the game\xe2\x80\x99s status is reverted to Approved If the game ever becomes de listed all locked developer funds are returned to the initial funders \xe2\x80\xa2 If the game is Rejected by the validators the initial funders are refunded 80% their MCC contributed The 15% staked is awarded to the challengers and voters of the TCR 23 \x0cBecause the structures of each token standard\xe2\x80\x99s reward mechanism will be decided by the token holders of MCC token developers are further incentivized to hold MCC token to play a role in the governance process for token standards A hash (TCR_TokenStandard) of all token standard at time of proposal is stored in the game\xe2\x80\x99s data field on the TCR so that developers do not have that their rewards schedules altered ex post facto Relayers cannot list coins whose status never change from Proposed to Approved If relayers list coins that did not meet development requirements the MCC network will lose significant value which should decrease the value of relayers\xe2\x80\x99 business models and MCC token holdings encouraging them to remain honest There may be the deployment of a TCR whose purpose is to moderate rule following relayers in the future although we do not think that is necessary at this time Challenge Periods A Challenge Period may be initiated against candidates in their application period or against already approved TCR members The Challenge Period begins when an ecosystem member stakes a certain amount of MCC tokens (the exact amount of basis points will be determined by the MCC token holders) in a proper challenge contract which will be voted on by the validators The only criteria to be a validator is for the user to have locked a certain amount of MCC tokens (the exact amount will be dependent upon the MCC token standard that the token complies with) in the TCR for the duration of the vote plus a buffer period There validators could be relayers evangelists consumers or other developers Developers with funds locked in the TCR contract could also be validators Once a challenge has been made all participating validators send their votes using a commitreveal scheme (to ensure that validators cannot see other validators\xe2\x80\x99 votes before submitting their own) A vote can contain any of the following messages Status_Delist Status_Approved Status_Paused Whichever message receives the highest number of votes becomes the game\xe2\x80\x99s status (except in the event of Status_Delist which would cause the game to be removed from the TCR) All validators who vote receive random TCC token rewards to incentivize continuous 24 \x0cparticipation These rewards come from the pool of tokens burned by relayers (for open order book trades) locked in the burn contract We prevent Sybil attacks for random rewards by requiring a tokens to be bonded in order to be a validator To Bridge the Online and the Offline At present there are 250 merchants in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang that accept the MCC token as payment We plan on partnering with 50 000 merchants before the end of 2018 Formalized MCC Operations Governance Module The Governance module provides a backdoor to the Generalized Proxy module for the governance of all other smart contracts on the MCC platform The Proxy module acts as a whitelist for which contracts are valid to be called on the MCC network The Governance contract contains the following function calls Bond \xe2\x80\x94 users bond tokens for a buffer period placed both in front of and behind the deadline to vote users\xe2\x80\x99 votes will be proportionate to their stakes users can bond and vote before the buffer period begins Delegate \xe2\x80\x94 an account can delegate their stake to another account (the tokens remain bonded during the delegation period and therefore cannot be spent during this period) Vote \xe2\x80\x94 an account publishes their vote on a Magic Cube Improvement Proposal Abort \xe2\x80\x94 an account can abort any participative actions (such as bonding or delegating) before the buffer period of the vote if their vote is made before the buffer period This will be useful if the account needs to spend MCC token for a reason economically more important than the outcome of the vote to them The Governance module has the ability to vote on the parameters of the Governance contract itself as listed in the Proxy module 25 \x0cFunding Mechanism The Funding Mechanism is executed through the launch Contract A launch contract is published by a contract owner (one address per contract initially for the representation of either a decentralized autonomous organization centralized organization or lone individual) The launch contract contains the following data fields Owner_Address Token_Symbol Price (of the utility token offering in MCC for the duration of the utility token offering) Expiration_Time (of the utility token offering to be executed through Time_Stamp) (total native) Token_Supply Percentage (of token supply allocated to the utility token offering) Inflation_Rate (if applicable) Contract_Upgradability The Owner_Address will be the receiver of the developer payout of the MCC raised in the launch contract with the money received at a rate as detailed in the MCC Token Standard under which the launch contract was deployed It will be likely that contract owners promote their utility token offerings through other networks designed for designed media and/or centralized media platforms On the Magic Cube wallet we will provide free promotion of token offerings launched on our platform Token Curated Registry The Token Curated Registry consists of two contracts the TCR contract and PLCR Contract There are three primary actions to support the functioning of each MCC Token Standard TCR (The creation and upgrading of MCC Token Standards will be maintained by the Governance module through the Proxy module ) Submitting a Candidate Interaction 1 Users approve that the TCR contract is allowed to transfer their funds from their wallet 26 \x0cInteraction 2 Users submit the candidate for application into the registry which includes the necessary bond to engage the validators Challenging a Candidate Interaction 1 Users approve that the TCR contract is allowed to transfer their funds from their wallet Interaction 2 Users challenge the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s application into the registry which includes the necessary bond to challenge as a validator Voting on a Candidate Interaction 1 Users approve the PLCR contract to transfer funds from their wallet Interaction 2 Users requests voting rights from the PLCR contract Interaction 3 Users submit their committed vote to the PLCR contract Interaction 4 Users submit the reveal hash (for their committed vote) to the PLCR contract The results of the challenge allow for the updated data of each listing\xe2\x80\x99s status A challenge can be performed for any applicant or for any current member of the TCR All members of the TCR are required to hold a small stake in the TCR in order to remain listed We would like to note some of the beneficial properties of the PLCR contract The tokens locked in the PLCR contract to vote are only partially locked meaning that they can be used in multiple polls so long as the tokens locked are owned by the same address and the polls are executed by another PLCR contract The PCLR contract does not punish the voters who vote not in the majority group The PLCR contract returns the status of the candidate to the TCR contract to decide who the winner of the challenge is (in the event of a Pause the vote is a draw until the status is changed again) and the loser\xe2\x80\x99s funds are distributed to the challenger and majority voters appropriately Votes can be changed during the Pause Period to signal the future result until an additional challenge is created at which point validators must lock in their votes to end the Pause Period This set up allows for validators to assuredly and easily vote in multiple polls simultaneously while holding accountable the Applicant and Challenger for capturing the network\xe2\x80\x99s time 27 \x0cDecentralized Exchange There are two types of orders that will be executed through the exchange point to point orders and broadcast orders Each type of order users the same DEX contract but begin with different data sets Point to point orders specify the buyer address(es) that can fill the order at a specific rate and quantity only requiring the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s signature Broadcast orders leave the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s address as null and specifies the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s address when there is a buyer The buyer still must sign the order in order for the order to be verified by the DEX contract The DEX contract verifies the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s seller\xe2\x80\x99s and relayer\xe2\x80\x99s signatures against each of their account addresses to ensure that the all three parties have agreed to execute the listed trade at the listed exchange and fee rate The DEX contract does care if an order is publicly or partially filled Relayers can perform partial fills through providing the additional argument Partial_Fill where the Partial_Fill is less than the TokenB_Amount (the amount of TokenB to be bought) It is up to the relayer to maintain the order book appropriately after a partial fill has been executed Orders contain the additional data to be processed by the DEX contract DEX Contract (pointing to the address of the DEX contract needing to be called) Token_S (the token to be sold the developer is given access to this token by the seller) TokenS_Amount (the amount of TokenAto be sold) Token_B (the token be to bought) TokenB_Amount (the amount of TokenB to be bought) Fee_Amount (the fee paid to the relayer) Fee_Address (the relayer\xe2\x80\x99s account address) Timestamp (the time at which the order was signed) Expiration (the duration of time that the buy order may be broadcasted on the relayer\xe2\x80\x99s order book) Prepared for Scenarios Because blockchains are not yet scalable for mainstream adoption we will carefully follow all scaling progress on public platforms Should we wish to decentralize our platform before adequate scaling has been achieved we may temporarily implement a Proof of Authority side 28 \x0cchain pegged to the public NEO main chain Our Proof of Authority side chain would require Authorities to stake a significant a significant amount of MCC tokens thereby turning the platform into an emergency Authorized Proof of Stake side chain Because this model is still centralized we would look forward to moving back to the main chain once scaling solutions have been resolved Cross Chain Game Asset Trading In the current gaming industry uniqueness of the new released games has gradually disappeared with the proliferation of homogeneous products and has made game developers increasingly concerned with how they can secure larger profits from their various competitors On the other hand the devaluation caused by the over delivery of game equipment often makes gamers suffer These are the main problems that Magic Cube hopes solve for the rapidly growing gaming ecosystem As a blockchain based entertainment ecosystem Magic Cube helps game developers issue game core tokens called GTOs (Game Token Offering) by helping them use smart contracts and by lowering consumption and trading thresholds in the game which in turn improves the game\xe2\x80\x99s user retention Up to now Magic Cube\ s game operators include Shanda Game Perfect World Game Blue Harbor Game Linekong along with other large game manufacturers The total number of registered users on the platform has reached 15 million Starting in June of this year Magic Cube will launch a layer2 chain based on the Tendermint consensus in an effort to help traditional games convert onto the blockchain through the use of our GTO model After that Magic Cube will gradually start expanding from NEO ONT and other public chains which will help us encourage more cross chain interactions with other public chains which will help us create a truly decentralized entertainment ecosystem Technical roadmap Additionally with the acceleration of 5G technology Magic Cube will also use VR (Virtual Reality) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology to better serve game users Use the innovative cross chain mechanism SOP Since the advent of blockchain technology numerous different chains have been born and the isolation of information on many chains inevitably lead to a \xe2\x80\x9cso called\xe2\x80\x9d value isolation island effect The so called cross chain is analogous to connecting bridges between two islands connecting different blockchains In practice the problem to be solved in a cross chain model is how to transfer the token from one chain and onto another chain This process is not only one that entails the transmission of information as the value transfer behind the information flow also needs to be accurately recorded It can be said that solving the problem of isolated islands between blockchains has always been a key problem that requires a solution in the field of blockchain technology However to this day 29 \x0cthere is still no cross chain mechanism in the market that can be universally recognized On the one hand efficient centralized exchanges can effectively meet the basic needs of users which makes the demand for cross chain abilities of low urgency On the other hand cross chain technology is not perfect in its current state According to research the problems currently existing in current cross chain technology are mainly reflected in two aspects 1 How to verify the transaction status on the original chain and how to ensure that the nodes that deal across chain won\xe2\x80\x99t be bad nodes that aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to prevent double payments How to ensure that the total amount of tokens on the original chain will not decrease or increase due to cross chaining transaction process In order to solve the two major problems existing in cross chain technology Magic Cube constructed a chain consensus mechanism based on Tendermint\ s layer2 according to Montesquieu\ s theory We call it Separation of Powers (SOP) So what is the separation of powers SOP Tendermint is a Byzantine fault tolerant algorithm that is optimized for PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant Algorithm) that requires only two rounds of voting to reach consensus In Tendermint there is the concept of a validator which is responsible for verifying blocks and voting On this basis Magic Cube has optimized this and proposed Separation of Powers (SOP) First Magic Cube divides the validator into three roles (1) check node (2) uplink node (3) verification node The check node is responsible for clearing the transaction information generated in the main chain obtaining the result and recording the transaction specific information and transmitting it to the uplink node The uplink node is responsible for accepting the transaction results and transaction content transmitted by the check node and sending it to the side chain or other main chain The verification node is responsible for verifying the uplink content submitted by the uplink node and performing verification broadcast 30 \x0cThese three types of nodes perform their duties cooperate with each other and at the same time restrict each other thereby achieving separation of the three powers In addition in order to achieve the high scalability of the decentralized application (DApp) Magic Cube has been building a network with Ethereum as the backbone and high throughput Layer 2 sidechain These side chains use the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as a consensus mechanism This means they will protect the network with a limited number of high performance verify nodes enabling large scale sub second acknowledgment times While inheriting the security of the Ethereum main network it also makes up for the lack of DPoS in decentralization Hard core analysis of SOP Well the above section talked about our innovative separation of powers (SOP) but there may be many individuals who believe that the above explanation is not enough and want to further understand this new and innovative mechanism Because of this we will give a more detailed analysis First the system randomly extracts the uplink node which not only can settle and record the transaction content in the main chain but also can specify the check node and as the check node can vote to determine whether the uplink node is in compliance In addition the verification node may determine whether the check node specified by the uplink node can be established and the check node may determine whether the verification result of the verification node is correct At the same time the uplink node can determine whether the result of the verification node is reasonable and the verification node can rebut the unreasonable part determined by the uplink node through the 2/3 majority 31 \x0cIn this way the separation of the three powers in the classic Montesquieu theory is formed This separation of powers allows the system to achieve better decentralization In addition the higher the efficiency of the node the more likely it is to be randomly selected resulting in positive feedback resulting in complete disappearance of the evil behavior In the Tendermint consensus protocol participants are called validators they take turns to package out blocks and collectively package the blocks Only one block commit is allowed at each height In the case where a block cannot be submitted in the round the protocol moves to the next round and the new verification node will propose a block of that height Two rounds of voting are required to commit a block these two rounds of voting are often referred to as pre vote and precommit In each round of voting more than 2/3 of the verification nodes need to pre commit the same block to get the last block commit The validator will fail when compiling blocks in each round for example the current offeror may be offline or the network may be slow Tendermint allows the validator to be skipped and the validator waits a short time to receive the complete proposal block from the proposal and then proceeds to the next round of voting This dependency on timeout makes Tendermint a weak synchronization protocol not an asynchronous one However the rest of the protocol is asynchronous and the verifier can only make progress if it receives more than two thirds of the votes The two round voting mechanism of precommit and propose is the same Assuming that less than one third of the validator are Byzantine nodes Tendermint guarantees that security will not be violated That is the validator will never commit conflicting blocks at the same height and will not fork To this end it introduces some locking rules Once the validator inserts a block in advance it will be locked on the block then The prevote block must be locked After precommit a new block the validator can be unlocked In combination with Tendermint\ s non forked feature Magic Cube\ s SOP mechanism can effectively eliminate evil nodes form secure synchronous transaction information between chains and chains and ensure efficient and secure non forked each node will compete to become a high efficiency node As a cross chain method of a relay scheme there is no problem that the additional resources are consumed in the original chain due to the synchronization state At the same time the data structure of the heterogeneous chain is different and data conversion can be solved here Therefore this scheme is not only economical but can also transfer money in the heterogeneous chain and in the MC\ s SOP mechanism the asset account is locked the status and data are responsible for three roles VR + AI two major technical advantages that serve game users In addition to using blockchain technology the Magic Cube game asset ecosystem also uses two other new technologies VR (Virtual Reality) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) The technological process in the field of computer science according to the current development law has a driving force that consists of nothing more than two aspects one is the innovation of computing power and algorithms the other is the iteration of terminal form and the emergence of VR/AR belongs to the latter With the acceleration of 5G technology the network transmission speed in VR technology is no longer a pain point 32 \x0cPreviously Magic Cube had a very mature VR technology that could achieve VR a real time live broadcast function Now based on the speed of 5G networks role functions real time VR interaction with in game scenarios and online players is possible For example while looking at the popular PUBG game players can now enter the game map through VR which will undoubtedly give players a more realistic and exciting operation experience In the future Magic Cube will also introduce the ability to directly map the game\ s characters to the player\ s characters and will synchronize the user\ s actions and communication with the player\ s game characters Furthermore modern banks have begun to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology in an effort to meet growing regulatory demands while minimizing labor costs The low cost approach is no longer to hire cheap labor but to automate Resource intensive repetitive tasks such as data entry and transaction processing are ideal for automation and artificial intelligence In addition communication barriers between traditional systems still have data islands and privacy issues and AI and blockchain can fit together perfectly and effectively solve these problems This is because the data on the blockchain is inherently highly secure and the blockchain helps us track understand and interpret AI decisions while AI can manage blockchains more efficiently than humans (traditional computers) Initially Magic Cube will provide a trading robot called small M In terms of finance the M robot can be used to provide financial counseling/consulting services for users and can also automatically classify customers according to their risk status from low to high Underwriting pricing and trading risk assessments can also be used to quickly calculate asset valuations using data points around assets and historical examples If players trade frequently M can quickly analyze data and make decisions to benefit users (games) thereby realizing the self investment of user (game) assets to the upward direction 33 \x0cProduct Features of the MC Platform For Users A Digital Wallet/Browser The Magic Cube Wallet/Browser will be compatible with all virtual assets such as game titles and skins that can be purchased with tokens launched on the MCC network It will have social features such as instant messaging and user profiles with the potential for other social features added on based on user feedback The wallet/browser will be accessible on both mobile and desktop devices across all popular operating systems (iOS Android Linux Windows etc) Most existing encrypted digital currency wallets require a high level of expertise from mainstream users such as transaction fees private keys and alphanumeric addresses Magic Cube will offer an opt in centralized custody of wallet funds so that users do not have to have to worry about losing their private keys Additionally all transactions using our wallet will be fee free as NEO does not require fees for computationally light transactions The Magic Cube wallet has already reached more than 250 shops in Zhejiang and North Jiangsu Users can quickly use the currency in their wallet by scanning other Magic Cube wallets\xe2\x80\x99 QR codes Magic Cube plans to on board 50 000 merchants onto the Magic Cube wallet by the end of 2018 The types of merchants who we are seeking are in the businesses of leisure and entertainment shopping malls food catering and schools For Developers The Cube Kit The Cube Kit will be an open source template for the deployment of different MCC smart contracts to guarantee that our gaming developers securely execute their abstracted business logic Initially we will focus on the IGO contract referencing the Launch smart contract necessary to launch a gaming token on the Magic Cube network The IGO contract template will require only that the developers assign values to variables that will be unique to each project with the audited template providing the additional code for the deployment of the contract As we on board increasingly complex games and blockchains scale we will develop numerous additional templates allowing for more intricate IGOs that could involve non fungible tokens 34 \x0cdual token models and dual game models Like other first and second layer networks we believe that creating tools that promote ease of creation will lead to greater creation and therefore accrue more value to the platform Additionally we will release open source templates for the creation of relayers once the MCC exchange shifts to a decentralized model This is less of a priority because of our development timeline Please see our Development Plan for more details Examples of other people offering similar developer tools in the crypto space https //blog airswap

offering) for the MCC token will be conducted in NEO or ETH (which would then be converted into NEO) as the MCC token is a NEP 5 token 35 \x0cMCC Token are designed to be consumed and that is the goal of the MCC Token sale In fact the project to develop Magic Cube would fail if all MCC Token holders simply held onto their MCC Token and did nothing with it In particular it is highlighted that MCC Token (a) is non refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation the Distributor or any affiliate (b) does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Foundation the Distributor (or any of its affiliates) or its revenues or assets including without limitation any right to receive future dividends revenue shares ownership right or stake share or security any voting distribution redemption liquidation proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property

supply of 20 billion MCC tokens The tokens will be distributed as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 15% will be allocated for the Development Team \xe2\x80\xa2 25% will be allocated for strategic private purchasers 36 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 10% will be allocated to the Foundation \xe2\x80\xa2 50% will be allocated to the Ecological Incentive The contributions in the token sale will be held by the Distributor (or its affiliate) after the token sale and contributors will have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in these contributions or the assets of that entity after the token sale Approximately 10% of the tokens allocated to the Foundation will be distributed to the traders who use the Magic Cube Exchange (see Development Plan) via secondary smart contracts effectively granting traders a rebate of 80% of their trading fees The rebate will be paid with MCC token as the platform currency This transaction fee rebate model has proven to be effective by FCoin a cryptocurrency exchange that surpassed a billion dollars of daily volume in just months after its launch This model also distributes the MCC tokens to Magic Cube users proportionally to their usage of the system thus ensuring fair decentralization of the network The Magic Cube exchange will launch in Q4 2018 Magic Cube Foundation The Magic Cube Foundation is established in Singapore The Foundation is committed to the development of a trustworthy fair gaming industry through the evangelism and promotion of the Magic Cube network The Foundation will achieve its commitment by

people and projects Hongfei Da Vitalik Buterin Mike Goldin Eddy Munoz The 0x Team The Loopring Team The FCoin Team 44 \x0cRisks You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing MCC Token holding MCC Token and using MCC Token for participation in Magic Cube In the worst scenario this could lead to the loss of all or part of the MCC Token which had been purchased IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE MCC Token YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS 1 Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions The regulatory status of MCC Token and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions The regulation of virtual currencies has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world It is impossible to predict how when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications including MCC Token and/or Magic Cube Regulatory actions could negatively impact MCC Token and/or Magic Cube in various ways The Foundation the Distributor (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies a cautious approach will be applied towards the sale of MCC Token Therefore for the token sale the sale strategy may be constantly adjusted in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible For the token sale the Foundation and the Distributor are working with Tzedek Law LLC a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain space 2 Inadequate disclosure of information As at the date hereof Magic Cube is still under development and its design concepts consensus mechanisms algorithms codes and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed Although this white paper contains the most current information relating to Magic Cube it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Magic Cube team from time to time The Magic Cube team has no ability and obligation to keep holders of MCC Token informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop Magic Cube hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable 45 \x0c3 Competitors Various types of decentralised applications are emerging at a rapid rate and the industry is increasingly competitive It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and network underlying MCC Token and/or Magic Cube and attempt to re create similar facilities Magic Cube may be required to compete with these alternative networks which could negatively impact MCC Token and/or Magic Cube 4 Loss of Talent The development of Magic Cube depends on the continued co operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors The loss of any member may adversely affect Magic Cube or its future development Further stability and cohesion within the team is critical to the overall development of Magic Cube There is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur resulting in negative influence on the project in the future 5 Failure to develop There is the risk that the development of Magic Cube will not be executed or implemented as planned for a variety of reasons including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset virtual currency or MCC Token unforeseen technical difficulties and shortage of development funds for activities 6 Security weaknesses Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with MCC Token and/or Magic Cube in a variety of ways including but not limited to malware attacks denial of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing Furthermore there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Foundation the Distributor or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of MCC Token and/or Magic Cube which could negatively affect MCC Token and/or Magic Cube Further the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing) could present unknown risks to MCC Token and/or Magic Cube by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain network 46 \x0c7 Other risks In addition the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your purchase holding and use of MCC Token including those that the Foundation or the Distributor cannot anticipate Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks You should conduct full due diligence on the Foundation the Distributor its affiliates and the Magic Cube team as well as understand the overall framework mission and vision for Magic Cube prior to purchasing MCC Token 47 \x0c
