presentation you\xe2\x80\x99ll \xef\xac\x81nd out how Boolberry reduces block chain bloat compared to *Ordinary CryptoNote coins *Ordinary CryptoNote Coins based on the original CryptoNote core such as ByteCoin DuckNote Monero etc Boolberry Solves CryptoNote Issues 2 \x0cBlock chain What is a block chain and how does it work The block chain is a database shared by all network users that stores the transaction history A transaction is not recognized until it is added to the block chain which is referred to as con\xef\xac\x81rmation Blockchain Block 98 Transactions Block 99 Transactions Block 100 Transactions Block 101 Transactions Boolberry Solves CryptoNote Issues 3 \x0cBlock chain What does a block look like Simpli\xef\xac\x81ed block structure version info nonce previous block

transactions list by an identi\xef\xac\x81er calculated from both the transaction pre\xef\xac\x81x and su\xef\xac\x83x (ring signatures) Boolberry Solves CryptoNote Issues 5 \x0cThe Problem Bloated Blockchains Examination of the Boolberry block chain (28 Jul 2014) shows the average transaction size is 4065 bytes Calculations show ring signatures take up an average of 55% of that size And these calculations are for a block chain where mixins are not widely used yet When mixins are used ring signatures take up 60 90% of the transaction size Ordinary CryptoNote coins have to keep all the ring signatures since it is not possible to prove that a transaction belongs to a block without them Boolberry Solves CryptoNote Issues 6 \x0csolution Cut O\xef\xac\x80 the Ring Signatures Once a transaction gets a lot of con\xef\xac\x81rmations (say one year old transaction with hundreds of thousands con\xef\xac\x81rmations) the ring signature is no longer needed\xe2\x80\xa6 even if transaction\xe2\x80\x99s output is not spent yet So why not just cut it o\xef\xac\x80 Boolberry Solves CryptoNote Issues 7 \x0cLet\xe2\x80\x99s compare Ordinary CryptoNote Coin pre\xef\xac\x81x

hash using all Boolberry calculates transaction id hash using only the transaction pre\xef\xac\x81x Ring signatures are excluded from transaction id hash Boolberry Solves CryptoNote Issues 8 \x0cBlock

to talk about other more interesting/smart ways to do that) This feature will make Boolberry Block Chain at least 55% and up to 90% smaller than Ordinary CryptoNote coins Compact block chain produce faster synchronization for better user experience and convenience Boolberry Solves CryptoNote Issues 11 \x0cGuess what Boolberry is the most convenient modi\xef\xac\x81ed CryptoNote coin to date
