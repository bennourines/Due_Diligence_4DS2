for global payment www abjcoin org/ico | \x0cFeatures Of AbjCoin Blockchain technology Blockchain is the foundation of the AbjCoin and is the next \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial revolution\xe2\x80\x9d It is a decentralized system with enhanced security simple in design and inexpensive to operate The ledger system allows for transactions to be done with complete accuracy because it is a fusion of computer peer to peer (p2p) technology cryptography and database systems The fusion of these technologies will lead to a system that is immutable and irreversible meaning that transactions cannot be tampered with when signed and transferred Transactions become final and there is no double spending Cryptography is utilized for encrypting messages on the ledger but is significantly used for signing of transactions by users and to proof these transactions With cryptography blockchain does not require supplementary security solutions to protect the authenticity of transactions Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized and p2p nature means that the ledger eliminates the need for a data centre and a disaster recovery centre (DRC) or intermediaries that houses core systems 6 The Abjcoin white paper Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain solution for global payment www abjcoin org/ico | \x0c(POW/POS) The AbjCoin is a cryptocurrency that is built upon blockchain which is underpinned by the consensus mechanism called the Proof of work (POW)/ proof of stake(POS) The POW is similar to Proof of Stake (POS) with the main difference being that it integrates behavior trusted to be positive for the entire economy while POS derives importance from the user\xe2\x80\x98s account balance ABJ Coin major algorithm is that of Proof of Stake (POS) because it does not require large scale computing resources for maintaining the Blockchain The ABJ COIN network emphasizes security and trust less computing The AbjCoin blockchain is run by a network of nodes operating together in a p2p configuration The nodes record and verify transactions that are transmitted on the network At block time (periodic intervals) these transactions are grouped together and then go through a hashing process that connects them to previous blocks The network\xe2\x80\x99s participants are anonymous and there is no restriction on their caliber API (Application Programming Interface) The dot com era saw a number of startups grow into massive online agencies disrupting traditional means of buying and selling and creating more convenience and flexibility for users Sharing economy services like blockchain are continuing this tradition of disrupting industries through convenience and flexibility AbjCoin will continue this tradition of disruption in the financial industry as a single hub underpinned by the tokens issued through integration with our APIs Trade Market 7 ABJ coin major focus is to provide borderless means of payments between Nigeria and the rest of the world In doing this AbjCoin will provide an exchange market where it can be traded to different country\xe2\x80\x99s fiat currencies We intend to integrate AbjCoin as a payment processor this will enhance a mass adoption of AbjCoin among the parties involved in the transaction since there is a ready market where it can be traded and exchanged to fiat currencies Unlike other means of cryptocurrency exchange where it is been traded for Bitcoin AbjCoin will provide direct trade access to local fiat currencies helping indigenous currencies to thrive The Abjcoin white paper Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain solution for global
