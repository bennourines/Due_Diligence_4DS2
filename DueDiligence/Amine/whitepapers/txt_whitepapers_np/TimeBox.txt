 THE FIRST DECENTRALIZED CUSTODY 
 SERVICE OF DIGITAL ASSETS 
 
 There are many things in our lives that we hold 
 dear to our hearts from the valuables we own and 
 the investments we make to the memories and 
 objects which are immeasurable in value to us In 
 the maelstrom that is the digital age everyone 
 desires to keep valuable digital assets such as family 
 photos wills and cryptocurrencies in a manner that 
 would ensure their security accessibility and privacy 
 amidst the ever evolving and harrowing pitfalls in 
 this ecosystem 
 
 
 Cloud service is a centralized form of storage and 
 thus has many security flaws Important data has 
 been lost and celebrity photos are compromised 
 on a regular basis because a centralized storage 
 system is not a safe and everlasting data storage 
 solution 
 
 
 TimeBox is like a time capsule which utilizes 
 decentralized storage technology and smart 
 contracts Blockchain can keep our digital assets 
 forever on the Internet as long as the Internet 
 exists A smart con tract guarantees the storage of 
 precious assets to be delivered on time whenever 
 they re needed 
 
 
 TimeBox leverages blockchain technology with 
 guaranteed delivery service and is thus the key 
 solution to the needs or pains for everyone Timebox 
 is your best option for storing digital technology

 CHAPTER 1 
 BusinessScope 
 1 1 1 WHY CREATE TIMEBOX 
 
 
 Jacks mother was diagnosed with cancer through a 
 medical examination one day 15 years ago Jack 
 and his family arranged hospital admission for their 
 mother to receive treatment immediately in 
 accordance with medical advice The treatment 
 process in hospital went smoothly Jacks mother 
 recovered gradually which allowed the entire family 
 to relax slightly That very night when the doctor 
 announced that Jacks mother could return home 
 from hospital for recovery she passed away 
 suddenly in her sleep without a single word 
 
 
 What if Jacks mother had kept her last will bank 
 accounts access data and even digital assets organized 
 inside an on line private box Send out to 
 someone someday when it meets certain 
 conditions 
 
 There has been nothing perfect in the past and 
 nothing is as certain as the unexpected Nothing is 
 impossible in the world Nevertheless what people 
 are most afraid of are what rarely occurs of words 
 which are too late to say or things which are too 
 late to take care of 
 
 
 If there were an extremely simple effective and 
 affordable platform allowing anyone to store the 
 right words their precious images sounds or 
 documents as well as ensuring that their relatives 
 and friends would receive them at the right moment 
 how many possible regrets could be avoided 
 
 
 This kind of story happens to and around everyone 
 one story of regret after another It was the idea of 
 the founder to create a platform to do away with 
 this kind of regrets called TimeBox

 1 3 SOLUTIONS 
 
 
 1 3 1 DESIGN CONCEPT 
 
 
 1 Permanent storage 
 With the changing times storage will continue to change we want to provide sustainable 
 storage with blockchain technology 
 
 Personal data and privacy have always been important discussion subjects regarding 
 
 the Internet and TimeBox will disrupt key security and privacy identification areas for 
 the good of everyone involved 
 
 
 3 High security 
 Using the technical characteristics of 
 the blockchain and its decentralized backbone 
 the very nature of 
 TimeBox 
 will make hacking from both the inside and outside nigh 
 impossible 
 
 Store text audio photos video and of 
 course 
 your digital assets like cryptocurrency 
 without fear of 
 theft or loss TimeBox will be implemented through smart contracts on 
 the blockchain The deposited content will be subject to a contract and means of 
 delivery It will then be transmitted to the specified person at the appointed time Of 
 course you can assign yourself 
 or others as trustees as well

 1 3 2 STORE ANY DIGITIZED DATA WITH UNLIMITED STORAGE SPACE 
 We will provide an exclusive virtual TimeBox for each registered user Everyone can receive a 
 TimeBox once they have registered on the TimeBox platform Afterwards they ll be able to 
 safely place cryptocurrency text audio clips photos or videos inside Smart contracts on the 
 blockchain and sharding will be utilized to store information 
 1 3 3 CONVENIENT ACCESS AND RELIABLE WAY FOR DATA ENCRYPTION 
 Step 1 User loads digital assets into the TimeBox 
 Step 2 He configures the smart contract s conditions inside TimeBox and pays for the contract 
 Step 3 The contract is executed by our DATN (Decentralized Asset Trust Network) technology 
 Step 4 TimeBox replies with contract status and asks for a backup pass phase 
 Step 5 01 User retrieves digital assets through original wallet or pass phase 
 02 Transfer digital assets according to the contract Once the user completes 
 these five steps the contract stores the content properly and executes the 
 transfer at appointed time 
 HOW DOES IT WORK

 1 4 WHY DO WE NEED TO TRANSFER 
 
 
 MEMORY ASSETS TO THE 
 
 
 BLOCKCHAIN 
 
 
 At its core blockchain is based on the paradigms of decentralization non repudiation and 
 non tampering allowing it to provide higher security as a storage medium than traditional 
 centralized financial institutions It is the best form of storage and transfer tool for 
 posthumous papers private data and precious personal data The participants in these 
 systems form a decentralized management or trusted party network that provides useful 
 payment services This is a decentralized application of a wide range of Internet open 
 services It can completely solve the weaknesses of traditional digital asset trusteeship 
 services 
 
 
 Decentralization is the form of social relationship and content formation in the process of 
 Internet development It is a new network content production process relative to 
 Centralization Compared with the early Internet era today s web content is no longer 
 produced exclusively by professional websites or particular groups but instead it is the 
 result of co creation by all netizens enjoying equal rights Anyone can express his or her 
 opinions on the Internet or create original content and produce information together 
 
 
 With the diversification of network services the scope of a decentralized network model is 
 becoming more clear and realizable Any participant can submit content and Internet users 
 collaborate to create or contribute to the content It makes it easier and more diversified to 
 produce or contribute to the Internet thus enhancing the ability of Internet users to 
 participate in the initiative and simultaneously reduce the threshold of content production 
 Eventually each Internet user can become a small and independent information provider 
 making the Internet more diversified for content production

 Naming 
 
 The coin adopted in the TimeBox platform is called a 
 TimeBox Coin or TB Coin for short 
 
 Essence 
 
 As a virtual commodity (just like the game 
 points ) TB Coin does not belong to the category 
 of investment products The value of it is 
 determined completely by the market rules and its 
 
 13 
 
 widespread usage In the meantime the coin s liquidity across various digital asset 
 exchanges may be different So there will be leaving room for certain liquidity risks In 
 addition to that TB Coin will actually be regarded as the virtual payment currency in the 
 TimeBox platform

 2 3 PROTOCOL AND INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 TimeBox Coin (Abbreviation TB Coin or TimeBox Coin) is a general virtual coin for the 
 Memory Blockchain Asset Trust Bank TimeBox users need to pay TimeBox Coins to 
 take advantage of offered services and miners who support the fragmentation of 
 TimeBox can receive a specific amount of Time Box Coin as a reward TimeBox Coin is 
 a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market 
 The market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol coin (also called TB Coin) 
 which miners earn by providing storage to clients Conversely clients spend TB Coin 
 hiring miners to store or distribute data As with Bitcoin TB Coin miners compete to 
 mine blocks with sizeable rewards but TB Coin mining power is proportional to active 
 storage which directly provides a useful service to clients This creates a powerful 
 incentive for miners to amass as much storage as they can and rent it out to clients 
 The protocol weaves these amassed resources into a self healing storage network that 
 anybody in the world can rely on The network achieves robustness by replicating and 
 dispersing content while automatically detecting and repairing replica failures Clients 
 can select replication parameters to protect against different threat models The 
 protocols cloud storage network also provides security as content is encrypted end toend 
 on the client s side while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys 
 TB Coin serves as a storage infrastructure for memory assets It is especially useful for 
 decentralizing data building and running distributed applications and implementing 
 smart contracts 
 
 
 TimeBox Coin is a work in progress Active research is under way and new versions of 
 this paper will appear on timebox network For comments and suggestions contact us 
 at timebox network 
 
 
 2 4 TIMEBOX COIN ECONOMY 
 
 
 MODEL 
 
 
 1 All TimeBox users who deposit more than 1000 TB Coins into the TimeBox Platform 
 will be able to use the service free of charge For this to work the accounts balance 
 must be kept at over 1000 TB coins the quantity will be checked daily These 1000 
 TB coins will be locked up for a specific amount of time during which the user will 
 make use of the service for free 
 For example A voluntary coin lockup for 3 months entitles the user to free usage of 
 the TimeBox service for the same amount of time 3 months 
 17 
 
 The minimum lockup period is 3 months The maximum is lifetime (Limited to 
 some value added services which are still in the design phase ) 
 
 
 2 TimeBox s users will need to pay a usage fee in TB Coins A small percentage of 
 TB Coins will be burned which could potentially increase demand for the 
 remaining TB Coin over the course of time 
 
 
 
 An estimated 15% of usage fees will be allocated to pay for gas/miners needed to 
 create and deploy the user s contract 
 An estimated 35% of usage fees will be allocated to pay for the long term smart 
 contract operation and decentralized file storage 
 
 
 
 
 
 The remaining 50% will be used by the platform for maintenance and 
 development including marketing and any unexpected costs as needed 
 
 
 3 All of TimeBox s users can also pay the usage fees in fiat (USD) 
 
 
 
 Estimate 13 5% will paid by TB Coin for gas/miners needed to create and deploy 
 the user s contract 
 
 
 
 
 
 Estimate 31 5% will paid by TB Coin as the long term smart contract operation 
 and decentralized file storage 
 
 
 
 
 Estimate 55% will used by the platform for maintenance and development 
 including marketing and can be spent at any time 
 
 
 4 The total amount of TB Coin burned in each transaction is directly proportional to the 
 decreasing supply It will also depend on the exchange rate(s) set by the network 
 which will oversee the available supply market conditions and inform the smart 
 contract of exchange rates at each particular moment of payment 
 5 The increase in token rates is determined by the TB Coin usage and the TB Coin 
 deposit for which is necessary to have a contract in the system As a result the 
 number of TB Coins in the market will gradually decrease In addition as the number 
 of system users increases that will help speed up the TB Coin s decrease rate

 Basically a smart contract is a contract of perfor mance It 
 performs duties according to the terms it is coded for The 
 smart contract uses the program code to set the terms of 
 the agreement and then allows it to perform its action For 
 example if you want the payment to be sent immediately 
 after some action is completed the smart contract will 
 perform this basic operation 
 The syntax of the IF THEN statements ensures that the 
 contract is pushed forward and the match condition order 
 is executed Smart contracts provide an automated way to 
 operate blockchain businesses and their settings are very 
 similar to the way bitcoin transactions occur In addition a 
 smart contract is easy to manage and monitor because of 
 its operation on the public chain Due to record and 
 program code setting the basic management of the 
 contract can be carried out Memory blockchain can be 
 used in conjunction with smart contracts thereby revealing 
 immediate benefits How can a memory blockchain be 
 useful in the field of smart contracts A smart contract is 
 needed to write the terms of the agreement and then a 
 distributed ledger system is necessary to ensure that all 
 parties are able to execute the smart contract terms

 3 1 1 BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESS 
 
 
 Blockchain business is growing and more mainstream companies are signing contracts 
 but this does not mean that operating on the blockchain is suitable for every endeavor 
 Therefore the smart contracts provide a great complement to the traditional form of 
 contract Due to the public ledger aspects of blockchain business users can publicly 
 review different versions of contracts Another advantage of the system is that users don t 
 have to worry about one of them accidentally changing the contract As a result of its 
 publicity implementation changes don t depend on what a single party can do A smart 
 contract can add a protocol to an automated third party to ensure that everything is done 
 properly and according to the terms set In addition some countries recognize the legality 
 of smart contracts so the legitimacy of electronic signatures and commercial electronic 
 records is already being gradually conceded by law This is a trend that will only grow as 
 time goes by 
 
 
 3 1 2 AUTOMATIC DELIVERY OF SMART CONTRACT 
 
 
 One of the great advantages of Smart Contracts is the aspect of automatic delivery 
 execution rendering continually checking and keeping a list of transactions impractical 
 Instead you can set up your Smart Contracts can be set up to automate processing If you 
 have an intellectual property right to reach an agreement you can set your own usage fee 
 automatically pay the usage fee and in each use in a proper proportion of distribution 
 People can write a Smart Contract to automatically send payment and place it in all 
 applicable accounts without having to restart and be able to complete all operations 
 
 
 3 2 TIMEBOX OPERATION 
 
 
 3 2 1 THE TIMEBOX OPERATION IN DISTRIBUTED DATA STORAGE 
 
 
 Blockchain is the driving force behind distributed data storage peer to peer transmission 
 consensus mechanisms and encryption algorithms The blockchain is a distributed ledger 
 and the decentralized protocol between the nodes of the blockchain maintains the basis of 
 operation Decentralization will give rise to a huge demand for distributed data storage 
 systems Construction or and operation of data centers in the future will reduce capital 
 spending there by diminishing storage costs

 After deployment of such a decentralized system the entire network will become a 
 network where no one can make a single effort to make changes Therefore memory 
 blockchain has the advantage of decentralization and tamper proof data integrity DATN 
 (Decentralized Asset Trust Network) Decentralization meanwhile is pushing the power 
 to execute contracts and manage assets to the edges of the network creating a 
 proliferation of new access points DATN allows you to use your devices to store data 
 inside the blockchain 
 
 
 3 2 2 TIMEBOX STORAGE PROTOCOL 
 
 
 TimeBox protocol that allows arbitrarily complex financial transactions to be encoded by 
 anyone and executed in a provably accurate manner by a distributed network 
 TimeBox provides a plan for network of independent storage providers to offer storage 
 and retrieval services Furthermore we present the TimeBox protocol as an auditable and 
 verifiable DATN construction TimeBox storage protocol constitutes a useful Proof of 
 Work system based on the stored data found on the storage provider In order for clients 
 to store data on the DATN PUT requests must be sent out conversely in order to 
 retrieve data from the DATN GET requests must be sent out

 Any user can participate in the TimeBox network as a Client a Storage Miner and/or a 
 Retrieval Miner Clients pay to store data and to retrieve data from the DATN via Put and 
 Get requests Smart contracts for managing memory blockchains have been put to use 
 by many technology companies The platform of these ledger companies can easily 
 create and execute contracts without the development of extensive professional 
 knowledge of blockchain coding By using smart contracts one can definitively be sure 
 that stipulated terms will be implemented This is a way to publicly monitor protocols 
 and ensure everything goes according to plan 
 
 
 3 3 OPEN SOURCE 
 
 
 A community is an organization and group for work life or common goals A free 
 software community wants to grow and many like minded people are required to 
 participate The global village has become a large community since the advent of the 
 Internet era and as part of it we want to uphold its spirit Open source technology is the 
 ultimate goal we hope to achieve When the day comes we ll rely on people s will to 
 express their kindness and wish to be part of something truly great thus continuing to 
 relay and contribute to the betterment of TimeBox TimeBox will endure for as long as it 
 is needed

 TimeBox in other platforms Other blockchain systems such as Bitcoin allow developers 
 to write smart contracts however these platforms provide very little storage capability 
 and at a very high cost We plan to provide an all inclusive solution to bring storage and 
 retrieval support to these platforms 
 
 
 FUTURE WORK 
 
 
 The future work presents a clear and cohesive path towards the construction of the 
 memory blockchain network however we also consider this work to be the starting point 
 for future research on decentralized storage systems Our commitment stretches far 
 beyond the release of the current structure also comprising proposals on eradicating 
 open issues and suggestions that meaningfully improve current protocols The following 
 list encompasses some of the key areas we are focusing on 
 
 
 
 Implementable TimeBox protocol specification 
 TimeBox in Ethereum interface contracts and protocols 
 The topics of blockchain and artificial intelligence will be analyzed for collaboration in 
 future 
 Memory Blockchain archives and records management 
 ULTIMATE GOAL AND SUSTAINABLE SERVICE 
 
 
 Blockchain will be applied to any field in the future which will have a tremendous impact 
 on human life The main system of TimeBox plans to adopt an open platform to ensure 
 that the holder of a private key can still use the applications developed in this platform to 
 retrieve the digital assets in case of any natural disasters or occurences which result in 
 the disappearance of TimeBoxs operating company TimeBox projects are broadly 
 divided into existential proofs smart contracts identity verification asset transactions 
 archival storage send and receive data APIs and so on Through more people s 
 participation we ll make TimeBox work better and make the people feel safe and secure

 MANAGEMENT 
 
 
 6 1 1 KNOWN RISKS OF BLOCKCHAIN 
 
 
 Smart Contract 
 
 
 There may also be circumstances which result in 
 attackers taking advantage of eventual defects to steal extort 
 or withhold money and like all software crimes the impact of 
 such attacks can be quite serious In a sense it is no different 
 from common applications or websites and there are 
 loopholes or mechanisms that are vulnerable to fraud 
 Therefore the safety supervisor must expand the 
 existing security protection mechanism incorporate the 
 smart contract and smart assets and incorporate the 
 risk of asymptotic failure into the organizational tolerance 
 
 
 Lost Key 
 
 
 A major feature of blockchain technology is 
 irreversibility and insurmountable impediments to forgery 
 Both of these benefits rely on the premise that the private key 
 is kept safe The private key is generated by each user and it 
 falls solely within the owner s responsibility to ensure its 
 safeguarding 
 
 
 In theory there is no third party involved so once the private 
 key is lost the user won t be able to do any operations on the 
 assets of the account Multi signature can solve part of this 
 problem but the implementation is very complex 
 Furthermore designing and matching the use of secret key 
 management system is very complex 
 
 
 Extensibility 
 
 
 Corporate information security in a safe and scalable method 
 to ensure the success of blockchain in the next few years 
 Although the blockchain may benefit from its scalability in the 
 future it is still regarded as a risk at present Accomplished 
 researchers are trying to make the blockchain break away 
 from the traditional distributed consensus mechanisms and 
 develop various options for scalable patterns 
 
 
 43
 
 6 2 CRYPTOCURRENCY RISKS 
 
 
 1 
 VULNERABILITY OF TRADING PLATFORM 
 Virtually all cryptocurrencies have no issuing subject and lack the effective supervision 
 of governmental regulators Furthermore the trading platforms they re exchanged on 
 are usually built by individuals or companies These platforms are continuously 
 exposed to both hacking attacks and unexpected shutdowns for arbitrary periods of 
 time 
 
 
 2 
 THE VALUE IS UNSTABLE AND FLUCTUATES GREATLY 
 The exchange rate of cryptocurrencies is determined by market demand and is 
 extremely unstable moreover the involvement of a large number of speculators can 
 and usually does lead to great fluctuations in the exchange rate of cryptocurrencies 
 bringing along huge volatility risks to investors with it 
 
 
 Low approval Fiat money has a strict liquidation guarantee system The 
 decentralization of cryptocurrency makes it have no guarantee not protected by any 
 government 
 
 
 3 
 DEFLATION RISK 
 The supply rate of cryptocurrency is determined by the an algorithm it has nothing to 
 do with market demand and economic development Its supply may not be able to keep 
 pace with economic development which is likely to produce deflation A 
 cryptocurrency which is prone to deflation is unlikely to become the currency of the 
 future 
 
 
 4 
 LEGAL AND POLICY RISK 
 The very nature of cryptocurrency goes hand in hand with decentralization Since there 
 is no single issuer nothing besides a regulatory trading platform can shield an 
 anonymous concealed crypto market from illegal transactions aiming to successfully 
 launder money transfer bribes/assets or fund terrorist plots 
 Without any supervision 
 and protection mechanisms no single institution can be held accountable for eventual 
 crimes forcing depositors and investors to bear all the risks themselves 
 Once 
 cryptocurrencies pose a solid threat to fiat money governments may simply declare 
 any carried out transactions illegal and close the case on grounds of systematic risk 
 consideration

 6 3 TIMEBOX PROJECT RISK 
 
 
 TB Coin is not an investment 
 No one can guarantee in fact there is no reason to certainly believe that the TB 
 Coins you buy will increase in value or at some point may go down in value 
 
 
 1 The project may be subject to a shortage of funds in the process 
 2 TimeBox is still at a very early stage containing significant risks including but not 
 limited to technology law policy operation risk management 
 3 The TimeBox team will do their best but it can neither guarantee the success of the 
 project nor that the price of TB Coin will constitute investment income 
 4 TB Coin online trading platform has not yet been determined 
 5 The risk of losing TB Coin stems among other factors and occurences from the 
 possibility of losing the security key 
 6 The risk of an unfriendly regulatory bill in one or more judicial departments 
 Blockchain technology has been carefully reviewed by various regulatory authorities 
 around the world TB Coin may be affected by one or more regulatory requirements or 
 bills 
 7 The development of TimeBox cannot avert and diminish every single risk that buyers 
 may expect According to the actual situation of TB Coin its development of TB Coin 
 may experience significant deviation from the current planning The buyer s 
 expectations for TB Coin regarding full functionality may lead to delays affecting the 
 expected release date Other reasons including changes in design and in the 
 execution plans and implementation are just as likely to lead to delays in release 
 8 There is a risk of being hacked and losing funds to theft 
 Hackers or institutions with malevolent intent may try to steal TB Coins by any 
 possible means This includes but is not limited to service denial attacks malicious 
 malware attacks or attacks based on consensus mechanism 
 9 There is a risk of obsolescence in the field of cryptography potentially in the form of 
 a major break through 
 The progress of cryptography or the advancement of technology like for example 
 the development of quantum computers may bring risks to the cryptocurrencies 
 resulting in a contingent loss of TB Coin to to cyberlarceny 
 
 
 45
 
 10 Market risks with insufficient liquidity of TB Coin 
 There are no exchanges TB Coin can currently be tradedon 
 11 There is no insurance to cover loss risk 
 Unlike a bank account or other financial institution TB Coin doesn t have 
 insurance When the value of its underlying coin is missing there is no insurance 
 company that allows the purchaser to claim be reimbursed 
 12 The risk of TimeBox project dissolution 
 There may be countless reasons including but not limited to the downward 
 fluctuations in the value of TB Coin or the failure of business relations that may 
 result in TimeBox not maintaining full functionality and leading to its dissolution

 globally in revenue terms the amount of money laundered would make it the third largest 
 industry
