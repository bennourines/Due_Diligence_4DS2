Blockchain 6 3 4 Asset Details 7 3 5 Management Team 7 Conclusion 7 \x0cExecutive Summary NPCoin is a peer to peer (P2P) cryptocurrency designed with the target to serve the utility and remittance market in Southeast Asian Region There are 10 countries in the Southeast Asian comprising of Indonesia Malaysia Singapore Thailand Philippines Brunei Vietnam Laos Myanmar and Cambodia This is a developing region with growing population it is indeed an important labour resources supply countries to the world market The utility payment culture in this region are in transition from traditional cash payments over the counters to online banking transfer Every household has numerous of utilities bills to settle every months ranging from electricity water sewerage cable TV internet mobile telecommunication bills and etc Residents and visitors around the world also need a convenient way to reload to local phone and data lines These involve huge monetary and big data transaction every day We see the needs for an utility coin as payment medium to ease these monthly routine NPCoin is designed with crypto blockchain technology to serve the role with enhance security and efficiency as compared to other conventional payment methods NPCoin uses a hybrid design of Proof of Work (PoW) mining and Proof of Stake (PoS) minting All coins were premined using PoW method while PoS take charge for the coin distribution and block validation The hybrid system complement each others for more security reduce electricity consumption need no special hardware create no energy wastage and is environmental friendly NPCoin can be traded and transact among the peer to peer network conveniently NPCoins allow non tech savvy individual to enjoy the conveniences and benefits of cryptocurrency We foresee value appreciation of NPCoins with the growing popularity and demands from more users in any geographical location in near future 1 \x0c2 0 Overview on Cryptocurrencies A cryptocurrency is a digital asset or digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency It uses peer to peer* (P2P) technology to operate with no central authority Cryptocurrency is gaining its popularity and importance as a substitute mode of payments against fiat currencies* Value can be transacted between participants on a decentralised computer networks with relatively minor transaction fees as compare to conventional wired transferring methods is secure time efficient and protect privacy Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009 it set the benchmark for digital currencies Bitcoin and most of the cryptocurrencies use Proof of Work (PoW) protocols to solve difficult algorithms as the backbone of mining and security model Acquisition of external hardware is essential for effective mining and huge consumption of electricity is needed These create energy wastage and involve huge operational costs Another method is the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol which is based on coin age to generate node via a hashing scheme that do not consume much energy Security level of network is not dependent on energy consumption in long term thus providing an energy efficient and more cost competitive P2P cryptocurrency 2 \x0c3 0 About NPCoin 3 1 Cashless Community NPCoin is designed for the convenience cost effective and time efficient usage among the peer to peer community Traditionally utility payment hubs operate either using fiat money or point system It is a one way flow of the payment channel and you need local fiat currency for transaction It is limit by geographical barrier and incur substantial fees for cross borders payment NPCoin has ready payment hub for utilities payments peers can pay their routine bills and/or reload telco airtime by using NPCoin directly The value of NPCoin will convert into local currency and thus eliminate the hassle of third party money changer and currency exchange In current virtual point system merchants or users might have difficulties in identifying the real points in circulation and thus its normally being centralize controlled and can only be used once It cannot be widely transferred from one merchant to another because no trustworthy public checking system to preserve its dignity In contrast once a merchant accepts NPCoin from a customer the merchant can still use NPCoin at other merchants Even if the merchants is not interested in any use case offered by NPCoin he can still sell at crypto exchange and get value of of the sales NPCoin\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s objective is to encourage and assisting the conventional utility payment users to transform and/or upgrade to a cashless community The world is going green and cryptocurrency has provide a smart secure and convenience option for your daily usage 3 \x0c3 2 Hybrid design of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) NPCoin uses a hybrid design of PoW and PoS protocol PoW initiate the coin generation and POS take charge for the coin distribution and transaction validation to achieve the distributed consensus PoW is a validation system based on work of some kind occurred NPCoin uses SHA 256 Algorithm which is the same as Bitcoin to initiate the processor block and premined 100% from PoW hardware mining One serious threat to new and young PoW coins is the 51% network attack* due to the low mining hashrate and high block production at the early stage 51% attack will further lead to double spend and is damaging to the whole eco system NPCoin opted for 100% premine to safeguard from this mining power attacks The eco system in NPCoin is then being maintained by PoS method The aim is to preserve a safer network because attack has become more expensive every attack is associated with own stake of NPCoins if a hacker would like to buy 51% of the total number of coins the market will react by fast price appreciation Thus this is a lost lost scenario and non profit making PoS means a form of proof of ownership (stake) of the currency Coin age consumed by a transaction can be considered a form of PoS Coin age is simply defined as currency amount times holding period (number of coins X number of days hold) These concepts were first introduced by Mr Sunny King in October 2011 to counter the energy wastage issue entailed from PoW method Proof of stake is a different way to validate transactions based and achieve the distributed consensus It is still an algorithm and the purpose is the same of the proof of work but the process to reach the goal is quite different With Proof of Stake the new block is chosen depending on its stake and holding time 4 \x0cIn PoW miners compete among hashrate to confirm transactions and to secure the network to earn block rewards In PoS all the digital currencies are previously created at the beginning and their number never changes this means that in the PoS system there is no block reward Validators (same as miners in PoW) play the role to validate the transactions and earn transaction fees Every validator must own a stake in the network Staking involves depositing and holding an amount of NPCoin in the system so as to have a chance of being selected to validate blocks of transactions and get rewarded for doing so In NPCoin coins are premined and being distributed to the Peer members in accordance to the minting package they subscribed Each minting package is equipped with a virtual processor and an Index block which specifies the total number of NPCoins stake owner is going to obtain in an unknown minting timeframe determined by the blocks submission Once the total number of NPCoins have been completely filled up the Basic Index block is deemed as expired and will be obsoleted This PoS minting block enable stake owner of NPCoins to mint NPCoins based on the consumed coin age In every block the minting index will indicate the total quantity of NPcoins that will be distributed to that block For example in a minting block with 200% minting index 1 NPCoin input will become 2 units of NPCoin upon maturity in an uncertain time frame depends on the hash target The hash target is the target per unit coin age to receive another coin i e the time frame require to distribute a coin into the minting block The hash target difficulties will be increasing overtime when more coins are in circulation Every coin submitted to minting block will reduce the circulating supply from the Total Supply thus maintaining the ecosystem of Demand and Supply 5 \x0c3 3 The Block Chain The blockchain is the digital ledger in which transactions made in cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly and can be processed by decentralised computers This decentralised ledger keeps a record of each transaction that occurs across a fully distributed peer to peer network either public or private Blockchain system is governing the transaction administration through mathematical algorithms which convert the information in an encrypted block and only readable with the correct key All transactions data and blocks information are maintained in blockchain NPCoin uses SHA 256 Algorithm which is the same as Bitcoin to initiate the processor block and premined 100% from PoW method Thereafter the network distribution consensus is maintained by coin holders via PoS validation protocal and eco minting process The NPCoin network consumes far less energy and rewards users in more sustainable ways 3 3 Asset Details The total number of NPCoin is finite to preserve its precious value and benefits The asset details of NPCoin is as
