b Atlas Protocol Light Paper Defining blockchain interactive adver tising & marketing version 0 9 1 2019 05 30 \x0cMotivation With the rapid growth of the Blockchain industry we are seeing continuous rollouts of blockchain projects However as of today there is very little interaction can be done on blockchain other than balance transfers Even though we have Smart Contracts that enables Dapps a good mechanism for information transferring and discovery is still to be de\xef\xac\x81ned There are prior attempts trying to solve digital advertising\xe2\x80\x99s problem with Blockchain technology however Blockchain economy has its own advertising problem to be solved It is impractical to promote Blockchain projects in Internet since digital advertising industry can not pro\xef\xac\x81le Blockchain addresses and current Blockchain could not support complicated interactions required by advanced advertising practices Hence a better infrastructure is needed to help de\xef\xac\x81ne ways of identifying activating users and conveying information along with value Nebulas Labs (Nebulabs) and xGoogler Blockchain Alliance (xGBA) has jointly incubated Atlas Protocol (ATP) to close this gap in the blockchain ecosystem ATP is tasked to build a Blockchain native interactive marketing infrastructure so to enable information \xef\xac\x82ow freely on chain and also to explore new ways of on chain interactions 1 \x0cProtocol Overview Atlas Protocol proposed a new Blockchain native media for value ranking and circulation via advertising ATP aims to connect advertiser publishers(e g DApps) Blockchain users with on chain interactions via Atlas Ads TIE ATR UDI Atlas Protocol components includes \xe2\x96\xa0 Transaction Interactive Element (TIE) Interactive elements build on top of Blockchain transactions \xe2\x96\xa0 Atlas Targeting Rank (ATR) Value ranking mechanism based on on chain activities \xe2\x96\xa0 User Data Protection & Incentives (UDI) Mechanism to protect user privacy from abuse as well as include users into the value circulation by rewarding user for engaging in on chain interactions 2 \x0cProtocol Transaction Interactive Element In Atlas Protocol Transaction Interactive Element (TIE) de\xef\xac\x81nes a generic structure for users on Blockchain to interact with each others besides transfer transactions It is worth noting that TIE also de\xef\xac\x81nes how one can proactively reach other Blockchain users on chain with information and interaction intent The protocol itself de\xef\xac\x81nes \xe2\x97\x8f Generic interaction structures that could be specialized for different scenarios \xe2\x97\x8f TIE data structure and related storage & transportation guidance \xe2\x97\x8f How to Interpret TIE data in end user facing channels \xe2\x97\x8f Smart Contract interfaces for record TIE interaction data on Blockchain Address Brand Advertising Address AD TIE Survey & Voting Viral marketing Address Tx Hash cd48\xe2\x80\xa6

Blockchain network and make sure it reaches the most wanted audience Smart Contract Addr ATR de\xef\xac\x81nes a value ranking mechanism for addresses that is Address A Address B \xe2\x97\x8f Based on on chain activities of addresses \xe2\x97\x8f Specialized for advertising \xe2\x97\x8f Used to increase the overall ROI of on chain promotions Addr Every address\xe2\x80\x99 ATR value is updated periodically and relatedness among user and multiple ad candidates are calculated dynamically during ad match Addr Smart Contract 4 \x0cProtocol User Data Protection & Incentives Atlas Protocol ascertains that user data belongs to user themselves and value user contributed data through interaction as their contribution to the ecosystem to be rewarded AD Hence in User Data Protection & Incentives (UDI) the protocol speci\xef\xac\x81es the follow details \xe2\x97\x8f Ways of using Blockchain technology and other security measures to ensure user data privacy including that ATP user pro\xef\xac\x81ling will not use risky traditional technologies such as Cookies \xe2\x97\x8f Mechanism to make sure ATP applications complaint with data protection regulations such as GDPR \xe2\x97\x8f Guidelines for distributing incentives to user to acknowledge their data contribution 5 \x0cUse Cases Atlas Smartdrop In the era of Blockchain advertising Airdrop is a new way of promotion that native to Blockchain however current solutions all rely on Internet for spreading the word and does not have good targeting hence are costly and ine\xef\xac\x83cient With Atlas Smartdrop one can rely on ATR for selecting targeted audience on chain base on their need and proactively reach out to onchain addresses with information engagement intent as well as token rewards hence making the whole process highly e\xef\xac\x83cient yields great ROI AirDrop (Before Atlas) \xe2\x97\x86 Human curated \xe2\x97\x86 Spreaded \xe2\x97\x86 Low ROI \xe2\x80\xa6 ress List d d a t o
