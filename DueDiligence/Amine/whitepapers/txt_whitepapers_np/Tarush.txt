better speed of transactions network security and transparency TARUSH has emerged to make a difference The certainty of the blockchain as a major milestone in the push by mankind for greater control over personal fortune and direction is a landmark Paying attention to the weight of disillusionment with the traditional commercial financial and transactional algorithms across the globe it is clear that the blockchain route cannot be ignored The utility of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in our world today surely point in the direction of greater adoption and consideration There is an increased demand and yearning for faster processing methodologies decentralized approach assured security and usability No other pathway seems to make all these expectations possible in today\xe2\x80\x99s world like blockchain innovation This is where TARUSH makes an entry TARUSH is an upcoming cryptocurrency project focused on privacy scalability and fungibility that is built by implementing a MimbleWimble blockchain with some various optimizations The choice of MimbleWimble as the governing protocol is informed by its privacy advantages 5 \x0c1 The MimbleWimble Protocol MimbleWimble was developed by in July 2016 by Tom Elvis Jedusor to take the privacy concerns of cryptocurrency proponents into consideration The first steps to MinbleWimble derived from the work of Adam Brock who conceived confidential transactions in order to encrypt the sending and receiving of bitcoins Block N 2 Block N 1 MW tracsactions Block N Blocks are formed with TX cut through and all inputs and outputs are mixed MW TXs still have input/output information The primary ingredient for the working of MimbleWimble is the use of blinding factors The use of blinding factors essentially involves a random value chosen to encrypt the transactional value of bitcoin This is determined by the sender as the transaction is initiated What needs to be taken note of here is that the blinding factor should be able to encrypt the transactional value without altering the input and expected output of such transactions In terms of value determination this is how it works If v is the value of a transaction input or output and H a point on the elliptic curve C we can simply embed v*H instead of vin a transaction This works because using the ECC operations we can still validate that the sum of the outputs of a transaction equals the sum of inputs 6 \x0cv1 + v2 = v3 => v1*H + v2*H = v3*H Verifying this property on every transaction allows the protocol to verify that a transaction doesn\xe2\x80\x99t create money out of thin air without knowing what the actual values are However there are a finite number of usable values (transaction amounts) and one could try every single one of them to guess the value of your transaction In addition knowing v1 (from a previous transaction for example) and the resulting v1*H reveals all outputs with value v1 across the blockchain For these reasons we introduce a second point G on the same elliptic curve (practically G is just another generator point on the same curve group as H) and a private key r used as a blinding factor An input or output value in a transaction can then be expressed as r*G + v*H \xe2\x80\xa2 r is a private key used as a blinding factor G is a point on the elliptic curve C and their product r*G is the public key for r (using G as generator point) \xe2\x80\xa2 v is the value of an input or output and H is another point on the elliptic curve C together producing another public key v*H (using H as generator point) Generating a private key as a blinding factor for each input value and replacing each value with their respective Pedersen Commitments in the previous equation we obtain (ri1*G + vi1*H) + (ri2*G + vi2*H) = (ro3*G + vo3*H) Which as a consequence requires that ri1 + ri2 = ro3 This is the first pillar of MimbleWimble the arithmetic required to validate a transaction can be done without knowing any of the values 7 \x0c2 Decentralized Governance Protocol In the modern economy decentralization has a major impact on financial activities since people do not want to depend on one another and are eager to get things done as quickly as possible Every crypto venture offers decentralization and hence provides several perks to the community What\xe2\x80\x99s different about Tarush is that it focusses on enhancing the \xe2\x80\x98extent\xe2\x80\x99 of decentralization and efficiency offered by the pioneering crypto Before exploring it in detail it is important to understand as to what is a Decentralized Governance Protocol See we have emphasized it multiple times in the whitepaper that Tarush firmly believes in taking power from centralized authorities and distributing it among the masses It implies that all the propositions regarding a \xe2\x80\x98change\xe2\x80\x99 and its implementation must come from the community Even though it is quite a trendy notion these days and is being adopted at a massive scale the \xe2\x80\x98decision making\xe2\x80\x99 protocol can never be 100% perfect and therefore it stays under discussion at all instances and the scope for its efficiency always exists It should be noted that all of the crypto based ventures like Tarush have the following three areas which are highly dependent on DGP 8 \x0c1 Funding governance where should the funds go 2 Consensus mechanism the algorithm/protocol used by the nodes to agree upon the state of the blockchain 3 Project governance everything else related to the venture It is very easy to understand that decision making remains an easy process if there are fewer members involved But when the number of users surges (or the network scales) there must be a comprehensive protocol that keeps everything aligned with the perspective In an overcrowded network the decisions should be made efficiently and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s input must be weighed in equally as it would have been done in the case of fewer users In a nutshell scalability should not haunt the decision making process Unfortunately in most of the networks it has become quite slow However with the help of MimbleWimble blockchain Tarush uses an optimized approach to scale the user base As a result the decision making process on our platform is several times more efficient than our significant others Is it important to have a Decentralized Governance Protocol Yes it is Even though cryptocurrency happens to be a great innovation it is basically technology and a result of programming \xe2\x80\x93 both of these things can never produce a \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99 product There is always scope for improvement for bringing more efficiency and security We can only weig tworks in relative terms For instance when the BTC was launched about a decade ago there was no other venture to compare it with and hence at that time it was the best most secure and efficient cryptocurrency However with the passage of time the industry has derived more robust algorithms and protocols which are way ahead of Bitcoin in terms of technology 9 \x0cIt is worth mentioning that when a crypto user suggests a change it is mutually agreed upon by the majority of the network and is then implemented with the help of a fork let it be a loophole related to security efficiency privacy scalability or any latest feature that a community might be interested to incorporate Two of the big giants in the industry (BTC and ETH) have both gone through several soft forks which were necessary in order to address some security concerns at one point or another Since we are using MimbleWimble blockchain our solution can also be integrated with the root BTC network for enhancing its efficiency in terms of scalability (out of many other salient features) Having said that we are fully aware of the fact that soft forks must be avoided Of course when a new change is being implemented it can cause a whole new set of inconsistencies while fixing a single bug Therefore developers must always ensure that they put in quality time for rolling out a decent project in the first production phase The business perspective Regardless of the fact that we have been hearing about cryptocurrencies for nearly a decade now it is important to realize that the entire infrastructure is based upon blockchain which is a rapidly changing technology Therefore this industry is still running towards achieving a certain level of \xe2\x80\x98maturity\xe2\x80\x99 10 \x0cHowever one crucial thing to be noted here is that cryptocurrencies have a lot in common with equity markets although the technology is completely different Keeping that in mind we must recall that there are very specific stakeholder structures for investment schemes and they have plenty of similarities with the governance model as implemented in blockchain protocols For instance both of them are interested in decentralizing the decision making bodies in order to take away the veto power from a couple of cherry picked executives Secondly equity markets and crypto ventures are sharply inclined towards safeguarding the rights of investors and they even spend millions of dollars annually for researching this department In many corporate and blockchain based governance systems the monetary value is at stake when we talk about individuals To understand it in a better way just assume that a few selective people make the decisions in a crypto network Now who happens to be at the immediate risk Of course the layman using a wallet on the same network is venturing his investment As a result of this major concern the overall environment (for investors) is effected and the payment protection process is looked upon with raised eyebrows Therefore it is very important to understand that investors in any cryptocurrency project must enjoy the same set of rights as compared with any company shareholder This is because their profit loss and interests can be affected proportionally if there is any change in the network through a DGP 11 \x0cIt should be noted that when a selective group of top tier management is tasked with making decisions millions of investors using the cryptocurrency are affected They could be victimized and that is not the thing we want at Tarush The industry has seen many bad examples in the recent past For instance when BTC\xe2\x80\x99s core team took a strong stance and decided to change the block size many investors were outrageous and their differences lead to a major fork which created a new token called Bitcoin Cash The myth and problems engulfing the pioneering cryptocurrencies Some people have still not understood the concept right even after observing the crypto and investing in it for about a decade There are several myths about it and quite often a sudden hype in the discussion of speculation leads to an unexpected and unjustified fluctuation in token\xe2\x80\x99s value For instance many people believe that since cryptocurrencies happen to be decentralized they do not have any \xe2\x80\x98governance\xe2\x80\x99 protocol They think that the \xe2\x80\x98code\xe2\x80\x99 of the venture should be made the law \xe2\x80\x93 that sounds quite illogical right What\xe2\x80\x99s important to note here is that every blockchain possesses a human like governance protocol that only executes when the community decides to have a voting session for an upgrade or addition of a feature to the platform Even if we view it from the perspective of the myth believers and stand on a common ground that the code must act as a law in all cryptocurrencies it must be realized that all codes have bugs and it is only a matter of time before someone exploits the loophole Therefore it is important to roll out updates to that \xe2\x80\x98law\xe2\x80\x99 periodically such that the power remains decentralized and the network is securer than before Please note that even though BTC and ETH have brought a revolution in the industry they have very outdated and from a couple of aspects \xe2\x80\x98faulty\xe2\x80\x99 governance models If we talk about Bitcoin there are less than 5 mining pools which have cornered the market with ASICs Moreover the fee has also surged up several times and in some transactions it is roughly equivalent to what the banks offer There are several scalability solutions in the market like Lightning Network but they are merely acting as banks and are prone to censorships and attacks by the competitors 12 \x0cExecutive Nodes Legislature Miners transmit mined blocks via nodes Judiciary The Senate Miners Developers Developers send code for miners and nodes to choose to run House of Reps Business & Infrastructure Community Businesses can support code development and devs can contribute to business goals Businesses send transactions to miners via nodes Some users run nodes themselves Users use businesses to interact with the network The Users/Community A very rough and simplistic diagram of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s governance model Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s model is much more decentralized if compared with Bitcoin as it has no single authority controlling the foundation and even the mining process is \xe2\x80\x98spread across\xe2\x80\x99 on a much wider scale However regardless of the fact that they follow a purely decentralized governance model the process is not carried out on the blockchain Once the community has made a decision regarding anything there are a couple of selected developers responsible for implementing the change which makes this particular aspect of the foundation highly questionable You must have realized the scale of the problem and impact of DGP now and this is why Tarush has utilized the same concepts as of the BTC network while making of use of efficient technologies to keep up with the race How does it work If you are a technical person you might have guessed it by now But let\xe2\x80\x99s just talk about its working in a detailed fashion After reading the rest of this section thoroughly it is quite easy to establish that the working of a Decentralized Governing Protocol is pretty straightforward Firstly it is important to declare the governing party which is responsible for invoking the request for a certain change 13 \x0cThen there is a lengthy (yet efficient) process in which all the nodes inside the DGP vote for the suggested change If the majority agrees it is implemented across the network with a consensus As soon as the modification in parameters is accepted the content of the proposal becomes active and it is given a specific format (e g a smart contract) which can be invoked by the authorized participants in the network Voting There are two types of governance systems in the blockchain niche but in this section we will discuss the on chain model only Until now you must have developed a decent sense about the fact that on Tarush everything moves on with consensus which is essentially a voting process The important thing to note here is that only the nodes possessing a minimum threshold of TAS tokens are allowed to participate in the process and the \xe2\x80\x98value\xe2\x80\x99 of every vote is different For instance if you have possessed the tokens for a long period your assets have increased over time or you have participated in several voting processes \xe2\x80\x93 in any of these cases you might be promoted to another level of governance and as a result your node would exhibit more value Let\xe2\x80\x99s say your vote attains a status of 3 1 and while you vote in favor 2 more (1 1) people cast their decision in opposition \xe2\x80\x93 your decision would still have precedence 14 \x0cApart from that it should also be realized that not all types of nodes are allowed to take part in every decision making process For instance a user who just joined the network a month ago might be able to cast vote for surface level matters However only the senior members or master nodes will be allowed to vote for mission critical propositions (e g budget proposal and security upgrades) Therefore it is important that the entire process of governance is defined very carefully and formally in order to ensure that the decision making power indeed resides in the hands of the community Just to clue you in it is worth mentioning that every second crypto venture markets itself as a \xe2\x80\x98decentralized\xe2\x80\x99 one However in reality things are quite different and when we explore their DGPs they only allow specific people to suggest or vote for the change So it is clear that merely offering a decentralized architecture is not enough In fact there must be a reliable algorithm in place which ensures that the \xe2\x80\x98spread\xe2\x80\x99 of authority is even and happens directly as the network scales There are plenty of Decentralized Governing Protocols in the industry and different projects implement them in an array of use cases However since we do not have a core team running the venture we are using the MimbleWimble blockchain which offers a reasonably generic DGP covering all types of scenarios Block creation It is the immediate step after reaching a consensus and probably one of the most important ones because that\xe2\x80\x99s how a ledger grows It is worth realizing that like every crypto venture Tarush also has its own block creation protocol dependent upon MimbleWimble 15 \x0cThere are several issues in the industry regarding block creation For instance the Steemit platform has a handful of witnesses (in the 20s) who are responsible for creating a new block In Tarush\xe2\x80\x99s opinion it is a catastrophe which leads to the centralization of power \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s not what we want at all We are quite decentralized in that regard and our platform ensures that everyone eligible to vote can also assist the network in creating a block However in the near future we might introduce a voting process in which all the members would have to vote for selecting a block producer But that\xe2\x80\x99s just another thing in consideration Power to the masses Of course it sounds fancy but if we view it from a technical perspective this distribution of power to the general public on the network is quite a sophisticated thing to handle particularly if a venture decides to implement an on chain governance method Relying on a 3rd party governance tool makes all of this stuff easier to manage since engineers can focus on developing the venture while the DGP only needs to be integrated However Tarush is trying to keep any 3rd party dependency at its minimum and the reasons are quite straightforward We would like to address the following concerns in the most reliable and robust fashion such that even if the network scales there is no clash in the processes 1 How would the protocol upgrade Who would be eligible to vote and what would be the considerations made by our algorithms 2 In case of an upgrade how would the network handle previous blocks and wallets owned by active users 3 How would the platform encourage its voters to take part in the process in order to keep the venture running in its best swing 4 Offering incentives to the voters Even after sorting that out it cannot be ignored that security happens to be the prime concern in any cryptocurrency project particularly when it is going through an upgrade Since there are various parties involved anyone who takes interest in the venture would automatically know about the details regarding an update and this puts the system at further risk It does not mean that Tarush is \xe2\x80\x98still thinking\xe2\x80\x99 about these features and considerations We are planning to roll out the token with what we think is the best after thorough research and testing However the point here is just to make you feel confident that if in the future the community thinks about bringing ANY given change it is quite possible 16 \x0c3 Dynamically Multigraph Blockchain Another important aspect of Tarush\xe2\x80\x99s robust venture happens to the application of sharding together with multigraph functionality As of yet not many projects are implementing it but we think it is very important for enhancing the transactional processes The theory Mathematical concepts are being used everywhere these days and the crypto industry is no different In the multigraph blockchain there exist several edges In simple graphs these edges can be identified pretty easily with the connected nodes sharing similar ends However things are a bit complicated (for our own good) when we talk about multigraphs Just to clue you in whenever there are more than one verticals in the graph their respective edges will be connected with multiple edges so as to diminish the chances of traceability when a transaction is performed and allow network scalability at the same time To make things easier to understand please note that in the context of a blockchain venture edges are the links that connect multiples users on the network The alignment and recognition of these nodes are necessary to enable swift operations 17 \x0cTalking in terms of processes only a full node will be allowed to download an entire copy of the transactions occurring on the blockchain Moreover they will also be able to determine whether the transactions are following the predefined consensus protocols or not In data structures like DBs everything is centralized which carries significant risks for the working of the network as well as the end user Tarush has taken that into account and therefore we have opted for a blockchain based infrastructure Our venture is not hardware dependent and happens to be a large scale solution based on a decentralized architecture Therefore we can enjoy the luxury where a node assigned to perform a specific task can seek help from several other nodes as well hence multiplying the overall efficiency of the network So if you look at it from a broader perspective it becomes easier to understand that since several nodes are connected the task of a single one can be divided which brings a great deal of robustness in our processes Sharding Tarush makes quite an effective use of dynamic sharding as well Due to this we are able to assign an arbitrary value to every node The entire network is aware of the IDs allocated to each one If you have read it for the first time you may not find it very fascinating but the use case is quite good when we consider taking a security measure For instance if the network decides to isolate one of its nodes through voting it can be done easily with the help of its unique ID Moreover this technique also comes in handy when an access restriction is to be applied 18 \x0cNote Since the network is decentralized and runs hundreds and thousands of nodes if a single one is being scrutinized the community would never suffer from a bad user experience even for a fraction of a minute Task sharing in Tarush We have talked about it briefly in the above sections but let\xe2\x80\x99s just explore it in detail now Task division between several nodes is not the only thing sharding does In fact it also ensures that the data split is logical such that the retrieval process is efficient and meaningful and the algorithms do not have to arrange anything at the runtime In order to understand it in a better way let\xe2\x80\x99s explore an example of internet pages Before moving forward please note that they operate in a centralized environment Suppose that a database service linked with any website or platform runs into an issue \xe2\x80\x93 which is very common As a result all the objects or data stored on the affected addresses will become 19 \x0cinaccessible for the users What\xe2\x80\x99s even worse is that the hosting website will most likely go down In such scenarios a load balancer would come into play and effect the redirection of inbound URLs to the DB In order to prevent a non user friendly experience the visitors will be sent to a page containing information as to why the site might be down This pathetic approach can be countered pretty easily in a distributed environment and the entire network can stay up even if hundreds of nodes go down For instance if the above mentioned scenario occurs with Tarush and from the perspective of blockchain even if several nodes go down at once the entire network won\xe2\x80\x99t shut down \xe2\x80\x93 only the affected section(s) will go offline Moreover in order to isolate the unresponsive nodes a code is incorporated at the time of very launch and it can detect any segment of the network which is affected by any means Merging sharding and multigraph processes In our network nodes user accounts and processes hold the maximum precedence and we also ensure optimum dedication and resource allocation to these vital elements Basically whenever a transaction occurs the sending wallet is selected as the basis Therefore even if someone tries to conduct a fraudulent activity in terms of revoking the transaction the \xe2\x80\x98basic\xe2\x80\x99 node is called for the process As a result there cannot be any double spending since the shards of this node prevent such an incident 20 \x0cMultigraph sharding at a glance Many enterprises hesitate to adopt blockchain because of their reservations related to business scalability \xe2\x80\x93 well they have legitimate concerns However since Tarush makes use of the dynamic multigraph sharding concept it enhances the processing speed of the network and as a result the scalability prospects also increase Just to clue you in it can handle about 100 000 transactions per second which makes Tarush a decent choice for pretty much any type of business willing to scale up It is worth noticing (again) that the technique is dynamic \xe2\x80\x93 it implies that regardless of the increase in the number of users the throughput will also adjust its pace so as to fulfill the expectations and demands As soon as the transactions on the network surge each one of them is assigned to a particular shard which breaks up the tasks in all transactions and processes everything in parallel thus achieving efficiency and allowing optimized scaling It is also worth noticing that Tarush makes everything work in a combination therefore our consensus algorithm and multigraph sharding work at the same time to guarantee that the system never slows down and the processing speed is kept at its \xe2\x80\x98level best\xe2\x80\x99 at all instances That\xe2\x80\x99s all about horizontal scaling where our focus is on the expansion of nodes and transactions Let\xe2\x80\x99s explore the vertical dimension now where Tarush ensures to add plenty of resources (e g computation power and storage capacity) in the individual nodes Therefore none of them would ever have to suffer from downtime or lag in performance because of limited resources It is understandable that with the help of sharding the network experiences an overall increase in efficiency and by utilizing vertical scaling the probability of any possible malfunction in CPUs is diminished to a great extent This is quite a robust technique and a major chunk of credit goes to the decentralization architecture offered by blockchains Since Tarush is based on the MimbleWimble it can act as a sidechain as well and can be easily integrated with the root BTC network by implementing a soft fork Until now several challenges have engulfed different blockchains in the industry However the MW creators and researchers spend a decent team researching all of these shortcomings and as of now it happens to be one of the most robust solutions in the market particularly if we talk about scalability security and privacy 21 \x0cNetwork sharding Now that sharding is reasonably clear to most of you we shall discuss how Tarush uses this technique It is basically a load balancing method and we use it to divide the entire mining network into smaller shards \xe2\x80\x93 this process has 2 steps Firstly it selects several loyal nodes from the network and forms a direct service committee The primary responsibility of this committee is to perform network sharding and then assign nodes to different clusters (aka shards) The DS committee governs the sharding process and the initial step in this regard is to select the nodes that are to be authorized which is done by solving a mathematical puzzle based on the PoW model The algorithm involved here makes sure that every node which has successfully produced a valid result in the previous stage must come up with the DS block header A DS block usually contains the signature and the header however it can be modified to carry more details as well As soon as a node solves the PoW based puzzle it simply creates the header for the block which is then sent to the DS committee through a multicast The committee is responsible for adding its signature to the block after reaching a consensus as to whether the header of the block is legitimate 22 \x0cImmediately after the bootstrapping stage is over the composition of the nodes which becomes a part of the DS committee is shown The time period between mining two DS blocks is referred to as DS epoch and it is carefully monitored to ensure that the two successive blocks do not start competing with each other As soon as a new node is added to the committee the previous one is removed to ensure that the total number remains constant It is also worth noticing that the latest member happens to lead the consensus protocol until a new node is added Conflict resolution Tarush\xe2\x80\x99s consensus protocol ensures that there is no forking in the DS blockchain by default They are only allowed when the majority of nodes solve a mathematical puzzle at roughly the same time In order to get rid of any conflict the members of the DS committee remove the nonce fields from their respective headers and then arrange them in ascending order At this point the node leading the consensus offers its header to the committee which MUST match with the largest nonce After that the newest node determines whether a consensus protocol is executed to agree on the block header or not if the result is negative it forcefully runs the consensus (that\xe2\x80\x99s rarely required) Shard generation As soon as the committee is elected the core sharding procedure begins and as you must have realized in order to take part in this stage a node must have undergone all the previous steps mentioned above At the very beginning of DS epoch sharding is performed again and the previous hashes together with nonce for this latest consensus are sent to the DS committee Transaction sharding Tarush makes use of an account oriented architecture which guarantees that if a transaction is meant to be sharded it indeed undergoes the process at all costs based on the sender\xe2\x80\x99s account 23 \x0cWe have skimmed through this technique in the above sections but it is important to understand the reason and working of this procedure Basically transaction sharding guarantees that any event related to double spending is countered by the very shards of the sending node In order to take care of the scalability needs we ensure that the network only performs atomic transaction commits Hence the cross shard transmission never occurs which further prevents the network from executing complex and resource intensive functions Tarush also executes all the transactions in an asynchronous fashion thus preventing the network from clogging at any given time Computational sharding and smart contracts Let\xe2\x80\x99s shed some light on smart contract first Basically since we are using Tron\xe2\x80\x99s platform the platform or rather the solution we offer is quite dynamic and we can host pretty much any use case Moreover it is worth noticing that traditional blockchains have outdated procedures and they are not optimized up to the required industry expectations Therefore such networks consume a significant time to validate a given transaction The primary reason for this shortcoming is that every node is supposed to run a repetitive process 24 \x0cIt may seem a secure option to many of you but it costs a hefty sum since the computational power consumed by such procedures when executed in repetitions increases exponentially If the expenses continue growing exponentially eventually no one would prefer using blockchain It happens to be one of the reasons as to why we have selected Tron\xe2\x80\x99s platform for smart contract creation as it goes quite well with our sharding procedures Please note that we run a consensus protocol to perform sharding of computational resources The purpose of this process is to ensure that all the participants on our network are involved in writing the sizes of groups for every subtask involved in a consensus As it is quite comprehendible now every consensus group will be assigned a particular task which they will be held responsible for It is worth noticing that the participants are also meant to determine a condition upon which the result of the consensus will be accepted by everyone Tarush is the next generation of payment oriented use cases and since we imply sharding with dynamically multigraph blockchain our scalability prospects are better than anyone else in the market Using Tron\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract platform There were plenty of reasons for choosing Tron but the primary one was their extent of decentralization They do not require you to be a part of any centralized organization and anyone with a piece of reasonable programming knowledge can build solutions on top of their technology and roll out a dApp Since Tarush does not have a management team running the venture (and offers the truest sense of decentralization) Tron serves our use case in the best possible manner Now that we have explored Tarush specific aspects let us jump towards some generic benefits of decentralization More efficiency In traditional banking models if you send payment to anyone you have to wait for a certain period (several days for International transfers) This is not feasible at all and the main reason is that you have to depend on central authority (bank) to verify and accept the payment before the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s account is funded 25 \x0cHowever you do not have to suffer from any such thing in a decentralized environment since automated smart contracts execute the deal for both parties and the transaction occurs in a matter of seconds So it is pretty obvious that decentralization does not only mean \xe2\x80\x98more power to the masses\xe2\x80\x99 but it also brings a great deal of efficiency in our processes since we do not have to rely on any single entity It happens to be one of the foremost reasons as to how we offer a throughput of 100 000 Transactions Per Second Extreme reliability While using cryptocurrencies you are not supposed to put your trust in any centralized entity In traditional organizations servers and all the data storage devices are placed in a centralized location Tarush is quite different in that regard We store the information all across the nodes so even if one of them is down the rest can respond and keep the network running What\xe2\x80\x99s exciting and distinctive is that we continuously optimize our chain size to offer unparalleled efficiency 26 \x0c4 Quantum safe encryption Cryptocurrencies are all about encrypting your private details and critical transaction information that may be exploited otherwise in traditional systems Even though security is taken very seriously when we talk about any blockchain based venture (let alone a cryptocurrency) there are advancements in other technologies as well that may pose a security risk to the existence of blockchains For instance quantum computing is progressing at an incredible pace and while it happens to be quite a decent step in the future its efficiency and computational power raise a serious threat for anonymity and integrity of information in crypto networks See the information infrastructure is dependent on public key cryptography which is highly reliant on mathematical problems It implies that there is a digital puzzle that needs to be solved by consuming enormous computational power Even though ordinary processors cannot break difficult algorithms (e g Elliptic Curve Cryptography) easily quantum computing can serve the purpose efficiently and once it starts operating at a mass scale it could bring wrath on cryptocurrencies if necessary measures are not taken on time What is at risk and how In short the wallets and all of their related confidential information are at stake due to the progress being made in quantum computing We have already talked about the application of mathematical algorithms but let\xe2\x80\x99s just dive deeper into the specifics to explore a bit more about how all this stuff works 27 \x0cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just assume that you are tasked to find the prime factors of 10 and 15 Of course you would tell the answer in less than a minute and if a computer program is given such input we can expect the answer in less than a second But what if the complexity of this problem is enhanced many times For instance even if we task a supercomputer (which is pretty fast in making calculations) to determine the primes of two numbers (10000+ digits each) it would take several years to give an output Please note that complexity and difficulty in solving such puzzles form the basis of cryptography in today\xe2\x80\x99s systems Even if a person or an algorithm claims to have access to the public key it is impossible to reverse engineer the process and retrieve a private key from it So this is the entire assumption or rather a notion upon which the foundation of cryptography stands As an ordinary reader without any technical knowledge it may sound great But quantum computing\xe2\x80\x99s different algorithms (e g Shor) shake it off For instance if a regular supercomputer takes a million years to solve a mathematical puzzle a QC would only require minutes if not seconds It implies that once the quantum algorithm gets hold of a public key we can expect it to retrieve the private key in absolutely no time Therefore if a wallet address broadcasts a transaction with an exposed public key a QC can get this sensitive data and sabotage the integrity of the entire network With that being said it is quite evident that any system relying solely on Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm would have to roll out an update in the near future before the QCs become mainstream (which may take about a decade) How does Tarush offer a solution We offer a protocol that is highly quantum resistant It implies that the transactions executing on our network are significantly difficult to be \xe2\x80\x98hacked\xe2\x80\x99 by an algorithm that runs on the basis of quantum computing Furthermore since regular updates are released for our protocol there is no need to worry about the blockchain getting outdated in comparison with the latest algorithms Just to set the perspective it is worth mentioning that most of the coins that can be destroyed by quantum algorithms are based on ECDS alone and in several tests we have observed that such networks are easily compromised by using Shor\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm 28 \x0cHowever in order to keep Tarush safe from any such incident we have implemented primitive cryptographies and hashes It ensures that the users and their data are safe on the network and no entity outside the channel can have access to the network whatsoever Our signatures and hash functions work together and it must be noted that the later mentioned is not prone to quantum attacks at all \xe2\x80\x93 not even the Shor\xe2\x80\x99s Contrary to what we are offering most of the cryptos running on ECDS can get compromised because their protocols \xe2\x80\x98uncover\xe2\x80\x99 the signature at the time of transaction execution If you happen to be the industry for some time you must have comprehended the loophole by now \xe2\x80\x93 if the signature gets in the wrong hands there is no way to stop anyone from using the funds in that wallet At this point it is important to have a brief look at some of the top cryptography techniques used in the industry Symmetric cryptography Basically it utilizes the same key for both ends of the operation (i e encryption and decryption) For layman\xe2\x80\x99s understanding it is equivalent to using a single key for opening the front and back doors of your house Asymmetric cryptography It happens to be the exact opposite of symmetric cryptography and given the seriousness of threats these days this technique is highly recommended Its working is quite different as it utilizes two different keys for encryption and decryption In order to execute a transaction the pair must be used together 29 \x0cHashing Basically a hash function is responsible for taking the data as input processing it and then producing a string against it The coolest thing about this function is that it only proceeds in one direction unlike encryption It implies that once the string is generated there is no way a person could decode it to retrieve the information for which it was initially produced In layman\xe2\x80\x99s terms here is what hashing looks like Whatever you provide as an input it is \xe2\x80\x98eaten\xe2\x80\x99 by the algorithm and instead it gives you something even securer to refer to the data But the ORIGINAL form of it cannot be retrieved at all However you can always point towards it or use it without knowing the details that could potentially reveal sensitive information regarding the transaction sender or receiver One of the greatest perks is that the output of the hash function is always of the same length For instance if you have heard about the SHA 256 algorithm it produces a string of 256 bits This is a great step which ensures that whether a set of data is equivalent to a sentence or millions of pages the function will only produce 256 unique bits against it So it does not only store the data securely but allows it to be found pretty easily at a later instance Securing the data at rest Unauthorized access happens to be one of the core security concerns in every niche It implies that merely storing the data is not enough and organizations need to take robust measures to guarantee that no unauthorized person can read fetch or manipulate the stored information After exploring many scenarios it has become quite evident that even an insider could be involved in a cybersecurity event But let\xe2\x80\x99s just keep our focus on external threats for now which can be thwarted efficiently by using post quantum algorithms Tarush\xe2\x80\x99s primary layer of security is there to prevent the data from being stolen and the \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 quantum resistant algorithm comes into play when the packets are sniffed away Its job is to guarantee that the \xe2\x80\x98thief \xe2\x80\x99 cannot crack the vital data that may compromise sensitive information We have also defined access controls and policies which further diminish the likelihood of any unforeseen incident in this regard 30 \x0cSecuring the data transfer This is a very volatile process that requires extensive security measures to present unauthorized access Tarush\xe2\x80\x99s quantum resistant algorithms ensure that while transferring the data from one network to another or while conducting a transaction between different individuals within a channel nobody can intercept or sniff the packets Our robust solution does not only offer an end to end encryption method but it also allows the network to detect any middlemen who might be trying to get into the network Therefore it happens to be a pretty advanced solution for organizations trying to secure their processes from a malicious third party element Due to the incorporation of post quantum algorithms we can also strengthen our claim that even if (although the chances are quite slim) a hacker or a QC based program steals the data it would be fairly difficult to crack or reverse engineer the information so as to reveal the actual IDs of the users and other confidential data related a given transaction Restricting access to data Blockchains are being used extensively in mission critical projects This is because the data required for such operations must be trustable by all the stakeholders The primary step in this regard as discussed above as well is to sanction the data and allow only role based access 31 \x0cIn plenty of ventures the role based privileges are rather static which in the long run promote insecure behaviors However Tarush has opted for a dynamic approach that grants access to the stored information only when required and authorized \xe2\x80\x93 the combination of these two must go hand in hand if optimum security is to be maintained What do we need to do We have already emphasized that QCs would take a couple of years before they become commercial But once they do significant problems could arise if steps are not taken way in advance The encryptions may sound safe for now but a couple of years down the road the situation might be reversed See blockchain has shaken the internet marketplace and is progressing at an incredible place Forget about crypto for a while every second business giant is researching extensively to implement an effective blockchain based use case Years later if the sudden mass production of the quantum computer begins that would mark the end of blockchain if necessary steps are not taken to strengthen the existing technology The pace of investment and adoption is higher than any other time in the history of blockchain Therefore by that time governments agencies and organizations would have invested a reasonable sum of efforts and finances and might experience irreversible losses This is the reason as to why Tarush has ensured that our signing technique wallets and all of the confidential information is secure and is well guarded from QCs while we continue researching in order to make the product more robust 5 Cross Chain Network In a quarter of a century more than 53% of the World\xe2\x80\x99s population has started using the internet and the rate is increasing exponentially Since the total number of users is about 4 billion it is pretty rational to assume that collectively they all use a different OS apps and technologies for performing a variety of activities on the internet With so much diversification the latest systems and apps being rolled out in the market must be cross compatible for connecting everyone across the Globe Talking about the new wave in technology (i e blockchain) most of the networks have their independent use cases tokens apps and users They operate in quite an isolated environment which halts their exponential progress since users and apps from a variety of networks cannot interact 32 \x0cTherefore a cross chain technology would allow Tarush to interact with multiple blockchains and exchange a variety of assets while giving an impression as if the operations are being executed on a single chain This solution multiplies the capacity of a network to scale up by summing up the throughput of all the related chains Why is it important If you have been reading this paper from the beginning you must have understood that scalability happens to be one of the core aspects addresses by Tarush Even though it is quite crucial for the future of cryptocurrencies it must be realized that in the long run a network cannot scale if it is not interoperable Therefore we are offering a solution that performs equally well in both domains and can interact efficiently with most of the blockchains in the industry 33 \x0cThat was a technical perspective Even if we view it from the angle of a layman it makes no sense to have hundreds and thousands of blockchains working separately from each other \xe2\x80\x93 what is the point of maintaining such a distinguished level of isolation when this technology is meant to combine everything under a hood One of the primary motives for introducing blockchains was to get above the monopoly of power But if industry leaders and even the emerging blockchains stay unintegrated there is practically nothing to be proud of For understanding the situation in a better way just consider blockchain as a planet with different cities and the phenomenon of interoperability as a road network In order to have efficient communication and transportation between every city there must be some sort of a cross city or rather a cross chain solution If there are technological advancement in a city all of its nodes would benefit tremendously But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if all the cities on the planet share the perks of the latest technology or innovation mutually This is where Tarush steps in Essentially we are building bridges which we think are not only beneficial for the entire crypto/blockchain community but in the next 5 7 years they would emerge as a necessity Furthermore the concept of interoperability and \xe2\x80\x98digital globalization\xe2\x80\x99 also aligns with Tarush\xe2\x80\x99s mission We have rolled out this solution to work on the BTC\xe2\x80\x99s model and make it efficient secure scalable and interoperable in today\xe2\x80\x99s landscape Our motive is not to offer competition to any of the stakeholders in the market but to provide an environment and feasibility where everyone could collaborate and advance How much is it worth Let us have a look at an important chunk of history first When the BTC was first rolled out about a decade ago plenty of people called it the million dollar bitcoin Even though the big rally towards the end of 2017 spiked up such hopes we can analyze the situation quite rationally now \xe2\x80\x93 Bitcoin is very far away from reaching that status What\xe2\x80\x99s troubling for most of the investors is that Ethereum consumed a significant portion of BTC\xe2\x80\x99s market share As a result when the price of a coin surged and people started pouring in their investments the transaction fee also increased and it became quite clear that the pioneering currency might not be able to fulfill the promises it made in the very beginning 34 \x0cThere is no doubt in the fact that a couple of years down the road the cryptocurrency industry is going to be worth trillions of dollars Therefore Tarush has jumped into this area and we are offering a solution where a variety of such networks can operate and exchange tokens with one another within a couple of clicks We believe that in the near future the demand for such a product is going to increase exponentially and it happens to be the perfect time for investing time and money in Tarush How is Tarush different (a technical perspective) Well before we start discussing the details it should be noted that scalability is not our sole focus In fact we also ensure that privacy fungibility and efficiency go hand in hand All of these are equally important and a crypto venture holds no significance if it scales decently at the expense of privacy or efficiency Since this industry is already suffering from the issues related to scalability we have decided NOT to implement an indirect approach for tackling the problems We would rather address this concern straightaway by shifting our focus on the overall throughput of the network Just to clue you in I want you to think about one thing Bitcoin hit the market about 10 years ago and there have been hundreds and thousands of transactions since then So where is all the data Of course it is stored in what we call the \xe2\x80\x98ledger\xe2\x80\x99 But is all of that data relevant and really important to store 35 \x0cNot really Since there is plenty of unwanted information stored on most of the crypto networks the load has increased exponentially and that is where Tarush comes into play As you must have guessed until now we remove all the irrelevant data from every transaction Therefore our block size is smaller and so is the case with the overall chain length If you happen to be in the industry for a couple of years now you must be aware that whenever any blockchain network reaches a state of consensus and records the transaction on a public ledger it undergoes a variety of processes \xe2\x80\x93 even though all of them are crucial for the integrity of the network it is not important to store their details forever This is what Tarush has realized after studying the BTC model for years So basically just to make it shorter and easier to understand we continuously remove the old transactions in order to keep the network in its best swing However if some of them are still crucial we do not remove them off in fact we bundle such transactions in a single block to prevent the network from clogging So instead of having a separate block for EVERY settlement we create \xe2\x80\x98a big one\xe2\x80\x99 and throw in the intermediary transactions Well that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only perk we offer The MimbleWimble blockchain can be efficiently implemented as an off chain As the name suggests it acts as a secondary chain and takes the sheer load off the main network So in a nutshell a smart contract is invoked from the root chain but due to MW\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced efficiency its sidechain processes and executes the transaction in order to settle it without any delay If we talk about traditional and some outdated blockchains they offer no optimized solutions for the length of the chain As a result they keep on growing steadily and even though it may seem quite good in the beginning it happens to be catastrophic in the long run You must have realized that MimbleWimble blockchain is not only relatively smaller in size it is also dynamic (i e the length of the chain changes by aggregating transaction blocks) The only thing that matters in a crypto network is to change the ownership of tokens after all the required verifications Suppose Adam transfers 1BTC to Mark who then transfers it to Smith If you look at it carefully there is no need to record the intermediary transaction where Mark possessed the coin We are only interested in recording the end to end transfer that happened between Adam and Smith 36 \x0cSince a huge chunk of information related to the intermediaries is not required in MimbleWimble our block size is merely 100B compared with 1MB of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s block (which is still quite less for the amount of unnecessary data they have to store) In the beginning some of you must have thought as if we are offering competition to the pioneering cryptocurrency But in reality we are just favoring it Tarush has a firm belief in the core and basic model set out by Bitcoin All we are doing is to strengthen its privacy and nourish the scalability This is a rapidly changing niche and it is important for all the upcoming ventures to utilize a robust technology stack to keep up to the expectations of their customer base Moreover since entrepreneurs all over the Globe are exploring different solutions to expand their businesses and scale up Tarush could turn out to be a perfect alternative in that regard Pros of cross platform compatibility Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it from the perspective of a business Your company does not have to create a wallet account on every network to accept more customers With cross platform compatibility only one wallet account will allow you to receive payments from all the chains As a result of this you do not have to depend on the uptime of any 3rd party or pay any intermediary chain for receiving or sending the money Moreover it would also allow a slow performing network to shift its intensive computation to another network get it done and then retrieve the result \xe2\x80\x93 at no cost 37 \x0cLet\xe2\x80\x99s explore the pros categorically now Multi token transaction Multi token wallet system is vital for cryptocurrencies and with its help investors HODLers and daily users won\xe2\x80\x99t have to trust a 3rd party (usually an exchange) for possessing their tokens As a result the transactions and conversions will be performed much more efficiently without risking your assets Interoperability We have already discussed it above Just like any other cross platform technology blockchains will also be able to interact with each other and exchange their assets without being reliant on any intermediary thus cutting off the delays and excessive transaction costs Value transfer If you look at it all digital systems particularly the ones dealing with financial activities merely transfer the numeric \xe2\x80\x98value\xe2\x80\x99 from one place to another For instance if you transfer 1BTC to your friend\xe2\x80\x99s wallet does a real coin move across the chain No just a number is deducted from your wallet and added to your friend\xe2\x80\x99s wallet With cross platform blockchain this value transmission can get a whole new meaning Cross chain consensus We have implemented Proof of Work with various other techniques to ensure that we offer a hybrid solution for cross chain consensus It is quite important and yet a futuristic approach provided that we are already allowing users to exchange assets of different types and values with a variety of blockchains Cross chain smart contracts Since we are talking about interoperability it is important to facilitate smart contracts that are executable on the majority of the blockchains As of yet it may seem like a luxury for which some ventures might charge a premium but in the long run it would become a necessity We have seen a couple of solutions recently including atomic swap but what it offers is quite limited However Tarush is quite versatile generic and efficient in that regard which can serve pretty much every use case that you could think of especially the ones related to finance Factors to consider Cross chain compatibility is a very fascinating term and sounds like a great thing However there are a couple of factors that must be scrutinized before making your solution go live 38 \x0cFirst of all since we are talking about moving funds or other digital assets from one chain to another there must be enough security for establishing a channel between the chains Plus it should also be guaranteed that if funds are being transferred from network A to network B then the later mentioned does not get hold of the private keys of the other This issue is quite decently addressed in FUSION (a cross chain platform) which implements DCRM to share the private keys of the network and it guarantees that none of the nodes possesses an entire key As a result of this implementation FUSION ensures that a single node is not authorized to take control of all the digital assets A word about cross platform compatibility In any blockchain network either data or value gets exchanged There are some solutions in the market that allow interoperability based on token compatibility and a very few 3rd party blockchains offer cross compatibility for either value or data based chains However considering the exponential growth of the industry it is crucial that we create more solutions like Tarush that offer comprehensive feasibility and cover a wide range of networks Moreover it is also crucial that we encourage different organizations and people to implement their ideas on a wide variety of blockchains instead of funneling down on Ethereum Hyperledger Fabric Waves etc Decentralized technology is difficult to implement than a centralized one and there are a variety of challenges that must be catered in order to make a network successful In recent years we have seen a sheer focus on privacy and scalability but cross compatibility is somewhat\xe2\x80\xa6 lost If this issue is not addressed heads on like Tarush has taken an initiative by implementing MimbleWimble the industry might end up in a pit of fragmentation and inefficiency in the next 5 7 years 39 \x0cSo it is very important to persuade developers investors and innovators to focus on a variety of chains while developing interoperable systems 6 x86 Virtual Machine When we talk about scalability there are plenty of factors to be looked after and since developers create these systems it is important to facilitate them as well Most of the people prefer EVM and therefore they are bound to write the smart contracts and entire business logic in Solidity programming language As a result it leaves us with a very small pool of developers having command over the very language In order to address this crucial concern Tarush has decided to go for x86 Virtual Machine which would allow us to facilitate the developers belonging to all technical backgrounds let it be Python Rust C++ or any other popular language Therefore you can create and test smart contracts in your preferred language Hence the results will be achieved much more efficiently and the operational redundancy will also diminish to a significant extent 40 \x0cIts implementation will further ensure that Tarush\xe2\x80\x99s network selectively uses the secure and validated code only Therefore fewer resources will be utilized and the burden on our nodes will also decrease Fortunately the industry is taking this technology seriously and tests have exhibited that its implementation can reduce the computational time of a network by at least 10 20% which is quite significant In some cases it happens to be even greater than but we would not want to give any absolute analysis as of yet just to keep the hopes realistic Tarush has a firm belief that ultimate authority must reside in the hands of the masses and so as to advance our mission we do not want only a handful of developers benefitting from our venture Everyone anywhere in the World should be allowed to participate Just to wrap it up we will be able to offer an unparalleled user experience in terms of efficiency since developers will be able to deploy their solutions in less time and the performance of our blockchain will also increase 41 \x0c42 \x0c
