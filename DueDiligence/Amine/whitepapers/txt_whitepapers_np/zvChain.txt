 CHAPTER ONE 
 Technical and Application Strategies of ZV CHAIN 
 
 ZV CHAIN has proposed a new type of consensus mechanism Chiron which employs Verifiable 
 Random Function (VRF) true random numbers [1] to solve the problem of decentralization At the same 
 time it rapidly achieves consensus through an interclass parallel operation with a target TransactionsPer 
 Second (TPS) of 3000 Based on our years of extensive experience in the distributed system we can 
 assure a no single point design in the proposal validation and block generation to further improve the 
 performance and robustness of the system Through rigorous mathematical computations and technical 
 analysis we believe that Chiron consensus mechanism provides the best solution to the Mundellian 
 Trilemma till date as shown in Figure 1 1 
 
 
 Figure 1 1 ZV CHAIN Technology and Application Strategies 
 
 We endeavor to build a convenient highly secured and user friendly decentralized network that 
 everyone can easily participate in Sustainable commercial applications can also be developed on this 
 network at a minimal cost By introducing mathematics cryptology and engineering technology into the 
 
 
 network it ensures its decentralization and high security as well as achieve a high performance at low 
 energy cost 
 
 1 1 High Security Layer 1 
 In Layer 1 our developed consensus mechanism Chiron uses a Verifiable Random 
 Function+Boneh Lynn Shacham (VRF+BLS) working mechanism The grouped VRF ensures that 
 private mining is not possible and shields itself from long range attacks It also increases the requirement 
 for a 51% attack to a 95% control of the total nodes Furthermore the POS interest stake is linearly related 
 to block generation rewards securing the network against sybil attacks by overcoming disinterested 
 relationships through a reward and penalty system The application layer is also designed for group 
 communications For scenarios that require safety communication channels safety is guaranteed through 
 the Elliptic curve DiffieHellman (ECDH) algorithm that encrypts communication channels To ensure 
 security in the user accounts we use a zero knowledge proof technology to safeguard account security 
 and privacy protection After a smart contact is submitted the system will conduct an in form validation 
 of the smart contract to audit the safety of the contract This will ensure its safety during the execution 
 process ZV CHAIN categorizes the various equipment into two types light nodes and heavy nodes Based 
 on the amount of contribution by miners to the ZV CHAIN network a miner health index will be generated 
 ZV Chain adopts a grouped consensus protocol with integrated true random number computation (VRF 
 and BLS) 
 
 ZV CHAIN uses consensus mechanism with integrated technology It combines VRF+BLS and 
 introduces several technologies in the distributed system such as sharding high concurrency collaboration 
 and preprocessing Its basic principle of design is as follows The system can increase its throughput by 
 increasing the number of nodes Currently sharding is deemed the most optimal solution The consensus 
 mechanism must therefore support the sharding process and is best facilitated through a grouping of the 
 miners 
 
 This method of grouping the miners however presents a great risk of collaborated perpetration 
 by group members Thus a VRF secret ballot will be used to randomly select the proposal group and send 
 the candidate blocks to the validation group The candidate block in the validation group that first achieves 
 the threshold signature will be the winner This mechanism of a concurrency collaboration significantly 
 reduces the chances of a collaborated perpetration The efficiency of the validation also reflects the 
 processing performance of the system Taking into consideration the complication of communication the 
 
 
 length of signature and performance we believe the validation group using the BonehLynnShacham 
 (BLS) threshold signature will perform better than another using the Group Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
 Even for scenarios similar to the optimization of Zilliqa on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) 
 the results achieved are close to the threshold signature but never surpassing it 
 
 Customized Virtual Machine (VM) 
 Currently most blockchain systems that support smart contracts uses VM with stack architecture 
 Stack architecture resolves the problem of consistency among the various physical operating systems 
 but also leads to a lowered efficiency in operations The TVM of ZV CHAIN is based on LLVM On 
 the basis of ensuring consistency and scalability it significantly improves the running efficiency of 
 the contract 
 
 Privacy preserving Computing 
 Privacy preserving computing [2] achieves the secured processing of data under the premise of 
 protecting data privacy through technical means From the perspective of cryptology privacypreserving 
 computing is the use of modern computing methodology as represented by a secured 
 multi party computation and a homomorphic encryption Analysis and computing of data is achieved 
 while protecting the security and privacy of the original data To guarantee account security and 
 privacy protection the zero knowledge proof (ZKP) technology is used a prover can make a verifier 
 believe a certain conclusion is right without providing any usable information to the verifier Thus 
 the prover proves to the verifier and the verifier believes that the prover knows or owns certain 
 information During the proving process no information on the piece of news to be proven is revealed 
 to the verifier The privacy of public blockchain will be further improved through the use of ZKPs 
 technology Other than the validity of the disclaimer no other information will be revealed during 
 the proving process The application can be applied to blockchain to camouflage the identity of 
 traders and the trading volumes It also ensures user account security and privacy protection For data 
 storage security and privacy protection we employ the homomorphic encryption 
 
 1 2 High Performance Layer 2 
 During the early stages of design in ZV CHAIN we have already considered the cost of system 
 efficiency in order to appropriately tap on the hash power of the full network In the sharding mechanism 
 
 
 [3] the Chiron consensus mechanism uses the strategy of grouping and supports the sharding of Layer 2 
 from protocol level performing the computing framework [4] Layer 2 randomly selects certain groups for 
 sharding and computing The other idling groups will periodically execute a checkpoint and validate the 
 veracity of the blockchain data At the same time ZV CHAIN draws on the principle of fractionated 
 processing It uses cold and hot backup for system data (account trade smart contract etc) Most of the 
 nodes only require storage for hot data This improves the cost efficiency for data storage 
 
 Sharding and computing 
 ZV CHAIN borrows its knowledge from Google MapReduce and Batch computing from 
 AliCloud to design an executional framework for sharding and trading It also supports data 
 sharding processing The VFR grouping mechanism ensures that different groups can execute 
 different tasks in parallel thus increasing the system throughput by one order of magnitude 
 
 ZLight Lightning Network 
 As a professional finance public chain incorporating Lightning Network not only improves 
 the systems throughput but also forms an integral part of the branching architecture Thus the 
 ZLight Lightning Network was developed The ZLight Lightning Network can securely execute 
 trades in the funding account offline with its only requirement being periodical settlement and 
 synchronization with the main chain Frequent small trades do not need to be put on the chain in 
 real time The lightning network can quickly build convenient and light connections between 
 business and consumers through the ZV CHAIN and complete the deals in high security 
 
 Storage of distributed ledger 
 All existing blockchain projects be it Ethereum or Bitcoin require full data storage for their 
 mining nodes The data will accumulate over time and the nodes take up hundreds of gigabytes or 
 even terabytes of data on storage marking a huge waste in storage At the same time performing 
 a cold boot for the new nodes will take a very long time We think that browsing historical data is 
 a low frequency operation Learning and acquiring the guiding principles from Cassandra HBase 
 and other column based distributed storage systems as well as certain projects by Alibaba that 
 separate cold and hot data we intend to optimize the storage of data in blockchain In Phase 1 we 
 plan to build a full ledger storage with heavy nodes In Phase 2 we will realize the distributed 
 storage of full ledger with heavy nodes These heavy nodes will be responsible for the block 
 generation proposal Light nodes will only store part of the ledgers and the relevant statuses of 
 recent block height accounts It will validate and sign the candidate blocks under a group 
 
 
 coordination Even if a mobile phone is used as a light node it can still participate in ZV CHAIN 
 block generation with the supporting packaged App 
 
 1 3 Specialized Middleware Layer 
 For a better and easier adoption in the finance industry we will extract some universal utility 
 modules customized for potential application in finance industry We will develop multiple middleware 
 in different stages with the purpose of improving security and performance DAPP s developers can also 
 conveniently obtain relevant middleware support by invoking the API 
 
 Payment Settlement Solution 
 A payment settlement solution based on ZV Chain will make use of the distributed ledger 
 and Lightning Network to enhance efficiency in exchange of information and clearance for users 
 businesses and corporates It may define a unified technological and functional standard for 
 security and reliability of financial network activities In the scenario of cross border clearance it 
 will be performed by proxy nodes and a two way Lightning Network The proxy nodes may 
 support fiat backed stable coins accepted by local merchants and the ZV CHAIN tokens as the 
 final clearance tools 
 
 Risk Control Solution 
 Risk control is the lifeline of any finance application The effectiveness of risk management 
 often determines the success of a financial application Most of the advanced risk control systems 
 are based on huge amounts of historical and real time data to build a smart rules engine and risk 
 management model to exercise risk control Risk management involves dealing with large 
 amounts of private data from users and company trade secrets Thus these confidential data cannot 
 be put on the chain directly Through the risk control oracle interface the on chain smart contract 
 is able to obtain a risk assessment and execute its respective operations based on risk control 
 
 1 4 Application Layer 
 Considering the disparity in financial scenarios and user requirements [5] there are two possible 
 modes of application solutions Baas (Blockchain as a Service) [6] and DAPPs development to meet 
 
 
 the needs of different users at different business operational scales Various applications can be adapted 
 according to the specific circumstances

 1 5 Smart Contract Support Modular Layer 
 The three key elements for implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) are robotic learning 
 algorithm or model big data and high performance hash power In recent years most of the industries 
 have transited to big data and begin their transformation to AI especially in the financial sectors The 
 potential of smart financial services has been acknowledged by more and more authorities However 
 traditional centralized IT architecture also contains many problems such as the leaking of private data 
 the collecting of user data by centralized platforms for commercial applications and the inability to 
 effectively protect innovation etc To tackle these problems many industries set their eyes on the rapidly 
 evolving blockchain technology and its applications in an attempt to transit to a decentralized blockchain 
 infrastructure At the same time as an internet protocol level infrastructure that enables financial value 
 connection blockchain by itself is insufficient to meet the requirement of a smart financial service Thus 
 we have incorporated big data processing modules a machine learning algorithm library and the AI hash 
 power We will provide comprehensive architectural support to build smart financial modules on the 
 public chain protocol layer 
 
 In addition we intend to provide support to the coordinated invoking of data hash and models in the 
 blockchain financial middleware 
 
 Data coordination channel 
 
 Data coordination channel provides big data exchange both inside and outside of the 
 blockchain On one hand it can connect to external data of different types and dimensions to 
 provide data support for training smart models On the other hand it creates the condition for the 
 value flow of authenticated public chain data 
 
 AI Hash Sharing 
 Based on the architecture of the public chain protocol layer the sharing functions of highperformance 
 devices will be developed This will improve the utilization of on chain high 
 performance devices and fulfill the needs of the public chain users to develop smart financial 
 models 
 
 ML financial model library 
 Through the sharing of swarm intelligence in particular the smart model training 
 intelligence from the on chain robotic learning expert we will provide a financial model library 
 for a multitude of complex smart financial services Public DAPPs users with similar 
 requirements can use these services at their convenience 
 
 Data authentication and value flow 
 Firstly user data protection and authentication can be realized through many protocol layer 
 public chain privacy computing modules Subsequently trading and usage channels will be 
 provided for paid authorized data Authorized users will receive a reward for their data sharing 
 Finally based on the output of the shared data training the process of the data value flow will be 
 completed 
 
 FinTech and RegTech 
 We will develop different smart services through the robotic learning financial models as 
 mentioned above This will meet the various needs of traditional financial services and aid in the 
 upgrading of traditional financial regulations truly realizing the vision of Fintech and RegTech 
 
 
 CHAPTER TWO 
 The Innovative Design of ZV CHAIN 
 
 2 1 Chiron Consensus Mechanism 
 Since the birth of Bitcoin there has been continuous research on the blockchain consensus 
 mechanism from both academia and the industry Many different mechanisms protocols and algorithms 
 have been established With all these developments however one challenge remains unsolved the 
 trilemma to fulfill decentralization security and performance POW (Proof of Work) suffers from lowperformance 
 mechanism and high energy consumption POS (Proof of Stake) cannot take care of both 
 decentralization and performance at the same time HASH and DAG target more on consistency rather 
 than accuracy These consensus mechanisms will normally pick two verticals from decentralization 
 security and performance to enhance As a result they seldom consider the optimal solution for the bigger 
 picture Some consensus mechanisms are leaning more towards the academic aspect Consequently many 
 mature technologies that prosper in the internet such as decentralized collaboration layered processing 
 preprocessing and multi level cache are not effectively integrated into blockchain In addition few 
 consensus mechanisms have conducted thorough analysis and contention on security problems such as 
 Nothing at Stake 51% attacks sybil attacks and long range attacks With ZV Chain we have developed 
 a brand new consensus mechanism Chiron It combines VRF and BLS and introduced various 
 technologies in decentralized system including sharding high concurrency collaboration preprocessing 
 and others Chiron consensus mechanism takes random samples from the light node miners and put them 
 into several validation groups generated by the collaborated VRF algorithm to determine the validation 
 group in each round Full node miners on the blockchain nominate proposal groups through secret 
 balloting and send the candidate blocks to the validation group which then validate the candidate blocks 
 and determine the final block through a group collaboration 
 
 Chiron consensus mechanism has several key strengths In terms of decentralization it 
 outperforms Bitcoin as it can mobilize any network device as a potential node At the same time Chiron 
 incorporates light and heavy nodes to cover both the breadth and the depth In terms of security validation 
 groups are selected through VRF generated true random numbers guaranteeing the uniqueness of the 
 working group at a particular block height and eliminating the possibilities of long range attacks and 
 
 
 unauthorized mining activities One has to control at least 95% of the nodes to initiate an attack similar to 
 the 51% hashing attack on Bitcoin In terms of performance Chiron targets TPS 3000 without sharding 
 or optimization Chiron incorporates a series of mathematical tools cryptographic algorithms and 
 comprehensive protocols Its core mechanism can be summarized as follows light nodes and miner nodes 
 are grouped usually 100 nodes per group Whenever a block is mined a proposal group is selected 
 randomly by full nodes through VRF algorithm This renders the proposer random and unpredictable 
 curtailing the risk of collusive fraud between the proposer and the verifier The proposal will be sent to 
 the verification committee through multiple channels concurrently The verification group is selected by 
 VRF which is based on the threshold signature scheme This ascertain the unpredictability randomness 
 and transparency of the verification committee During the actual block generation only light inter group 
 verification is required to achieve rapid block generation through concurrent multi channel production 
 lines 
 
 By comparing with frontier public chains the advantages of Chiron can be clearly seen in almost 
 every major aspect

 Chiron surpasses BTC in terms of its enhanced decentralization and strengthened security as well 
 as significantly upgraded performance and drastically lowered energy consumption Comparing with EOS 
 Chiron stands at the same level in performance but boasts a clear edge in terms of decentralization and 
 
 
 security We contend that in the context of the blockchain system decentralization takes higher priority 
 over security which in turn precedes performance [7] Compared with Dfinity [8] Chiron is equally 
 competent in terms of decentralization yet it deploys small distributed collaborative bodies within groups 
 in order to enable highly efficiently inter group task divisions and collaborations enhancing its 
 performance and robustness The proposer is randomly selected by full node VRF secret balloting 
 mechanism The difficulty level of a collusive fraud between the proposer and the verifier is therefore 
 increased from group level to full network level thereby substantially curbing the possibility of collusive 
 frauds Compared with Algorand the grouped VRF relay model has a unique and unpredictable validation 
 group to map at every block height Block candidates broadcast in a directed way to verification groups 
 Intra group consensus is achieved through BLS threshold signature to perform validation Therefore 
 Chiron is far ahead of Algorand in terms of communications the size of the signature data and 
 performance Compared with Cardano all nodes in the Chiron network can participate in block generation 
 Every step during block generation is mirrored to eliminate single points of failure As illustrated in Figure 
 2 1 by improving the robustness of the system the average performance is significantly boosted 
 
 
 Figure 2 1 The Block Generation Process of Chiron 
 
 Compared with Zilliqa all members in the verification group of Chiron will be able to recover the 
 final group signature after receiving the threshold signature The final multi signature aggregation can be 
 realized without having to appoint a leader within the group thus enhancing the robustness and the 
 security of the system From the above comparison with major and emerging public chains and by showing 
 mathematical and formal proofs we can conclude that the Chiron consensus mechanism is the most 
 optimal solution to the impossible trinity problem in the consensus algorithm Chiron is leaps and strides 
 ahead of all existing consensus mechanisms 
 
 
 To ensure orderly operation of the system we have made the following assumptions on the parameters of 
 the miners 
 
 1 Both honest and malicious miners exist in the system 
 2 Honest miners outnumber malicious miners 
 3 Both honest and malicious miners are driven by economic gains Honest miners profit by 
 observing the rules while malicious miners profit more by breaking the rules 
 2 1 1 Open Participation Mechanism 
 The Chiron consensus mechanism employs open participation mechanism that allows average 
 users to apply to access the system and become miners On the other hand miners can also apply for 
 annulment and reclaim their user status For these actions we have designed specialized smart contracts 
 the Miner Application Contract and the Miner Annulment Contract Both contracts are inscribed in the 
 genesis block to be called by the users 
 
 Miner Registration 
 
 During the application process a normal user needs to submit a Miner Application Contract 
 indicating the type of miner they intend to apply for i e proposing miner or validating miner Every miner 
 has a unique ID 
 
 ID = transhash(pk) 
 
 pk is the public key of the user before he becomes a miner transhash currently uses a hash 
 function that outputs 256 bit The public key of the user corresponds to his miner ID and is unique in the 
 system The Miner Application Contract codes (pk Type) into the blockchain In principle miners on 
 heavy nodes are expected to become proposing miners while those on light nodes are expected to become 
 validating miners 
 
 Miner Annulment Contract 
 
 Miners can submit the Miner Annulment Contract to withdraw from the Chiron consensus 
 Similarly the annulment contract will be inscribed into the blockchain After a period of time (longer than 
 the groups life cycle) as illustrated in Figure 2 2 users can call upon the deposit to redeem their contract 
 The deposit will be released to the users by the system The Chiron consensus uses random sampling on 
 light node miners to create several validating groups 
 
 
 Fig 2 2 The Demarcation of Chiron Group Cycle 
 
 Real random numbers generated by the grouped VRF algorithm serve as random seeds for the 
 PRG function which in turn generates random numbers that determine the validating group for the current 
 slot Heavy nodes across the network are grouped in accordance with the random numbers of the previous 
 block and the proposal group for the current slot is selected randomly Members of the proposal group 
 nominate several candidates block and broadcast it to the validating group who will then complete the 
 block validating process through group collaboration The validating group will subsequently establish an 
 intra group consensus through the threshold signature before broadcasting it to the entire blockchain 
 Owing to the immutability and traceability of the data as shown in the figure above the Chiron consensus 
 utilizes a dual chain model namely blockchain and group chain to document the production of the entire 
 data chain To curb the possibility of collusive frauds within the group each group has a life cycle and 
 will be dismantled for a new round of random sampling and grouping process After the system stabilizes 
 whenever it enters a new epoch new groups will be formed and the old ones will be dismantled Therefore 
 in every epoch the working list will vary accordingly 
 
 2 1 2 Miner Incentive Mechanism 
 To motivate and reward miners and ensure that the project is steered towards a positive direction 
 the design of ZV CHAIN must incorporate an economic incentive mechanism The economic incentive 
 model should have a remuneration system that reasonably compensates the miners for their hard work 
 while remaining consistent auditable traceable impartial and immutable The description above mirrors 
 a contract of service found in traditional businesses and it is for that very reason that our smart contract 
 is designed Naturally a smart contract is the best solution to concretizing theoretical economic incentive 
 models 
 
 The ZV CHAIN system initiates a specialized smart contract at the beginning of each new round 
 of block generation Miners who contribute to block generation including proposal or validation can call 
 the contract with proof of work after they have tallied the work that is completed in this round The 
 
 
 remuneration is calculated based on the smart contract which functions as a proof of work After a 
 window period the logic of reward in the contract will be triggered automatically and will transfer the 
 reward to an individual miners account as illustrated in Figure 2 3 
 
 
 Figure 2 3 The Economic Reward Flowchart of Chiron 
 
 ZV CHAIN mobilizes smart contract to concretize the economic incentive model not only in a 
 secure and impartial manner but also to provide fundamental statistics that lay the groundwork for 
 creating and evaluating crucial indexes such as the health index of each mining node Based on the 
 statistics we can easily distinguish positive miners from negative ones The health index contributes 
 positive feedback to further computations done by Chiron on future mining activities

 2 Group Building and Maintenance 
 ZV CHAIN system carries out regular checks on group building based on CheckInterval (a 
 system parameter) Suppose it is currently in the rth round slot if r is a multiple of CheckInterval 
 when a new block is generated the current working group should undergo group building and 
 maintenance Considering the problem of chain synchronization and assuming that it takes d slot 
 timing to broadcast to the entire network it is safe to conclude that blocks before the dth block are 
 already in sync Thus it can be concluded that all blocks across the network at a height no higher 
 than r d are perfectly in sync Through an examination of the miner contracts and a deliberate 
 screening mechanism members of the working group can determine the number of suitable 
 candidates who meet the requirements to be a part of the new group The working group will thus 
 be a parent group to the new group formed and raise proposals for forming new groups 
 accordingly 
 
 3 New Group Proposal 
 Being the parent group the current working group raises proposals with the main goal to 
 determine potential candidates for the new group The key strategy is to rank candidates according 
 to their health index before generating pseudo random number sequences with real random 
 numbers of the current block as seeds The random selection of candidates guarantees that the 
 distribution of health index among the new members is similar to that of all suitable candidates 
 and that some members with high health index will carry along some members with low health 
 index By doing so it eliminates the probability of being attacked by zombies In addition the 
 current working group must decide the activation time of the subsequent new group For example 
 in the second epoch after the current epoch e GIS Activation = e+2 the deactivation of the new 
 group is dependent on a system preset parameter ValidPeriod GIS deactivation = GIS activation 
 
 + ValidPeriod Owing to the aforementioned candidate sequence new member selection 
 
 strategies are auditable As a result the hash calculated should be the same for all honest miners 
 in the current group Each miner within the group can thus generate and sign on their individual 
 hash and corresponding information before sending it to the rest of the group Once the hash 
 received equals to or exceeds the threshold group members can use the group signature to recover 
 the output private key to sign on the group block The parent group will also call the bonus smart 
 contract template on the genesis block to establish a bonus contract and then publish it for the new 
 group The contract will eventually be written in the blockchain 
 
 4 Establishing New Group 
 In reality as group members are peer nodes on the decentralized network sometimes it is 
 inevitable that some nodes have to go offline due to unforeseeable circumstances such as unstable 
 network connection malicious nodes etc To prepare for the unpredictable the verification group 
 is designed to have (t n) threshold signature capability where n refers to the number of group 
 members and t the threshold value (usually t = n) This means that group consensus is achieved 
 if the number of group members who has signed their acknowledgement is greater than the 
 threshold value and the group signature can be recovered from the agreement among the t 
 members We employ a decentralized form of sharing Shamirs Secret Sharing to generate 
 signature private key S among group members group signature public key and group public key 
 gpk as opposed to group private key which represents group consensus Once these private keys 
 are obtained and the consensus on public key is agreed upon the group is hereby established 
 
 The classical Shamirs Secret Sharing algorithm [9] can be perceived as a process seeking 
 centralization as it requires a dealer who decides on the what secret polynomial to use The 
 dealer then fragments the secret and disseminate it to others However blockchain is a 
 decentralized network Every node is equal and no centralized dealer should be elected from 
 peer nodes In addition the dealer precedes others in knowing the secret therefore it is hard to 
 prevent wrongdoings if the dealer has malignant intents In view of these intrinsic flaws we 
 employ a decentralized private key sharing algorithm Its core principle lies in empowering every 
 group member to become the nucleus or the secret dealer As a result there is no physical 
 centralization But at the same time an initial secret is formed at the logic layer of the group 
 None of the members has knowledge of this secret By following the three steps listed below 
 every member will be able to form a shared secret Si in the group logic layer Similar to the 
 classical Shamirs Secret Sharing algorithm the set of shared secret Si is able to reconstruct the 
 secret SK when the threshold is met i e the initial secret SK can be reconstructed by obtaining no 
 
 
 less than t number of secret shares In the case that the total number of secret shares obtained is 
 less than t no information about the initial secret SK will be distributed at all 
 
 Specific implementation steps are as follow 
 
 a) Each member chooses his individual secret sharing polynomial 
 ( ) 
 = 
 * + 
 
 + 
 + + /0 /0 
 
 
 Polynomial coefficients * 
 
 /0 ( )are randomly chosen by individual 
 group members Hence every members initial secret is = (0) 
 = 
 * Using the 
 private key the corresponding public key is calculated 
 
 b) Each member computes the shared secrets to be allocated to other members and sends them 
 respectively that is the /9member computes = ( )and sends to the /9member 
 together with his public key where 
 = 
 1 2 
 =1 2 
 c) When a member collects all shares of secrets from other group members he can compute the 
 sum of all secret shares he has received =SD E 
 =SD E 
 ( ) and calculate 
 =SD E 
 
 
 
 d) Each member calculates the public key corresponding to the private key of the group 
 signature and informs other members of the 
 Note in step (b) the communication among group members should be encrypted to prevent it 
 from being wiretapped The corresponding user public keys pubk of all the miners within the 
 group are recorded in the new hash information set MinerArray which will be used as the ECDH 
 key for encrypted communication 
 
 After completing the above steps each member obtains a private key for the group signature a 
 public key and the group public key gkp that corresponds to the group private key SK The group 
 logical layer also harbors the group private key =SD E 
 As every member is only privy to his 
 own initial secret SK therefore remains unknown 
 
 
 We will prove that SK can be reconstructed from member private key 
 if the threshold is fulfilled 
 
 (a) Proof of Correctness 
 As the sequence of group members is inconsequential we assume that k refers to the first k 
 members for any = Let ( )=SD E 
 ( ) from Lagrange interpolation polynomial

 ( )=S JE

 which holds for 1= =

 Let ( ) 
 = 
 ( ) ( ) we will know that H(x) is a polynomial with k 1 as its highest 
 power For 1= = ( )=0 hence ( )=0 i e ( )= ( ) Hence the Lagrange 
 interpolation polynomial for a secret sharing scheme among k members is the secret sharing 
 polynomial Calculate (0)= (0)=SD E 
 (0)= 
 
 
 (b) Proof of Security 
 ( )=SD E 
 ( ) 
 is a polynomial with the highest power of t 1 with t number of 
 coefficients However when < only equations can be formed From linear algebra theorem 
 we know that when the number of equations is less than the number of unknowns the system 
 has infinitely many solutions In this case it is impossible to determine the coefficients of the 
 polynomial and consequently unable to determine ( ) Therefore when < we are unable 
 to ascertain any information about the initial secret SK 
 
 When the number of nodes in the network (including new group members) received the same new 
 group public key reaches threshold t the new group is considered successfully established The public key 
 is true and will be written on local group chain 
 
 5 Asynchronous Group Building 
 Whenever a new group is created the parent group has to come up with a list of candidates 
 for the new group and send it to the new group members The new group members will decide 
 among themselves on the creation of the group private key The process of creating a new group 
 and applying to join the group are conducted asynchronously From the above illustration when 
 
 
 creating a new working group all members are required to send their secret packet at the same 
 time But in reality this condition is easily compromised As long as one member is offline the 
 group building process cannot proceed which significantly hinders the probability of successful 
 formation of the group To solve this problem the Chiron consensus supports asynchronous group 
 creation through engineering design Fault tolerance is designed to accommodate members going 
 offline when new group is created As long as these members come online within the stipulated 
 period and discover that they have been assigned to a new group Step 1 and 2 of the group creation 
 process will be automatically triggered so that the member will share his secret packet with the 
 other group members Upon receiving the secret packet the other members will feedback by 
 sending their secret packets to the member By asynchronously collecting all the shared secret 
 packets within the group a new group can be successfully established

 2 Shamirs Secret Sharing Scheme Incorporating ECDLP 
 We will use Barreto Naehrig curves = + ( ) in which finite prime field 
 ( )

 =36 ^+36

 Where x is a 63 bit number and p and r are prime numbers with length of about 256 bit 
 Two finite groups 
 
 
 = b ( )c[ ] 
 = [ ]n ( j | |) 
 
 
 We will use the optimal linear pairing operator on a Barreto Naehrig elliptic curve found in recent 
 studies and define ( )as 
 
 ( )=( pMq ( ) )(jst0 )/v 
 
 
 Here = x30x1( ) x10x2qx3 [6Mq2]x( ) 6Mq2 x( ) can be calculated using Miller Rabin 
 primality test 
 
 Based on the characteristics of bilinear operator for any 1 2 1 2 there exists ( 1 + 
 2 
 )= ( 1 ) ( 2 ) 
 for any 1 1 1 2 2 there exists ( 1 1 + 2)= 
 ( 1) ( 2 ) for any 1 2 there exists ([ ] [ ] )= ( )z{ 
 
 
 Here we use [ ] to denote multiplication on elliptic curves For example [a]P denotes the a times 
 multiplication of point P on the elliptic curve based on the elliptic curve digital signature 
 algorithm 
 
 {0 1}* secret that needs to be signed (in binary) 
 
 Compute = ( ) 
 
 
 Compute =[ ] where x is the private key of user signature is the signature 
 
 obtained 
 
 Combining with the aforementioned group construction (decentralized Shamirs secret sharing) 
 we establish a correlation between member signature private key and group private key SK as 
 follows 
 
 M0NOP
 
 =SJ E 
 J E L 
 where = 
 
 
 NOQ0NOP 
 
 
 Hence for secret m 0 1* the member signature is =[ ] from the characteristics of binary 
 elliptic curve we can obtain the following equation 
 
 
 M0NO0NOP 
 M0NOP
 
 [ ] =[SJ E 
 J E L 
 ] =SJ E 
 J E L 
 
 
 
 NOQ0NOP 
 NOQ0NOP 
 
 
 In other words on bilinear elliptic curves after signing the information with all members 
 signature private keys obtained from the above grouping method we get kt signed secrets and we can use 
 the Lagrange interpolation polynomial to obtain the secret signed by group private key SK 
 
 In Shamirs secret sharing algorithm 
 must be revealed in order to reconstruct group private 
 key SK Using bilinear mapping of the properties of e the signature of group private key can be obtained 
 without compromising This renders group private key recyclable for repeated uses Through this 
 technique group consensus can be achieved by threshold signatures The process is more efficient than 
 Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) 
 
 3 Group Collaborative VRF Random Number 
 As no one knows the group private key SK the signature [SK]R is non selectable 
 unpredictable and immutable but it can be verified by the group public key gpk to ascertain 
 whether it is signed collectively by the group It is a technique to generate group collaborative 
 VRF random numbers 
 
 The method Chiron uses to generate random numbers is the aforementioned group 
 collaborative VRF technique Let v be the Rand value of the block generated in the ith 
 round slot We use random number 
 
 v=h h( v0 )for the rth round slot 
 
 Using group selection strategy the working group for the rth round slot can be determined 
 The current working group pairs sign and collect signatures that are equal or greater than the 
 threshold value The reconstructed group private key pair ( | v)will be used as randomly 
 generated number of the current slot and written into the v of the block generated in the 
 rth slot 
 
 v = ( ( | v) ( | v) 
 
 ( | v) /( | v))
 
 _ 
 
 
 
 The Rand of the previous block determines the current working group The current group 
 calculates Rand of the current slot with the formula above to determine the next block RR is the 
 Rand of the genesis block and it is set during the initiation of the system If in the rth round the 
 working group is unsuccessful in generating a block in the (r+1) th round the random number is 
 determined by the following equation 
 
 vq =h h(h h( v0 zD )) 
 
 
 Using the group selection strategy we can determine the working group of the (r+1) th slot to 
 carry out the threshold signature on +1| vq Rand for the current block will subsequently 
 generated If there is still no block generated in the (r+1) th round Rand for the next round will be 
 generated from the Rand of the current block The process goes on 
 
 4 Validation Group Selection Strategy 
 Suppose we are currently entering the rth round slot calculate the current epoch 
 = / 
 
 
 Random number v=h h( v0 ) and we can get the current working group list gB from 
 the group chain 
 
 | < 
 
 
 Using the random number v 
 as a random seed the pseudo random number generation 
 function PRG can be used to randomly determine the current working group in the above existing 
 working group list gB These choices are auditable and verifiable by other nodes In the later 
 development stages we may consider taking the group s health index (the sum of group member 
 health indexes) and use the Follow The Satoshi (FTS) algorithm as the basis of group selection 
 
 2 1 4 Convergence Optimization and Communication Optimization 
 Due to the dynamic size of the proposal group multiple candidate blocks may be generated at the 
 same time Therefore the algorithm must quickly converge on the candidate block 
 
 We have set two strategies 
 
 
 The validation group will give priority to the proposal group to obtain the information of the 
 validated block in the previous round (the block that completes the group signature Multiple 
 block may exist) In addition the validation group will give priority to process the weight of the 
 blocks of the previous round 
 As the validation group is preparing to sign when a candidate block reached a group consensus 
 and is broadcasted no other candidate blocks of the current round will be signed 
 With reference to the propagation performance of Bitcoin s P2P network it takes 1 second to 
 complete a transmission of a 1KB message to 95% of the network whereas it takes 1 5 minutes to 
 complete the transmission of a 1MB message to 95% of the network transmission We must also take into 
 account that the group members are scattered around the world and the working group will propose 
 multiple blocks as candidate block Therefore it is imperative to optimize communication accordingly 
 We consider adopting Block header within the group to communicate with the validation group As the 
 group reaches strong consistency on the hash of block header it only guarantees the content of the block 
 and the time sequence The existence of double spending in user accounts cannot be verified Therefore 
 after rapidly reaching strong consistency on the hash the transactions are synchronized locally The 
 validation of the account status on chain will ensure the validity of the transactions With this process a 
 higher consensus can be achieved If the proposing miners are honest the workflow is more efficient than 
 the classic way of information transmission which mobilizes the entire blockchain including all 
 transactional information on block If the proposing miners are malicious validation will fail when the 
 block come on chain Validation outside the group is prohibited from broadcasting thereby ensuring 
 security In addition if a proposal miner is malicious the bonus contract is immediately called after the 
 verification group validates the transaction But failure in new block validation will render the block fail 
 to come on chain The bonus contract called will be inconsistent with the one on block acting as a solid 
 proof of malicious activities Corresponding punishment will be carried out on the miner such as forfeiture 
 of deposit or deduction in health index of the miner 
 
 2 1 5 Forking 
 1 The Decision to Fork 
 Due to the characteristics of the consensus mechanism and the uncertainty of the P2P network 
 soft forks are inevitable on the blockchain Upon the occurrence of a soft fork the nodes on ZV 
 
 CHAIN will prioritize the fork 
 = 
 
 where Gi is the priority level of each block 
 as shown in Figure 2 4 
 
 
 Figure 2 4 Schematic Diagram of Chiron Forking 
 
 As a specification chain the forking nodes will quickly and easily adjust local chains to 
 specification chain through forking adjustment thereby ensuring consistency on the regular chain 
 
 2 Forking Adjustments 
 A node locates the forking point first when it undergoes forking It will then make a selection by 
 comparing the total priority from the forking point to its current height In the process of searching 
 for forking points a regional search mechanism will be employed to conduct a binary comparison 
 on target chain segments of a certain step size The step size will be adjusted according to the 
 results of the comparison so that the forking points can be quickly located to carry out forking 
 adjustments 
 2 1 6 Checkpoint Mechanism 
 Finality broadly defined refers to specific operations that once completed will be chiseled 
 permanently and irreversibly in history This is a crucial concept in the financial industry ZV CHAIN is 
 a public chain that undertakes banking services and data certainty is a central security factor that must not 
 be overlooked The final consensus of the data will be confirmed with finality and not with probability 
 unlike the 6 block confirmation used by Bitcoin 
 
 
 The Chiron consensus provides a periodic checkpoint mechanism The cycle for the checkpoint 
 is the epoch (the preset epoch cycle by the system For instance the system can set its default epoch to the 
 duration of 100 blocks) According to the Chiron grouping mechanism as mentioned above the number 
 of validation groups is fixed during each epoch cycle An algorithm similar to the Hashgraph is used to 
 find a strong visible connection (in essence trying to achieve a Byzantine fault tolerance with an 
 endorsement from at least two thirds of its members) and to determine the status of the checkpoint with 
 the information on hand 
 
 The checkpoint mechanism assuming that the current block height enters the (n+2)th epoch cycle 
 will backtrack to the nth epoch and find in the interval any sub chain block that has obtained validation 
 from two thirds of the groups in the validation group set Chirons checkpoint mechanism unlike DAG 
 or Hashgraph will be able to predict the finality time as every slot has a unique random and unpredictable 
 validation group in charge of the validation process proven in the section of VRF group selection In other 
 words the probability of a group being appointed the task of verification is equal therefore in each epoch 
 finding a sub chain with two thirds endorsement is common and highly probable The final blockchain 
 of ZV CHAIN can prevent long range attacks Even if 51% or more nodes in the network is being 
 controlled any attempt rewrite history outside the latest checkpoint will be stopped 
 
 2 1 7 Consensus Analysis and System Security 
 We consider a system highly secured if the solutions proposed to counter security breaches such 
 as double spend attacks long range attacks (private mining) nothing at stake attacks sybil attacks and 
 51% attacks are proven through mathematics or game theories Fundamentally all attacks can be roughly 
 boiled down to the four attacks as stated above These attacks can precipitate temporary or permanent 
 damage to the system and individuals The periodic Checkpoint mechanism illustrated above guarantees 
 the finality of blockchain data on ZV CHAIN Even if the attacker controls more than 51% of the nodes 
 the attempt to override transaction history outside the latest checkpoint will be curbed Therefore attackers 
 with more than half of the nodes under their control can only modify recent blocks i e blocks between 
 the current block and the latest checkpoint Apart from the checkpoint mechanism ZV CHAIN also offers 
 a monitoring system against the most severe 51% attack by introducing the concept of system health 
 indicator which helps users get a better idea of the system condition at one glance and safeguards security 
 by suspending or delaying the final confirmation block of the transaction 
 
 
 2 1 7 1 Consensus analysis 
 1 Decentralized analysis 
 The PoW consensus is a highly decentralized algorithm However as mining hardware and 
 mining pools have become more prevalent they are emerging as the hidden center of the PoW consensus 
 It is almost impossible for participants using hardware with mediocre hashing power to gain profit from 
 mining activities The Chiron consensus divides nodes into heavy nodes and light nodes Heavy nodes 
 obtain the right of proposal through VRF random secret balloting The probability of obtaining the right 
 of proposal is linearly correlated to the staking amount for a single heavy node In contrast light nodes 
 are randomly grouped and the actual working group is determined by true random number in a particular 
 round thus making sure that all groups have equal chance of becoming the validation group The proposer 
 of the final block together with group members who are involved in the validation process is rewarded 
 for block generation 
 
 2 Consistency and Accuracy Analysis 
 Chiron designs a checkpoint mechanism with one CP per 100 blocks (about 5 minutes) A 
 consistency check is done during the validation stage of block generation while an accuracy check is done 
 during the proposal and block generation stage When the non block generating groups in the full 
 network receive a new block they will conduct an accuracy check on the content of the block If any 
 issues surface a voting session is carried out within the group If more than threshold number of votes 
 agrees that the block has problem then voting will be done with every group as a unit to a specialized 
 smart contract The voting nodes share the benefits and the penalties of the vote At the beginning of every 
 new CP the smart contract should be checked If more than N groups have voted for abnormality in block 
 generation of the previous CP then an accuracy check shall be carried out If the abnormality is confirmed 
 then the process backtracks to the previous CP and restarts Otherwise it will proceed with the current CP 
 For most small and medium sized transactions they can be confirmed once 90% of neighbor nodes are 
 observed to generate three additional consistent blocks after the block containing the transaction 
 information For large transactions we suggest confirming the transaction once 90% of the neighbor nodes 
 have entered a new CP 
 
 2 1 7 2 System Security Analysis Defense Against Attacks 
 Nothing at Stake Attack 
 
 In pure PoS algorithm incentives are given to reward block generation but there is no penalty for 
 malicious block generation or forking due to errors As a result under the condition of intense multi chain 
 competition the best strategy for rational miners is to mine on every single chain By employing this 
 mechanism the miners will receive rewards regardless of which chain triumphs As the hashing power 
 invested is virtually negligible the winning miners are able to maximize their gains with extremely low 
 costs as shown in Figure 2 5 
 
 
 Figure 2 5 Schematics of Nothing at Stake attack 
 
 zand { 
 are the winning probabilities of two forks respectively When miners vote on both forks 
 E (the expectation of returns) is maximized In extreme cases where all miners on the network are profitdriven 
 no consensus will be reached even in the absence of attackers 
 
 In a traditional PoW algorithm all miners engage in a real time competition of hashing power In 
 order to implement a Nothing at Stake attack the miners must distribute their hashing power into two 
 branches which will greatly hinder their competitiveness Therefore the traditional PoW is naturally 
 resistant to Nothing at Stake attacks 
 
 In fact in the Chiron system VRF selects a corresponding working group at each block height 
 This ensures that among multiple branches only one block that has the right to generate blocks in each 
 round Similarly there is only one share of revenue Therefore other non block generating groups are not 
 economically driven to maintain two forks They will opt to make a choice between the two forks and 
 reach a consensus eventually In addition the block proposer and verifier need to call upon the bonus 
 contract after the block is generated to receive their rewards The system sets penalty on multi block 
 generation at the same block height When irregularities in calling the bonus contract during multiple 
 block generation is detected by the miner in charge it will then be submitted as evidence of malpractice 
 
 
 The system will in turn punish the block generator at that height thus we believe that the Chiron algorithm 
 eliminates the problem of nothing at stake attacks 
 
 Sybil attack 
 One form of sybil attack is when the attacker creates a large number of pseudonymous 
 identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence and to increase his own profits 
 from mining ZV CHAIN mobilizes the traditional rights staking mode to facilitate block 
 generation as the proposal probability on heavy nodes is linearly correlated to the staked right 
 Therefore distributing the right to multiple accounts to participate in block generation is not going 
 improve the expected returns Similarly the probability of a light node being selected is also 
 linearly related to its staking rights thus it is not lucrative or economically viable to perform a 
 sybil attack 
 
 Another form of sybil attack involves the attacker interacting with honest miners and steal 
 their benefit through certain means In the ZV CHAIN system there are three types of interaction 
 among nodes namely one way two way and cross chain interaction One way interaction refers 
 to receiving and storing information after its legitimacy is validated such as data synchronization 
 messages Owing to a unidirectional communication the attacker is not able to gain any profits 
 from this type of interaction alone Two way interaction refers to receiving information and giving 
 feedback to the sender (or other group members) after the information is validated such as the 
 block validation messages and group creation message The attacker can camouflage as a group 
 member and establish communication with the victim during group building or the validation 
 process in an attempt to steal profit As the group creation process is initiated by the designated 
 parent group the selection of founding members is performed by obtaining node signatures that 
 exceed the threshold value from the parent group thus it remains auditable and immutable Real 
 group members can be easily distinguished from the imposters Cross chain interaction refers to 
 receiving and transferring information which apparently will not benefit the attacker It is 
 noteworthy that the attacks mentioned above are rendered futile with the assumption that the 
 miners private keys are not disclosed as all interactions on ZV CHAIN do not involve the transfer 
 of private keys 
 
 In conclusion the ZV CHAIN system prevents malicious attacks with a self improving 
 feedback mechanism consisting of block generation participation and system health index A 
 
 
 secure and verifiable communication mechanism eliminates any possibility of security breach and 
 profit theft that cause damage to users interests 
 
 51% Attack 
 
 In pure PoW systems the adversaries of 51 percent attacks are fatal and irreversible because 
 the attackers have sufficient hashing power to branch out a longer and more complex chain to 
 eliminate the main chain Honest miners will gradually accept the attacker chain the attacker will 
 henceforth emerge victorious The ZV CHAIN system randomly assigns miners to different 
 groups 51% of the attacks may result in attackers controlling most of the working groups In this 
 case the main chain will be extended slowly and the attacker chain will be extended more rapidly 
 because it controls more groups and the chain will keep increasing as long as honest miners reject 
 the attacker chain At this time the vast majority of users can easily perceive that there are two 
 different chains in the system and they are thus afraid to trade rashly This in turn generates little 
 profit that is utterly disproportionate to the cost of initiating a 51% attack 
 
 If all nodes that are randomly connected to an ordinary user are controlled by the attacker the 
 user will continue to trust the network because he cannot perceive any anomalies in the system We believe 
 that these users can bring benefits to the attacker and we shall address them as victimized users for the 
 time being Apparently the more victimized users the greater the benefits of the attacker The following 
 is a brief analysis of the proportion of attackers and victimized users 
 
 Assume that 90% of the n nodes randomly connected to each user are controlled by an attacker 
 rendering the user a victim Assume that the number of nodes in the entire network is W and the attacker 
 control ratio is x the victim ratio is 
 
 S 
 ( )
 Q 
 Q 
 
 
 (s Q ) 
 
 
 = 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 More generally let W = 10000 n = 10 the curve of v and x is shown in Figure 2 6 below 
 
 
 Figure 2 6 Relation Between the Ratio of Attackers and Victims 
 
 From the graph above we know that when the attacker controls 50% of the nodes the percentage 
 of victims is only 1 07% Theoretically the attacker can dominate the network only if he controls 100% 
 of the nodes If the percentage of victims exceeds 90% the attack is profitable but the attacker should 
 control more than 95% of the nodes The cost of attack is enormous 
 
 Table 2 2 Key Points of Comparison 
 
 0 5 0 01071 
 0 8 0 3757 
 0 9 0 7361 
 0 95 0 914 
 1 1 
 
 Conversely when the attacker withdraws due to unprofitability the system will restore if the 
 percentage of honest miners is more than 95% 
 
 ZV CHAIN is unlikely to be susceptible to the 51% attacks that have been plaguing low hashpower 
 PoW public chains as its system will be able to resist attacks higher than 95% with the initiation of 
 
 
 further improvement to the health threshold of the system during cold start or in low power states As a 
 result ZV CHAIN will be able to offer a higher level of security 
 
 Long range attack 
 Under the PoS algorithm there are no limits imposed on the speed of block generation 
 During the early stages there is not a large number of miners If these miners unite and revert to 
 the initial stage of the system to generate blocks they would be able to create a longer chain within 
 a shorter span of time Presently ordinary users cannot distinguish the main chain from the 
 attacker chain and it is probable that the attacker chain may triumph over the main chain At 
 present many PoS implementations attempt to increase the difficulty of attacks by limiting the 
 number of rollbacks 
 
 In the ZV CHAIN system the upper and the lower limits of block difficulty are set to be zMand 
 D and zM 
 = D with the j 9 
 denoting the width of each epoch The working cycle of 
 each working group consists of n epochs At the end of each working cycle the group will be automatically 
 dismantled and subsequently enters the reconstruction stage Assuming that the attacker chooses to revert 
 to H block to initiate a long range attack and that the ratio of groups controlled by the attacker is x owing 
 to the randomness of VRF the attacker can only generate blocks during the selected window period while 
 churning out empty blocks during the non selected window periods In the long run the ratio of effective 
 blocks in the attacker chain is directly proportional to the percentage of groups controlled by the attacker 
 After n epochs the status of the chain is shown in Figure 2 7 below 
 
 
 Figure 2 7 Schematic of a long range attack 
 
 Table 2 3 Minimum Percentage of Groups that Attackers Should Control 
 
 
 K value The range of x 
 1 Greater than no solution 
 2 Greater than 50% 
 3 Greater than 33% 
 5 Greater than 20% 
 
 The maximum cumulative chain difficulty that an attacker can compute in a working cycle is as 
 follows 
 
 ==
 
 z//z J 
 j 9 zM 
 j 9 zM 
 
 
 Then the minimum cumulative difficulty of the main chain is 
 
 =
 
 z D 
 ( + j 9) D 
 
 
 The conditions for an attacker to succeed is 
 
 z//z J 
 > z D 
 
 
 After simplification 
 
 j 9( 1)> 
 
 
 Thus the attacker can only revert to a limited height to carry out long range attacks When 
 =1 the probability of a successful attack will be 0 This means that the attacker must control 
 more groups to reduce the difficulty of an attack Table 2 3 shows the minimum percentage of 
 groups to be controlled for different K values 
 
 In fact stringent conditions must be fulfilled for deductive reasoning to hold true Firstly all 
 groups controlled by the attacker must be in the same life cycle in order to sustain the attacking power 
 This condition is difficult to achieve in a random group building model Secondly the deductive reasoning 
 assumes that the attacker can reach the upper limit of the block difficulty every time while the honest 
 miners are barely able to reach the lower limit of the block difficulty As long as either one of the two 
 conditions are not satisfied the range of H will be significantly reduced Finally refusing to accept 
 outdated (n number of blocks back) blocks on the part of honest miners will limit the number of blocks to 
 which the system can perform rollbacks on 
 
 
 In short imposing difficulty levels and the effective time of blocks limits the number of blocks 
 the system can perform rollbacks on while random grouping strategy and group periodic reconstruction 
 mechanism make it impossible for the attacker to maintain a long term high intensity attack This makes 
 it almost impossible for the ZV CHAIN system to suffer long range attacks 
 
 DDOS attacks 
 DDOS attack refers to attacks initiated by perpetrators who organize a batch of computers to 
 submit a large number of requests to service nodes aiming at exhausting resources by keeping the 
 service nodes busy processing requests to the extent that the nodes are unable to continue 
 providing services All nodes in the Bitcoin and Ethernet network engage in decentralized PoW 
 computation We believe that the degree of decentralization will determine the strength of defense 
 against DDOS attacks The Chiron algorithm uses VRF to randomly select validating groups 
 across the network On the surface the validating group becomes the temporary center of the 
 system However owing to the randomness and unpredictability of the VRF mechanism the 
 virtual center changes dynamically each round so fundamentally the system remains 
 decentralized 
 
 The Last Member Attack 
 All nodes in the ZV CHAIN system participate in the distributed ledger through group 
 collaboration Every block is validated by the threshold signature and nodes outside the group 
 can be validated with the group public key As such it is immutable If the last member attempts 
 to manipulate the data it will ultimately result in a failure in validation with the attacker left with 
 nothing to gain Deliberately remaining inactive is also a form of last member attack However 
 in ZV CHAIN any node within the group can be the last member so a single point does not exist 
 As long as an honest node exists the attacker is deemed to fail Under extreme circumstances 
 where the attacker controls all members in a certain group a veto by the attacker will trigger the 
 system into skipping the current round and proceeding directly to the next round rendering the 
 attack futile 
 
 Double Spending attack 
 The common practice of a double spending attack is to create a sub chain that can potentially 
 take over the main chain The attacker needs to control at least half of the nodes in a certain group 
 to initiate an attack In order for this to happen the attacker broadcasts his transactions whilst a 
 
 
 block is being generated before transferring the transaction to a different fork This will happen 
 simultaneously with the generation of a new block on the same fork After the transaction is 
 confirmed on the main chain (the confirmation time is short) the attacker then broadcasts the fork 
 If the difficulty of the forked chain is greater than the cumulative difficulty of the current main 
 chain the attacker chain will gain recognition as the main chain Records of the previous 
 transaction will disappear as if they have never existed This attack strategy is similar to that of 
 long range attacks For detailed explanations please refer to the section on defense against longrange 
 attacks 
 
 Private mining Attack 
 In the bitcoin system all miners can perform PoW mining at any block height Nodes with a 
 stronger hashing power can hide the blocks they have mined and embark on the next mining cycle 
 discreetly to get a head start In ZV CHAIN all miners mine collaboratively in groups In order 
 to broadcast a generated block the miner needs to gather threshold signature from majority of the 
 group members rendering private mining impossible for individual miners On a group level the 
 group is not guaranteed the right to mine as group rotation is solely based on VRF As a result 
 privately mining is also impossible for group collusions 
 
 The single chain performance of the Chiron consensus mechanism is 3000 TPS a rate that sets 
 the stage for high level security and decentralization Chiron offers the optimal solution to the impossible 
 trinity of decentralization security and performance as compared to all existing consensus mechanisms 
 The Chiron consensus mechanism has considered the issue of cost effectiveness in performance since the 
 conception of the project and capitalizes fully on group idle time as well as the design of the periodic 
 checkpoint mechanism 
 
 2 2 Privacy Preserving Computing and Security Framework 
 2 2 1 Data Privacy and Regulation 
 The key features of the blockchain technology include decentralization and credibility both of 
 which enables reliable P2P value transfer amongst unknown nodes without relying on a trusted third party 
 authority These key features are instrumental in reducing transaction costs and enhancing the efficiency 
 of interactions The blockchain technology has broad applications in the future with an optimistic outlook 
 and is believed to be the pivotal technology in leading the transition of the Internet from an information 
 
 
 network to a value network However with the development and application of the blockchain technology 
 the problem of data security has become increasingly pronounced 
 
 1 Transaction privacy 
 Bitcoin the creative brainchild of Nakamoto Satoshi and the decentralized platform 
 subsequently developed have lifted the heavy reliance on third party transaction platforms Yet 
 at the same time all transaction records of Bitcoin must be broadcasted on the blockchain and 
 group consensus must be reached to safeguard the security of the entire system In other words 
 in addition to the transparency of all online transaction records the sender and receiver addresses 
 used during transactions will be exposed The original Bitcoin protocol does not provide extra 
 measures to protect user privacy After analyzing the transaction pattern of a certain address and 
 corroborating it with real life information the attacker can easily discern relations between the 
 transaction address and the actual person which poses a great threat to user privacy In view of 
 these pertinent issues researchers have proposed two fundamental attributes of cryptocurrency 
 privacy 
 
 a) Unlinkability 
 The inability to distinguish whether two transactions are sent to the same person leads 
 to the inability to discern who the receiver is 
 
 b) Untraceability 
 Untraceability refers to the inability to discern who the sender is ZV CHAIN is a 
 public chain that facilitates banking services thus data privacy protection is of utmost 
 importance 
 
 2 Privacy Protection Theory 
 We deploy zero knowledge proof technology to safeguard account security and user privacy 
 In addition homomorphic encryption technology is incorporated in the field of data storage 
 security and privacy protection Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption which allows 
 for computation on ciphertexts generating an encrypted result which when decrypted matches 
 the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext From the standpoint of 
 abstract algebra this method preserves the homomorphism of the encrypted text Homomorphic 
 encryption veils the original information from the processors gaze It also provides a contingency 
 plan which integrates blockchain technology with the existing infrastructure By adopting 
 
 
 homomorphic encryption for data storage on the blockchain a perfect balance is achieved 
 ensuring that no major changes are made to the fundamental structure of the blockchain The 
 blockchain remains a public chain though on chain data is encrypted to address the problem of 
 privacy violation The homomorphic encryption not only installs private chain features on the 
 public chain and safeguards user privacy it also allows access to on chain data for auditing and 
 other purposes In other words incorporating homomorphic encryption combines the strengths of 
 both public and private chains Beyond that homomorphic encryption will allow smart contracts 
 on the blockchain to process ciphertexts ensuring that the original content of the contracts remain 
 concealed which in turn enhances the security and privacy of the network 
 
 3 Privacy Protection Schemes 
 a) The Dandelion Protocol 
 One of the major challenges to privacy concerns in cryptocurrency is that transactions 
 can be traced when transactions are added to mempool transmitted across the network 
 and linked back to the original IP address Even on networks with effective privacy 
 measures the transaction information can be de anonymized to reveal the identity of the 
 users The Dandelion Protocol is proposed as a network layer solution to ameliorate 
 privacy concerns during transmissions on network Under this protocol a transaction is 
 transmitted in two phases namely the anonymity phase and the spreading phase In the 
 anonymity phase transactions are relayed through a privacy graph to a single random 
 peer who relays to another single peer through the same algorithm This pattern continues 
 until one of the nodes broadcasts the transaction in the typical format of diffusion to the 
 rest of the network hence marking the transition into the second phase By relaying the 
 transaction to random peer nodes on the network before diffusing to the rest of the 
 network the source of transaction would become virtually untraceable 
 
 b) I2P Anonymous Network 
 I2P is an anonymous network project implemented as a Mix Network I2P is a 
 network layer consisting of I2P routers with garlic routing which provides a secure and 
 anonymous platform for applications to communicate without any restrictions I2P uses 
 UDP and TCP protocols simultaneously and supports UPnP mapping 
 
 To cater to the needs of Tor anonymous network users ZV CHAIN offers support 
 by using the SOCKET VPN to link to local Tor portals At later stages users will also be 
 
 
 able to implement orchid library on nodes or in their wallets In addition I2P chosen as 
 one of ZV CHAINs anonymity network support will set the stage for the implementation 
 of local VPN or SAM implants ZV CHAIN uses I2Ps original tool to dock into the 
 anonymous network and guarantees the anonymity of the users network so that their IP 
 addresses remain untraceable ZV CHAIN has plans to employ a more sophisticated P2P 
 network technology in the second phase of development 
 
 c) MimbleWimble Protocol 
 The MimbleWimble number [10] is initially conceived as an improvement to the 
 Bitcoin network The transaction address and amount are concealed in the MimbleWimble 
 protocol while the intermediate steps are cut through During each transaction the 
 parties involved create a public multi signature key There is no address input into the 
 system as both parties share a so called blinding factor a type of digital currency 
 encryption which shares secrets with the two parties involved exclusively and is able to 
 safeguard network privacy 
 
 The MimbleWimble protocol uses the Pederson Commitment Scheme in which full 
 nodes deduct the encrypted amounts from both the inputs and outputs creating a balanced 
 equation by introducing the blinding factor that proves that no coins were produced out 
 of thin air During this process the actual amount of the transaction remains unknown to 
 the node A Cut through can be understood with the following analogy A gives B an 
 amount of money which in turn is given to C in full This is equivalent to B not 
 participating in the transaction thus Bs information is not recorded on the chain Cutthrough 
 compresses the size of the blockchain making it much lighter in terms of data 
 storage ZV CHAIN fully embraces regulations by providing an auditable wallet that is 
 open to multiple auditing functions The wallet generates an additional public/private key 
 pair which is used to label transactions Auditing agencies with the public key can decrypt 
 the transactions on the chain but are not able to create labelled transactions This 
 mechanism provides transparent transaction information to the authorized parties without 
 compromising the privacy of the companies involved in the transaction 
 
 
 2 2 2 Formal Proof 
 The Ethereum network brings smart contract to blockchain technology and expands the functions 
 of the blockchain exponentially However just this year alone several ERC based ICO projects were 
 hacked due to loopholes discovered in the smart contract codes causing massive damage to investors 
 This serves as a wake up call to all stakeholders involved in the cryptocurrency industry Safeguarding 
 the security of the smart contract is of paramount concern to all public chain developers ZV CHAIN 
 proposes the formal proof of smart contracts as a viable solution After users upload their smart contracts 
 the ZV CHAIN system will carry out a validation procedure on the structure of the smart contract while 
 incorporating the traditional test+audit model The two pronged approach is a powerful strategy to 
 strengthen the security of the smart contract 
 
 Currently there are two solutions to the security issues of smart contracts namely the testing of 
 contract code and auditing These two solutions will allow the detection of most security loopholes to a 
 certain extent therefore they are considered necessary actions in guaranteeing contract security 
 However both solutions are not without intrinsic flaws The contract testing team develops an automatic 
 testing software that generates an exhaustive list of test cases to verify whether the smart contract can 
 function under various conditions However test cases generated are not able to cover every single 
 scenario As a result even if the test results turn out to be negative it does not necessarily mean that the 
 contract is without security flaws On the other hand auditing requires the security team to assess the 
 contract from various perspectives such as coding service logic etc and provides professional opinions 
 to the project team on how to rectify bugs Although professional security teams are able to identify 
 majority of the loopholes and vulnerabilities the auditing process relies largely on the experience and 
 judgment of the auditing team thus it is not a 100% foolproof solution 
 
 Formal proof is a representation of the contract code with formal logic and strictly observes the 
 rule of inference and mathematical deduction This process relies on the rigour of mathematical reasoning 
 and ensures full coverage of the runtime behaviors The absolute correctness of runtime behaviors can be 
 guaranteed to a certain extent As such the process of formal proof overcomes the limitations of the two 
 traditional methods mentioned above 
 
 Formal verification refers to the use of formal methods in mathematics to prove or falsify the 
 attributes of the algorithm There are two types of formal methods 
 
 1 Model Checking 
 
 All possible states of the system are listed and tested exhaustively The process is fully 
 automatic but cannot be scaled to large systems 
 
 2 Deductive validation 
 A collection of mathematical proofs is generated from the system and it is discharged 
 using either interactive or automatic theorem prover This method is suitable for large systems 
 but requires manual conversions of the operation method of the system into a language that the 
 verification system can understand 
 
 In blockchain applications if security is compromised during the implementation of smart 
 contracts it will cause enormous and irreversible damage to the users due to the immutability of the 
 blockchain Once the network is under attack a group consensus must be reached in order to roll back the 
 transaction However rolling back is not the most effective nor realistic remedy to malicious attacks It is 
 thus crucial to perform numerous trials and errors during the development stage to fend against malicious 
 attacks Yet trial and error though comprehensive has its own trade offs as it inevitably sacrifices the 
 speed of iteration The scarcity of blockchain developers renders it more challenging to keep up with the 
 surge in the number of smart contracts developed Moreover the cost of manual audit is enormous 
 therefore the transition towards machine aided validation is imminent It is relatively straightforward for 
 machines to perform syntax and semantic validation due to the low technical entry threshold However 
 the machine aided validation stops at the correction of superficial errors and is unable to comprehend 
 deep level programming logic Ultimately formal proof is the only means that has immense potential to 
 shed light on enhancing the automated auditing process of smart contracts 
 
 2 2 3 Communication Security 
 The network communication security is achieved by the logic of the application layer At the 
 application layer we classify communication information across the entire network according to the 
 security requirements For communication that requires secure channels we will use the ECDH encrypt 
 secure channel for P2P communication to bulwark communication security 
 
 2 3 Smart Contracts 
 In the process of rapid DAPP development we are confronted with similar problems that are 
 facing traditional application development if not more intense These problems are the undesirable side 
 
 
 effects of a decentralization network ZV CHAIN aspires to create a holistic and effective ecosystem for 
 developers premised on honoring the spirit of contract safeguarding security and guaranteeing equality 
 and fairness The system is designed to facilitate the rapid development and implementation of DAPP 
 projects 
 
 2 3 1 Contract Upgrade 
 Functional upgrading has always been an integral part of the traditional application development 
 process Transaction is the precursor of DAPP The trade off of honoring the blockchain spirit code is 
 law is that functional upgrade has yet to gain traction with respect to systemization ZV CHAIN 
 ultimately envisions to build a robust commercial platform for DAPP development We propose to 
 establish a holistic contract upgrade and facilitate the negotiation of functional upgrade planning between 
 the contract initiators and users on a platform level The contract initiator sends a contract upgrade 
 invitation to users who upon receiving it will evaluate the potential impact of the proposal on their 
 individual interests and decide if they wish to proceed with the upgrade The process is illustrated in 
 Figure 2 8 
 
 
 Figure 2 8 Smart Contract Upgrade Diagram 
 
 
 2 3 2 Major Anomaly Repair (Hard fork) 
 In traditional application development in addition to daily functional upgrade and bug fixing 
 there are also forced upgrades triggered by major bugs and data rollbacks During the DAPP iterations 
 based on smart contracts the decision of whether to enforce an upgrade or data rollback should not be 
 decided by the developers alone Support from the platform level is instrumental in rapidly restoring the 
 system and solving severe problems during DAPP operation to achieve minimal hard fork 
 ZV CHAIN will provide a comprehensive set of interfaces and toolchain to assist developers to swiftly 
 proceed to fork when major bugs are detected during DAPP operations These include mirror duplicating 
 the contract data copying and rolling back to a specific height and broadcasting to all DAPP participants 
 
 2 3 3 Efficient VM and Contract Language Python 
 ZV CHAIN uses TVM which is developed in house and supports scalable primitives as the 
 keywords for smart contracts It also supports several user friendly programming languages such as 
 python and go and offers a variety of smart contract templates for common scenarios which can be called 
 by simply changing a few settings 
 
 Python is a highly accessible programming language with a smooth learning curve and can be 
 learnt in an interactive environment powered by command line interpreter The syntax of Python is elegant 
 reflecting a minimalist thinking while the code is exceptionally readable with an efficient code audit 
 The linguistic ecology of Python is sophisticated with a comprehensive built in library and a myriad of 
 third party API gateways by virtue of Pythons open source feature The strengths listed above are 
 testimonies to Python being a highly capable development language simple syntax and comprehensive 
 libraries can significantly enhance the development efficiency while the linguistic characteristics of the 
 script lower the cost of debugging The ease of learning renders python one of the most popular 
 introductory language among beginners and is most widely accepted as a contract language 
 
 2 3 4 Financial Service Standardized Component Library and Component Market 
 TVM introduces a series of generic component libraries that offer high efficiency and low GAS 
 consumption Apart from providing high decoupling function and reusability TVM also significantly 
 reduces the consumption of storing data on the blockchain Calibrating frequent requests across industries 
 TVM will establish a standardized protocol to streamline the standardized procedure for wallets to handle 
 requests In the meantime TVM will build a standardized component market to encourage the 
 development of component libraries by the third party Subjecting to rigorous auditing these third party 
 
 
 libraries will be stored on the blockchain and released to DAPP developers to further cut down the cost 
 of research and the storage consumptions Calling the components alone will not be charged The platform 
 will reward tokens to component developers according to the times their components are called In 
 addition the platform prevents malicious calling by giving out tokens that are less than the GAS 
 consumption each time By employing the incentive mechanism developers are motivated to take more 
 initiatives and component libraries substantiated which in turn ease the development of DAPP With the 
 proliferation of third party libraries developers will receive incentives in the form of tokens which 
 encourage them to optimize and create more practical and reliable libraries We believe that the model of 
 creating generic component libraries and application component libraries is instrumental to build a healthy 
 and robust ZV CHAIN ecosystem as shown in Figure 2 9

 2 4 Cross chain Technology 
 The cross chain technology seeks to hurdle the constraints of inter chain operability by allowing 
 the transmission of value and information between different blockchain network Specifically the 
 blockchain network is a type of distributed ledger with each block an independent ledger and there is no 
 obvious connection between two separate ledgers Essentially it is impossible to transfer value between 
 ledgers However when it boils down to individual user level the value stored on one blockchain by a 
 user can be transferred to another blockchain which in essence is the circulation of value Currently there 
 
 
 are several blockchains that are widely used including the public chain the private chain and the 
 consortium blockchain The common trend is that the development of private chain is evolving towards 
 the consortium chain which in turn is advancing towards the public chain The evolution of different types 
 of blockchain network is also a testimony to the growing demand of blockchain interoperability 
 
 2 4 1 Major Types of Cross chain Technology 
 Among many challenges facing blockchain the lack of interoperability between blockchain 
 networks hinders the application and potential proliferation of the blockchain Regardless if it is public 
 chain or private chain cross chain technology is the key to materialize the Internet of Value the boat that 
 emancipates blockchain from a deserted isle and the bridge that connects blockchain technology to its 
 broader applications in the outside world In addition to the three types of mainstream cross chain 
 technologies mentioned in a report on blockchain interoperability [11] from Vitalik the founder of 
 Ethereum to R3 a banking consortium the existing cross chain technology includes distributed private 
 key control All of which will be elaborated below 
 
 1 Notary Schemes 
 The notary scheme has gained a lot of attention in the field of licensed ledger as not only 
 does it pose as a leading contestant to the scalable consensus it also dispenses with excess 
 Proof of Work algorithm or complex proof of a benefit mechanism Suppose there is no 
 mutual trust established between A and B then a third party notary a trusted intermediary 
 chosen by both parties can be introduced In that case indirect trust is established between A 
 and B One of the exemplary applications of the notary scheme is the Interledger Protocol (ILP) 
 developed by the Ripple Labs in 2002 It is not a standalone ledger nor is it seeking to achieve 
 any consensus On the contrary it provides a top layer cryptographic escrow called the 
 connector or verifier which facilitates the flow of money between ledgers The notary 
 elected by both parties involved in the transaction is guaranteed to be highly reliable and is 
 to validate the effectiveness and authenticity of the data The Interledger Protocol is applicable 
 to all ledger systems while the differences among which are duly accommodated The protocol 
 aims to establish a universal payment standard across the globe creating a consolidated 
 protocol for online financial transfers 
 
 2 Sidechains/Relays 
 The sidechain technology facilitates asset portability between Bitcoin and other 
 blockchain chains It is a new blockchain technology that enables interoperability among 
 
 
 multiple blockchain networks by pegging the original digital assets with assets on other ledgers 
 not unlike the pegging of gold with fiat currency The sidechain technology is a type of scaling 
 technology that aims to enhance the scalability of the mainchain and further pushes the 
 boundaries of blockchain application and innovation It enables the traditional blockchain 
 network to support various types of assets micropayment smart contracts security 
 mechanisms and real world asset registration and enhances the privacy protection of the 
 blockchain network Notable Bitcoin sidechains include BTC Relay initiated by ConsenSys 
 Rootstock and Element Alpha of Bitcoins testnet and non Bitcoin sidechains such as Lisk 
 and Asch 
 
 Relays take over the task of trusted intermediaries in the notary scheme and function as 
 channels between different chains If the channel is a blockchain network on its own it is then 
 termed a relay chain Examples of relay chains include Polkadot and Cosmos HUB of which 
 Polkadot plans to integrate the private chain/consortium chain into the consensus network of a 
 public chain while retaining features such as data privacy and licensing of the original private 
 chain/consortium chain The mechanism of Polkadot regards other blockchain networks as 
 parallels During transactions Polkadot empowered by the relay chain technology can 
 temporarily lock tokens of the original chain by transferring them to a multi signature address 
 on the original chain The transaction on the relay chain will be validated by the signatories 
 through voting Polkadot also introduces the role of fisherman who monitors transactions on 
 the network and reports any abuses or malpractices Polkadot connects Bitcoin and Ethereum 
 to the Polkadot network and has the potential to render cross chain communication a reality 
 
 3 Hash locking 
 Hash locking originates from hash time locked contract (HTLC) of the Lightning Network 
 which offers a scalable bitcoin micropayment channel that enhances the transaction of Bitcoin 
 outside the Bitcoin network The working mechanism of the key technology HTLC will be 
 illustrated below When Alice and Bob reach a commitment transaction that temporarily locks 
 Alices 0 1 BTC If by time T (T refers to the future height of a particular block) Bob can 
 present Alice with an acceptable R (known as a secret) whose hash equals the value of H(R) 
 which is agreed upon beforehand then Bob will receive the 0 1 BTC If Bob is unable to offer 
 a satisfactory R value by time T the 0 1 BTC will be unlocked and return to Alice 
 
 4 Distributed Private Key Control 
 
 WanChain and Fusion are among the exemplary infrastructure of distributed private key 
 control protocol WanChain uses multi party computation and threshold private key sharing 
 schemes When unregistered assets are transferred from the original chain to WanChain the 
 nodes of WanChain will employ an imbedded asset template based on the protocol and 
 establish a new smart contract based on cross chain transaction data to create new assets on 
 the chain In the case of registered assets the nodes of WanChain will release tokens of 
 equivalent value according to the existing contract which guarantees the transaction and 
 circulation of the original assets on the WanChain Parallel computing is made possible 
 through multi layer consensus mechanism and ledger node grouping The multi layer 
 consensus mechanism enables the sequential completion of the contract computation and the 
 documentation of the computation results on ledgers The grouping of ledger nodes distributes 
 the workload and facilitates the documentation of different smart contracts on different ledger 
 nodes 
 
 At present there are pros and cons for all four types of cross chain technology Different 
 business scenarios and the technical capabilities of respective projects must be taken into 
 consideration when conducting a holistic evaluation of the said types of cross chain technology 
 Evaluation parameters include but not limited to interoperability trust models the presence of 
 cross chain exchanges the applicability of cross chain oracles the support of cross chain asset 
 mortgage difficulties in operations and multi token smart contracts 
 
 2 4 2 ZV CHAIN Cross chain Protocol 
 Blockchains are designed to be immutable and traceable We believe that the burgeoning of DAPP 
 is most likely to be first developed in the field of digital assets with applications on areas such as supply 
 chain finance digital copyrights electronic invoice and gaming ZV CHAIN supports the mapping and 
 tokenisation of real life assets while transactions between users can be executed via the registered assets 
 on the ZV CHAIN network to effect value transfer Through the tokenisation of assets even some offline 
 commercial transactions can be locked and managed through smart contracts 
 
 Besides issues such as limited storage space and performance constraints there is another 
 compelling reason why blockchain projects are yet to be adapted on a large scale to commercial 
 applications that is individual blockchain project is an isolated Internet of value It is impossible to settle 
 all commercial projects on one blockchain network In this respect multi chain and multi ecosystem are 
 not only probable but also the conceivable future The challenges of collaborations among various 
 
 
 blockchain projects have considerably impeded the progress of blockchain application development In 
 response to the problem ZV CHAIN proposes a cross chain protocol that supports the value exchange 
 and transfer across various chains 
 
 The ZV CHAIN network is not only an independent blockchain network but it also materializes 
 cross chain communications including asset transaction and value transfer The ZV CHAIN protocol will 
 include the following roles 
 
 Interception node 
 An interception node functions as full nodes of the original chain by generating new 
 blocks on the original chain and executing transactions It collects valid transaction 
 information that facilitates cross chain communications and transmits it to the validation 
 nodes 
 
 Validation node 
 A validation node is the notary node of the original chain and the miner node of the 
 ZV CHAIN network that validates the authenticity of the data on the original chain and 
 imbeds it in the new blocks on ZV CHAIN 
 
 Gateway node 
 A gateway node functions as the wallet node for both the original network and ZV 
 CHAIN which is equivalent of the gateway between them It documents and processes 
 transactions in and out of the original chain This type of nodes requires the allocation of 
 corresponding tokens on the original chain to achieve cross chain oracle 
 
 ZV CHAIN positions itself as the transit point of the future blockchain world by integrating userfriendly 
 smart contracts with new business scenarios and bringing disruptive innovations to traditional 
 business while enabling all business to implement blockchain technology and laying groundwork for trust 
 and value exchange in the future 
 
 
 CHAPTER THREE 
 ZV CHAIN Performance Optimization Proposal 
 
 3 1 Sharding and Parallel Computing Framework 
 The Chiron consensus is able to attain the performance of POS without compromising the features 
 of decentralization and security and 3000+TPS is powerful enough to support the majority of commercial 
 applications In consideration of the scalability of ultra large scale applications ZV CHAIN draws 
 inspiration from the MapReduce of Google and the Batch Compute of Alibaba Cloud and designs a 
 sharding framework that allows the execution of parallel transaction to further improve throughput 
 
 In the parallel computing framework the heavy nodes are split into computational nodes and 
 proposal node In other words in a block generation cycle multiple proposal nodes are selected based on 
 the random number generated during the previous cycle (For detailed explanations please refer to the 
 chapter on the Chiron consensus mechanism) On the other hand nodes selected based on computations 
 from signatures and transaction proposers addresses are called the computational nodes The 
 computational nodes are responsible for transaction execution while proposal nodes manage block 
 generation The detail workflow of sharing computation is show in Figure 3 1 
 
 
 Figure 3 1 Shard Calculation Flowchart 
 
 
 Transaction shards 
 The transaction data is sent to different computational nodes based on signatures of the 
 previous block and the proposers address There are no restrictions imposed on the receivers 
 address rendering our model more flexible than the state channel Multiple transactions from the 
 same proposer will be transmitted to a single computational node which in turn can detect doublespending 
 risks within the shortest window period In the meantime the VRF algorithm in the 
 Chiron consensus randomly assigns computational nodes as a strategy to distribute transactions 
 to nodes The multiplexing and the random nature of computational nodes enhance the robustness 
 and security of the system 
 
 Transaction execution 
 The computational node will carry out transactions according to the while keeping track of 
 changes in the user accounts The execution of transactions usually depends on the data of account 
 status such as account balance and user data stored in the contract In ZV CHAIN the complete 
 set of data is stored on computational nodes by design Whenever a new block is generated the 
 local status will be updated therefore computational nodes can execute transactions locally 
 without performing complex cross chain interactions 
 
 Merger 
 The result of every transaction execution will be submitted to proposal nodes of which the 
 content includes the Merkle root (hereafter referred to as the root) of account status the accounts 
 affected by the transaction and the deviation in account status The proposal nodes will iterate 
 over the results collected and compare local root with the root submitted to filter the transaction 
 results and consolidate them in to a candidate set The proposal nodes will then merge the 
 deviations of account status in the candidate set with local accounts to generate the final account 
 status 
 
 Validation blocks 
 The validation blocks authenticate the results of transaction execution within the validation 
 groups to generate a group signature and proceed with the final block generation For detailed 
 illustration please refer to the part on validation group consensus and block generation under the 
 section of Chiron consensus 
 
 
 3 2 ZLight Lightning Network 
 The introduction of Lightning Network technology not only improves the throughput of the 
 system but also constitutes an integral part of the ZV CHAIN branch structure The lightning network 
 allows funding transactions to be committed offline securely with minimal synchronization with the 
 mainchain instead of frequently updating micropayment in real time on the blockchain network The with 
 the help of the Lightning Network technology B2C lightweight connection can be rapidly established to 
 facilitate secure transactions In addition ZV CHAIN designs both unidirectional and bidirectional 
 lightning networks that cater to different business scenarios 
 
 3 2 1 ZLight Unidirectional Lightning Network 
 The unidirectional lightning network is highly accessible Business owners do not need to put it 
 advance deposit to complete high frequency low volume transactions with clients The unidirectional 
 network is applicable to fast moving consumer goods business such as sundry shops mini mart and small 
 diners In Figure 3 2 the workflow of the unidirectional lightning network is delineated 
 
 
 Fig 3 2 The Flowchart of ZV CHAIN Unidirectional Lighting Network 
 
 3 2 2 ZLight Bidirectional Lightning Network 
 
 The bidirectional lightning network is catered to business owners with relatively high liquidity 
 such as the supply chain finance and upstream and downstream The B2B payment channel supports 
 bidirectional offline asset circulation without compromising the security The bidirectional lightning 
 network is the standard lightning network channel that supports full duplex data transmission 
 The security of the bidirectional lightning network which allows the transaction to proceed without having 
 to announce it in public is safeguarded by penalizing the uncooperative participants The key lies in how 
 to detect and penalize someone when he broadcasts a favorable intermediary commitment transaction on 
 the network The schematics diagram of how Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract (RSMC) safeguards 
 the system security is illustrated in Figure 3 3 
 
 
 Figure 3 3 ZV CHAIN Bidirectional Lightning Network Security Structure 
 
 The ZLight model designs a delayed payment period that regularly sends out transaction notices to a party 
 if its counterpart broadcasts the intermediary commitment transaction on the mainchain and punishes the 
 other party by forfeiting the full transaction amount 
 
 3 2 3 ZLight Branch Structure 
 The RSMC of the Lightning Network can enhance the throughput of the mainchain If we were 
 to set up offline payment channels among 1 million customers and 100 thousands business owners we 
 will need to build 1 
 100 h 
 = 
 10 Should there be more 
 users or business owners joining the ZV CHAIN mainchain the number will be magnified in terms of 
 
 
 Cartesian Product Acknowledging the disparity in scalability of various industries in different regions 
 ZV CHAIN introduces HTLC to formulate a branch structure In traditional HTLC once a node on the 
 chain goes offline or becomes temporarily unavailable the transaction will be immediately locked and 
 the asset will remain frozen for a prolonged period which makes it difficult to maintain a stable and 
 efficient transaction network ZV CHAIN blazes new trails by innovatively restricting the HTLC depth to 
 two layers and integrating the branch structure This means that only HTLC nodes authenticated by ZV 
 CHAIN will become the branch nodes of the mainchain This innovation guarantees the stability of the 
 HTLC services while capitalizes the returns on each node The structural design is elaborated in 
 Figure 3 4 
 
 
 Figure 3 4 ZLight Branch structure 
 
 3 3 Distributed Data Storage 
 The distributed data store encompasses not only block data but also account balance contract 
 codes and contract internal data Let us set an expiry time T1 for data D which means that D will be stored 
 on all proposal nodes before T1 We refer to data D as hot data as shown in Figure 3 5 
 
 
 Figure 3 5 Distributed Data Storage and Managementthe Diagram of Hot/Cold Data Storage 
 
 After T1 we will perform a modulo operation on the node ID according to the data hash value to 
 ascertain the shard in which D is located (If the node ID is base 16 we can take the first 16 hexadecimal 
 digits and configure 16 groups encoded from 0 to F) Data D will be preserved on the proposal nodes 
 located on the same shard as D while other proposal nodes will retain the hash of D instead of the original 
 data The hash of D stored on other nodes is called warm data 
 
 Similarly let us set an expiry time T2 for the warm data After T2 the storage of warm data is 
 switched over to storage nodes that are slower and consequently less expensive The data switched over 
 is called cold data When historical data is required for transactions during block generation the network 
 will first read the local data before searching through the warm and cold data storage nodes Once found 
 the data will be validated based on local hash Once data validation is completed the storage node that 
 provides the data will be rewarded otherwise if the validation fails or is timeout the transaction will not 
 be processed in the block 
 
 3 4 P2P Network 
 
 From the perspective of business applications transaction throughput and latency are the most 
 important trading performance indicators for companies Key factors affecting the performance of 
 blockchain networks include broadcast communications information encryption and decryption 
 consensus mechanism transaction verification mechanism among several other aspects As the P2P 
 
 
 network constitutes the core technology of blockchain the efficiency of P2P communications has a huge 
 impact on the overall performance of the blockchain network The implementation of light node validation 
 and inter/intra group communications in the Chiron consensus mechanism both rely heavily on highperformance 
 P2P network The P2P network of ZV CHAIN performs a significant technical upgrade from 
 the classical model which is illustrated in Figure 3 6 
 
 
 Figure 3 6 ZV CHAIN P2P Architecture 
 
 Major improvements include 
 
 Significantly increased node uptime with the new NAT penetration technology (patent pending)

 3 4 1 NAT Penetration 
 The standard STUN [13] is presented as a solution to the problem facing the mainstream NAT 
 penetration STUN classifies NAT devices into four categories full cone NAT restricted cone NAT portrestricted 
 cone NAT and symmetric NAT We have consolidated statistics from 60 000 Internet cafes in 
 China on the categories of their NAT devices among which 5% of the Internet cafes use full cone 7% 
 restricted cone 58% port restricted cone and 30% symmetric A theoretical penetration rate of 56% can 
 be calculated from the following equation 
 
 5%100%+7%100%+58%70%+30%12% 
 =56 20% 
 
 
 On the other hand due to the existence of the NAT firewall the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
 packet in a passive mode upon reaching the NAT device will trigger the generation of a corresponding 
 record on the tracking block connected to the port This side effect will cause a failure of prediction in the 
 subsequent ports and in turn result in the failure of the entire penetration process STUN does not take into 
 account of the NAT firewall hence the actual penetration rate is curbed at around 30% 40% 
 
 After a thorough analysis of the Linux kernel protocol stack we redefine the categorization of 
 NAT devices based on port forwarding rules and proceed to re classify them into three categories namely 
 host port fixed port and symmetric port By this definition the statistics collected from 60000 Internet 
 cafes is re consolidated among which the percentage of host port is 75% fixed port 23% and symmetric 
 port 2% The theoretical penetration rate is thus enhanced to 96% based on the following calculation 
 
 
 75%98%+23%98%+2%098%+23%98%+2%0% 
 = 
 96 04% 
 
 
 ZV CHAIN solves the problem of penetration failure caused by the change in mapping ports 
 induced by the router/firewall upon receiving non correlated passive packets by designing the time tolive 
 (TTL) dynamic adjustment algorithm The algorithm enables the actual penetration rate to approach 
 theoretical values 
 
 3 4 2 Multicast Network 
 All nodes on ZV CHAIN will be added to the global KAD network where every node will be 
 connected to 8 16 neighbor nodes The communication between neighbor nodes facilitates the transaction 
 broadcast block chain synchronization and group chain synchronization ZV CHAIN constructs a twolayer 
 KAD network to locate member nodes and ensures highly efficient communication among group 
 members that in turn expedites the process of proposal submission and validation The two layer multicast 
 network has an edge over the global KAD network in terms of accelerating intra group information 
 transmission and mitigating the load on the entire network

 3 4 3 RUDP 
 RUDP has significant advantages over TCP in the scenarios of high uptime networks and large 
 amounts of fragmented validation data interaction From a macro perspective the industry is gradually 
 moving away from TCP and towards the adoption of RUDP The QUIC framework proposed by Google 
 for instance can be seen as a superset of RUDP As ZV CHAIN requires high connectivity and 
 collaborative block generation it has replaced TCP with open source and mature RUDP in the 
 communication layer 
 
 
 CHAPTER FOUR 
 The Technical Architecture of ZV CHAIN 
 
 4 1 ZV CHAIN Core Technology Architecture 
 ZV CHAIN is a native public blockchain which guarantees the decentralization of on chain 
 application and the immutability of on chain data The core businesses running on ZV CHAIN are smartcontract 
 based decentralized applications Technologies besides blockchain are adopted to support the 
 smooth running of these Dapps particularly in the field of finance On the one hand the introduction of 
 new technology aims to protect user privacy and trade secrets For instance risk control services would 
 benefit greatly from big data and cloud technology while clearing requires distributed computing clusters 
 on the other hand with the help of new technology we hope to provide a better user experience by 
 integrating existing technologies such as distributed service clusters and CDN to get a better gauge of user 
 expectations and pain points The framework of the core technology of ZV CHAIN is elaborated in Figure 
 
 4 1 below 
 4 2 ZV CHAIN Node Architecture 
 4 2 1 Node Categorization 
 The ZV CHAIN node is the umbrella term used to describe all participants of the ZV CHAIN 
 ecosystems We can classify them into four groups according to the ecological roles they play namely the 
 cornerstone node the user node the miner node and the guardian node The node functions include 
 proposal validation storage risk control and inspection These nodes can also be classified in three groups 
 based on the minimum requirements for node devices namely light node heavy node and supernode As 
 ZV CHAIN advances into the maturity stage with the expansion of ledgers on the mainchain network 
 the mainchain will kick off the provision of the distributed ledger storage function the heavy nodes will 
 be subdivided into storage nodes and hashing nodes (also known as computational nodes) 
 
 
 Figure 4 1 ZV CHAIN Core Technology Framework 
 
 
 User Node (Light Node) 
 The user node brings liquidity by virtue of the extensive use of mobile wallet on the ZV 
 CHAIN network to digital assets in the ecosystem User nodes can receive incentives by 
 participating in the submissions of proposals The longer they remain active online the more 
 incentives they will get

 Miner nodes (Hashing nodes and storage nodes) 
 The miner node provides the underlying infrastructural support with the aid of lowconsumption 
 network devices such as home NAS or AP to the ZV CHAIN ecosystem Incentives 
 are gained by participating in the validation process of block generation and ledger storage 
 
 Guardian node (Supernode) 
 The guardian node the network sentinel authorized by the user and miner communities 
 collectively provides security and risk management services for all users in the ZV CHAIN 
 ecosystem in addition to offering regulatory services Both services are made possible by a high
 
 
 
 performance distributed cluster The guardian nodes in the ZV CHAIN ecosystem receive 
 incentives from real time risk calculations and full ledger storage 
 
 Foundation node (Cornerstone node) 
 The cornerstone node which is the smallest configuration in the ZV CHAIN is a node 
 commissioned by the ZV CHAIN Foundation At the systems initial stage or when it is not yet 
 crowded with external miners the cornerstone node will assume the function of the proposal node 
 the validation node the storage node and the supernode to ensure the operation of the system As 
 the number of external miners increases or after the number of proposal nodes or validation nodes 
 exceeds the threshold value the cornerstone node no longer performs the said functions but rather 
 focus on the role of monitor and inspection wither parts of the storage and risk control functions 
 preserved When the external miner nodes are dwindling the cornerstone node can be converted 
 to undertake the tasks of proposal submission validation and more 
 
 4 2 2 Node Function 
 The node architecture of ZV CHAIN is shown below in Figure 4 2 which includes five major 
 types of nodes 
 
 1 Proposal node 
 The proposal node is responsible for proposing blocks for the candidate sets 
 2 Validation node 
 The validation node has the responsibility of validating candidate block 
 3 Storage node 
 The storage node oversees storing distributed data in the system 
 4 Supernode 
 The supernode is responsible for storing the risk management data and providing 
 customers with risk control services The supernode on the ZV CHAIN network aims to help 
 perform the day to day function of the ZV CHAIN banking services while providing nodes 
 that offer complementary services apart from Bitcoin nodes These complementary services 
 include smart risk control and clearing services provided by weak decentralized nodes 
 
 
 Figure 4 2 Schematic diagram of the ZV CHAIN node function 
 
 5 Cornerstone node 
 The cornerstone node the smallest configuration of the system is independently 
 developed by the project team 
 
 During the initial stage or the network is not crowded with external miners the cornerstone node 
 will assume the function of proposal nodes validation nodes storage nodes and supernodes to ensure the 
 smooth running of the system As the number of external miners increases or after proposal nodes or 
 validation nodes exceed the threshold the cornerstone node no longer performs the functions of proposal 
 submission or validation rather it enacts the role of monitor and inspection while partially retaining 
 storage nodes and supernodes) When the number of external miner nodes is lacking the cornerstone node 
 can be converted to undertake the tasks of proposal and verification to ensure the smooth sailing of the 
 system 
 
 4 2 3 Node Relations 
 The function of the user node on the ZV CHAIN network is two fold it is the actual user of the 
 system while actively contributing to the liquidity of the network The user nodes have to pay the miner 
 nodes a levy in order to gain access to the network In the meantime the user nodes are entitled to the 
 miner revenue in accordance with their contribution to the liquidity of the system In addition the user 
 
 
 nodes are empowered to regularly nominate guardian nodes through voting The economic and ecological 
 relations among nodes are depicted in Figure 4 3 
 
 
 Figure 4 3 Economic Ecological Relations of ZV CHAIN Node 
 
 The miner nodes constitute the infrastructure of the ZV CHAIN network In order to prevent 
 potential fraud and malpractice that may be detrimental to the establishment of the ZV CHAIN network 
 it is imperative to assess the credibility of miners and their contribution to the network for all mining 
 activities in the Chiron consensus The indicators of credibility and contribution largely depend on the 
 number of ZV tokens staked and the duration of continued online activities If the number of ZV tokens 
 staked is less than the requirement the miner nodes can loan from the guardian nodes to gain the maximum 
 incentives The guardian nodes safeguard the security of the ZV CHAIN network The number of user 
 nodes determines the number the guardian nodes which provides secured risk control services to the user 
 nodes and loan and mortgage services to the miner nodes

 A 1 Chiron Consensus Terms and Symbols 
 p large prime numbers cryptographic parameters such as 256 bit prime number 
 GF(p) A finite prime field based on p 
 Node We refer to the client portal running on a user device as a node According to the hash 
 power of the device the node can be classified into two types based on the property and 
 configuration light node and heavy node 
 Heavy node computing PC professional equipment (mining machine) etc 
 Light node ordinary PC mobile phone set top box mobile device embedded device etc 
 Miners Ordinary users can participate in distributed ledger by signing up an account Let M be 
 the set of all miners and label them as 1 2 |M| The miners are classified as proposer and 
 verifier according to different functions 
 Proposer The full ledger node responsible for raising proposals 
 Verifier nodes that work in a collaborative manner and validate the authenticity of the blocks 
 nominated by the proposers and reach a consensus within the group 
 Group At any given time for some or all i M one or more subsets are arranged G1 G2 
 |M| These subsets are called group We will organize the proposers and the verifiers according 
 to a preset ratio into a working group Each working group has the same group size n = |G4| 
 Slot Slot is the time taken to generate a block The number of slots is correlated to the height of 
 the block in the rth slot a block is generated with a height of r If however the block generation 
 process fails during the rth slot then the block with height r does not exist while the prehash of 
 the (r + 1) th block points to the (r 1)th block 
 Epoch An epoch contains a number of slots which is determined by the corresponding preset 
 system parameters 
 Parent group After the number of applications to become miners meets the conditions for 
 establishing a group a new group will be initiated by the working group which becomes the 
 parent group of the new group The parent group can assign special attributes to the new group 
 such as the activation of the new group 
 Group survival period refers to the time between the activation and deactivation of the working 
 group which is a parameter set by the system When the time reaches the deactivation stage the 
 working group will be dismantled 
 
 Miner health index This index is a multifactorial function Currently we consider the following 
 factors (ranked according to priority from high to low) 
 
 Number of participations in block generation (proposals or verifications) 
 Participation rate (number of actual participation/the number of theoretical participations) 
 The health level of devices (obtained from device fingerprint) 
 Number of groups joint (duration of online activities) 
 Proof of Stake 
 
 A 2 Entities in the Settlement Network 
 Each of the following entities (network nodes or technical nomenclatures) will be part of the settlement 
 network of ZV CHAIN 
 
 1 Consumer (ZV CHAIN wallet user or card user) 
 Authorized ZV CHAIN user 
 2 Business 
 An entity that accesses the ZV CHAIN settlement network through a terminal POS or wallet and 
 accepts ZV CHAIN payment and in turn provides goods or services 
 3 Proxy node 
 A network node that acts as a proxy between consumers and businesses during transactions and 
 opens unidirectional lightning networks with the user and the business respectively It also 
 provides liquidity to currency exchange in cross border payment scenarios 
 4 Unidirectional lightning network 
 A technical (clearing) network that allows consumers and business to make high frequency lowvolume 
 transfers 
 5 bidirectional lightning network 
 A technical (clearing) network that allows high frequency transactions and exchanges between 
 proxy nodes 
 6 Dual signature contract 
 A contract that is prepaid by one or both parties The processing of the transaction requires dual 
 signatures 
 7 Commitment Transaction 
 In a dual signature contract one party signs and sends the signed transaction to the other party 
 This can be considered as completing the transaction clearing the other party signs the transaction 
 and broadcasts it on the blockchain network to complete the transaction settlement 
 8 ZV CHAIN settlement network 
 The ZV CHAIN settlement network is the distributed ledger of ZV CHAIN The result after the 
 final confirmation of the transaction (i e the settlement result) will be broadcasted to the 
 blockchain
