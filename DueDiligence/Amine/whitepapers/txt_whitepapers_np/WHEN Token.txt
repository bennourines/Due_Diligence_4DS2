b Connecting People with Time Whitepaper interface whenhub com ico@whenhub com Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cThis whitepaper provides information about the WhenHub Interface Network a new platform that uses blockchain based smart contract technology to connect people for transactional business interactions online or in person Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY WhenHub proposes to build a mobile app for connecting consumers to experts of all kinds via two way video streams text audio or in person The app will be part of a larger service ecosystem called the WhenHub Interface Network (WIN) (Patent Pending) The service will use dAPPS (distributed apps) running on the Ethereum blockchain to create secure microcontracts \xe2\x80\x93 that can be as short as 15 minutes \xe2\x80\x93 as well as to provide frictionless billing and payment service At the end of each micro contract payment in the form of WHEN Tokens will be automatically transferred to the expert No paperwork or billing is involved Users buy WHEN Tokens using a credit card or with Bitcoins at an online exchange via the WhenHub Interface app The tokens are used within the app to pay experts for their time For privacy your phone number and address are not shared with experts Our partners will provide verification services on participating experts to give consumers confidence WHEN Tokens are not an investment vehicle but because they will be artificially limited in quantity their value is expected to fluctuate based on customer demand for the WhenHub Interface app WHEN Tokens will be available to the public starting Mar 19 2018 Visit https //interface whenhub com for details of the offering The WhenHub Interface Network uses blockchain based smart contract technology to connect buyers with sellers for ad hoc transactional meetings maximizing seller monetization potential and addressing buyer needs on demand No international billing and currency issues when WHEN Tokens are involved Pricing for experts can be fixed or auction based In the gig economy think of this product as a \xe2\x80\x9clong tail\xe2\x80\x9d market for expert advice Experts of all kinds can display their availability whenever they like for as short a window as 15 minutes The WhenHub Interface app will use the existing commercial WhenHub API for scheduling and geofencing features WhenSense is our proposed technology for allowing third party sites to host ads about our participating experts\xe2\x80\x99 availability and share in the income from completed contracts Site owners paste our HTML code into their site to participate 55 million Amercians are freelancing That\xe2\x80\x99s 35% of the US workforce Nearly 53 54 Millions Millions +2 2014 55 Millions MILLIONS 2015 2016 Source Upwork com Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cDue to the nature of consulting work which often includes travel there are inevitably blocks of time during the workday that go unbilled resulting in lost income Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cPROBLEM Time \xe2\x80\x93 we are all bound by it and no matter what we do we cannot increase the number of work hours in a day beyond a certain limit That being the case it makes sense for us to maximize the monetization potential of the time we allocate for work For salaried individuals this monetization potential is usually fixed and not of concern But for millions of free agents or self employed persons monetization of work time is highly variable and very significant For these \xe2\x80\x9cindependent workers \xe2\x80\x9d time is always money Independent workers generally fit into four segments Share of working age population engaged in independent work Primary income Supplemental income Preferred choice Free agents Casual earners 30%| 49 million 40%| 64 million Out of necessity Reluctants Financially strapped 16%| 26 million 16%| 26 million Source 2016 McKinsey Global Institute survey of ~8 000 US and European respondents For independent workers who are self employed by choice and for whom their independent work is their primary source of income the biggest challenge is staying fully utilized Ideally 100% of the work time of these Free Agents or Consultants should be billable to a customer but in reality this is seldom the case Unlike casual earners reluctants or financially strapped workers who typically rely on a Service Agency to tell them where they should report next Consultants need to fend for themselves Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cPROBLEM Problems Faced by Consultants As they juggle multiple projects or transition from one customer to the next Consultants face several problems #1 Unbillable Time Due to the nature of their work which often includes travel there are inevitably blocks of time during the workday that go unbilled resulting in lost income Enough of these in a week or month and the Consultant is potentially facing hardship meeting their financial obligations #2 Project Leads Getting leads for good projects is hard Freelance marketplaces tend to be a pricing race to the bottom and are anathema for Consultants who value their knowledge and time While most have a handful of repeat customers for such independent workers there is no guarantee of billable work on a regular basis Word of mouth referrals inbound marketing through blogs/social media and networking events tend to be their primary source of project leads #3 Project Size Given the investment Consultants make of their own time to secure project leads they have no choice but to focus on larger or longer term projects which address Problem #1 and Problem #2 However there are three issues with this (a) larger projects are harder to find (b) the lead time to close larger projects is longer and (c) larger projects by their nature attract more competition An unfortunate side effect of this is that the Consultant will pass on smaller projects which could have a very real potential of becoming their next large project The problems described above are all supply side problems Consulting has demand side problems as well Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cPROBLEM Problems Faced by Customers of Consultants An individual or business customer seeking a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to provide advice encounter the following problems #1 Availability It is often challenging to find the right Consultant who can provide guidance at the time of greatest need We cannot predict when we\xe2\x80\x99ll need advice on a particular topic and there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that a trustworthy knowledgeable SME is available to provide counsel at that time #2 Leads The process to find a trustworthy and knowledgeable Consultant is difficult and time consuming It involves asking friends family business associates for a reference or as a last resort searching online and going with someone based on location online reputation and skill set That\xe2\x80\x99s only half the battle \xe2\x80\x93 you also need to determine if they fit your budget #3 Fit The more knowledgeable a Consultant the less likely they are going to be interested in one off or short term projects This means we may have to settle for someone who may not be the ideal fit for our requirement Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cPROBLEM Problems of Supply and Demand Astute readers will have noted by now that there is a one to one correspondence between the Supply and Demand side problems in the domain of Consulting Consultant WHEN Cannot find billable customers for unbilled Cannot find trustworthy SME help at the time slots because there is no easy cost time of need because there is no easy cost effective way effective way Has no efficient way to find customers with WHO ad hoc project requirements for unbilled time slots WHAT Customer Has no efficient way to find SME with the right reputation and skill set Does not do any marketing for smaller ad Does not discover any SME willing to work hoc projects due to their lower return on on an ad hoc project because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t large investment missing out on possible leads enough Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc

strategy expert with 10 years of experience but you left the workforce to have a baby Your child is now three years old and although you are interested in resuming work you cannot do it full time You are overqualified for all the part time marketing gigs and you only have certain times during the week when you are available How can customers who can benefit from your expertise find you so you can do a quick 30 or 60 minute phone call and give them guidance on their marketing strategy Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cPROBLEM 6 You are helping your child with homework that is due tomorrow It is very late in the day and the homework is vital for your child\xe2\x80\x99s grade You are both stuck on something that is preventing you from moving forward How can you find a tutor to call who can speak for 15 20 mins and answer your questions so you can help your child complete their homework 7 You are planning a four day family vacation to London You have done

relaxing vacation How can you without spending a lot of money get on a quick call with a Londoner or a tourism expert who can help you plan your trip itinerary 8 You are getting married and

can you call for a 30 min consultation to help you understand what your options are and what the pros and cons are of making certain choices Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cPROBLEM Problems of Payment Friction Assuming the problems of When Who and What are addressed for the above ad hoc consulting scenarios there still remains the huge problem of payment friction The issue of payment for short duration consulting projects is often a significant impediment preventing the transaction from ever materializing Due to the ad hoc nature of such transactions the typical process of emailing an invoice followed by check or electronic deposit for payment is simply impractical Online invoice and payment would work but the overhead time and effort by both parties to handle payment for perhaps a 15 minute phone call is also impractical If the parties are in different countries it gets even more complicated as currency conversion and taxation issues come into play Problems of Reputation and Trust When identifying a Consultant to take on a large project the process of evaluating the person includes calling references and also reviewing their past work For an ad hoc consulting project this is impractical In order to evaluate the Consultant the customer has to use online resources such as LinkedIn business website social media and blog posts to make an educated guess about the reputation and trustworthiness of a Consultant If the nature of the project requires an in person meeting both the Consultant and the customer need to mitigate the risk of meeting an unsavory character Problems of Pricing In order for a Consultant to monetize time that would be otherwise unbilled they might make a conscious decision to charge a lower amount than their usual billing rate However they want to be cautious and not make it too low Ideally there would be some way for them to find out what the market is willing to bear for their service on a specific date/time and charge that price Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cThe WhenHub Interface Network is an ecosystem that uses blockchain based smart contracts to create

for larger amount of time when short consultation is desired 4 Allows quick consultation with SMEs on topics that would be out of reach using existing methods (example interior designer nutritionist

participation on the network The detailed token economics for this will be developed over the next several months to ensure there is a balance between supply and demand for WHEN Tokens These efforts may not be successful in achieving the desired balance We believe that all participants in WIN can benefit from the tokenized ecosystem we are creating and that WHEN Tokens will have meaningful use in their hands \xe2\x80\xa2 SMEs WIN would offer a direct to consumer advertising and distribution solution As an SME demonstrate its value to buyers we expect their profile to become more valuable SMEs can be paid in WHEN Tokens thereby simplifying the backend payment process While a seller of a certain type of knowledge or service an SME may be a buyer of another type of knowledge or service and can use WHEN Tokens for those arrangements \xe2\x80\xa2 Buyers WIN would allow buyers to locate verify interact with and pay for an SME\xe2\x80\x99s time without friction and with the convenience of a mobile application \xe2\x80\xa2 Website owners Owners of websites will have the ability to earn WHEN Tokens by displaying availability of seller time slots on web pages based on a match between the web page topic and the SME\xe2\x80\x99s area of knowledge or performance focus These \xe2\x80\x9cpublishers\xe2\x80\x9d will also potentially be buyers or sellers on WIN \xe2\x80\xa2 Partners Companies that provide verification services for buyers and sellers will be designated as \xe2\x80\x9cpartners\xe2\x80\x9d and will have the ability to earn WHEN Tokens by providing such services These companies will also potentially be buyers or sellers on WIN Within this ecosystem WhenHub also intends to grant awards of a small number of WHEN Tokens to educational institutions to help students in socio economically disadvantaged neighborhoods gain access to tutors and SMEs on WIN Copyright \xc2\xa92018 CalendarTree Inc All Rights Reserved \x0cTOKEN ECONOMICS WHEN Token Allocation

WIN Seeding To encourage use of WIN we plan to seed it by distributing WHEN Tokens as incentives to a large number of users This incentive structure is similar to \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d utilized in certain other crypto currencies We expect our seeding incentives to focus on two types of users 1 Sellers/Buyers Users who use WIN to interface with each other will receive incentives We want to encourage these users to download the Interface mobile app and transact with each other on WIN For sellers and buyers incentives are divided into three categories \xe2\x80\xa2 Profile Completion Users are incentivized to create a detailed profile \xe2\x80\xa2 Verification Users are incentivized to get verified using a partner provided service \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction Users are incentivized to interface with each other on WIN 2 Publishers Users who use WhenSense to display availability of seller time slots on their website will receive incentives We want to encourage these users to sign up for a publisher account on WIN and place the WhenSense embed code on their website We expect to further define these preliminary incentive plans presented as WIN development progresses In addition we plan to create conditions and limitations to prevent fraud or misuse of our seeding program Set forth below are illustrative examples of how we may design our planned seeding
