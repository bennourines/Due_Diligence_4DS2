\xef\xac\x81rst decentralized platform for the airline industry that combines aviation management automation with a ticket distribution system By using Smart Contracts on the Blockchain we store information about any given airplane along with full technical summary and schedule This allows to instantly communicate complex sets of data within seconds without any human involvement or possibility of making mistakes Which enables us to solve complex problems in the industry and establishes TICKO io as a technological leader in airline management We believe our platform will become the industry standard by offering a safe and secure way to connect the airlines with Blockchain \xe2\x80\x93 therefore streamlining daily operations scheduling and ticket distribution We offer a simple way to instantly book and store tickets as well as eliminate the need for middle men and ticket resellers entirely by moving all operations onto a Blockchain When the marketplace becomes more democratic ticket prices naturally go down and trustless transactions allow to book affordable \xef\xac\x82ight directly from the airlines TICKO io comes with an automated ticket management system that operates on tokens built for instant transactions and forever stores information about all purchases This means that there is no way to lose purchase data while all information about any given \xef\xac\x82ight is always stored on the Contract and updates whenever there are delays or scheduling changes Most importantly the system is impossible to tamper with Our platform serves as the following 1 Ticket purchasing & distribution system 2 Management system for airlines 3 Open airplane & scheduling database Since the beginning airline industry has been consistently growing in revenue As airfare is becoming more and more affordable to the general public the industry grows to meet the demand Most online platforms right now are either brokers/resellers or only have offers from a small number of airlines providing a limited service TICKO io solves this by providing a superior technological solution for the airlines themselves and puts management booking and payment services into a Blockchain based platform We utilize the latest web development practices to not only enable a true free market in the airline industry but to also match platform users with the best possible offer within seconds There is no need to surf between multiple websites and mobile applications any longer 02 TICKO io \x0c3 MARKET OVERVIEW There are over 5000 airlines currently in operation and the global annual revenue in the airline industry exceeded 750 billion USD in 2017 The passenger demand is projected to grow another 6% in 2018 with the aviation demand rising in both established and emerging markets Compound annual growth rate when it comes to a number of commercial airline passengers is expected to be 4 7% annually between 2017 and 2032 Even after decades of growth and consolidation the airline industry is still subject to profound change \xe2\x80\x93 high variance in local transport regulations and subsidies as well as \xef\xac\x82uctuating fuel costs make predictable growth dif\xef\xac\x81cult and for every airline that makes large pro\xef\xac\x81ts there are two that end a year with billions in losses This creates a market opportunity as most participants in the economy are still adapting and searching for reliable pro\xef\xac\x81t models and ways to achieve predictable revenues At the same time the airline industry is fragmented \xe2\x80\x93 passengers and service providers often go through intermediaries and ticket resellers in order to conduct business which ends in up to 20% in additional fees High transaction costs are also an issue credit and debit card surcharges alone take upwards of $8 per purchase Lack of transparency in fee structure is especially complicated as most airlines are interested in keeping their ancillary fees hidden and lump everything into a total package Such fees are estimated to cost passengers over $7 billion a year \xe2\x80\x93 which creates a market opportunity and fuels the development of online platforms and ticket brokers As \xef\xac\x82ight is becoming a commodity rather than luxury passengers get more interested in price shopping while airlines are struggling to adapt and optimize their business models for the changing market Passengers are left struggling to \xef\xac\x81nd direct and transparent offers split between dozens of various brokerage applications while carriers are left to compete for attention outside the comfort zone of their own branded platforms All of this puts TICKO io into a perfect position to enter the expanding market and streamline the operations for both the passenger and airline side of the equation We provide a way for passengers to always have access to the best offer between their destinations of choice while also enabling carriers to build their own brands and platforms on the Blockchain structuring a predictable and scalable business model optimized for growth TICKO io 03 \x0c4 TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY The airline industry relies on and pays millions for complex management systems Business is divided between various software providers who operate behind closed doors fracturing the industry further as solutions become less \xef\xac\x82exible over time especially when they get integrated into daily operations The cost of changing or implementing something new grows exponentially with staff training and engineering involved in the process The introduction of Blockchain technology and in particular Smart Contracts opens numerous possibilities for software development In this case creation of an adaptive decentralized application with transparent architecture would not only be superior to all current solutions but also allow the carriers to coexist and instantly exchange vital information with each other always have feedback from the entire market at hand Blockchain provides a reliable and scalable way to connect airlines directly to passengers without any intermediaries or added layers of complexity involved Moreover because of the decentralized nature the platform will be transparent and reliable by default \xe2\x80\x93 so any additional airline speci\xef\xac\x81c software solutions can be built as individual extensions interfacing with the Smart Contracts and would not require relying on any particular provider for day to day operations At the same time utilizing the Smart Contract Escrow functions the Blockchain can secure all transactions and guarantee all passenger airline \xef\xac\x81nancial interactions Providing smaller airlines a passenger service system of this nature would introduce a controllable way to optimize costs and bolster pro\xef\xac\x81ts without spending years and millions developing individual solutions or modifying existing ones Introducing a decentralized Blockchain solution to ticket distribution and airline management would make all interactions in the market more ef\xef\xac\x81cient secure and predictable Direct instant connections and data exchange independent of human error will revolutionize airline operations and make transport more ef\xef\xac\x81cient and affordable Latest surveys show Airlines spend 3% of their revenue on IT solutions At the end of 2017 the revenue in the industry was over 750 billion USD making the software market at least 22 billion USD large and with strong growth trends This creates a perfect opportunity to enter and expand the market both in the general industry of commercial transport as well as IT solutions for commercial airlines speci\xef\xac\x81cally 04 TICKO io \x0c5 GENERAL INTRODUCTION OF TICKO io TICKETING PLATFORM PASSENGER SERVICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ANALYTICS SOLUTION Passengers can use the decentralized platform as a \xef\xac\x82ight search engine to browse and reach the best offers provided by airlines They can safely make instant bookings and keep tickets secured on the Blockchain under their name and pro\xef\xac\x81le They are facing no extra fees and are connected directly to the airline are able to specify and customize full details of their order down to the seat booked in any given \xef\xac\x82ight The application provides scheduling and organizational information directly from the airline no intermediaries required Airlines can use the decentralized platform as a general passenger service system as well as an ef\xef\xac\x81cient global distribution system They can make offers instantly available manage their own systems on the Blockchain as well as work with the entire customer facing side of business in a single interface They can instantly set \xef\xac\x82ight schedules track airplane status and history manage fare tariffs keep track of passenger reservations and records in a manner that is provably secure and free of human error As a result \xe2\x80\x93 we create a trustless ecosystem that directly connects passengers with airline operators Leveraging Blockchain allows us to keep fees down to an absolute minimum while enabling fast and secure transactions This powerful mechanism instantly connects the supply of airlines with demand of the passengers and completely removes guesswork and uncertainty from the market on both sides The Platform optimizes the entire process of passenger transport with applying the newest available technology to the established industry practices The system is decentralized so it works as a direct point of contact between the airlines and passengers and can easily support an entire infrastructure of user interfaces and management systems They would interact with the Smart Contract architecture and produce an ever evolving product where all core values and crucial data are stored on the Blockchain The industry gets to save on both in house and outsourced software solutions and airlines also get an opportunity to develop their own brands and platforms that would interact with TICKO io via the Blockchain this opens opportunities for further development and speeds up the transition from existing solutions to the newest generations of airline software For the market of commercial airlines our approach ensures full disclosure for any given transaction or offer Transparency is enforced by the process itself \xe2\x80\x93 when data enters the contract and is con\xef\xac\x81rmed in the chain it is instantly distributed and updated everywhere across the platform This includes airplane details \xef\xac\x82ight scheduling ticket prices even airport delays and last minute offers \xe2\x80\x93 all of this information at the palm of your hand updated in real time TICKO io 05 \x0c6 VISION TICKO io is purposefully being engineered from the beginning as an ecosystem where each participant is motivated to further improve the environment and in turn make \xef\xac\x82ight simpler and more affordable for everyone involved Financial mechanisms are all about directly meeting supply and demand within the platform TICKO io is decentralized and therefore doesn\xe2\x80\x99t operate with business elements or pro\xef\xac\x81t motive This fosters a different approach to make purchasing and entrepreneurial decisions \xe2\x80\x93 one that removes the hassle from the process of making purchases and operating a business We want to create an incentive for every airline to develop and improve their link with passengers make direct connections and remove communication dif\xef\xac\x81culties from their service And from the consumer perspective we envision a market where scheduling trips is easy quick and affordable An ever growing amount of people are now regularly using \xef\xac\x82ight as means of transport and our intention is not only to use this trend to our advantage but also to accelerate it as much as we can 06 TICKO io \x0c7 GOALS 01 * We are building the platform to be open and decentralized \xe2\x80\x93 transparency is key 02 * Through the use of Smart Contracts ticket supply and demand can be met automatically 03 04 05 Create a robust ecosystem for connecting airlines & passengers Balance distribution and ticket pricing mechanisms control Enable all participants on the market to get instant signals & updates * Blockchain allows for practical ways to optimize the communication process Remove random elements from pricing strategies in the aviation industry * Volatility can be accounted for with predictable demand & instant market feedback Help smaller airlines compete in the highly regulated environment * Direct and openly available market feedback makes the entire industry a safer investment 06 * Airline software can now be built by small teams and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the only target enterprise sales 07 * Direct link to passengers makes it possible to predict future demand and schedule accordingly TICKO io Design an architecture for entrepreneurs to pick up and build on top of Simplify the process of \xef\xac\x82ight scheduling & operations 07 \x0c8 ADVANTAGES Removes confusion from pricing Aggregators and resellers provide highly varied and \xef\xac\x82uctuating prices TICKO io serves as a place where all offers are clear and traceable to a given service provider therefore speeding up the entire decision making process The platform is an all in one solution to instantly connect airline proposals with passengers Multiple offers between any given destinations will be available and easily customizable all fees will come directly from the operators and the ecosystem will actively encourage transparent pricing and reliable service Streamlines \xef\xac\x81nding the best offer The best offer is always going to be available directly from the service provider Handling \xef\xac\x82ights as Smart Contracts on the Blockchain removes the need for airlines to enter preferential contracts with resellers and brokers Supply and demand on the market balance instantly The platform enables airline operators to administer special offers in a way never before available TICKO io allows to track the scheduling of any given i\xef\xac\x82ght and provides open access to its status \xe2\x80\x93 which makes it easy for the airline to enter a sale or promotion instantly and adapt the pricing of their tickets in real time according to demand in a pure market environment Optimizes passenger service Airline operators always have real time market feedback from the passengers Scheduling and planning become easier with the creation of a single reliable stream of passenger details securely stored on the Blockchain The platform is safe and works as a decentralized marketplace In essence it\xe2\x80\x99s a way to directly connect the passenger with the best airfare service provider \xe2\x80\x93 TICKO io enables them to enter into a contract with each other instantly without the need for going through third parties to \xef\xac\x81nd tickets for a particular place and time Predicts demand One of the main challenges of the airline industry is its dependence on current events and the dif\xef\xac\x81culty of scaling and adapting day to day operations in order to respond to sudden surges or falls in demand The platform allows to receive market feedback in real time and adapt operations accordingly With the use of Blockchain analyzing demand of the passengers as well as the supply of competition becomes far cheaper and removes reliance on third parties for a good chunk of market analysis Customer feedback and direct communication are available on request 08 TICKO io \x0c9 FINANCIAL MODEL AND TICK TOKEN TICK is a native cryptographic token which allows members of the ecosystem to engage in activities on the platform Tokens are a crucial element of the entire system and is used as a transaction tool It is a utility token for purchasing tickets making bookings safety deposits creating offers and contracts \xe2\x80\x93 depending on any given airline requirements Advantages of implementing TICK on the Blockchain 1 Secure Payments \xe2\x80\x93 each purchase is safe and secured within the contract made directly with the airline guaranteeing the transportation service 2 Incentive mechanics \xe2\x80\x93 the use of tokens provides real time market feedback and long term participation interest in further development of the platform 3 Reliability \xe2\x80\x93 the process is direct each transaction is stored on the chain and can quickly be tracked and con\xef\xac\x81rmed 4 Customization\xe2\x80\x93 application of Smart Contracts provides airlines an ability to make their own agreements and special offers that passengers have open access to reading and evaluating 5 Worldwide presence \xe2\x80\x93 a simple way to achieve services in different countries and various languages automatically solving the issues of \xef\xac\x81nancial clearing regulations and removing any third party commissions from the equation 6 Integration \xe2\x80\x93 platform can be connected with a wide variety of other Blockchain solutions TICK is an Ethereum based token compliant with ERC20 standard which is the most convenient and can be connected with most Ethereum wallets listings and exchanges Tokens are limited in supply and can not be reproduced Ethereum Smart contracts serve as a foundation for building our decentralized application BENEFITS FOR TOKEN HOLDERS TICK is a utility token so all ticket purchases and payments on the platform will be done with TICK and users have an incentive to keep and use them Demand for tokens will be directly driven by airlines as ticket issuance will also be done using TICK Since airlines will receive TICK for services number of long term holders will grow with every secured partnership TICK is the mechanism for providing real solutions for current problems in commercial aviation Supply remains limited while the demand for tokens increases along with the number of participants in the ecosystem TICKO io 09 \x0c10 TICK TOKEN SALE Total amount of TICK released is1 000 000 000 No additional token releases will take a place If all TICK available for sale are not purchased the remaining tokens are destroyed Token distribution takes a place 10 days after the token sale is complete PRESALE June

incentives provided to the early members of our community pioneers in platform development Bounty Program \xef\xac\x82exible af\xef\xac\x81liate system for raising awareness of the project among the general public TICKO io 11 \x0c12 TICK BUYOUT PROGRAM Every quarter ~22% of annual company revenue will be allocated to a special pool called the buy out pool Preparation for the procedure will be taken 45 days prior to the beginning of the buyout It works as follows TICKO io issues a smart contract to purchase tokens with a x\xef\xac\x81ed amount and closing date Platform users will be informed of the opportunity to sell TICK tokens Token holders can interact with the contract to send their tokens for sale until the set funding amount de\xef\xac\x81ned from the start is reached Until closing date it is still possible to interact with the contract by revoking prior contributions and replacing them with others On closing date number of tokens is x\xef\xac\x81ed and all participants are sent funds in proportion to the amount of tokens that remain on the contract This buy out program ensures additional liquidity for the investors and guarantees a vested interest in keeping the ecosystem functioning as intended It provides holders an additional opportunity to pro\xef\xac\x81t from the revenue generated by the platform and fosters a strong relationship between the developers and the community 13 PROJECT DEVELOPMENT The funds obtained through the crowdsale will be used for further development of TICKO io To achieve our goals it is necessary to build an international team achieve presence in multiple countries The main complications with general passenger management systems up to now have been with technological limitations and we believe we can achieve development of a successful commercial product in a form of a decentralized application Platform creation is divided into two parts back end and front end web development Back end is the use of Smart Contracts Blockchain solutions administration for airline management Front end development will focus on user interface and design interaction mobile adaptation and general ease of use After we launch the platform a franchising program will be created for software development and distribution companies to deliver the service to other countries and speed up the process of it becoming standard in the industry Strategic partnerships with marketing agencies will be made in order to secure our presence in the industry 12 TICKO io \x0c14 SUCCESSFUL FUNDING SCENARIO In case of reaching necessary ICO goals we will budget our funding in the following manner Platform Infrastructure Development Marketing Efforts Business Development Legal Costs One effect of TICKO io success would be global establishment of cryptocurrency and Blockchain in the commercial airline industry meaning a general increase in public interest and market penetration Our steps in case of ICO success are the following (step by step graph) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 TICKO io Expand our development team by sourcing global programming talent Secure presence of our team in IATA events and industry conferences Foster our platform community and negotiate solid exchange listings for TICK Ensure listing of over 15 airlines on the platform (in part already achieved) Present the \xef\xac\x81rst platform functionality

SOLVING MAJOR PROBLEMS TICKO io solves the issues of predictability and scaling for the airlines at the same time as eliminating doubts and confusion on the passenger side Leveraging Smart Contracts for ticket distribution takes advantage of the latest technological trends and uses them to get rid of volatility problems that plagued the commercial airline industry from its inception INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION General passenger service becomes simple and therefore airline management more safe and streamlined This brings additional investment into the industry as well as makes it possible for smaller airlines to provide excellent services locally without having to lose large sums of money on the marketing and communication channels that are already built into our platform EXPERTISE Our team is composed of veterans on both the IT side of development as well as airline management We understand how the business works and are able to communicate with shareholders on a higher level All our goals are clearly de\xef\xac\x81ned and the foundations for their achievement already established BRAND NEUTRALITY It is impossible for TICKO io to favor any particular airline or value their services above all others Smart Contracts involved in each offer are open to everyone and the platform showcases offers purely on pricing scheduling and additional services provided This simplicity eliminates the risk of fraud and improves services overall WORLDWIDE EXPANSION Blockchain is global and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on geographical boundaries \xe2\x80\x93 it can connect passengers and airlines the world over within seconds This allows us respective of laws and regulations in different countries to make strategic partnerships where they provide all parties the most value TICKO io can scale quickly considering the global nature of the market INNOVATION TICKO io is being built at a crucial time in human history when instant peer to peer connections are becoming the norm We are looking to not only build a product but a foundation for future development For example with our platform it becomes feasible to further use Machine Learning to predict demand for airline services

EXPANSION The European market is a primary point of focus and expansion in the industry United Kingdom is the leader in this and reached over 3 5 annual passengers per inhabitant So an average UK citizen books at least three \xef\xac\x82ights a year \xe2\x80\x93 and this number only grows as \xef\xac\x82ight becomes more affordable The emerging markets speci\xef\xac\x81cally Asia Paci\xef\xac\x81c are a big second point of focus with fast growth speci\xef\xac\x81cally in the niche of Low Cost Carriers Over 10 000 airplanes are planned to be sold to Asian airlines and growing tourism to Vietnam and the Philippines is making those otherwise overlooked markets worth our attention The USA markets are among the most pro\xef\xac\x81table but with the high degree of regulation we also expect the adoption of new solutions to happen differently than in other environments As such our focus is going to be on beginning negotiations as early as possible and then entering the market itself with a proven track record TICKO io 17 \x0c19 ADOPTION PROJECTIONS Over half the passengers in developed countries now purchase tickets online To take USA alone as an example this number grew from 45% in 2008 to 59% in 2018 \xe2\x80\x93 the market of digital ticket sales is expanding rapidly each year There were over four billion scheduled passenger i\xef\xac\x82ghts in 2017 with the number growing 4 5% annually In this expanding market TICKO io is perfectly positioned to establish itself as primary online ticket acquisition method BECOMING THE DOMINANT TICKETING SOLUTION IN 5
