b ANAPP BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED A Scalable Blockchain \xe2\x80\x93 Proof of Assignment Protocol IOTW Highly secure IoT ecosystem enabling Instant transaction and green micro mining from any connected device no extra hardware no additional cost Whitepaper By Fred Leung Tony Chan Kartik Mehrotra and Peter Chan 2018 \x0cMission To Develop an IoT Blockchain protocol using proof of assignment to integrate IoT devices with Blockchain such that a decentralized network of IoT applications and data exchange can be established The Problem Current consensus systems such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake have drawbacks that make them di\xef\xac\x83cult for adaptation to IoT devices For example The Proof of Work system requires strong computational power and large amounts of memory on the end node side which are costly for consumers to adopt A \xe2\x80\x9cmining machine\xe2\x80\x9d for Bitcoin costs over USD 2000 per set Mining under the PoW protocol is deliberately consumptive of power It is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses 0 14% of the global energy consumption and more power than several developing nations As the PoW system gets bigger the whole network slows down The Proof of Stake system still requires large amounts of memory on the end nodes and also large amount of tokens to be able to win the Blockchain reward The rich gets richer under the PoS system Both PoW and PoS are leading to the centralization and accumulation of mining power into the hands of a few entities Under PoW giants like Bitmain\xe2\x80\x99s mining pools control close to 51% of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s mining Similarly under PoS original adopters of Ethereum who own large stakes can easily rake in all the fees from the network \x0cIntroduction We have invented a completely new Blockchain protocol that Can run on most kinds of IoT devices without the need to change any hardware Have a mining function to attract IoT device users to join up to the chain Have a unique consensus protocol called \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Assignment\xe2\x80\x9d that gives fair chance to all IoT devices to obtain mining rewards Very light in overall power consumption and Supports instant transactions even if the chain expands in size exponentially Features of our new Blockchain architecture Divide the Blockchain network into di\xef\xac\x80erent layers to reduce system requirement on the IoT devices (end nodes) side End nodes do not have to have strong computational power or large amount of memory All IoT devices can connect to our Blockchain without any hardware change All the end nodes have equal chances of getting Blockchain rewards The chain does not consume unnecessary power and The chain supports instant transactions no matter how big it becomes From the Proof of Assignment consensus protocol we have developed the \xe2\x80\x9cMicro mining\xe2\x80\x9d protocol Micromining is introduced so as to incentivize IoT device users to connect their devices to our Blockchain and provide usage data In order to make it easy for IoT devices to connect to our Blockchain we have also designed a new Blockchain architecture with end nodes and trusted nodes separated Under this innovative new architecture most of the IoT devices in the world be them big or small can run our micro mining software without the need for any hardware change For the \xef\xac\x81rst time ever Blockchain and IoT devices can seamlessly work together We aim to connect every household in the world with Blockchain and collect their usage data for betterment of the whole mankind This can be achieved through our easy to adopt Blockchain design and a token reward system (IOTW tokens system) IoT device owners who join our Blockchain network will be rewarded with IOTW tokens We shall establish a decentralized purchase network for the IOTW holders to purchase goods and services with their IOTW tokens directly from the device makers and service providers This is a decentralized purchasing ecosystem to do away with all unnecessary middlemen and agents The following pages will explain our technology and business case in more details \x0cA High Instantaneous Throughput IoT Blockchain Architecture using Proof of Assignment consensus Motivations Blockchain is arguably the most disruptive information technology (IT) in decades Using distributed ledger architecture Blockchain technology is poised to transform our society in many ways revolutionizing our \xef\xac\x81nancial system supply chain and even legal system Yet Blockchain technology has virtually hit a roadblock in the Internetof Things (IoT) arena markedly limiting its applications in ubiquitous electronic devices and appliances in our daily lives The most popular Blockchain algorithms used today are Proof of Work (PoW) [NAKA08] and Proof of Stake (PoS) [KING12] algorithms Unfortunately both PoW and PoS are inappropriate for IoT applications because most IoT devices have very limited computing and memory resources and power budget To this end we have invented a new Proof of Assignment algorithm that is suitable for IoT devices and is very robust secure and scalable The PoW algorithm is used by many existing blockchains including Bitcoin in which miners compete to become the \xef\xac\x81rst provider of a cryptographical problem It is not an environmentally friendly algorithm and consumes much energy The complexity of the cryptographical problem increases with the growth of the size of the ledger size and is already demanding super computing power Although PoW is useful for some applications it is de\xef\xac\x81nitely not good for IoT applications In the PoS consensus process a candidate is regularly elected among validators in the blockchain ecosystem The PoS algorithm is less power hungry than the PoW algorithm because the above election process and the cryptographical problem solving do not require supercomputing power Nevertheless PoS is still not a good choice for IoT application because each node still needs to have substantial computing and memory resources Our Proof of Assignment (POA) algorithm is designed to gracefully solve these speci\xef\xac\x81c IoT issues Miner of PoW (Proof of Work) Miner of PoS (Proof of Stake) Miner of PoA (Proof of Assignment) \x0cMicro Mining In the PoA algorithm each IoT device is required to perform some simple but very important cryptographic tasks known as \xe2\x80\x9cMicro Mining\xe2\x80\x9d On the other hand these IoT devices are not required to handle the transaction ledger which is maintained by a distributed Trust Node system PoW Mining Machine (Proof of Work) Electric Power Blockchain Network PoS Node (Proof of Stake) Electric Power PoA Node (Proof of Assignment) Blockchain Network Blockchain Network Trusted Node or Ledger Server Data exchange interface High Power PSU Very high speed (\xe2\x80\x9c1000W) processor Ledger Storage Data exchange interface High Power PSU (\xe2\x80\x9c500W) High speed processor Ledger Storage Low voltage DC Supply Ledger Storage Low voltage DC Supply Micro controller with Data Exchange Interface Micro controller with Data Exchange Interface Miner X Miner Y While PoS solves the energy wasting ledger servers involved in such blockchain still need to have substantial memory capacity to accommodate the transaction ledger The cost will then become not a\xef\xac\x80ordable for small IoT devices to become blockchain enabled IOTW aims at removing such hurdle to enable the general adoption of blockchain in our daily used products This will hopefully fuel the growth of blockchain transactions in our daily life Similar to PoS mining devices in the IOTW blockchain do not require super computational power In addition IOTW removes the need for mining devices to store the transaction ledger This removes the cost associated with the large memory and therefore adding mining capability to simple IoT devices will become a\xef\xac\x80ordable The consensus algorithm behind the IOTW is proof of assignment (PoA) \x0cInstead of allowing every network node to participate in mining in PoW or having a voting process to elect the appointed validator for a transaction in PoS PoA elects a single candidate or a limited number of candidates to solve the cryptographical problem by pre agreed criteria (e g random historic time connected to the system among of cryptocurrency involved etc ) and issue the task directly to the elected candidate(s) Therefore no or limited competition exists in solving the cryptographical problem Furthermore the storage of the ledger is not a mandatory requirement for mining devices Transaction ledgers are being stored in higher networks layer(s) such as trusted servers or ledger servers The PoA makes the requirement on computational power and memory capacity of the mining devices basic An average micro controller controlling functionality of products (e g electric fans rice cookers vacuum cleaners air conditioners printers etc ) with network access and su\xef\xac\x83cient program memory to incorporate the mining software can become a mining device on the IOTW blockchain Thus the term Micro Mining is adopted for the mining process in IOTW to distinguish it from other conventional mining Since the cost for adding Micro Mining to any IoT enabled product is extremely low or near zero together with the incentive of getting award during the operating life of the products with Micro Mining capabilities it is anticipated that the adoption can be much more rapid than public blockchains today This will bring blockchain technologies down to earth and spawns o\xef\xac\x80 various applications Initial launch of IOTW blockchain aims at creating a market place linking household appliance product manufacturer agents services providers and end user Accessing the IOTW blockchain via mobile phones pads and computers will also be supported Product manufacturer agents and distributors service providers etc are strategic partners of IOTW blockchain and it is the aim of the IOTW blockchain to grow together with its strategic partners Miner Selection Algorithm To elect miner candidates from a large set of IoT devices we can adopt the following two types of approaches First as for centralized approaches we allow \xef\xac\x82exible design choices for selecting IoT mining device(s) For example we can leverage the API server to perform the assignment allocation or the API server can delegate the allocation task to a ledger server/trusted node The assigning process can be random where each IoT device has equal chance of being selected Or the assigning process might be weighted so that each IoT device has di\xef\xac\x80erent chance of being selected and is in proportional to their weights In practice we can use the reliability of the IoT devices i e whether it has correctly performed mining in previous assignments to build up their reputations as weights Another possible approach is through generating public randomness and using it as a seed to select IoT devices completely in a decentralized manner Here we give one concrete instantiation using veri\xef\xac\x81able random functions (VRF) The public randomness seed can be generated via VRF or via a multi party computation protocol Later using seed each IoT device (with public/private key pair <pk sk>) can generate a speci\xef\xac\x81c hash value via (hash \xce\xa0) VRFsk (seed) where hash is a hash value and is a proof Then the IoT device can determine whether it is selected e g via pre de\xef\xac\x81ned characteristics of the n least signi\xef\xac\x81cant bits in hash and others can prove that the IoT device pk is indeed being selected via validating the given hash and checking whether True VRFpk (hash \xce\xa0 seed) holds Furthermore as for selection criteria we can either select IoT candidates randomly or in proportion to their weights on the blockchain such as money units in their accounts \x0cSystem Architecture Today public blockchains simply have a \xef\xac\x82at layer of ledger server mesh network under the API server The IOTW blockchain has more network layer(s) below the ledger server mesh network Mining devices may be linked to any one of the ledger servers of IOTW blockchain directly or via another layer of trusted node mesh network Mesh networks between mining devices and trusted nodes may also exist Hence the network architecture may vary from one to multiple layers of mesh networks It should also be noted that due to the simplicity of mining devices MMI for transaction processing and direct association with wallet are generally not being built within mining devices Instead they are normally linked to user devices such as cell phones tablets or computers for communicating with the IOTW blockchain ecosystem Similar with public blockchains today there is an API server on top of the ledger server mesh network to link di\xef\xac\x80erent categories of users together as well as to wallets and exchanges A big data bank can be built into the SPI servers collecting data and carry out analysis to generate useful information such as consumer behavior best selling products product reliability and life service response time etc Such information has the potential to become an income generating source for the IOTW blockchain The following diagram illustrates possible system architecture It should be noted that the mining assignment block shown is within the API server It is also possible that the mining assignment is within the ledger server mesh network controller Physical Service & Consumable Provider Physical Service & Consumable Provider Mining Assignment Big Data Collector Request Processing API Wallet API Server Ledger Server 1 Ledger Server N Trust Node Mesh Network Trust Node Device Node Device Node Device Node Device mesh Mesh Network Device Node Trust Node Device Node \x0cBlockchain ecosystems are normally more vulnerable to 51% takeover attacks when the number of ledger server nodes is small As number of ledger servers grow blockchains become more and more robust against such attacks Therefore special care should be taken during initial launch of new blockchains For IOTW the whole system is controlled by Anapp Blockchain Technologies Limited in collaboration with strategic partners serving also as owners of trusted nodes or even trusted ledger servers The makes the IOTW blockchain ecosystem not an open system at the beginning to trade for better system security Transaction Execution Transaction request can be raised by any devices on the IOTW blockchain ecosystem having a valid wallet for paying or receiving of IOTW coins A transaction request comprises the transaction information in terms of the nature of transaction such as purchase or selling of goods and services involved parties delivery schedule warranty terms transaction amount involved etc together with a transaction HASH and other optional data such as signature day and time stamp etc The following diagram illustrates a typical ledger with N transaction blocks Block HASH (0) Block 0 Data of transaction (1) Transaction HASH (1) Optional Signature (1) Upon receiving of new transaction request the IOTW blockchain ecosystem assigns the job of computing the new block HASH to one or more mining devices Trusted node(s) or ledger server(s) then validates new Block HASH generated by mining device(s) Other optional data (1) Transaction request once veri\xef\xac\x81ed and validated the newly generated block HASH will be appended to the transaction request to form a new transaction block The new transaction is then being appended to the last transaction block Transaction amount involved will then be transferred between corresponding wallets Data of transaction (2) Block 1 Block HASH (1) Transaction HASH (2) Optional Signature (2) Block 2 Other optional data (2) Block HASH (2) Data of transaction (N) Transaction HASH (N) Optional Signature (N) Other optional data (N) Block HASH (N) Block N \x0cSecurity Witnessing Protocol Since transaction ledger is not being stored in micro mining machines (IoT devices) the 51% hostile takeover does not apply to this network layer In the IOTW blockchain ecosystem the key to security is to protect the ledger from attacks at the trusted server network layer Theoretically trusted servers are already most robust against attacks In addition we are developing another algorithm to improve the security of the IOTW blockchain ecosystem Instead of validating a new transaction by just veri\xef\xac\x81cation by IoT micro mining and validating by trusted nodes at least one witness who is not the mining node will be invited to witness the new transaction using digital signature (private/public key pair) With such implementation 51% attack needs to simultaneously attack both the transaction ledger as well as the associated blockchain of witnesses to gain hostile takeover Hence this will greatly improve the security of the IOTW blockchain ecosystem This is known as the witnessing protocol Security of the system will be growing with time as more devices get connected We have a patented witness protocol that assumes a few devices from the pool of available ones will be picked up to sign and verify the transaction blocks The block will be considered valid only if all devices will return the same coherent veri\xef\xac\x81cation In case of not coherent veri\xef\xac\x81cation provided all devices chosen for this veri\xef\xac\x81cation will be blacklisted and removed from the pool To further enhance security for single block veri\xef\xac\x81cations originated from di\xef\xac\x80erent geographical locations and di\xef\xac\x80erent manufacturers can be chosen and connected to trusted servers residing on di\xef\xac\x80erent cloud infrastructures (AWS Google MS) Below we give a more concrete analysis on the extra security strength brought by our witnessing protocol Suppose we have n witness nodes being pre selected in the setup stage Assume that each witness node has a probability of p to be compromised by the adversary Here the compromise probability p is directly related to the deployed security practices on how we protect the witness nodes Then the probability (k) that exactly k out of n witness nodes have been compromised follows the binomial distribution (k n p) as given by the formula (k) = (k n p) = (nk) (1\xe2\x88\x92p)\xe2\x88\x92k To put the above math formula in to contexts if we pre select the trusted nodes as witnesses which are necessarily well maintained in our system then we can expect that the probability p would be extremely small If we use a threshold based witnessing scheme which demands t out of n witness nodes\xe2\x80\x99 signatures to audit the block then the probability that no more than t witness nodes have been compromised by external attacker is given by the formula t\xe2\x88\x921 \xe2\x88\x91 (k) = (0) + (1) + (2) + (t\xe2\x88\x92 1) k=0 Thus if we follow the standard blockchain threat model (Byzantine) and set t = 1/3 witness nodes then the above formula gives us overwhelmingly high probability that the adversary cannot control more than t witness nodes While for witnesses serving by IoT mining nodes we can expect that the probability p might rise Nevertheless we can integrate a combination of IoT mining nodes and trusted nodes as witnesses and emphasize that the attacker has to compromise both the trusted nodes and selected IoT witness nodes at the same time to disrupt our ecosystem \x0cIOTW Blockchain Network Management The initial assignment of IoT devices to Ledger Server is managed by Anapp Blockchain Technologies Limited in collaboration with strategic partners such as semiconductors and IoT devices vendors When the ecosystem grows a management standard steering committee will be form by interesting individuals and companies to oversee the overall IoT ledger sever assignment and general network management and its future development direction Members of this committee come from di\xef\xac\x80erent stakeholders who participate in IoT device manufacturing and selling chain AnApp founding members have founded USB OHCI 1394 A and participated in PCI SIG wireless LAN standard development AnApp has the skillset to push start such a committee Patents will be licensed out for free when the development and sales is for IOTW network ecosystems with some exception such as building mining farm The steering committee and AnApp will have the right to take legal action against such violation or shut down their operation The target is put IOTW coins into common people\xe2\x80\x99s hand through mining We will select appropriate security models to benchmark the \xef\xac\x81gure of merit about the IOTW blockchain ecosystem before the public launching Existing Status & Future Works We have been successfully running IOTW blockchain on 1 000+ IoT devices at the same time with a single Trust Node Transactions are being generated using either cell phones or computers at the moment but will soon be on other connected devices such as light bulbs and air puri\xef\xac\x81ers as well The blockchain ledger can be viewed in a computer screen (for demo only and not the future working version) The software is fully scalable Furthermore the current implementation is target for instant transactions The ultimate target performance would be 1M transactions per second Our recent alpha testing of the platform resulted in 3 000 transactions per second for long distance network transactions and 100 000 transactions per second for local network transactions Future development will focus on the following Implementation of a real IOTW blockchain ecosystem with user friendly MMI Scale up the system capacity to accommodate practically unlimited number of users (as discussed previously) Implementation of further security features to make the ecosystem more robust against the 51% attack (further discussion in following paragraph) Development of data analysis of big data and launch of related services Instead of the normal validation in PoW or PoS IOTW implements another level of security by inviting one or more user(s) to serve as witness to co sign transactions Signature(s) of the witnesses are generated by private key and validation of such signature(s) is done using the public key This will greatly increase the di\xef\xac\x83culty for the 51% talk over attack due to the need to tackle simultaneously the witness\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain within the limited time of transaction processing \x0cMining Algorithm Comparison Proof of Work (PoW) Proof of Stake (PoS) Proof of Assignment (PoA) Greater mining leads to higher rewards Compensation increases as more people get paid The more the mining nodes are the more rewards we get Crypto Currency Bitcoin and many others NEM\xe3\x80\x81PeerCoin etc Etherueum will be adopted in the future IOTW Computation Power Required Extremely high Lower than PoW Extremely Low Power Consumption Extremely high Lower than PoW Extremely Low A few seconds Less than one second Ming can potentially be centralized Mining is 100% decentralized Compensation Instant Transaction IOT Device Centralization Mining is becoming more centralized \x0cBusiness Model B2B2C Collecting usage data from IoT devices used to be very di\xef\xac\x83cult There are over 15 billion IoT devices scattered around the world and they are too simple to run complicated blockchain software Yet they contain so much information about people\xe2\x80\x99s daily lives To enable and encourage IoT device users to connect to the blockchain network and share their usage data we have invented the micro mining system 1 Getting Existing Devices Connected People\xe2\x80\x99s behavior is hard to change To get IoT device users to connect to our blockchain we need to incentivize them This is done through our micro mining function For existing IoT devices we will work with di\xef\xac\x80erent device makers to embed our system codes into their next \xef\xac\x81rmware update When the IoT device owners upgrade their \xef\xac\x81rmware their devices will be able to connect to our blockchain and start micro mining to get blockchain rewards The way of giving out blockchain rewards under the Proof of Assignment consensus protocol has been explained in the previous chapter Once they get IoT they will start to obtain IOTWs as they continue to connect their devices If the users are willing to share their usage data they will obtain extra IOTWs 2 Partnering with Goods and Services Providers In order to create value for the IOTW tokens we need to have goods and services providers willing to take IOTWs as payments We expect certain \xef\xac\x82uctuations in the value of IOTWs initially and goods and services with high margins would be able to withstand such \xef\xac\x82uctuations in their payments As such we are discussing with sellers of luxury goods overstock items digital contents such as music and videos and online games to take IOTW as their payments We shall make announcements when such discussions are concluded In the long term as more and more devices are IoT to our chain and more and more households have IOTWs the price of IOTWs is expected to stabilize Then we expect more ordinary sellers of goods and services to be willing to take IOTWs as payments 3 Collecting and Selling Usage Data for Device Owners With micro mining functions and IOTW rewards IoT device users are motivated to connect their devices online and sell their usage data Device makers research institutes government agencies and other organizations can purchase such data from us with IOTW tokens The IOTW tokens are limited in supply but usage data are continuously being generated and organizations will have regular needs of such information Therefore as more and more data are being generated the demand for IOTW tokens will become higher and higher creating a strong support for the value of IOTW tokens 4 Instant Transactions Made Possible We have installed our beta software into 1 000 Expressif wireless LAN chipsets and run a number of demonstrations to interested audiences in Malaysia China Hong Kong and the US The Expressif family of chipsets has cumulative sales of over 100 million units and is still shipping millions of units per month This is a clear demonstration of our software\xe2\x80\x99s lightness in very simple chipsets that can be widely found in many IoT devices \x0c5 Increasing Target Market of IoT Devices In order to further increase the number of IoT devices for our blockchain we have invented a Digital Power System chipset (\xe2\x80\x9cDPS chipset\xe2\x80\x9d) that is a low cost solution to replace traditional analog power systems in small appliances with digital power systems while giving them connectivity at the same time We believe the DPS chipset will be able to see adoption by a certain number of device manufacturers for saving costs while increasing device functionality We have already \xef\xac\x81led a patent for the DPS chipset design We plan to \xef\xac\x81le a few more patents for this new product 6 Scalability & Sustainability From the adoption point of view blockchain should o\xef\xac\x80er very rapid transaction processing speed such that tens or even hundreds of transactions per second can be entertained This is the well known scalability problem that every blockchain is attempting to tackle Sharding is one of the most often discussed methods to improve drastically the capability in terms of transactions per second We are investigating sharding as well as other potential innovative solutions to improve the scalability Starting from the formulation of the operating model of IOTW blockchain recurrent income from transaction fees as well as service fees for big data are anticipated Since the IOTW aims at building up a mass network with millions of IoT devices worldwide income generated will become substantial once the blockchain ecosystem becomes well established It is the target of the IOTW blockchain to become a sustainable ecosystem in the long run such that transaction and service fees received can cover reward system as well as system management maintenance and upgrade as well as further development 7 Decentralized Data Hosting IOTW will develop and expand a decentralized data hosting platform for IoT device manufacturers IoT device Manufacturers currently host data on centralized servers while paying high fees that hinders their scalability Device manufacturers can end up paying up to $4 per device in a year resulting in millions of dollars spent on data hosting IOTW uses a decentralized network of devices and efficiently utilizes the existing storage and compute of devices to host Data for such IoT device makers IOTW also partners with decentralized data hosting platforms to leverage their technology and provide a cost effective and efficient data hosting capabilities to partner IoT manufacturers As a result of this we are able to significantly reduce data hosting costs by up to 95% to $0 1 $0 2 per device a year This will inevitably allow for reduced prices of devices and increased access \x0cIOTW Ecosystem PRODUCTS Exchange DATA Manufacturers End Users DATA BUYING Power companies Marketing agents Mining Research institutes Governments SERVICES & DATA PARTS SERVICES
