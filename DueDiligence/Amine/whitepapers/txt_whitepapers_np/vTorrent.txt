b vTorrent A Decentralized BitTorrent Client with Paid Streaming and Downloading Author Aldous Terence Watts vtorrent_unofficial@mail com www vtorrent org December 18 2017 Disclaimer The information

digital distribution environment there are several longstanding issues in need of solutions Firstly indicators suggest that there is a significant demand for tail end content which digital content providers are unable to fulfill Secondly the BitTorrent ecosystem is troubled with censorship attacks slow and unreliable download speeds on the part of public torrent sites and the lack of a protocol level streaming functionality Thirdly content creators hosting their art on traditional content providers such as Spotify are subject to limited artistic control delayed payouts and eroded revenues \xe2\x80\x94 byproducts of a distribution system heavily controlled by rent seeking intermediaries Lastly high barriers to entry make the aforementioned system difficult to disrupt allowing the status quo to prevail vTorrent is addressing all these issues by combining BitTorrent and blockchain technology to enable paid P2P streaming and downloading within a decentralized user friendly private and secure environment The Paid Streaming and Downloading feature (PSD) will function as an incentive mechanism setting the stage for a market for tail end content and a market for fast downloads and streams The decentralized architecture will ensure censorship resistance and will also allow content creators to distribute their art without the limitations of intermediaries The user friendly privacy and security focused approach will make certain that everyday people can board safely and easily opening the door for mainstream adoption Lastly startups wanting to partake in the quest to disrupt the digital distribution industry will save largely on cost and gain significant in terms of potential by building on top of vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s open source codebase \x0cTABLE OF CONTENTS

22 1 \x0c1 INTRODUCTION ______________________________________________________________________ 1 1 PROBLEM The internet the digitization of content and P2P file sharing technologies have revolutionized the way content such as movies songs and books are distributed and consumed However there are still several long standing issues deeply rooted in the field of digital distribution Firstly the availability of tail end content is poor across the field despite strong indicators of a significant collective demand For instance Netflix Hulu and Amazon supply some ten thousand of titles combined [1] but the number of registered titles in the film database IMDB exceeds four million [2] Depending on the type of digital content provider in question high licensing costs high barriers to access and usage or lacking incentive mechanisms are the culprits Secondly while being subject to the above issue as well the BitTorrent environment suffers from frequent censorship attacks slow and unreliable download speeds on the part of public torrent sites and the lack of a protocol level streaming functionality BitTorrent sites are vulnerable to censorship due to their centralized access points the issue of slow and unreliable download speeds is largely a consequence of poor incentive mechanisms and BitTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s tit for tat seeding policy is the limiting factor in respect to streaming Thirdly content creators distributing their art through conventional streaming and downloading platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify are facing a reality of eroded revenues limited artistic control and delayed payouts \xe2\x80\x94 byproducts of a distribution system heavily controlled by rent seeking intermediaries For instance an artist using Spotify will have to pay an aggregator in order to get on board accept that Spotify takes a 20 30% revenue cut [3] deal with rigid pricing and format requirements and pay a third party to collect and distribute payouts with delays of weeks and months [4] Lastly high barriers to entry particularly in terms of high capital and operating costs on the part of digital content providers protects the aforementioned system against disruption \xe2\x80\x94 to the detriment of content creators and consumers 2 \x0c1 2 SOLUTION While a solution to any of the above issues would be groundbreaking a solution to all of them would be revolutionary vTorrent is aiming for the latter with its proposal of a decentralized BitTorrent client enabling paid P2P streaming and downloading within a user friendly private and secure environment \xe2\x80\x94 all built on a code base that will be open source The Paid Streaming and Downloading feature (PSD) will function as an incentive mechanism giving those in demand of tail end content a way to reward seeds to meet their needs The decentralized architecture will reduce the cost of seeding to a minimum and the user friendly privacy and security focused approach will lower the barriers to access and usage These factors will set the stage for a niche content market of unrivaled selection PSD will also be central in addressing the issues riddling the BitTorrent environment by enabling streaming and by giving those in demand for fast downloads and fast streams a way to reward seeds to meet their needs Moreover vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized architecture will remove any central points of failure ensuring censorship resistance The decentralized architecture will yield benefits to content creators as well In essence it takes rent seeking intermediaries out of the equation to allow for full revenues complete artistic control and instant payouts While vTorrent has the potential to revolutionize the entire distribution industry alone it will invite third party distribution services to partake in the quest by making its code base open source Third parties building on top of vTorrent will save largely on cost and gain significant in terms of potential \xe2\x80\x94 giving them the leverage necessary for disruption As a result vTorrent might become a catalyst for a paradigm shift in which the balance of power gets tilted away from the middlemen and back into the hands of the content creators and the consumers 3 \x0c2 DESIGN APPROACH _____________________________________________________________________ At a glance vTorrent will likely resemble your regular BitTorrent client It is being built around the popular and lightweight Transmission client and will include all the BitTorrent functionalities with which many of us are familiar However a closer look will reveal a number of additional features setting it apart \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Paid Streaming and Downloading (PSD) Digital Wallet(s) \xe2\x80\x94 Full Node and Thin Wallet Cryptocurrency Trader Browsing and Storage Functionality Encrypted Chat and Anonymous Social Network Anonymous Transactions Decentralized Architecture Paid Streaming and Downloading (PSD) is vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s primary feature \xe2\x80\x94 being central to its most disruptive use cases It will allow for fast low fee and anonymous P2P exchange of digital content with a cryptocurrency called VTR Underpinning PSD is the BitTorrent protocol a Zerocash PoS blockchain and BOLT payment channels The additional features on the above list will serve ancillary purposes with common threads of user friendliness privacy and security These are fundamental values of vTorrent and fall in line with its vision of mainstream adoption Currently BitTorrent and crypto applications are spread across a number of different sites and services This makes for a slow and cumbersome user experience as well as demanding a certain level of knowledge about the crypto and BitTorrent domains The result is high barriers to access and usage incompatible with mainstream adoption By unifying all relevant applications in one solution vTorrent aims to lower such barriers to enable everyday people to get onboard vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s privacy and security features are intended to protect users against privacy breaches thefts and censorship by default This will ensure that everyday people with limited technical knowledge on said subjects will be able to enjoy a safe ride 4 \x0c3 FEATURES ______________________________________________________________________ 3 1 PAID STREAMING AND DOWNLOADING (PSD) The PSD feature will enable the exchange of digital content for payments in a peer to peer fashion over the BitTorrent protocol Users will be free to exchange whatever content they want at whatever prices they choose using an anonymous cryptocurrency called VTR Users will be able to download or stream different pieces of the same content from several uploaders simultaneously as well as reselling said pieces during the downloading process Transactions will be cheap anonymous and secure The main underlying technologies of PSD are the following \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f The BitTorrent protocol A Proof of stake (PoS) Zerocash blockchain BOLT Payment Channels Now we will look at how these technologies work and how they will interact to enable the aforementioned properties 3 1 1 BitTorrent BitTorrent is a peer to peer content distribution protocol that allows for highly efficient transfer of large files such as movies and TV shows [5] Central to BitTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s magic is its method of slicing files being transferred into a number of equally sized pieces Another essential part of the protocol is a network of individuals who keep complete files available for anyone to download These individuals are called seeds The practice of keeping files available for anyone to download is called seeding If several individuals are downloading the same complete file from one or more seeds simultaneously they will receive different pieces of the file Each time they receive a new piece they will utilize their excess bandwidth to transfer a copy of the piece to any of the other downloading individuals The group of downloaders will continue trading pieces in this manner until everyone has the complete file Essentially by following this process they distribute the bandwidth burden between each other instead of leaving it all to the original seed(s) The result is downloading speeds that are vastly higher than can be achieved in a traditional client to server scheme 5 \x0c3 1 2 Blockchain For BitTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s file sharing efficiency to apply to a payment scheme micro payments need to be exchanged for every piece of a file being transferred This way a paid downloader will be able to download or stream paid pieces of the same content from several seeds simultaneously as well as reselling those pieces to other individuals at the same time For this to to be practical payments need to be small fast irreversible and low fee Such set of features is foreign to any traditional payment system but uniquely enabled by cryptocurrencies The underlying technology of a cryptocurrency is called a blockchain A blockchain is basically an immutable and decentralized database secured by cryptography and maintained by private computers all over the world [6] This ensures that transactions cannot be tampered with censored or reversed Also because costly and ineffective intermediaries are out of the picturetransactions are allowed to be fast and cheap vTorrent runs on a proof of stake (PoS) blockchain which will get forked to the Zerocash protocol to make for fully anonymous transactions [7] Below is an overview of the blockchain specifications 3 1 3 BOLT Private Payment Channels Despite its favorable properties a blockchain alone is not enough to make a payment scheme integrated with BitTorrent feasible While blockchain transaction fees are relatively low they quickly add up to a prohibitively high number when taking into account that each piece of a file has to be exchanged for a payment with an associated transaction fee Also the resulting transaction frequency would lead to delayed settlements and in turn a bloated blockchain vTorrent will address this limitation by combining the use of a blockchain with an alternative payment scheme called Payment Channels A payment channel allows a buyer to make a large number of small payments while only incurring the fees of two blockchain transactions This method significantly lowers the total fee amount reduces blockchain bloat and ensures scaling in line with mainstream adoption The type of payment channels vTorrent will integrate are called BOLT payment channels and has the additional benefit that transactions running through the channels will stay completely anonymous [8] 6 \x0c3 1 4 Streaming A central component of BitTorrent is its tit for tat seeding policy Essentially it requires that individuals downloading content pursue a rarest piece first or random piece picking strategy to optimize the download time However this prevents users from consuming the content prior to a full download barring the possibility of streaming vTorrent s payment scheme will alleviate this constraint enabling pieces to be downloaded in order which in turn will allow for paid streaming Earlier we explained that seeding is referring to the process of keeping a complete file available for anyone to download In the context of vTorrent we will also refer to seeding as the process of keeping a complete file available for anyone to stream 3 1 5 Security In any well functioning P2P file sharing protocol let alone one in which payments are involved the risk of any form of cheating needs to be reduced to a minimum For instance there has to be a mechanism preventing a buyer from receiving content without making a proper payment and vice versa vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s payment channels are designed to eliminate this risk by means of multi signature addresses In essence these work like decentralized escrows effectively preventing any party from cheating in the aforementioned manner The addresses also include time locks which allow a buyer to get his funds back at a predetermined time in case a seller leaves or attempts extortion Another risk inherent in P2P file sharing on the side of a recipient is that a sender transfers to him content that is inconsistent with the terms upon which the parties agreed beforehand An example of such scenario would be one in which a malicious sender attaches a virus to the file which the recipient originally consented to receive vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s development team has emphasized the importance of reducing this risk and a solution is currently on the development roadmap 3 2 DIGITAL WALLETS FULL NODE WALLET AND THIN WALLET vTorrent will provide two different wallets each sitting in their own client The clients will be similar in every way except for their wallets Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at them 3 2 1 The Full Node Wallet The full node wallet will require a complete copy of the blockchain be downloaded and synced Running such wallet will assist in validating blockchain transactions As a reward up to 5% yearly interest will be yielded based on the VTR held in the wallet The interest is derived from the coin supply inflation and transaction fees The process of validating transactions and receiving interest is called staking and happens automatically when keeping the wallet open and online Due to the aforementioned requirements downloading the client housing this wallet will be a slow process and will demand a lot of hard disk space As such the client will not be compatible with mobile use nor convenient for users who want fast and easy access to vTorrent 7 \x0c3 2 2 The Thin Wallet The thin wallet will not require a copy of the blockchain be downloaded and synced Therefore downloading the client housing this wallet will be a quick process and storage requirements will be low However running the wallet will not assist in validating transactions which means that no interest will be yielded Due to the low storage requirements the client housing this wallet will be compatible with mobile use and will be a good choice for everyday users who want fast and easy access to vTorrent Both an iOS and Android version are planned 3 2 3 Shared functionalities The differences between the wallets and thus the clients in which they are housed are limited to those mentioned above In terms of similarities both wallets enable basic functionalities such as sending receiving and storing VTR Both can be protected with a password as well as 2FA as an extra layer of security The wallets are heuristic determined to make backing up and restoring fast and easy Users only need to remember a randomly generated twelve word phrase in order to restore a lost wallet In addition both clients will be compatible with standard operating systems such as Windows MacOS and Linux To keep it simple since the clients are similar in every way except for the aforementioned differences of the wallets we will refer to them in singular from here and on unless otherwise is stated 3 3 CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADER Within the client is a Cryptocurrency Trader that enables buying and selling of VTR The intention is to relieve users of the hassle of going to a third party exchange every time they need to trade VTR 3 4 BROWSING AND STORAGE FUNCTIONALITY Functionalities for browsing and storing of magnet links will be available in the client The storage medium will be the underlying blockchain Storing a magnet link on the blockchain will incur a transaction fee of a few cents in order to reward the stakers The browsing functionality will be based on an integrated block explorer As with the Cryptocurrency Trader the intention of integrating these functionalities is to relieve users of having to jump across third party sites to find or seed content The latter approach is both cumbersome as well as representing a barrier of knowledge for beginners not familiar with what torrent sites are safe or what torrent sites host the type of content they are looking for 8 \x0c3 5 ENCRYPTED CHAT AND ANONYMOUS SOCIAL NETWORK The vTorrent client will include an encrypted private chat as well as an anonymous social network application called Riot Both will be end to end encrypted to prevent metadata and IP information from leaking during communication Moreover the solutions will be fully decentralized and open source The private chat will be useful during the trading process For instance if a buyer has any questions regarding the content he wishes to download or stream he will have a fast and easy way of getting in touch with the seller Riot is built around chat rooms and anyone are free to create rooms with any topic to their liking We can imagine users creating rooms with topics of the categories of content being traded in vTorrent Prospective buyers unable to find seeds can visit the room relevant to the category of content they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for and either post a bounty or ask to be directed to seeds Moreover content creators distributing their art through vTorrent can create their own rooms to stay in close touch with their fans or gain new fans by being active in rooms with topics relevant to their art genre Last users might also use Riot purely for socializing Ultimately vTorrent may end up having thousands of rooms covering all kinds of categories and purposes 3 6 ANONYMOUS TRANSACTIONS The world is turning increasingly Orwellian with companies selling privacy information to the highest bidder and governments spying on their own people vTorrent will go against this dystopian trend by integrating state of the art privacy features to protect the privacy rights of its users rather than violating them In its early days Bitcoin was renowned for being anonymous However it has later become clear that this is not the case All Bitcoin transactions along with the addresses of senders and recipients get stored in a public blockchain for everyone to see [9] Based on this information sophisticated analysis tools can reveal the identity of Bitcoin users Unlike Bitcoin transactions vTorrent transactions will automatically hide the sender recipient and the value sent This anonymity feature is by virtue of the Zerocash protocol [7] Transactions running through the BOLT payment channels will be anonymous as well BOLT eliminates the linkage between payments within a channel which will ensure that a buyer\xe2\x80\x99s payments are hidden within the set of all payments made to the seller [8] 9 \x0c3 7 DECENTRALIZED ARCHITECTURE In November 2016 the hugely popular private music tracker What CD got shut down after a raid on several of its servers in France [10] Almost a decade worth of carefully curated content got wiped away Takedowns like this happen frequently and authorities are steadily increasing their efforts to stop torrenting The factor that makes existing torrent sites and trackers vulnerable is centralization The files themselves get stored across decentralized mediums but the access point where the magnet links are categorized and stored is centralized When fully developed vTorrent will not quite fit the category of a torrent site nor a private tracker However it will indeed include all the same features which make the aforementioned services targets of censorship What will differentiate vTorrent though is that its architecture will be fully decentralized This will effectively remove any central point of failure \xe2\x80\x94 making censorship extremely hard Simply said there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any site to block or server to crack Transactions and magnet links will get stored in the immutable blockchain \xe2\x80\x94 backed up by computers all over the world the private chat and the Riot app will run on decentralized networks as well while the integration of distributed hash tables will remove the need for a centralized tracker 10 \x0c4 USE CASES ____________________________________________________________________________ This section will talk about some of vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s use cases \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f A Tail End Market A Market for Fast Downloads and Fast Streams A Free File Sharing Alternative for Current BitTorrent Users A Distribution Solution for Independent Content Creators A Platform for Third Party Content Providers 4 1 A TAIL END MARKET 4 1 1 The Long Tail Theory In a famous 2004 WIRED article author and entrepreneur Chris Anderson introduced the theory of the long tail [11] Essentially it says that the collective demand for niche content can rival or even exceed the demand for mainstream content such as hits and blockbusters The main rationale is that niche items make up for their low individual demand by being much larger in numbers than the relatively few items that end up becoming mainstream The theory has since become widely popular and can be illustrated in what is called a Long Tail graph \xe2\x80\x8bFigure 2 \xe2\x80\x8b The Long Tail 11 \x0cThe left hand side of the graph the head represents mainstream items such as blockbusters and hit albums The right hand side is called the long tail and represents niche items such as movies or albums by big name artists that didn t fare so well indie content old and obscure stuff low budget films etc While the tail is much lower than the head it is much much longer In other words the quantity of long tail items in existence totally dwarfs the quantity of mainstream items There really is no way to quantify its contents but some might say the tail is close to infinite Just think about all the movies ebooks songs games etc that get produced every year and how few of those end up becoming hits The mainstream adoption of the internet and the digitization of content have spawned a number of digital content providers of various types For example streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu downloading platforms like iTunes and P2P file sharing services like public torrent sites and private torrent trackers Not limited by physical shelving space or costs related to physical content digital content providers are able to provide far more content than traditional brick and mortar retailers 4 1 2 The Tail End Still current providers are far from able to make available the entire long tail of digital content For example Netflix Hulu and Amazon host some ten thousands of titles combined [1] but the number of registered titles on the film database IMDB exceeds four million [2] iTunes and Spotify provide millions of songs [12] but really old rare and obscure music still elude their catalogs Even the libraries of public torrent sites are poorly supplied with the contents of the long tail In actual fact current digital content providers are collectively only able to make available the upper part of the long tail The more rare and obscure items residing further out in the tail are hardly represented For the sake of clarity we will label such items as \xe2\x80\x9ctail end\xe2\x80\x9d from this point forward Exactly where the cutoff lies between long tail content and tail end content is hard to pinpoint However as a rule of thumb think of a typical tail end item as being so rare or obscure that you will have trouble finding it anywhere For example an old Norwegian documentary about lutefisk a song never officially released the weird tv show from your childhood etc It is also impossible to measure the exact number of tail end items in existence However taking into account that the Long Tail may be nearly endless it might be fair to assume that the Tail End amounts to millions of items Hence if the Long Tail Theory holds true which is likely given the numerous successful providers using it to their advantage the collective demand for tail end content should be significant despite the presumably low demand per item 12 \x0c\xe2\x80\x8b Figure 3 \xe2\x80\x8b The Tail End This also makes sense anecdotally While most of us prefer content of somewhat mainstream nature most of us also have a few preferences straying toward really obscure stuff For example someone may generally prefer the shows and movies available in the Netflix catalog but also have a hunch for old Japanese science fiction movies Moreover we all have occasions in which we find ourselves searching for really obscure content that don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily relate to our general preferences For instance I once came across a Youtube commenter describing how he for years had been trying to find a commercial from the 70\xe2\x80\x99s in which an actor from The Flew Over The Cuckoo\xe2\x80\x99s Nest had a guest role even though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any particular interest in old commercials in general [13] 4 1 3 Limitations of Current Digital Content Providers Given that the collective demand for tail end content seems to be significant why doesn t the supply measure up The answer depends on the type of digital content provider in question In the case of large movie and TV show providers such as Netflix Hulu and Amazon Prime cost is the limiting factor They have to carefully pick titles that deliver most views compared to the cost of licensing in order to maintain their low prices [14] The result is that popular titles tend to get priority Lacking incentives is the culprit on public torrent sites like the Pirate Bay Since downloading is free on such sites there is no monetary incentive to seed Also their public nature implies that the incentive to seed based on a sense of community is weak Consequently a relatively tiny 13 \x0cfraction of users bears the burden of seeding Naturally they have to prioritize their limited bandwidth and in that regard it makes more sense to seed mainstream items of high popularity Private torrent communities called private trackers are the few oases on the internet in which the coverage of the entire tail is amazing The catch is that their barriers to access and usage are high leaving them inaccessible to everyday people An invite is usually required to get access and obtaining one is no easy task Depending on the tracker in question you either need to have a friend being a member with the privilege to issue invites pass an interview with BitTorrent related questions have a satisfying upload/download ratio history in a previous tracker or patiently wait for a tracker to hand out open invites which some trackers do for limited time periods In other words you either need connections knowledge experience or lots of patience just to be able to get your foot in the door And that is only the first hurdle Most trackers also require that you adhere to strict and cumbersome rules and that you maintain a certain upload/download ratio in order to maintain your membership In sum due to either cost constraints poor incentive mechanisms or high barriers to access and usage current providers are unable to fulfill what seems to be a significant demand for tail end content 4 1 4 vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s Solution An obvious solution is to address all the aforementioned limitations in one single service That is exactly what vTorrent aims to do With PSD low seeding costs and low barriers to access and usage as key features vTorrent seeks to balance the supply and demand for tail end content once and for all Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a closer look at how these features will contribute to achieving this goal \xe2\x97\x8f PSD Incentive Mechanism Earlier we saw that lack of incentives is the main cause of the poor selection of tail end content on public torrent sites With the PSD feature vTorrent will give those representing the unfulfilled demand for tail end content a means to reward seeds to fulfill said demand With the opportunity of getting paid seeds will have an incentive to meet this need In essence PSD functions as an incentive mechanism facilitating the free market forces to bridge the supply and demand gap of tail end content The low availability of tail end content (while private trackers collectively host a rich supply of such content their high barriers to access and usage significantly limit the availability) in the current digital distribution environment implies that there will barely be any price competition outside of vTorrent This is also likely to become the reality within the vTorrent landscape The quantity of unique tail end items in existence is so high and the copies of each unique item so low that the average tail end item will only be in the hands of a few people For instance due to its age and obscurity the \xe2\x80\x9cA Flew Over The 14 \x0cCuckoo s Nest commercial\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned earlier is probably only in the possession of a handful of people Moreover many seeds will likely seed content unique to their geographic area further decreasing the likelihood of overlap between seeds\xe2\x80\x99 sets of tail end content In such an environment of low price competition seeds will naturally be able to set higher prices which in turn will strengthen the incentive to seed There is a common concern that seeds may set in motion something called a race to zero A race to zero is a vicious cycle in which seeds buy each other s content with the purpose of reselling said content for a lower price triggering a race to price levels so low that only a few seeds will be able to stay in the market While long tail content closer to the head of the graph may be susceptible to this effect content further down the Long Tail is less likely to be affected In particular tail end content should be largely insulated due to the low demand per item Rational seeds are simply not likely to take the risk of buying a tail end item with the purpose of reselling it for a lower price given the high likelihood that a buyer will not show up in a long time \xe2\x97\x8f Low Seeding Cost The ability to set high prices will not be much of an incentive if the costs related to seeding end up shaving off most of the profit margin Luckily this will not be the case The only direct cost imposed on a seed is a low fee (a few cents) for adding to the blockchain the magnet link of the content to be seeded \xe2\x80\x8bThis fee can be offset with interest revenue if the seed chooses to stake some of his income There will also be indirect costs derived from the bandwidth required during the seeding process from the electricity required to keep the computer turned on while seeding and from the storage required to host content The relevance of these costs depends on the type of seller in question At one extreme we can imagine an everyday internet user who mostly engages in low bandwidth requiring activities who rarely bothers to turn off his computer and who has some spare tail end content sitting in his hard disk Stated differently such an individual is in possession of spare bandwidth spare electricity and spare content that is already being paid for but which provide no value By seeding his spare content on vTorrent he will be able to utilize these surplus resources to earn passive income 15 \x0cAt the opposite extreme we can imagine someone with a large selection of tail end content who will need to acquire additional storage bandwidth and electricity in order to maintain his seeding operation Although these commodities will indeed add more costs to the equation their prices are relatively low \xe2\x80\x94 and in the case of storage and bandwidth the prices are continuously dropping [15 16] For instance for the past 35+ years or so the hard drive prices have decreased till today\xe2\x80\x99s level of only $0 03 per gigabyte [15] Moreover a large seed will enjoy economies of scale further decreasing his unit cost of content Thus seeds will have strong incentives to seed tail end content regardless of the size of their content selection \xe2\x97\x8f Ease of Access and Usage As demonstrated by the private trackers however great the selection of tail end content might be it will be incapable of fulfilling the corresponding demand in the face of high barriers to access and usage Obviously such restrictions will also reduce the number of seeds limiting the supply side of the market as well In order to avoid this walled garden problem vTorrent focuses on keeping the barriers to access and usage as low as possible In contrast to private trackers vTorrent will not require an invite for access nor impose any strict rules or ratio requirements for usage vTorrent users will only need to download the free client to enter the ecosystem and to obtain VTR with the in client trader in order to buy or seed content This convenient approach in combination with the all in one design and the default privacy and security features will ensure that both the demand and supply side of the market will be allowed to reach their full potential \xe2\x97\x8f A Tail End Market of Unrivaled Selection In sum the combination of low price competition and high collective demand will allow seeds to set higher prices low seeding costs will enable anyone with spare tail end content to become a seed \xe2\x80\x94 regardless of the size of their content selection and ease of access and usage will enable anyone to take part of the market These factors will set the stage for a Tail End market of unrivaled selection comprising both streamed and downloadable content 16 \x0c4 2 A MARKET FOR FASTER DOWNLOADS AND STREAMS The PSD feature will be integral in vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s aim at connecting those in demand for faster downloads and streams with those being willing and able to provide the corresponding supply Earlier we learnt that the main culprit behind the poor niche content selection on public torrent sites is lacking seeding incentives Lacking seeding incentives is also the reason why the tiny fraction of tail end content that actually is available on the public torrent sites tend to suffer from painfully slow download speeds Sometimes large long tail files can take days and even weeks to download With PSD those in demand for such files will be able to reward seeds to provide them with the download speed of their need With the opportunity of getting paid seeds will have an incentive to prioritize their bandwidth to fulfill the demand While it may seem less obvious there is likely an unfulfilled demand for fast downloads and fast streams for mainstream content as well This demand is likely to mostly comprise of people falling between the cracks of current content providers To give an example imagine a person who for some reason needs to download all the seasons of an award winning show in the course of a very short time span Streaming services will obviously not have what he is looking for due to his downloading requirement \xe2\x80\x94 and at the other extreme \xe2\x80\x94 public torrent sites will be a hit or miss owing to the big variations of the download speeds of the content being hosted there The potential income to be earned for fulfilling the demand in the above examples along with low seeding costs and low barriers to access and usage \xe2\x80\x94 are the key factors designed to attract people all over the world to utilize their spare content and spare bandwidth \xe2\x80\x94 or acquire such commodities \xe2\x80\x94 to take part of the supply side of vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s market for faster downloads and streams In contrast to the tail end market described earlier \xe2\x80\x94 the supply side of this market will contain all kinds of contents 17 \x0c4 3 A FREE FILE SHARING ALTERNATIVE FOR CURRENT BITTORRENT USERS While the aforementioned use cases mostly have revolved around the PSD feature vTorrent will provide significant benefits with respect to free file sharing as well Firstly vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized architecture will ensure resistance against censorship \xe2\x80\x94 an issue that is plaguing current public torrent sites and private trackers Secondly vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s anonymous communication tools provide users with better privacy protection than the insecure and cumbersome solutions often utilized by current sites and trackers Thirdly vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s all in one approach will ensure that the user experience is faster and easier than the current norm of which BitTorrent applications are spread across a number of different sites and services For these reasons many of the over 170 million monthly BitTorrent users[17] \xe2\x80\x94 A number larger than the combined user base of Netflix Amazon and Hulu [18] \xe2\x80\x94 may end up making vTorrent their new home Provided that this scenario manifests and the immigrating seeders continue their seeding activities on vTorrent \xe2\x80\x94 a library comprising of free mainstream and upper long tail content will follow in the wake This adds an important piece in the puzzle of vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s content selection complementing the selection of paid content described earlier 4 4 A DIGITAL CONTENT PROVIDER FOR INDEPENDENT CONTENT CREATORS Traditionally content creators have been reliant upon third parties such as labels (the music industry) film studios (the film industry) or publishers (the book industry) in order to promote and distribute their art However the internet and digitization of content have enabled a growing number of content creators to go independent \xe2\x80\x94 with the benefits of higher profit margins and more artistic freedom Despite this they still have to deal with a distribution system comprising of rent seeking intermediaries imposing limitations of various forms Digital content providers royalty collectors aggregators etc all want their piece of the pie In addition artistic control is still under par in the industry while delayed payouts and restrictive gatekeepers come with the territory vTorrent looks to solve these issues with the goal of providing a much better distribution solution for independent content creators 4 4 1 No Service Fee Low costs In order to cover costs and to make a profit streaming and downloading providers retain a certain percentage of the revenue generated by the content creators using them for distribution For instance Apple Music and Spotify both retain roughly 20 30% [3 19] Since vTorrent is decentralized it is not subject to the costs common with the aforementioned services such as credit card fees data center costs bandwidth costs marketing costs staff salaries etc Nor is it governed by any central entity requiring a profit on top As such content creators distributing their art through vTorrent will retain 100% of the revenue they earn as well as being subject to significantly less costs 18 \x0c4 4 2 Instant and Low Fee Payouts The revenue which a content creator generates by distributing through a content provider does not go directly into his pocket Instead intermediaries facilitate the transfer As compensation they take a cut of the brokered revenue Usually they distribute payouts long after the revenue generating downloads or streams took place For instance the intermediaries collecting and distributing payouts in the music industry commonly operate with quarterly payout dates [4] While delayed payouts may not be a concern for big commercial artists they indeed represent an issue for small independent ones on a tight budget Since payments on vTorrent are P2P costly and ineffective intermediaries will be out of the equation If a consumer pays for a song his payment will go instantly and directly to the artist owning the song The only cost involved is a minuscule transaction fee to compensate the stakers 4 4 3 Low Barriers to Access Another advantage of using vTorrent for content distribution is low barriers to access Current digital content providers rarely deal with content creators directly If an artist wants to add his songs to a provider such as Spotify he has to pay an aggregator to do this for him In other words aggregators are gatekeepers between content creators and providers Using an aggregator is not only costly It also demands time and effort which the content creator could have spent developing his art With vTorrent there are no gatekeepers If an artist wants to expose his songs to an audience he only needs to download the free client get some VTR and start seeding 4 4 4 Free Price Setting and No Format Requirements Content creators using vTorrent will enjoy total freedom in regards to what content they can sell and what prices they can set They can even choose to offer content for free if they prefer so Such privileges which are seldom a reality on traditional content providers enable content creators to tailor their products in line with their different audience segments For example if an emerging artist is trying to build a larger fan base he may choose to share a collection of free songs on the premise that the downloaders sign up to his mailing list On the other side of the spectrum an established artist might want to sell an exclusive collection of high quality songs to his most loyal fans for a premium price 4 4 5 Unique Global Audience Indeed vTorrent makes the process of distribution faster easier and cheaper However such benefits are useless if there is no audience to distribute to Since independent content creators usually produce art ending up somewhere in the tail their target audience are not exactly the average consumers getting their fill of entertainment through Netflix and the like A better fit of audience are consumers with eclectic tastes with a penchant for art outside of the narrow 19 \x0cconfines of the mainstream Luckily vTorrent will have what it takes to attract this type of consumers Firstly since vTorrent is not subject to region locks its libraries will consist of content from all over the world \xe2\x80\x94 an attractive feature to anyone with diverse tastes The lack of region locks will benefit content creators as well by increasing their global reach Secondly the fact that payments to content creators won\xe2\x80\x99t get eroded by intermediaries should be attractive as well Those seeking art outside of the mainstream are usually not only fed up with mainstream art \xe2\x80\x94 but also the entire industry surrounding it More specifically the many intermediaries who use art solely as a vehicle of making money with the consequence of reducing the diversity of said art By being able to pay content creators fully consumers will be sure that they support the arts rather than the aforementioned money making scheme Moreover vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s additional use cases are set to draw in users fitting the description of the target audience of independent content creators For instance it should go without a saying that the Tail End market poised to emerge within vTorrent will bring along individuals with an above average interest for niche content Similar preferences can be attributed to BitTorrent users \xe2\x80\x94 of which a large fraction may choose to switch over to vTorrent \xe2\x80\x94 as described in the previous use case Studies have found that BitTorrent users are avid eclectic consumers of art and that they spend far more money on digital content than average internet users [18] For instance a study conducted by the American Assembly in 2012 found that BitTorrent users buy 30% more music than the average internet user [20] While these findings run counter to the popular belief that BitTorrent users are only interested in getting content for free those who have hung out in any of the numerous BitTorrent communities on the web are likely not surprised In these communities discussions about the motivation behind torrenting and the willingness to pay for content pop up frequently Commonly participants state that they torrent to find content not available elsewhere and that they would be more than willing to pay if possible In other words vTorrent seems to be the perfect matchmaker between independent content creators and the around 170 million monthly BitTorrent users 4 4 6 Unique Fan Interaction The days when artists were positioned as unreachable idols are long gone In today\xe2\x80\x99s digital world artists have to forge personal relationships with their audience to keep their interest vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s Riot app will be the perfect tool to facilitate this Here artists will be able to create their own chat rooms to stay in close touch with their fans or they can join rooms relevant to their genre to connect with potential new fans 20 \x0c4 5 A PLATFORM FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS vTorrent\xe2\x80\x99s combination of being open source and decentralized makes it an ideal platform on which third parties can build streaming or downloading services Traditionally building such services from scratch is a complicated endeavor with high capital investments and draining operating expenses However a large fraction of these costs can be eliminated by building on top of vTorrent These cost saving benefits come in addition to the ability to leverage the disruptive potential of the PSD feature Simply put vTorrent lowers the barriers to entry for small start ups looking to disrupt the field of digital distribution Initially most services built on top of vTorrent will likely include some centralized components since these generally pose less challenges with respect to development However given the numerous benefits of decentralization we may witness a race towards fully decentralized services We can imagine services where activities such as content curation and content discovery are outsourced to users through clever incentive mechanisms powered by blockchain technology 5 CONCLUSION \xe2\x80\x94 A BRAVE NEW ECONOMY ____________________________________________________________________________ vTorrent leverages the BitTorrent protocol and blockchain technology to create a decentralized BitTorrent client which will enable paid P2P streaming and downloading within a user friendly anonymous and secure environment This removes the limitations of intermediaries and authorities as well as lowering the barriers to access and usage \xe2\x80\x94 setting the stage for a brave new economy of digital commerce in which hundreds of millions of content creators fans seeds and consumers all over the world will be free to participate 21 \x0c6 SOURCES ____________________________________________________________________________ [1]
