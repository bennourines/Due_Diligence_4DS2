exchange security critical data over the IoT network Many IoT networks use the public key infrastructure (PKI) to authenticate devices and ensure the data security as well as the data privacy The IoT device has to sign the generated data by a digital public key and deliver the data to the network for exchanging However such authentication method tends to be expensive for an IoT device regarding computing power and energy consumption Furthermore the blockchain technology has the decentralized secure and private nature to become a promising idea that can be approaching the next generation IoT architecture Therefore in our previous works Flowchain and Devify have already been proposed to build a blockchain technology for the IoT device over a p2p network Therefore to achieve a secure and inexpensive blockchain for the IoT this paper proposes Flowchain Hybrid Blockchain to enable fast authentication by eliminating the concept of traditional PKI methods Furthermore our work can address the technical challenge of achieving an efficient and secure IoT device to exchange the captured data by the blockchain technology Copyright retained by the authors The rest of the paper is organized as follow In Section 2 we describe the main components of the hybrid blockchain design In Section 3 we present the model including the architecture algorithms and the hybrid blockchain design The IoT blockchain economy is discussed in Section 4 Finally Section 5 concludes the paper 1 1 Previous Works A Devify Devify has already proposed a generic and comprehensive software framework for building various types of trust IoT networks in a decentralized manner that can execute on a variety range of hardware devices such as cloud servers mobile devices and resource constrained devices B Flowchain Flowchain is the blockchain technology for the IoT developed on Devify In a blockchain network the consensus system can ensure the trusted transactions among all IoT nodes in a p2p network The blockchain for the IoT technology comprises of a p2p network system and a consensus system The traditional public blockchains such as Bitcoin [12] and Ethereum use proof of work (PoW) consensus system however the PoW consensus system does not provide the ability of near real time transactions Therefore in our previous work Flowchain has also already proposed an IoT blockchain technology and a mining based proof of stake (PoS) miner to ensure the real time transactions for IoT blockchain Consequently IoT devices vary e g resourceconstrained devices mobile devices and high performance server frames that the computing power varies from devices Flowchain uses the Devify software framework as the underlying p2p network system to implement such IoT blockchain technology Thus it can execute on various IoT devices 1 2 Type of Blockchains The blockchains could be either a public blockchain or a private related to who is allowed to join the blockchain network [7] A Public Blockchain Anyone can join the blockchain network meaning that the blockchain network is entirely open to users for submitting transactions accessing shared ledgers and mining More specifically since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 the public blockchain can enable a decentralized model that it can operate without any central authorizations thus the public blockchain has the natures of openness and trust \x0cB Private Blockchain Unlike public blockchains only authenticated users can join the private blockchain network The user needs to request permissions from an authority in the private blockchain for joining the network The authority validates the authenticity of a user and grant permissions to authenticated users for submitting transactions and accessing shared ledgers C Hybrid Blockchain A hybrid blockchain comprises of public and private blockchains The hybrid blockchain creates openness and trust of transactions in the public blockchain and protect the privacy sensitive data in the private blockchain Such technique has already been proposed to secure blockchains and applied to digital rights management [15] The use cases of the hybrid blockchain are as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 In a hybrid blockchain the private blockchain can determine which transactions are public and submit these transactions to the public blockchain for open access \xe2\x80\xa2 In a hybrid blockchain the public blockchain can store transactions to secure data provenance Based on the application design and business logic the blockchain architect can use the public blockchain private blockchain or a hybrid model by leveraging the benefits of both public and private blockchains 1 3 Related Work The standard methods of distributed computing desire stronger notions of security where authentication may be provided by the PKI Nevertheless the study [8] describes that such methods are too strong for open and p2p networks moreover the study shows that a group of n nodes can generate a pseudonymous PKI by solving cryptographic puzzles at some bounded rate As such the nodes are validated by pseudonymous authentication rather than by true authentication We show that such pseudonymous authentication method can be achieved by a hybrid blockchain model with secure and fast by encouraging public miners to generate cryptographic puzzles Accordingly the study [2] showed a Byzantine agreement model without a PKI by solving computational puzzles at some bounded rate and assume authenticated channels between honest nodes Moreover our hybrid blockchain technology achieve pseudonymous authentication without such authenticated channels thus the hybrid blockchain can have unbounded number of corruptions Also the study [14] proposed a framework to efficiently and securely capture and validate provenance data our hybrid blockchain technology can ensure such capabilities with the concept of hybrid blockchain technology 2 CORE COMPONENTS This section describes the main Hybrid Flowchain components as shown in Figure 1 A Private Blockchain The private blockchain is where IoT devices can store their private data and ensure their data privacy The IoT devices in the private blockchain can decide which data can be public by submitting the transactions of the data to the public blockchain Figure 1 Core components of our hybrid blockchain design B Public Blockchain The public blockchain can verify transactions and record the verified transactions in the distributed ledgers across miners The transactions in the public blockchain are public and opened to anyone meaning that anyone can access the transactions in the public blockchain C Flowchain IoT Nodes The IoT nodes is an IoT device that executing the Flowchain [5] application previously proposed by this paper The IoT nodes can be self organized as a peer to peer (p2p) network by using the Chord algorithm [1] and Flowchain protocols D Puzzle Miner Puzzles Miner is a computer that aims to generate the puzzles and broadcasts the puzzles to the private blockchains Section 4 describes the design and purpose of the puzzle miner E Hybrid Node Hybrid node is a device that receives the puzzles from the public blockchain and delivers the puzzles over the p2p network of the private blockchain 3 OUR MODEL 3 1 Hybrid Blockchain Architecture Public blockchains such as Nakamoto blockchain use the permissionless blockchain to build a trusted machine to read and submit transactions Furthermore private blockchains use the permissioned blockchain to build such trusted machine by granting access permissions only to authenticated participants In a private blockchain users need to be preauthenticated before reading and submit transactions However the pre authenticated is time consuming to achieve near real time transactions for today\xe2\x80\x99s IoT applications Therefore this paper proposes the hybrid blockchain architecture designed for the decentralized IoT application that can ensure a near real time ability to read and submit transactions without such full authentication Accordingly the most important features of the decentralized IoT is the consensus system A consensus system can verify the transactions from a less trust state to a trusted state as such this paper will also propose a fast hybrid consensus system by combining a permissioned public blockchain \x0cFigure 2 The hybrid blockchain network with a permissionless blockchain to verify transactions over the hybrid blockchain system In hybrid blockchains the public blockchain is accessible by any participants and the private blockchain is only opened and accessible to authenticated users The private blockchain is a permissioned network such as a wireless sensor network and a Machine Learning network that can determine which transactions can be submitted to public blockchains Figure 2 summarizes that the decentralized IoT application proposed by this work can provide the settings for today\xe2\x80\x99s IoT requirement \xe2\x80\xa2 In the private blockchain the users can submit sensory data issue such data as digital assets and submit to the hybrid consensus system \xe2\x80\xa2 The consensus system can determine which transactions are opened to public blockchains for public access \xe2\x80\xa2 The consensus system can subsequently record such transactions in the public blockchains with openness trust provenance and immutability More importantly since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 the decentralized model has been proposed to ensure an openness and trust network by verifying transactions without any central authorizations Therefore this paper introduces the hybrid blockchain model by using the public blockchains to provide such decentralized model 3 2 Pseudonymous Authentication Method The distributed computing uses the full authentication technique such as the PKI to control access to their networks Also most existing blockchains use such PKI technique to authenticate users secure the communications and verify transactions by multi party computation [6] However the study [8] has figured that such PKI technique is too strong to enable a fast communication Specifically the IoT blockchain need to authenticate nodes with fast as such this paper will propose the pseudonymous authentication technique to address such technical challenge The pseudonymous authentication uses the technique of computational puzzles solving to replace the PKI to enable a fast authentication Moreover such PKI technique is too strong that it involves confirming the identity of a user by validating the authenticity of a user with a digital certificate Unlike a strong authentication technique the user is anonymous in such pseudonymous authentication system and the system validates the authenticity of the anonymous user by the consensus of the solution The pseudonymous authentication uses a weaker but secures enough authenticity system The Figure 3 Puzzle mining and broadcast to private blockchains blockchains such as Bitcoin which don\xe2\x80\x99t use strong authentication systems have proven the notion of pseudonymous authentication to be a tremendous success In summary figure 3 shows that IoT nodes in the hybrid blockchain network are pseudonymously authenticated in the private permissioned blockchain to ensure near real time transactions 3 3 Puzzle Miner Algorithm The users represented as IoT nodes in this paper can join the private blockchain and submit transactions to the public blockchain by solving a computational puzzle mined by the miners The puzzles are computed by miners in the public blockchain and broadcasting to the private blockchains As previously described the pseudonymous authentication needs to ensure a fast validation of the authenticity of an anonymous user Therefore this paper proposed that the hybrid blockchain use a lottery function to generate Konami Code that can be used to verify the solution Formally let \xce\xbb be Konami Code a truly random magic string generated by the lottery function and each puzzle is bound to this Konami Code Let Fpuz be the puzzle solving function and Ui represents each user Then if the user does not submit the solution of the puzzle to the public blockchains within a fixed time interval the public blockchain assumes that the user is unauthenticated Also the transactions submitted by the unauthenticated user are considered untrusted which can be discarded Therefore untrusted transactions will not be recorded in the public blockchain This paper assumes that the user can solve a puzzle within a fixed time interval \xcf\x83 then the mining process of the miners is as follows 1 Ui starts receiving \xce\xbb from the broadcasting 2 Let Puzzle be a function and \xc2\xa7j be a string Ui receives a puzzle (Puzzle xj ) from a peer Uj in the private blockchain over the p2p network 3 Let Puzzle(\xce\xbb) gives an arbitrary length vector ~ x of the Konami Code then ~ x = (x1 xn ) n < j 4 Let Fpuz maintain a set T of puzzle solutions then Fpuz computes each entries in ~ x let yi = Fpuz(xi ) i = (1 j) 5 The miners say that Ui solves the puzzle (Puzzle xj ) if \x0cFigure 4 The virtual blocks and local blockchain Fpuz successfully finds yi = xj within the time interval \xcf\x83 6 Fpuz returns \xc2\xa7j to Uj and stores H = (~ x yi \xce\xbb) in T 7 The miners and Uj confirm the user Ui is authenticated Also the user Ui can thus use H to sign transactions and submit the transactions to the public blockchains for verifying the submit process be as follows 1 The trusted user Ui produces a message or receives a message from another user through the p2p network formally let M be this message 2 The trusted user Ui has the keypair (ski pii ) let Sign be the signature function 3 Let T i be the new transaction and Hash be a hash function so that T i = Hash(Sign(M ) H pki ) 4 Ui submits T i to the public blockchain Accordingly regarding the implementation selection the hash function Hash can be SHA 256 SHA 512 etc 3 4 The Hybrid Consensus The public blockchain network can record transactions in the distributed ledgers the blockchains across all miners after some miners successfully agree on the transactions the process is called proof of work consensus The transactions recorded in the public blockchain are trusted transactions and immutable Moreover the miners should ensure that the transactions were submitted from an authenticated nodes As such the hybrid blockchain has a hybrid consensus that can achieve such multi party trust The hybrid blockchain provides these settings to support the consensus system for multi party trust \xe2\x80\xa2 In the public blockchain the miners can verify transactions from a pseudonymously authenticated node \xe2\x80\xa2 The public blockchain network can agree on the transactions by proof of work consensus Also the hybrid blockchain can provide the ability to exchange messages between different private blockchains via the public blockchain 3 5 The Local Blockchain As previously described Flowhain can build a private blockchain that the IoT devices can self organize as a p2p network Every Flowchain IoT Node in the private blockchain has a local blockchain that keeps the privacy sensitive data Figure 4 depicts the concept of virtual blocks and the local blockchain The local blockchain starts from the genesis block and is chained by virtual blocks mined by a local miner executing on the IoT node Section 3 6 describes the algorithm of a local miner Flowchain comprised a mining based proof of stake model for IoT devices that the block time the time to find a valid block is predictable and can be timed in a fixed number calculation per second Furthermore Kraft and Daniel [10] studied the predictable block times for various hash rate scenarios as the Poisson process with time dependent intensity Therefore we model the prediction of block times as a Poisson probability density function to ensure a cost effective difficulty control system Figure 5(a) depicts the concept of this mining process 1 The block time is determined by P the Poisson distribution function 2 The value of P is resulted by stakes such as the battery level and WiFi signal strength 3 At the time t1 P predicts that if the termination time of the current block is exactly early than the end of t1 than block #1 is successfully mined 4 The local miner continues the step 2 and 3 to mine more virtual blocks In figure 5(a) the local miner predicts that block #2 can be found at t2 and block #4 can be found at t9 The block time of block #4 is longer than expected because that the WiFi signal is weak at time t4 to t8 Furthermore the Byzantine agreement is a consensus algorithm to avoid distort data [11] across p2p nodes The Byzantine agreement can be found in many database systems to ensure data replication and redundant Technically the Byzantine agreement is a distributed decision making process that some amount of nodes are agreed on transactions and can replicate the data such a mechanism is also known as fault tolerance and Byzantine agreement is known as Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Therefore the private blockchain can also agree on the private transactions by fault tolerance meaning that the p2p network in the private blockchain can replicate a certain of private transactions In general if a maximum number of n node can distort data a BFT algorithm can be achieved with a total of 3n + 1 nodes to tolerate the network However if nodes can not distort application data submitted through them then an amount of 2n + 1 nodes is capable of tolerance the network There are various BFT implementations such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) [3] and Speculative Byzantine Fault Tolerant (Zyzzyva) [9] can be employed in the private blockchains of our hybrid model The implementation is a selection according to the difference in their business logic 3 6 The Local Mining The previous work of this paper [5] proposed that the IoT nodes can use the virtual blocks concept to store local transactions IoT nodes can temporarily store their transactions in the virtual blocks and submit the stored transactions to the private blockchain network for replicating This setting called gathering transactions can provide additional abilities to hybrid blockchains as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 The IoT nodes can submit real time sensitive transactions immediately to the public blockchain and save the transactions in the virtual blocks \x0cFigure 5 (a) Local mining and (b) the pseudonymous authentication \xe2\x80\xa2 The IoT nodes can gather and store none real time sensitive transactions in virtual blocks as well \xe2\x80\xa2 The IoT nodes can submit their virtual blocks to the private blockchain for data replication As described previously we present a local miner by which virtual blocks are mined Moreover the genesis block is pre defined by the private blockchain developers As figure 4 previously figured that the genesis block formally denoted as G which is pre defined by private blockchain developers and there are give entities E1 E2 E4 E4 and E5 in a private blockchain As such figure 5(a) depicts the process of local mining and the following example shows E1 1 The public blockchain has \xcf\x83 slices per second meaning that the puzzle miner uses a fixed time interval mining mechanism 2 The puzzle miners in the public blockchain are broadcasting \xce\xbb1 at time t1 3 The Flowchain node E1 has a sensory data formally denoted M and E1 generates a transaction T 1 = Hash(Sign(M ) H pki ) 4 The Flowchain node E1 successfully mines Block #1 after Fpuz solving the puzzle bound with \xce\xbb1 and stores T 1 in virtual block Block #1 of E1 5 E1 repeats steps 2 3 and 4 until the end of \xcf\x83 slices and resulting in a total number of 5 transactions [T 1 T 5] which were stored in virtual block Block #1 6 E1 subsequently continues to get \xce\xbb2 at t1 as well as resulting in 10 transactions [T 6 T 15] which were stored in virtual block Block #2 7 At the time t3 the IoT node E1 submits [T 1 T 15] in the virtual blocks Block #1 and Block 2 to the private blockchain network 8 All authenticated nodes in the private blockchain can join the consensus activity to agree on [T 1 1 T 15] that all the transactions will become trusted 9 The BFT consensus can ensure that trusted transactions [T 1 1 T 15] were replicated in the private blockchain meaning that the private blockchain is capable of fault tolerance of private trusted transactions Figure 5(b) shows such local mining technique that the Flowchain node was pseudonymously authenticated to submit transactions at (ti tj tk ) Furthermore the above process also gives the deferred submission concept The Flowchain Table 1 The attributes of the perfect blockchain Perfect Our Model Blockchain Predictable block We use the probability density functimes tion to predict block times We use a periodical mining sysStability of block tem to ensure the stability of block times times An alternative dif We use a PoS miner to control the ficulty control mining difficulty We use the hybrid blockchain model Secure and together with the pseudoymous autrusted transacthentication technique to ensure setions cure and trusted transactions node can gather transactions in its virtual blocks and submit gathered transactions to the public blockchain in a future time The blockchain model provides additional advantages for the IoT thus this paper selects the blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and secure IoT network Table 1 summarizes the results of our work to highlight attributes of a promising IoT blockchain 4 THE IOT BLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY Describing the benefits of a new blockchain technology in the economy is fundamental Thus in addition to the blockchain technology this work also describes the blockchain economy how blockchain technology can benefit the IoT technology as well as why the blockchain technology is necessary for the next generation IoT innovation More specially this section also describes how to adapt our hybrid blockchain model to gain such benefits 4 1 Tokenized Hardware There are various types of tokens currently existing in the cryptocurrency economic such as utility token security token and coins The SEC recently announced to consider Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as securities which could be a good thing since the ICOs as securities is a new viable way to raise funds called tokenized securities In this paper we propose the tokenized hardware another new viable way to hardware manufacturing and production for open hardware economic Tokenized hardware can ensure the assets of \x0cthe hardware rights data privacy and data security by hardware tokens Therefore this paper also proposes the concept of tokenized hardware that the hardware ecosystem comprised of manufacturers developers and consumers can collaborate on mining to mine a fixed amount of hardware tokens We consider that the tokenized hardware technology will represent a revolutionary innovation to build more trust and secure hardware Furthermore in recent years the crypto has become an emerging technology for creating more secure and decentralized systems Ethereum platform an Ethash based blockchain system uses such technology to issue tokens which can be utilized as cryptocurrency that can be traded in any central exchange Accordingly startups can also raise funds by selling virtual shares in the form of security tokens called tokenized security Moreover the underlying infrastructure of IoT blockchain technologies is consolidated by the orchestration of hardware and software components that can support the implementation of cryptographic technologies As such figure 6 presents that the proposed software architecture of our previous work can implement the tokenized hardware firmware 4 2 The benefits of IoT Blockchain It is the token fundamentals to define the benefits the customers gain from holding tokens thus linking viable benefits with token usage models is a critical issue in our research The benefits customers gain from utility tokens are as the following examples 1 Access the basic cloud service 2 After sales service 3 Purchase discount The amount of total supply of utility tokens equals to the total quantity of each shipment and utility tokens must record their benefits provided on public blockchains such as Ethereum and Hyperledger In short utility tokens can grant permissions to authorized hardware for accessing cloud service request for the after sales service and other available benefits provided by hardware manufacturers Also unlike public blockchains private blockchains are permissioned blockchains that are controlled by their operators and only grant permissions to authorized users [7] thus each shipment of the hardware can be employed as a private blockchain by which utility tokens are mined Internet of Things (IoT) is a connected device enables the sensory data transfers to the Internet and applications can participate the IoT device to access these sensory data For participating the IoT device the participants have to pay the device for data access Unlike utility tokens the payment is in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and ERC20 currencies which uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation units of the cryptocurrency and verify the transaction of funds Moreover unlike fiat currencies cryptocurrencies are usually operating independently without a central bank and can be minted on public blockchains such as Ethereum In conclusion the payment of funds is achieved with cryptocurrencies in a peer to peer (P2P) manner called client to client (C2C) model The WiFi camera is a use case among tokenized hardware products The WiFi camera is a tangible asset while the video streams produced by the camera are digital assets Figure 6 The software on a Flowchain IoT node [16] in short the tokenized camera is an asset comprised of the hardware asset and the digital assets and the token holder has the rights to use these assets Subsequently the blockchain can issue access tokens to users who want to access the digital data from the camera As such there is a use scenario of such tokenized camera hardware 1 John has an app on his mobile phone 2 An app pays some units to the WiFi camera 3 The blockchain issues an access token to mobile apps after verifying the transactions 4 The app starts with received video streams the digital assets of the tokenized hardware 5 John can watch the video from the camera Such use scenario is a use case of tokenized hardware proposed by this paper nevertheless we define connected tokenized hardware as Tokenized Things compare to the traditional Internet of Things (IoT) Also technically a tokenized thing has to be represented as Virtual Things with the ontology of Web of Things (WoT) [13] and operates in a p2p manner Therefore this paper has also developed the Devify software framework [4] a generic and comprehensive software framework based on Flowchain for building p2p IoT networks 4 3 Incentive One of the most visible impacts is that the hybrid blockchains have to provide an incentive design A favorable incentive design can help to build a sustainable blockchain network and keep the network healthy meaning that the incentive can encourage participants to support the blockchain network by participating in the activities of the public blockchains such as puzzles mining as previously described In our hybrid blockchain model the public blockchain can fund incentive either by puzzles mining proof the existence of specific application data or run smart contracts Puzzles Mining Participants have to join the public blockchain network and spend their time to generate and broadcast puzzles \x0cFigure 7 The hybrid blockchain architecture for the IoT and AI The IoT devices can be tokenized to ensure their trust and submit datasets to the public blockchain for data analysis Proof of Existence A transaction exists if it has been verified and recorded in the public blockchain The miners can assist smart contracts for validating the existence of a transaction call proof of existence More importantly the proof of existence can ensure the data trust and provenance Hosting Smart Contracts The smart contract is one type of the decentralized applications (Dapps) and in our hybrid blockchain model the developers can build a private blockchain develop smart contracts for their private blockchain and deploy smart contracts to the public blockchain for invocation 5 CONCLUSION To conclude the contribution of our work we illustrate the machine learning network as an example Hybrid Flowchain comprises of private permissioned and public permissionless blockchains that can enable the machine learning on IoT Blockchain with the allowance of multiple organizations to perform collaborative data analytics and machine learning while guaranteeing the data privacy of their datasets The consortium blockchain is a type of hybrid blockchain that it allows multiple organizations to exchange trusted transactions through the public blockchain The organization has their private blockchain and the hybrid consensus can ensure the multi party trust as previously described in section 3 4 Figure 7 depicts the hybrid blockchain architecture that can enable such machine learning network on the Hybrid Flowchain The paper has already
