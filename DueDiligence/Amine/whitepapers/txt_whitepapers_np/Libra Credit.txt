DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP 31 5 DEFINITIONS 32 6 APPENDIX 34 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Access to credit should be hassle free real time and simple However traditional financing is channel product and geographic specific with onerous processes and outdated systems resulting in long cycle times and increased cost of capital Heavy reliance on traditional lenders (e g banks country centric P2P platforms) does not address future customer needs (i e getting credit when and where they need it and leveraging emerging crypto asset classes as collaterals) Global lending is expected to grow at 14% over the next five years driven by a rise in digital ecosystems and technology disruption which makes lending to more than two billion under banked population a closer reality Given these significant tailwinds a global and open digital platform is needed to shape the future of lending making it accessible to anyone anywhere Libra Credit is a decentralized lending ecosystem that facilitates open access to credit anywhere and anytime based on the Ethereum blockchain to be developed by Libra Foundation Libra Credit will be launched in July 2018 with crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat lending underpinned by its industry leading credit management capability and four distinctive partnership networks forming a world class lending ecosystem that encompasses In house Proprietary AI based Credit Model Customer Acquisition & E Wallet Partnership Network to drive adoption Lenders & Stablecoin Partnership Network to drive liquidity Extensive Exchange Partnership Network to minimize default Identity Verification Partnership Network to expedite KYC & verification process Libra Credit is a global initiative by Libra Foundation with a mission \xe2\x80\x9cCredit for the Real World\xe2\x80\x9d The team has a track record in digital credit services across Asia Powered by its proprietary big data AI based credit assessment technology and existing global partnership networks Libra Credit has the expertise and capabilities to realize its mission 3 \x0cPROJECT BACKGROUND 2 1 CHALLENGES OF EXISTING MARKETS Despite growing adoption of digital assets something as simple as getting access to credit still remains a challenge for many borrowers Not only are future customer needs not addressed traditional lending institutions are also heavily reliant on outdated credit rating methods directly dismissing the legitimacy of digital assets Additionally even with breakthrough technologies like blockchain traditional financing is still channel product and geographic specific with onerous processes that result in long cycle times and increased cost of capital These issues not only limit efficient flow of assets but also ignore a large segment of the market that is under served by banks Challenges of Traditional Credit Services Borrowers \xe2\x80\xa2 High barriers to credit services due to limited or unrecognized personal credit data \xe2\x80\xa2 Unsatisfied borrowing experience due to complicated KYC procedures long processing times low application transparency and high borrowing costs ~10% globally (World Bank) Lenders \xe2\x80\xa2 Increased lending difficulty due to lack of traditional records of the digital savvy generation \xe2\x80\xa2 Opportunity cost of uncaptured digital savvy market segment \xe2\x80\xa2 Difficulty in cross border cross currency and cross time zone lending 4 \x0cPROJECT BACKGROUND On the other hand the rise of crypto assets faces similar challenges \xe2\x80\x93 lack of \xe2\x80\x9creal world\xe2\x80\x9d underlying application causes crypto holders to be tied down by their own digital assets Challenges of the Crypto Market Liquidity Issues Limited Applications \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of liquidity and integration into fiat financial service offerings \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of recognition and application as a general payment method / asset class \xe2\x80\xa2 Difficult to convert between digital assets and traditional assets (i e gold stocks bonds real estate etc ) \xe2\x80\xa2 High volatility and speculation with little to no asset backing There is a genuine need for a solution that provides safe and convenient credit services accessible for all 5 \x0cPROJECT BACKGROUND 2 2 MARKET OPPORTUNITY The global credit market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14%1 (2017 \xe2\x80\x93 2021) Specifically over 85%2 of the global credit market is dominated by the secured retail lending market Favorable market conditions have attracted many new technologies and players to enter this market popularizing credit alternatives such as peer to peer (P2P) lending and digital lending Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization (Billion USD) Global Digital Lending Volume (Unsecured) (Billion USD) 1 8 0 6 CAGR 31% 1 5 8 5 CAGR 1 3 7 9 33% 1 1 9 3 1 0 5 4 898 805 676 615 2017 509 2018E 2019E 2020E 2021E 2017 2018E 2019E 2020E 2021E Moreover a paradigm shift in digital adoption has also given rise to alternative asset classes like cryptocurrency Although not traditionally accepted as collaterals for lending cryptocurrencies have surpassed USD $600B in market capitalization at the end of 2017 As the market grows cryptoinvestors demand more use cases for their assets which are largely unmet by traditional financial institutions 1) Source Business Wire 2) Source HIS Database 6 \x0cPROJECT BACKGROUND Despite continuous growth in global secured retail lending and rise of digital lending over two billion people3 remain under banked with little to no access to credit or financial services Once digital lending becomes mainstream among the under banked this largely untapped segment will be a significant addition to the credit lending addressable market 2 3 WHY LIBRA CREDIT Libra Credit is launched with the mission to provide \xe2\x80\x9cCredit for the Real World\xe2\x80\x9d Devoted to the provision of credit anywhere and anytime Libra Foundation will build a secure convenient and globally inclusive financial services

Custodian Partnership Network 8 \x0cLIBRA CREDIT To address the limitations of both markets we are launching Libra Credit \xe2\x80\x93 a decentralized lending ecosystem that facilitates open access to credit anywhere and anytime In July 2018 Libra Credit aims to facilitate global crypto to crypto and crypto to fiat lending (subject to regulatory approval) for borrowers To improve acceptance and drive adoption initially we will act as the loan guarantor for financial institutions (i e banks funds etc ) and private investors (i e HNWI crypto community) Crypto assets will then be released directly from our Lender & Stablecoin Partnership Network to borrowers Key highlights of our business model are as follows EXTENSIVE PARTNERSHIP NETWORKS 1 \xe2\x80\xa2 Collaborating with partners in both crypto and financial markets \xe2\x80\xa2 Synergies with crypto exchanges stablecoin providers (e g Maker DAO) 3rd party identity verification providers (e g uPort) and financial institutions (e g banks) \xe2\x80\xa2 Reinforcing Libra Credit while delivering value for our partners PROPRIETARY AI BASED CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK 2 \xe2\x80\xa2 In house risk management technology which has been deployed in China and the ASEAN market successfully \xe2\x80\xa2 Pioneer in digital credit services leveraging a dual credit assessment framework that considers collateral viability and borrower credit score FLEXIBILITY FOR PARTICIPANTS 3 \xe2\x80\xa2 Crypto to fiat loan allowing collateralization of cryptocurrencies to spend fiat without sacrificing their current crypto position \xe2\x80\xa2 Crypto to stablecoin loans enabling borrowers to hedge price volatility without exiting \xe2\x80\xa2 Crypto to crypto lending allowing borrowers to pledge other alternate tokens for more mainstream crypto currencies (i e BTC / ETH) with better liquidity 9 \x0cLIBRA CREDIT As Libra Credit scales each of the following partner network components will be developed to assume the following roles LIBRA CREDIT PLATFORM The Libra Credit Platform focuses on a dual credit risk scoring mechanism that takes into account both the creditworthiness of the pledged collateral as well as the individual credit information of the borrower Borrowers may pledge any crypto assets as collateral and receive loans in their desired asset Through smart contracts and our own proprietary collateral valuation and liquidation system Libra Credit will lock in agreed terms between borrowers lenders custodians guarantors and liquidators The platform pulls together an ecosystem of four different types of partnership networks as outlined below 1) CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND E WALLET PARTNERSHIP NETWORK The customer acquisition partnership network can help the Libra Credit drive adoption and scalability Lending applications and e wallets provide a multitude of acquisition channels for Libra Credit to obtain its customers Our lending application partners can facilitate liquidity for its end users through the Libra Credit Examples 2 would be travel applications (i e crypto holders can obtain fiat lending for trip payment) and e commerce applications (i e fiat lending for purchasing advance) On the other hand the Libra Credit can drive trade volume for e wallet networks through our loan disbursement needs 2) IDENTITY VERIFICATION PARTNERSHIP NETWORK Libra Credit can manage the KYC identity verification process of new borrowers quickly and securely through our identity verification partnership network Our mutually synergistic credit information network generates large amounts of credit data per day Interested parties (i e vendors regulators and financial institutions) may leverage our anonymized data to perform activities such as data analytics credit scoring customer behavioral monitoring and much more At the same time we will have access to the information systems of our partners allowing us to constantly refine and enhance our verification process Our partnership network can access the platform and data through open APIs that will be available to Libra Community members for a fee 10 \x0cLIBRA CREDIT 3) LENDER & STABLECOIN PARTNERSHIP NETWORK Lenders and stablecoin providers are essential to our network since they can supply liquidity hedge risk and enable the reinvestment needs of our borrowers Fiat lenders such as banks funds and other financial institutions can satisfy cash turnover needs of crypto holders (i e payday loans) While stable coin providers enable crypto holders to hedge the volatility of their portfolio Lastly crypto to crypto lenders (i e crypto funds private investors) can lend tokens or other crypto currencies to institutions and crypto users For example institutions with large holdings of proprietary tokens can borrow BTC or ETH to fund their operations 4) EXCHANGE & CUSTODIAN PARTNERSHIP NETWORK Our exchange partnerships (e g Radar Relay and DDEX) serve the role of providing crypto market liquidity and flexibility for the network Borrowers can go through Libra Credit to get the best rates offered to us exclusively for their crypto investments At the same time Libra Credit will have full access and support in the case that collaterals in our possession have to be immediately liquidated 11 \x0cLIBRA CREDIT 3 1 2 Selected Use Cases Libra Credit offers a quick and seamless digital lending process that can be completed online or in a mobile application in five easy steps Application Verification & Credit Assessment Notification & Confirmation Collateral Deposit Disbursement Here is an illustrative example of a crypto to fiat loan on Libra Credit Assume that Bob a Libra Credit community member and XYZ Token holder wants to pledge XYZ Tokens for a 30 day loan in US Dollars (USD) Step 1 Application As a platform member Bob fills in an online/mobile loan application form and submit digital documents (if required) to Libra Credit Step 2 Verification & Credit Assessment credit score and collateral grade Libra Credit will Libra Credit verifies the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s identity after generate corresponding loan terms the application is submitted In particular to obtain more authorized and verified data of Bob Libra Credit may make selective disclosure request to verification partners (e g uPort) Sample Loan Terms Sample Approved Terms Collateral XYZ Token(s) are accepted Collateral to loan (CTL) Ratio 125% Interest rate 12% Payment frequency Weekly Users with existing Identity Management Accounts at supported platforms may be able to bypass the KYC process Once verified an automated real time credit assessment is conducted by our proprietary big data and AIbased credit assessment engine Based on Bob\xe2\x80\x99s 12 \x0cLIBRA CREDIT Step 3 Notification & Confirmation Bob will be instantly notified via APP SMS or email of the final loan terms in which he can immediately accept with simply one click Step 4 Collateral Deposit Bob\xe2\x80\x99s XYZ Token is deposited into Libra Credit\xe2\x80\x99s e wallet or exchange partners depending on borrower\xe2\x80\x99s preference The collaterals will be securely stored for the entire loan period Step 5 Disbursement USD will be instantly deposited from the lenders wallet to Bob\xe2\x80\x99s4 If Bob chooses to receive the loan in his digital wallet (e g Alipay WeChat Pay) the whole process will be completed within minutes5 If Bob prefers a bank account deposit one working day will be required for loan disbursement6 This is significantly faster than most digital lenders that require day(s) and traditional lending institutions that require at least 2 4 weeks to process During the loan period Bob makes weekly payments (or any other frequency approved by Libra Credit) When the loan is repaid Bob\xe2\x80\x99s XYZ Token is returned Risk Handling Mechanism Maintaining the Margin \xe2\x80\x93 Cryptocurrencies pledged as collateral may drop in value during the loan period causing a decrease in the CTL ratio If the CTL ratio falls past a threshold (minimum maintenance margin) a margin call will be triggered In Bob\xe2\x80\x99s case if XYZ suddenly drops 10% in value Bob\xe2\x80\x99s CTL ratio will decrease to 112 5% 4) We assume that the electronic wallet will be able to store both fiat and crypto currencies 5) Depending on regulatory approval applicant\xe2\x80\x99s profile and server speed 6) Subject to the regulatory approval and efficiency of banks 13 \x0cLIBRA CREDIT Since it is lower than the minimum maintenance margin of 125% required by Libra Credit a margin call to Bob is triggered by the smart contract This will inform him via APP notification SMS or email to either deposit additional XYZ Tokens (or equivalent LBA Tokens) or make a loan payment to meet the maintenance margin at 125% Bob will be given enough time to meet the maintenance margin subject to the velocity of the XYZ Token value The quicker the price drops the shorter the time Bob has to respond Default \xe2\x80\x93 If Bob is unable or unwilling to meet the minimum maintenance margin during his allocated time the Libra Credit will initiate an automated liquidation of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s assets All liquidated assets will be used for loan repayment and minimum margin maintenance In this example 44 4% of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s XYZ will be sold and the CTL ratio will return to 125% Incremental liquidation will occur if XYZ continues to depreciate in the future Similarly in a crypto to stablecoin lending all steps remain the same except disbursement (step 5) Instead of fiat distribution stablecoins (e g DAI from MakerDAO) will be deposited directly to borrowers\xe2\x80\x99 e wallet During the loan period borrowers need to repay stablecoins (e g DAI) in agreed frequency and when the value of collaterals drops borrowers need to deposit more collateral or make stablecoin repayments 14 \x0cLIBRA CREDIT 3 1 3 Competitive Advantage Compared to existing digital lending models Libra Credit differentiates itself

through their mobile application A developed mobile application is already in testing to facilitate crypto to crypto loans (From Left to Right Credit application pledge crypto collateral stable coin deposit receipt) To facilitate efficient asset exchange and bring in crypto providers a separate integration gateway is built to connect the Libra Lending Platform with exchange network (e g Radar Relay and DDEX) and stable coin providers (e g MakerDAO) For exchange networks and stablecoin providers integration details please refer to B1 19 \x0cOUR TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIP NETWORK ACCESS INTEGRATION B In order for Libra Credit to operate as a full ecosystem our partnership networks have to be properly integrated To ensure quality and contribution of our various partnership networks the information flow in and out of Libra Credit will be governed by our Joint Modelling and Open Data smart contract detailed in D Smart Contract Suites B1 Exchange Networks and Stablecoin Providers Our exchange partnership networks (e g Radar Relay and DDEX) and stablecoin providers (i e MakerDAO) are connected through an integration gateway identified as B1 In particular stable coin providers can be programmed using Web3 js and Infura Below is a demonstration of an integration call sequence with MakerDAO 1 4 Borrowers 5 2 Libra Lending Platform 3 6 Libra Credit and MakerDAO Operation Flow 1 Borrower pledges crypto to borrow MakerDAO stablecoin \xe2\x80\x98DAI\xe2\x80\x99 2 Libra lending platform opens an account with MakerDAO and pledges ETH as collateral (MakerDAO only accepts ETH) 3 MakerDAO transfers DAI to Libra lending platform 4 DAI is disbursed from Libra lending platform to borrower 5 DAI is repaid from borrower to Libra lending platform 6 Libra lending platform returns the required DAI and closes the account with MakerDAO 20 \x0cOUR TECHNOLOGY In addition Libra Credit can integrate with 0x protocol based decentralized exchanges (DEX) to approve access to standard ERC 20 collateral token A demonstration of an integration call sequence with 0x based DEX (e g Radar Relay and DDEX) is shown below Ethereum Blockchain 3 1 2 Borrowers 4 Stable Token DEX Taker Libra Credit Network 8 5 7 0x based DEX (e g Radar Relay and DDEX ) 6 6 Collateral Token Libra Credit and 0x based DEX (e g Radar Relay and DDEX) Operation Flow 1 LBA borrower creates a loan request with ERC20 collateral token for stable token at agreed terms 2 LBA borrower sends loan request to Libra Credit and makes ERC20 collateral deposit 3 Once the loan request is approved Libra Credit will forward this request in the form of a 0x exchange order to DEX Taker 4 DEX Taker approves the request and accesses its balance of stable token 5 DEX Taker then submits the Libra signed order to DEX partners such as Radar Relay and DDEX 6 DEX partners will authenticates Libra signature verifies that the order has not expired verified that the order has not already been filled and then transfers the collateral token into stable token 7 DEX partners (e g Radar Relay and DDEX) send stable token to Libra Credit 8 Libra Credit disburses the stable token to borrower 21 \x0cOUR TECHNOLOGY B2 Open APIs for E wallet Partnership Network E wallet partners can be used natively by borrowers to store and transfer their cryptocurrencies and fiat (depending on compatibility) with the best possible rate the Libra Credit can offer E Wallet partners are connected to the Libra Credit Platform through open APIs governed by one of the smart contract suites detailed in D Smart Contract Suites B3 API Plug in

BASED CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK C The AI based Credit Assessment Framework leverages raw data from a variety of sources to compute an optimized result for each individual borrower using a proven mathematical algorithm The result is purely computed mainly based on two variables \xe2\x80\x93 credit score and collateral grade \xe2\x80\x93 as follows Credit Score A comprehensive persona is created by collecting data from the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s mobile application behavior application profile social network banking history and matching entries from credit rating providers These raw data points are then consolidated and computed using machine learning algorithms consisting of Logistic Regression Modelling with features extracted from the Deep Neural Network and Ensemble Learning build using a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) architecture This proven and efficient credit scoring algorithm has enabled Libra Credit to be able to achieve historical loan default rate average of 3 5% The credit score is computed mathematically as follows 23 \x0cOUR TECHNOLOGY Collateral Grade Libra Credit has developed an in house machine learning algorithm that generates a collateral grade score The system adopts WebCrawler \xe2\x80\x93 a technology that automatically analyses trading history Github repositories blockchain explorers media reports social network data speculative information and cryptocurrency forum discussions to form a comprehensive collateral report By combining our grading system with traditional volatility measures a collateralization rate (between 0 and 1) is calculated to represent a volatility estimate of the crypto asset(s) pledged by a specific borrower If the collateralization rate is less than 1 it indicates that the collateral will be valued at a discount Our Deep Learning valuation capabilities are tested against historical Bitcoin data sets with a proven statistical significance The AI based credit assessment framework directly feeds HASH data to the Ethereum main net through the Libra Credit DApp ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN INTERACTION AND SMART CONTRACT SUITES D Libra Credit leverages the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate two major types of smart contracts \xe2\x80\x93 Retail Lending and Joint Open Access Modelling To optimize storage efficiency cost and speed other information such as customer profile and loan detailed data is stored with encryption offchain on D2 with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol 24 \x0cOUR TECHNOLOGY Libra Credit\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract suite on Ethereum features the following 1 Retail Lending Smart Contract Suite The retail lending smart contract is coded in a manner that simultaneously combats market volatility while stabilizing the pledged collateral The retail lending smart contract adopts the features of Alert Watermark Guard (\xe2\x80\x9cAWL\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x93 a layered mechanism that stabilizes the asset liquidity and collection effectiveness in the case that a borrower defaults on his / her loan Paired with Smart Automated Reaction (\xe2\x80\x9cSAR\xe2\x80\x9d) the retail lending smart contract can be automatically triggered to perform hedging against systematic risks AWL and SAR works together as follows Define r loan Initial collateral to loan (\xe2\x80\x9cCTL\xe2\x80\x9d) ratio (~150% 130% depending on specific collateral and borrower credit score) r min Minimum CTL ratio when a margin call is triggered (~110% to reduce loan risk) r alert CTL ratio between r loan and r min where automated reactions to market movement will intervene if enabled by borrowers (larger r alert means more responsive reactions) Collateral value increase current CTL would increase and borrower can withdraw some collateral (withdrawal is limited during the entire loan span) must maintain r loan Collateral value decrease responses dependent on pre defined strategy and current CTL (e g borrower can choose to enable or disable SAR with respect to his/her own risk preference ) 25 \x0cOUR TECHNOLOGY Alert Watermark Guard Algorithm Repeat this routine at a pre defined interval (~10 minutes) for each outstanding loan { { r=current CTL if (r<=r min) then Emergency margin call to add collateral or collateral auction to keep r=r loan else if (r>=r loan) then Borrower could partially withdraw collateral and maintain r=r loan else if (r min<r<=r alert & SAR enabled) then Transform partial collateral to stable coin to maintain r>r alert } [Note1] SAR only takes effect within pre defined N days before repayment due day e g N = 7 Larger N usually means more responsive SAR [Note2] If the borrower defaults an add on fee will be added to final amount due and additional collateral may be automatically deducted 2 Joint Open Access Modelling Smart Contract Suite Open Data Smart Contract \xe2\x80\x93 Third parties (i e financial institutions regulators etc ) may access through open API plug ins governed by the Open Data Smart Contract The smart contract is open source and built with a standard Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI) that enables connected parties to share and query data on chain All data on the system is processed and verified to ensure regulatory compliance Data query volumes are strictly limited dependent on previously contributed data An experimental code snippet for the Open Data Smart Contract is attached to the appendix for reference 26 \x0cOUR TECHNOLOGY Joint Modelling \xe2\x80\x93 To effectively manage risk regarding third party access Libra Credit will adopt a holistic solution involving Joint Modelling with other data providers data labelers and modelling hackers A Smart Scoring Contract will be developed covering all aspects of the risk evaluation lifecycle Additional risk is managed using validation tests whereby A/B Tests (split testing) and champion challenges will be conducted before any thirdparty can participate in joint modelling on the main chain In addition to synergies generated for both parties using Joint Modelling outstanding contributors will be rewarded Token(s) for their contributions 27 \x0cOUR TEAM 3 3 OUR TEAM Lu Hua \xe2\x80\x93 Co Founder & CEO Payments
