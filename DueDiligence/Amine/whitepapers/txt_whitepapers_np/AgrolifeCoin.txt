Advantages over other cryptocurrencies The social network Roadmap Conclusions Legal Note Links \x0cThe Primary Sector Curre nt and Future In the near 2050 more than 9700 million of humans will populate the Earth It is estimated that the demand for food will increase by 70% for that year and that at least 80 billion dollars of annual investment will be necessary to respond to said demand That means that all the production processes have to be not only much more efficient but also the rest of the points of the distribution chain must be tuned as the most precise clock in the world Nothing can be wasted and therefore we have to take advantage of every last gram of food produced What most makes us think is that today we do not know if we will be able to produce such amount of food Surely we can only respond to that demand if we adopt more technological and efficient means of production We must also change the relationship between the producer and the consumer avoiding that (according to UN estimates) 50% of the value of the product remains in the distribution network and not in the hands of the producer According to estimates food demand will increase by 70% by 2050 and at least $ 80 billion annually in investments will be needed to meet this demand most of which is expected to come from the private sector \x0cThe AgrolifeCoin Market Government policies often prove to be ineffective and may in fact create impediments to offer financial The direct market of AgrolifeCoin are all people and company that wish to invest in products with a great potential for growth in particular those that are related to the primary sector from any of its aspects The AgrolifeCoin system grows thanks to the efforts of multiple stakeholders in our cryptocurrency and in our project So far it has been funded by a group of cofounders and the AgrolifeCoin team It aims to be the alternative to financial institutions in developing countries to improve credit capacities in the agricultural sector It should not ignore the fact that the primary sector environment is generated an important parallel economic activity which has to do with other sectors such as transport technical economic and legal advice biotechnology or creation of means of production If the agricultural sector is of great importance in developed countries in those that are still developing this importance is even greater In these environments agriculture is the true axis that supports the subsistence of the population (in 2005 it occupied between 18 and 22% of the active population and today almost 40%) reduces poverty creates jobs and resources energetics to self supply the activity The majority of farmers in these countries also lack consolidated financial systems and that can able to support large agricultural extension projects The most important source of funding comes from corporate initiatives and is often limited and ineffective All this makes them perfect scenarios to apply the project and its AgrolifeCoin currency Currently intense work sessions are being held with groups in countries in Europe Africa and Latin America to promote the project \x0cThe Agrolife Coin Market

AgrolifeCoin comes to innovative ecosystem of criptomonedas focused and based on the primary sector mainly agriculture AgrolifeCoin will invest in this type of companies as part of its mission to catalyze the economic growth of the activity Its commitment is to increase the amount of capital available for development and improvements in this global sector The need to invest in agriculture is not only due to the growth of the world\ s population but also to the change of the food preferences of the middle class in emerging markets towards foods of higher quality and value AgrolifeCoin is an alternative form of payment to the current media in the value chain of the products generated by this economic activity It will bring producers and consumers giving support to online markets in which the use of this cryptocurrency will facilitate a more just relationship between both There is a clear imbalance between the portfolio of loans from the banking sector to agriculture and its contribution to GDP This limits investment in agriculture by farmers and agricultural enterprises It also shows that the loan barrier is not due to a lack of liquidity in the banking sector but rather a lack of willingness to extend loans to agriculture AgrolifeCoin seeks to mitigate the effects of this imbalance \x0cThe Agrolifecoin Mission AgrolifeCoin wants to take to any corner of the world the possibility that people can access a platform of products and services in a practical and efficient way AgrolifeCoin mission is to help all people worldwide to use a fast economic and safe payment system It will help in the development of the villages providing great benefits to The objective is to make AgrolifeCoin be used as an alternative means of producers and consumers of agricultural products It will reduce significantly the commissions that are paid for the purchase of said products It will provide the sector with all the benefits related to its support technology Blockchain It will promote the use of this technology in the traceability from the producer to the consumer of these products also allowing their payment in a reliable way for both The key objective is to create a global transparent efficient and safe ecosystem that allows agricultural and food companies to significantly reduce expenses related to production sales and logistics of the food we consume today It will establish a more just and direct relationship between producers and consumers offering everyone access to a wider and more varied range of products The objective is to make AgrolifeCoin be used as an alternative means of payment for international commercial transactions AgrolifeCoin has come to stay Our mission is to be the first cryptocurrency for the purchase of Agricultural Products and Tools We strive to offer value to investors while providing opportunities for growth and enrichment to our users and our business partners always striving for honesty justice and integrity \x0cScope of Application AgrolifeCoin provide s several approache s for its use and application Capital and financial asset It can be used as a saving and investment instrument Digital platform It is the asset that supports the economic activity of the AgrolifeCoin social network on the other hand the network itself contributes to the rise in the value of the currency Exchange medium It will be redeemable for FIAT money or other cryptocurrencies through digital exchange houses Customized payment system It can be used for the purchase of goods and services worldwide Marketing Solutions It will significantly improve the channels and marketing processes of the products reducing the intermediaries in the value chain increasing profits in a very significant way A farmer has different tools hoes harvesters tractors AgrolifeCoin Itis also a tool to facilitate and make more profitable your work \x0cCharacteristics of AgrolifeCoin The most outstanding characteristics of AgrolifeCoin are Descentralized It is not under the control of any public or private entity understand these as Companies or States The legislations are local but the scope of the currency is worldwide hence the impossibility of being controlled In the case of some cryptocurrencies it is the network itself through mining that is in charge of generating new currencies according to demand whereas in the case of AgrolifeCoin the currencies are pre mined and this has a clear deflationist effect Private AgrolifeCoin allows you to conduct the knowledge or approval of trusted third parties transactions without Direct No intermediaries Transactions are made directly from person to person this operation and the practical absence of intermediation make transactions instantaneous and with minimal cost (almost nonexistent) Anonymous The AgrolifeCoin Ecosystem is totally anonymous It is not necessary to reveal your identity when doing business and this is one of the main characteristics of our currency Safe The money belongs to you 100% It can not be intervened by anyone and the accounts can not be frozen or seized Economic The cost per transaction with AgrolifeCoin is lower than that of any bank worldwide Fast Fast The fact that the coin is pre mined makes that transactions with AgrolifeCoin system are almost instantaneous \x0cSecurity The transactions are guaranteed by the underlying technology the Blockchain When the transaction is made to a recipient we have absolute certainty that this will be the case and not another one who receives our payment On this point we must say that different systems of trust have been tested that guarantee the agreement between the parties in case of having to correct some transaction error in the transactions AgrolifeCoin is not subject to the intermediation of third parties it is based on pointto point transactions between the one who transfers the money and the one who receives it Use a string of classic blockchain in which the transactions are public but SHA256 encryption is used to secure them It is impossible to falsify or duplicate the use of advanced cryptography techniques that prevent such a fact The network on which it is supported and the wallets have important security measures such as verifications in two phases or encryption by key pairs All this guarantees that AgrolifeCoin coins are used legitimately The download wallets and the Web have been audited by computer security companies to ensure a high level of security against hacker attacks or malicious uses Security is one of our main concerns when designing and deploying any of our solutions Our prestige as a company goes in it \x0cPrivacy The technology of AgrolifeCoin allows you to send transactions completely anonymously In currencies based on the SHA256 Algorithm you can know which coins are spent and which are not this is known as UTXO Through the AgrolifeCoin wallet there is an optimal level of anonymity making the work of tracking transactions complex In the current banking model the level of privacy granted to its users is limited since access to the information of the parties involved will always be audited by a trusted third party The need to keep track of transactions in our systems is not incompatible with the need to preserve the anonymity of the parties involved This is the privacy model promoted by Blockchain the transactions are audited without being able to identify the people who carry them out AgrolifeCoin does not keep any data on its servers that allows it to identify the people who carry out the transactions It does not keep any personal data on which explicit consent has not been given for its use as required by the LOPD \x0cThecnology of Agrolife Coin Technical Data WAVES PLATFORM Token

who purchase the PRO subscription in the social network will give away 10000 Tokens The rest is maintained by the company to cover and give coins in the credit swap of the social network \x0cFunds Allocation Here is the detail how the Agrolifecoin\xe2\x80\x99s funds will be allocated \x0cThecnology of Agrolife Coin Wallets AgrolifeCoin wallets are available in the following operating systems and repositories Windows MacO s Linux OnLine Git What is a wallet A purse or wallet is a software to store save receive and send your cryptocurrencies in an encrypted and therefore secure way The wallets can be compatible with a single cryptocurrency such as official portfolios or on the other hand multi crypto portfolios commonly created by third parties The portfolio also acts as a ledger for your transactions How does a wallet work We started by contradicting a bit the purse definition since cryptocurrencies or tokens are stored in your private key and not in your wallet The private key is a 100% sure code that you can only know and a public key a public code that is responsible for indicating the amount of cryptocurrencies or tokens that your private key or wallet has The security of the portfolios is developed on a public / private key pair The ownership of your private key gives you full control over your cryptocurrencies associated with their corresponding public keys so it is extremely important that only you know your private keys We suggest using portfolios in the cloud for people with less experience such as the one that AgrolifeCoin provides IMPORTANT It is convenient to download the wallets from the official pages and distrust those that promise profits not reflected in the White Papers of the projects that endorse them Never share your password and even less your private key Store them in a safe place \x0cAgrolife Coin and the Blockchain Ecosystem The literal translation is chain of blocks They can be one or several interconnected or not Broadly speaking it is a large database ordered distributed among several participants called nodes which contains all the operations carried out by each of them This solution acquires value in transactions that require security and transparency without the need of ntermediaries Simplifying we could say that Blockchain is a cryptographically distributed and secure network for storing information AgrolifeCoin is a peer to peer Internet currency that allows instant payments almost at zero cost for anyone in the world AgrolifeCoin is an open source the global payment network that is totally decentralized from the central institutions Mathematical algorithms secure the network and allow people to control their own finances \x0cAgrolife Coin and the Blockchain Ecosystem In the system two types of participants are distinguished Those who send or receive transactions People who have AgrolifeCoin and use it to buy and pay for something and validation of Processing transactions Computer generated equipments are responsible for resolving and validating operations There is a network of computers designed to guarantee the integrity of the data of each transaction Once the data has been validated transactions are included in a block of the chain All the processing done by the computers to validate the transactions implies an important use of energy This cost is paid by those who transact and has the name of fee In the case of AgrolifeCoin this fee is insignificant It is important to note that what is paid is not related to the amount sent That is if we send 100 USD or 100 000 USD with a fee of 5 USD the chances of both being validated and included in a block as fast as possible are equal Although these fees are lower than what one pays to move money through the banking system we must pay them every time we want to make a transaction with AgrolifeCoin It should be noted that the currency is pre mined and this makes these fees very low AgrolifeCoin uses the Blockchain to create an electronic money system peer to peer Allows the sending of payments between both parties directly without the need for banks or financial institutions \x0cBenefits of Agrolife Coin Without Bank account Without the need of bank accounts you can make your transactions to pay for the products you Low cost per transfer Your transfers will have a cost per transaction much cheaper than any banking agency Payments from mobile devices You can use your mobile to make payments in a comfortable and safe way Fast transaction The blockchain system makes operations much faster and safer Opportunity With AgrolifeCoin you can participate in bonuses affiliate program staking generating in this way active and passive income to the users of the currency Multiplatform wallet for mobile and desktop The social network will make alliances with companies that generate safe and reliable payment tools through our cryptocurrency Recieve and Send AgrolifeCoin with QR code All Affiliates will have their payment gateway e commerce wallets and cashiers for Currency Exchange \x0cWaves Network Structure The structure of the peer to peer network impacts the security and performance of crypto currencies A geographically clustered network can quickly propagate a new block to many other nodes This makes it more difficult for a malicious miner to propagate conflicting blocks/transactions quicker than honest nodes However a less clustered network may mean that full nodes are being run by a wider variety of users which is also good for decentralization Waves has a peer to peer network for disseminating block and transaction information Any computer running blockchain software is considered a node of that blockchain Waves also contain full nodes allowing anyone to take part in the decentralized process of block creation The Waves full node serves two critical roles 1 To relay blocks and transactions to miners 2 To answer queries for end users about the state of the blockchain \x0cThe Importance of a Full Node The job of a full node is to store the blockchain data pass along the data to other nodes and ensure newly added blocks are valid Validation entails ensuring that the format of the block is correct all hashes in the new block were computed correctly the new block contains the hash of the previous block and each transaction in the block is valid and signed by the appropriate parties Waves also contain full nodes allowing anyone to take part in the decentralized process of block creation Full nodes may also act as mining nodes (i e generating new blocks) The mining node checks that each transaction is self valid since the other nodes would reject the block if it included invalid transactions Any node may propose new transactions and these proposed transactions are propagated between nodes until they are eventually added to a block \x0cWhy invest in Agrolife Coin AgrolifeCoin is the first digital system that has its own social network and integrated payment platform which will incorporate smart projects in its Blockchain By having the backing of legally constituted companies our cryptocurrency will generate confidence in future

the loss of value of FIAT money and the monetary policies that tend to devalue these currencies to improve for example the export capacity \x0cWhy invest in Agrolife Coin Experience shows us that

time There are crucial factors to consider when investing and we want you to know that AgrolifeCoin meets them Acceptability It is very important when investing in a cryptographic asset knowing where
