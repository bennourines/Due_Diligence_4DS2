\x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners Digital Asset Management Industry Status Challenges Regulatory Confusion \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners Industry Status In recent years with digital assets such as Bitcoin gradually entering the mainstream view its influence has been increasing day by day It has become an asset category that institutions and individuals cannot ignore The total market value has reached a maximum of 800 billion US dollars With the gradual enrichment of digital assets there are more and more value creating activities related to it The management of digital assets is one of them Against this background the digital assets fund (token fund) has sprung up around the globe According to incomplete statistics the current number of digital asset funds has reached hundreds worldwide and the asset management scale is nearly 5 billion US dollars We believe that with the institutionalize and professionalize of investors in the digital asset market the construction of infrastructure of this industry will become the focus of market \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners Challenges Reduced threshold In the era of digital assets as the access threshold for digital funds is reduced fund managers do not have to undergo qualification verification and only need one wallet address to accept and manage funds from all over the world leading to a mixed bag of chaos in the digital asset management industry Lack of Regulation Digital asset fund is an emerging industry There is no corresponding industry regulation The internal operations of funds are not transparent to investors The lack of information disclosure and external audit can not effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors Backward Tools Conflict of Interests The management tools of digital asset funds are relatively primitive and backward Most management teams use basic Office softwares such as Word and Excel and wallet applications for records The accounting is inconvenient and the efficiency is very low Participating parties in the field of digital asset management include regulatory institutions fund managers investors and fund custodians etc The interests of all parties are not the same At present there is no mechanism for coordinating the appeals of all parties \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners Regulatory Confusion Lags and di\xef\xac\x80erences in regulations The formulation of laws and regulations generally lags behind the economic and social development Both digital assets and digital asset funds are emerging industries The legislative bodies of most countries have not yet issued corresponding regulations and even if regulations are introduced they fail to reach a consensus Regulatory Di\xef\xac\x83culty Digital assets have the property of \xe2\x80\x9cself financing\xe2\x80\x9d In theory the issuance and trading of assets can bypass the traditional financial system and supervision is difficult High Regulatory Costs Traditionally most of the fund\ s supervision has adopted territorial jurisdiction but blockchain technology has such features as cross temporal cross subject and international Fund managers can easily avoid oversight by migrating their registration sites to third countries The cost of cross national jurisdiction is too high Lack of Popular Recognition The purpose of supervision is to protect the legitimate interests of investors but driven by interests most people lack the sense of participation and recognition of supervision Therefore it is necessary for fund managers to be \xe2\x80\x9cself disciplined\xe2\x80\x9d in addition to the \xe2\x80\x9cself regulation\xe2\x80\x9d of the industry \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners HASHGARD Origin of Philosophy Ecosystem Beyond THE DAO Technical Architecture Development Roadmap Core Concepts Economic System \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners Origin of Philosophy Autonomous organization refers to a group of interdependent trustees who organize themselves and conduct self governance so that they can achieve lasting common benefits in the event that everyone faces free riders evades responsibility or other opportunism The problem that must be solved is how to combine the variables namely (1) increase the initial possibility of autonomous organization (2) enhance people\ s capacity for continuous self organization (3) enhance capability to solve the problem of public ponds by self organization without some kind of external assistance \xe2\x80\x94 Elinor Ostrom Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in \xe2\x80\x9cGoverning the Commons Compared to self governing organizations the DAO is a further organizational structure consisting of a group of people who share the same ideas and have common goals and operates and selfgoverned through blockchain and smart contracts In the DAO individuals are equal the implementation of the rules and the changes in the rules themselves are accomplished through smart contracts \x0cDigital \xe6\x95\xb0\xe5\xad\x97\xe8\xb5\x84\xe4\xba\xa7\xe7\x90\x86\xef\xa7\xa4\xe5\xbf\xb5 Finance

International Monetary Fund For assets such as digital assets that have a \xe2\x80\x9cself financing\xe2\x80\x9d nature An effective way of supervision is to use the blockchain technology that carries it to supervise This is the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctreating fire with fire\xe2\x80\x9d \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners The DAO\xef\xbc\x9athe exploration of decentralized asset management The DAO Centralized Fund Manager In the traditional asset management business fund managers make profit through the management of funds from investors Advantages Funds are managed by experienced professional fund managers with high operation efficiency Disadvantages The operation of assets is not transparent and it is easy to breed corruption and damage the interests of investors VS In April 2016 the smart contract crowdfunding application on Ethereum \xe2\x80\x93 the DAO \xe2\x80\x93 explored decentralized asset management The DAO has designed mechanisms for guardians whitelisting proposals voting DAO forks and fund transfer to implement decentralized decisionmaking for crowdfunding and asset protection for investors \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners The DAO\xef\xbc\x9adesign flaws eventually aborted Defect A The DAO adopts voting as a decision making mechanism and lacks a professional fund manager The decision making is inefficient and not professional enough Defect B The smart contract of the DAO hosts the user\xe2\x80\x99s funds and structurally the use and hosting of the funds are not separated which makes it vulnerable to attacks Defect C The algorithm design of the DAO smart contract is defective making it in favor of users who are inclined to up vote and suppress the opposition \x0cDigital

stolen The Ethereum community had to recoup its losses through a hard fork This event directly led to an ideology split on Ethereum and some members did not accept changing transaction history through the hard fork which eventually produced a parallel version ETC In July 2017 SEC of the US issued the investigation report of the DAO incident It is believed that the DAO token is securities in nature and should comply with the federal securities laws We realize that many problems in the digital asset management field cannot be solved by just building a crowdfunding smart contract on Ethereum We urgently need more realistic solutions \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners HASHGARD\xef\xbc\x9afrom and beyond the DAO Hashgard fully absorbed the asset autonomy thought in the DAO and improved it We believe that in the digital asset management industry in the future the centralized and decentralized organizational forms exist at the same time The \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized asset autonomy\xe2\x80\x9d explored by the DAO is one of its forms but it is not the only one Hashgard will combine the concepts of centralization and semicentralization to establish a better digital asset management ecosystem from the perspectives of regulation and self discipline \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners HASHGARD Core Concept \xe2\x80\xa2 Advanced DAO autonomy digital assets based on blockchain technology have characteristics such as crosstemporal cross subject and anonymity Traditional supervision is difficult and costly At this stage the introduction of blockchain\ s core self governance can really help the industry promote self discipline and standardization \xe2\x80\xa2 Distributed inclusive finance Hashgard can empower the design and issuance of distributed digital financial products and enable global investors to participate based on their risk preferences so we can truly achieve distributed inclusive finance \xe2\x80\xa2 Code level contract regulation Hashgard consists of a series of smart contract portfolios tailored for asset management Fund managers custodians third party organizations etc upon appointment by investors are subject to corresponding restrictions based on smart contracts \xe2\x80\xa2 Operational Level Data On Chain & Privacy Protection Operational level data in Hashgard cannot be tampered and will be cryptographically protected Fund managers and other fund raising parties on one hand will have their key business data encrypted and stored through private keys which will only be open to authorized person on the other hand they can disclose investment decisions risk management account management financial management and other operational level data to their investors to prove the truth and credibility of performance \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners HASHGARD Ecological System Decision Making Process & Organizations Digital Asset Fund Trading DAO Community Building

Architecture \xe2\x80\xa2 As the underlying infrastructure of the digital financial industry Hashgard has a complete distributed ledger technology system including distributed network technologies consensus mechanisms smart contracts application layer interfaces(API) and etc \xe2\x80\xa2 Hashgard fully considered the need for the protection and transaction of many different types of assets in the future when designing the system and technically supports the cross chain interaction of various public chains \xe2\x80\xa2 Hashgard engages with eco partners such as decentralized data storage decentralized asset custody decentralized asset issuance and decentralized asset lending Hashgard connects with eco partners on lower layer interfaces to support developers to build various application services under different scenarios \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners HASHGARD Economic System \xe2\x80\xa2 Purpose of deposit within the Hashgard system in such scenarios as issuance of fund equity asset creating a DAO and a DAC etc user are required to freeze tokens generated by the system as deposit When users violate the agreement the corresponding deposit will be deducted by the smart contract for punishment \xe2\x80\xa2 Purpose of burning GAS the Hashgard token will be used as GAS for trading fuel partially distributed to consensus nodes and partially allocated to contract creators to motivate the community \xe2\x80\xa2 Ecological building purpose The Hashgard Foundation will distribute token reward to DAPP developers based on criteria such as fund management practices smart contract creation and usage to encourage more users to participate in the digital finance ecosystem \xe2\x80\xa2 Token appreciation logic the total amount of tokens generated by Hashgard system is fixed Therefore the total economic value of the community will be greater with more users at the same time more tokens are frozen resulting in a continuous reduction in the amount of liquidity while the demand is increasing resulting in an increase in expected value of tokens \x0cDigital Finance Hashgard Team and Partners HASHGARD Token Distribution \xe2\x80\xa2
