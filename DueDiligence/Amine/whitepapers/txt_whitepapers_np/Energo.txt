b Decentralized Autonomous Energy System \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Abstract Built for a future DAE (Decentralized Autonomous Energy Community) Energo is an ecosystem based on decentralized apps At its core are Qtum and a decentralized system designed for the measurement registries transactions and settlement of clean energy in local Micro grids This document envisions a peer to peer DAE community (Decentralized Autonomous Energy Community) where the Energo system is embedded with a cryptocurrency TSL and where owners of this cryptocurrency are entitled to access to the distributed energy storage system Energo is designed for a new future of energy production and consumption It connects energy producers of varying capacities and energy consumers of diverse needs Clean energy is consumed \xef\xac\x81rst within the community energy e\xef\xac\x83ciency and reliability are increased intermediaries of energy trading are eliminated energy producers and retailers experience pro\xef\xac\x81t boosts energy users see their cost slashed With such a vision in mind Energo is to channel the physical construction informational structure and value system of the future smart grids and help bring about a truly decentralized autonomous energy community Energo also o\xef\xac\x80ers a solution to machine to machine energy demand Electric vehicles of tomorrow will apply its digital ID and digital wallet on the block chain to pay for the electricity it receives at any given charging station Both the charging and payment process can be done unattended The e\xef\xac\x83ciency of clean energy supply and consumption in any given community can also be maximized \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Backdrop The electric power industry is undergoing profound changes as we move from a centralized generation system to a decentralized smaller scale production model If such a trend continues every household will have a power generating facility(ie PV or CHP) installed in the near future Those facilities will generate enough electricity to meet household demands and supply local communities with the surplus Energy trading may thus be prompted with such a capacity enjoyed by a large number of households Imagine a future where every household has installed PV and enjoyed a power surplus which can be supplied to other users When electricity is traded within the local community costs of distributing power building transmission lines and expanding generation capacity will be signi\xef\xac\x81cantly decreased What\xe2\x80\x99s more such a future would fundamentally transform the renewable energy landscape where resources and capacities are unevenly distributed Power surplus will be consumed within the local community \xef\xac\x81rst while being complementary to the original power source The renewable energy sector relies heavily on subsidies from pro clean energy governments but these subsides are dwindling with Germany already pulling out its subsidy Prosumers pro\xef\xac\x81ts are slashed They sell at low prices to utility companies which in turn sell to customers at a marked up price reaping most of the pro\xef\xac\x81ts Against such a backdrop a new solution independent of subsidies and guided by rules of the free market is much needed An electricity market where free trading happens bene\xef\xac\x81ts all stake holders [1] Such a market is a double edged sword in itself though challenging and presenting new opportunities to traditional power grids businesses and operations [2] Our vision for a future where solar and wind power production and electric vehicles consumption are the norm is to \xef\xac\x81nd better solutions to manage a massive decentralized future energy grid which can in times be unreliable Such a vision allows participants to maximize the use of electricity generated locally and delivers evident bene\xef\xac\x81ts cutting power distribution cost and energy loss managing local power grid better eventually leading to decentralized autonomous \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs energy communities that sit at the hearts of future smart grids and smart cities This future also demonstrates how the development of market economy and civic society can go hand in hand When citizens take the initiative to promote renewable energy and display innovation in the process the nation succeeds in its supply end reform in the energy sector and develops renewable energy equipment and storage Through the Energo network or DAE community such a vision comes to life The network encompasses interconnected small scale grids which operate in a larger region Advanced information technologies combined with new energy technology such as blockchain IOT AI electric vehicles energy storage technologies micro grids integrate real time \xef\xac\x82ow of power information and value transfer among producers and consumers in a complex decentralized system where energy is traded and

serves to bridge the bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystem and channel the blockchain world to the physical world Qtum system di\xef\xac\x80ers from smart contract platforms underpinned by POW a consensus protocol constrained by resources and hardware and thus unlikely to scale up Consensus mechanism is innately \xef\xac\x82awed due to a lack of \xef\xac\x82exibility which can be problematic because public blockchain and consortium blockchain are accessed by di\xef\xac\x80erent entities and thus exert di\xef\xac\x80erent requirements on consensus Whereas Qtum system with both Qtum public blockchain and Qtum consortium blockchain is more \xef\xac\x82exible Qtum public blockchain given its degree of decentralization low threshold for participation secure environment and reliability adopts the POS based IPOS Qtum consortium blockchain restricted by pre selected nodes participated by known counterparties and subject to di\xef\xac\x80erent consideration for consensus adopts a blended mechanism of Proof of Time and Raft agreement to optimize computing power in any given trusted network Another \xef\xac\x82aw of current blockchain systems is that they are rather locked down Most of the smart contracts have their triggering events from within the blockchain system itself instead of the outside world There\xe2\x80\x99s a lack of interaction with the physical world With Qtum system however things are di\xef\xac\x80erent Oracle and Data Feed featured in the system enable data in the physical world to be triggering events breaking the closed loop of smart contracts Energo is a consortium blockchain with myriads of the future distributed energy storage equipment as its full nodes Energo consortium blockchain developed in the Qtum system can better guarantee the security stability and partial decentralization of the entire DAE ecosystem It boasts superb capacity to handle the massive energy information \xef\xac\x82ow and value transfer With commitment to DAE development Energo is focused on operations applying blockchain technology \xef\xac\x81rst to the energy sector \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Token Energo energy asset WATT Energo ecosystem asset TSL WATT is a blockchain based digital asset Its TSL (Tesla) represents its owner\xe2\x80\x99s access to value is backed by energy each WATT token power in distributed energy storage equipment represents 1KWh of actual energy stored in micro Future prosumers and electricity users must own grids or distributed energy storage equipment TSL in order to store electricity in energy

operation on current electric power system and introduce into it a new grid structure That\xe2\x80\x99s how micro grid comes to the picture Micro grid is a highly autonomous and \xef\xac\x82exible energy network able to either work in parallel with national grid or in isolation It also integrates the distributed energy generated in a given community signi\xef\xac\x81cantly promotes energy utilization and o\xef\xac\x80ers excellent reliability At its core is an energy storage system which through voltage and band management achieves stable and quality power supply renewable energy generation and management The storage system facilitates peer to peer energy transfer (i e consumers can purchase stored energy contributed by prosumers) Combining IOT facilities that meet measurement requirements and technology standards of multiple countries for measurement and communication the system has what it takes to bring about a decentralized autonomous energy community Energo is designed to facilitate renewable energy consumption maximizing the trading of produced and stored energy and utilization of energy storage system Therefore unlike traditional micro grids it prioritizes the use of renewable energy in the local community with traditional grids playing a complementary role supplying the whole region with its backup energy storage FUTURE OF MICROGRIDS\xef\xbc\x9ahttps //www

Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Decentralized Energy Exchanges Trading Platform The foundation stone of any decentralized energy system is the capability of the di\xef\xac\x80erent peers within the network to freely exchange the energy they produce and consume This process of settlement is traditionally de\xef\xac\x81ned as a trading There are di\xef\xac\x80erent kinds of trading mechanisms being used worldwide for di\xef\xac\x80erent kind of business products and services One of the key points of a trading mechanism is the pricing mechanism A pricing mechanism de\xef\xac\x81nes the principles and processes for which products and services prices are negotiated between the price asked buyers (commonly referenced as \xe2\x80\x9cask\xe2\x80\x9d price) and the price bided by sellers (commonly referenced as \xe2\x80\x9cbid\xe2\x80\x9d price) Three of the most common ones are auction reverse auction and stock markets mechanisms The auction pricing mechanism is commonly used by online platforms such as eBay and o\xef\xac\x84ine for art selling Sellers setup a minimum price for which they are willing to sell their product or service and buyers try to outbid each other to win the auction The buyer willing to pay the highest price for the auctioned item within the auctioning time will proceed to acquire the item and pay the bidding price to the seller If no bids are made no transactions will be made Auctions are a great mechanism to maximize the price a seller can obtain for a speci\xef\xac\x81c product or service and is good for products or services with many buyers but few sellers The reverse auction pricing mechanism is commonly used by governments and companies to outsource services In a reverse auction the buyer de\xef\xac\x81nes a maximum bidding price and de\xef\xac\x81nes the product or service it requires Sellers interested to win the contract will o\xef\xac\x80er their product or service at a given ask price Once all interested sellers provide their asking prices the contract will be rewarded to the seller with the minimum asking price that ful\xef\xac\x81lls the contract requirements This is a great mechanism to minimize the price a buyer is expected to pay and is good for products or services with many sellers but few buyers The Stock Market pricing mechanism is commonly used by world wide stock markets and currency exchanges and other kinds of commodities Sellers and Buyers are expected to freely publish the amount they are willing to sell at which asking price meanwhile buyers are expected to freely publish the amount they are willing to buy at which bidding price Following a \xef\xac\x81rst in \xef\xac\x81rst served policy buyers \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs with bids higher than the minimum asking price will be able to acquire the commodity from sellers This pricing mechanism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t maximize neither minimize the deal price but it is a very good mechanism for markets with many sellers and many buyers For a peer to peer energy trading platform we expect many buyers and many sellers\xe2\x80\x99 environment this means that from pricing mechanism point of view the most suitable pricing mechanism is likely to follow the example setup by the Stock Market but with some speci\xef\xac\x81c modi\xef\xac\x81cations to align with our speci\xef\xac\x81c needs \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Decentralized Energy Exchanges Energo Pricing Going into more detail on our selected pricing mechanism a typical step for Stock Markets is to create the order book table Figure 1 Order Book Example Every order represents an acceptable price for each unit of quantity in an order Common situation for an order book includes a \xe2\x80\x9cBid Ask Spread\xe2\x80\x9d area that is the price margin between the highest bid and the lower ask price In this scenario we will de\xef\xac\x81ne the buying price as the lowest ask price since that\xe2\x80\x99s the price at which I currently can buy anything and selling price will be de\xef\xac\x81ned as highest bid price as that\xe2\x80\x99s the most expensive price I can currently sell In case of our energy market we face a special situation at which energy we may want to sell may not have been created yet This will lead into a situation where we have some overlapping between sell and buy orders Figure 2 Energo Platform Order Book Example \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs In this case we have some orders with asking price lower than the highest bidding price however the people that created those orders don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough energy balance to execute In this case if user wants to buy energy right away they will need to match the price of the \xef\xac\x81rst seller with currently available energy however we will still de\xef\xac\x81ne market prices per the order book regardless of energy being available or not Another specify of our market is energy storage Currently energy storage isn\xe2\x80\x99t being manufactured at a cheap enough price to be considered a commodity Current energy storage prices can range between 5500$ for a 14KWh Powerwall supplied by Tesla ~400$ / KWh capacity to ~200$/KWh for utility scale battery capacity On top of that not only battery creates pressure from pricing point of view but also from physical location point of view Per BYD own website 800KWh is the maximum capacity that can be \xef\xac\x81tted within a 40ft container with an area size of approximately 30 sqm Figure 3 Price and Area requirements for di\xef\xac\x80erent micro grid populations [1] Battery size has been calculated with the expectation of being able to store 150% of the total average user energy balance [2] We use 200$ as the KWh capacity price Installation costs land costs and other secondary costs have been ignored On Figure 3 we can compare the total cost for di\xef\xac\x80erent micro grid sizes per the average energy being stored by every household Using the 200$ / KWh price and with required capacity as 50% higher than the average balance hold by our users the per user average stored KWh capacity goes at around 300$ This places two main priorities for us to be able to sustain the system \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs First we need to ensure that we have mechanisms to minimize the battery usage per user to avoid battery costs from sky rocketing and consequently we will limit the maximum amount a user can store To calculate the desired maximum balance (Bmax) per a target energy storage cost per user (Cu) and assuming users average balance to be around half the maximum we can de\xef\xac\x81ne the equation as Equation 1 Calculating Maximum Balance per a target cost per user Second we need to ensure that users have a mechanism that allows them to sell energy automatically to avoid loss of pro\xef\xac\x81t To allow users to automatically sell energy we will use a Zero Intelligence (ZI) agent [2] In our case we will use a ZI for which a user can only de\xef\xac\x81ne the target purchase and selling price and our platform will automatically buy and sell once a given balance threshold is reached and no other buy or sell order exists Because we have a maximum amount of energy a user can hold as balance we may incur into a situation in which users have purchase orders that are issued but can\xe2\x80\x99t be executed until the user\xe2\x80\x99s balance decreases \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Software Implementation For our software implementation we need to di\xef\xac\x80erentiate three di\xef\xac\x80erent actors Users or Agents External actors can operate over users\xe2\x80\x99 order book Business Logic Units Execute calculate or hold data regarding users\xe2\x80\x99 balance orders or transaction history Smart Meter Can report energy usage and energy creation and consequently increment and decrement balances Figure 4 Market Software Implementation diagram On our platform we will use the Qtum blockchain as a central data source to record and account users\xe2\x80\x99 energy transactions We will consider a transaction the following actions Energy being added or removed because of smart meter account Currency being added or removed because of users\xe2\x80\x99 actions Currency being transferred between users as energy payments Energy being transferred between users We will also use a smart contract within Qtum to write and handle the di\xef\xac\x80erent parts of our business logic [1] BYD Utility Scale energy storage Available at http //www byd com/usa/energy/utility

not just between people but also between machines between electric vehicles and charging stations robots and chargers to name just a few Take new energy vehicles and charging stations which is a typical case of energy trading We give new energy vehicles and charging stations unique and human like digital ID on blockchains Since charging stations are connected to the distributed energy storage equipment in the micro grids new energy vehicles upon accessing charging stations in DAE communities can ful\xef\xac\x81ll the purchase in a given energy exchange and the payment to the charging station for the energy asset (using non \xef\xac\x81at currency) the whole process done unattended Such a future enhances utilization of clean energy generated in communities increases supply and makes energy source traceable thus making new energy vehicles even cleaner Arbitrary pricing and unfriendly payment methods will become yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s story The future through Energo\xe2\x80\x99s new energy vehicles charging service sees a standard electricity price and payment method within any given community The only di\xef\xac\x80erence is the service fee charged by di\xef\xac\x80erent charging stations \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Energo Ecosystem Energy trade and management APP The Energo network enables users of di\xef\xac\x80erent regions and micro girds to trade or share energy on certain APPs (Android/IOS) It\xe2\x80\x99s also capable of collecting data and running analysis on both production and consumption end (Q1 2017 has already delivered that ) Going into the future it will serve as smart home apps controlling energy use through AI and o\xef\xac\x80ering meticulous energy management (This feature is expected to be launched in Q2 2018) Wallet Energo wallet is an APP managing users\xe2\x80\x99 token asset Users can create new accounts transfer TSL and future tokens in the OTUM ecosystem import or export private keys and view the status and trading history of TSL Smart meters and charging stations Energo and its partners supply smart meters and charging stations that meet the measurement requirements and technology standards of the country installing those facilities To access Energo network and DAE community prosumers and traditional electricity users will have to install smart meters that can run in Energo environment Charging stations for new energy vehicles will be connected to the Energo network and be upgraded to be compatible with it \xc2\xa92017 Energo Labs \x0cE ne rg o L a bs Development Process Energolabs was found in October 2016 we have been prepared for the blockchain related research and design as early as august and has obtained the investment of Mr Wang Li Jie and Mr Zhang Jun two famous angel investors who had invested in Antshares and Metaverse After that we got the strategic investment from Energy Blockchain Laboratory and Shougang Fund As a early practitioner of energy blockchain Energolabs also appeared in Event Horizon in Vienna (February 2017) and the Clean Tech 2017 hold by ASIA DEVELOPMENT BANK in Manila(June) as guest speaker with our Startup project promoting the DAE community based on the blockchain which was favoured by government and energy company in each country In the \xef\xac\x81rst quarter of 2017 we have completed the blockchain Version ALPHA and the development of Energy Exchange in Android platform The development of intelligent electric meter prototype was \xef\xac\x81nished and it has been sent to Hanergy Global R&D centre for testing and adjusting in a real microgrid environment In the early days we built the blockchain by ourselves and spent a lot of energy on the development of the chain itself so the chain is not in\xef\xac\x82uential enough which might restrain the business advancement and ecological construction therefore we decide to transfer the developing basement to Qtum and reset the development process
