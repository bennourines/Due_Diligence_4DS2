NO PURCHASE IS NECESSARY YOU ARE FREE TO TAKE PART IN THE PROJECT OR NOT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW THE EXISTING LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY BEFORE BUYING BITCOIN TURBO KOIN YOU MUST READ UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE INVOLVING YOURSELF IN THE PROJECT \x0c\x01\x03\x06\x07\x05\x02\x04\x07 Bitcoin Turbo Koin is a de centralized Currency on blockchain technology Open Source Community run and maintained It is a currency ultimately owned by the people who possess it a \xef\xac\x81nancial system owned by individuals not a large entity Bitcoin Turbo Koin is not an ICO but a radical step towards repeating and improving the legacy of the original Bitcoin in creating a de centralized currency by the people for the people Unlike other cryptocurrency ventures that seeks to sell all or almost their entire tokens/coins during their ICO Bitcoin Turbo Koin is designed to be majorly distributed as awards to adopters for maintenance and continual improvement of the project The remaining large portion of tokens are to be airdropped freely This again is another attempt to start a movement of a crypto community that can not be controlled by major donors or \xef\xac\x81nancial investors but each person of the community adds value to the currency Instead of nodes it is people Instead of business decisions it is passionate people adopting a new way of thinking and transferring money through blockchain technology \x0c\x01\x05\x08\x07\x06\x03 \x02\x08\x04\x06\x05 From $0 003 USD in March 2010 to $19 535 USD in December 2017 This is of course the price value of 1 BTC (Bitcoin) in US Dollars Bitcoin which started in 2009 is a cryptocurrency a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to control its creation and management rather than relying on central authorities The Bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the \xef\xac\x81rst open source bitcoin client and the issuance of the \xef\xac\x81rst bitcoins with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the \xef\xac\x81rst block of bitcoins ever (known as the genesis block) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins even when it had no signi\xef\xac\x81cant price value A lot of investors and traders from numerous parts of the world have since then found it pro\xef\xac\x81table and comfortable to participate in the economy of this currency Cryptocurrency which started with the introduction of Bitcoin has now led to the presence of over 1500 crypto based coins in the world This technology (Cryptography) which works with a transparent ledger system known as Blockchain has made its marketplace a convenient one for everyone A NEW SOLUTION NEEDED With larger adoption Bitcoin has run into problems like scalability It\xe2\x80\x99s price point is daunting to investors or for common day usage Mining resources to sustain the network have become astronomical in energy consumption The time and fees of the TX have made the currency un usable for day to day transactions with waiting periods of up to 30 minutes or longer These among others are the problems that inspired the creation of Bitcoin Turbo Koin (BTK) Despite the challenges associated with bitcoin a lot of investors still want to participate in its market To this end BTK is introduced as a platform for easy fast affordable and ef\xef\xac\x81cient use of bitcoin The solution is centered around giving people (BTK community) the ability to comfortably use bitcoin through a scalable alias \xe2\x80\x93 BTK \x0cOne ailment of the crypto currency world is over technicality and confusing jargon We believe that blockchain technology can be delivered to a larger user base with simplicity and less confusion Bitcoin Turbo Koin is striving to be one of the leaders in adoption of digital currency for everyday use We intend to simplify and bring the powerful peer to peer ledger system into the hands of every day people who will utilize it for everyday transactions Our vision to accomplish this is to put the community and the people \xef\xac\x81rst We regularly speak of ourselves as a community currency and enjoy the simple comments and interactions of new users to blockchain technology We allow them to dictate how we should make things easier and more effective for their use We also are community run and desire to set the framework of an open source system where this currency will perpetuate with the community in control not a large investor or any larger centralized entity We desire for BTK to remain and continue as a decentralized currency for the people E COMMERCE APPLICATIONS Bitcoin Turbo Koin is looking to make the bitcoin currency easily transferable and liquid able for purchasing power We are already in talks with various companies that we believe are spearheading the way forward to integration with all major existing e commerce online platforms The current TX rates can be as low as Zero with our new blockchain so this makes us a strongly competitive with Paypal or Stripe who charge 2 9%+ for each transaction of money So our goal is to have Bitcoin Turbo Koin available to be used by small businesses or websites as method of payment or donation to transfer funds TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES \x0cBitcoin Turbo Koin is to provide a stable cryptocurrency that will be trusted and adopted We are currently utilizing the original Bitcoin codebase + Dash and Pivx in our blockchain Our Total Supply will be around 20 billion and can grow our circulation supply will be far less The Bitcoin Turbo Koin codebase is trusted and is being used in other cryptoprojects the code is secure We are a coin running on Proof of Stake and Masternodes We believe running on Proof of Stake is the best option in todays crypto market Further we like the idea that anyone can earn BTK each day just by having the wallet online for staking We believe that the bene\xef\xac\x81t with having many people staking instead of big mining farms is better EDUCATING USERS Bitcoin Turbo Koin is very sensitive to the need to educate people on blockchain technology in a simple user friendly fashion This objective is close to the heart of the project in putting people and their needs \xef\xac\x81rst in ensuring adoption of the technology is easy and even fun Our platform is open source and also spreads further education and forward thinking of the blockchain technology spurring on innovation WORLD WIDE COMMUNITY Bitcoin Turbo Koin has since its foundation been a world wide currency Developers from many countries advisors innovators and volunteers on social media have been from varied parts of the world This has become part of our DNA to cater to the needs of translation work and adoption of blockchain technology in countries all over the world This is another way that blockchain technology is disrupting the \xef\xac\x81nancial sector in that it is rewarding not only the rich but poor in any part of the world We are excited to have team members joining from all walks of life and social status to be a part of Bitcoin Turbo Koin USABILITY Bitcoin Turbo Koin will make blockchain technology less daunting for the end user and give people renewed con\xef\xac\x81dence in this pioneering way of transferring funds through a peer to peer digital network From our custom applications to partnerships with like minded teams we are seeking to make this technology as user friendly as possible \x0cA) ANONYMITY allow for further innovation and for anyone to In Bitcoin Turbo Koin there has been take part in improving Bitcoin Turbo Koin been an desire from many of the team D) SUPPLY AND ECOSYSTEM members to remain anonymous in their contributions This has helped the team focus on the main project and ensure steady growth We see the same in the original vision of bitcoin anonymity was also part of its success Our goal is results that are tangible in user interaction and adoption and not to focus on the developers behind the scenes B) DECENTRALIZED Many projects starting are used by businesses that are centralized entities The original vision of blockchain technology is to operate in a way that is peer to peer and not a part of any centralized hub The genius of this technology is that it runs and works apart from the control of any one individual The Bitcoin Turbo Koin has made built an ecosystem based on Proof of Stake and Masternodes This makes us very secure the people that are running their wallets online are helping and supporting our blockchain People earn BTK coins each day by running our wallets We have ensured that the BTK Blockchain will run for years It will grow each year and supply will be increasing E) LARGE AIRDROP When BTK was a token we sent out around 70 % of our supply as airdrops this is why we can call ourself a project for the people We have a big community because we sent so many BTK out for free BTK is now a grown up project with a large user base Investors Bounties We are utilizing our own blockchain the goal will be to ensure a de centralized model is maintained C) OPEN SOURCE 25 0% 5 0% In keeping with the spirit of many projects in the crypto world we desire to be open source with everything that is developed From Wallet Apps to any E commerce applications Everything will be open source or released onto Github after initial development This will 70 0% Airdrop \x0cThis did set us apart from many of the projects Innovation and improvement to the starting that are essentially doing a small blockchain technology is important but if it is airdrop to boost recognition of their branding not being used it becomes just test tube We estimate that as much as 70 80% had been experiments but not applied to real life We airdropped being the other 20 30% used for believe in its adoption to a large user base of bounties investor funding and rewards (not even non crypto minded people that the payment) for initial development work done technology will have to adapt and change and for earlier Bitcoin Token this will bring innovation otherwise not F) COMMUNITY thought of A big focus is the development of a strong and H) SIMPLICITY large community that is active and helping A question asked over and over again in this dictate the future of the Bitcoin Turbo Koin project is \xe2\x80\x9ccan it be done more simply \xe2\x80\x9d The We see the value of the currency in its complexity of many systems that utilize community and this will ensure the long term bitcoin technology narrow the \xef\xac\x81eld of durability of development innovation and use usability Bitcoin Turbo Koin strives to be unique of Bitcoin Turbo Koin amongst digital currencies to keep things G) MASS ADOPTION simple user friendly and even fun to use An important aspect of this project is its outward focused goal of mass adoption rate WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED Bitcoin Turbo Koin has grown at a fast pace and many have remarked how well and fast the project is growing The Cryptocurrency world is a very face paced technology and things move quickly We seek to follow pace with fast growing innovation and implement the most effective and new technical additions to our currency \x0cHere is a short list of some accomplishments ( with this current rate of growth we could be one of the leading coins in a matter of time ) The @bitcoin_token Twitter account has grown to over 35 000 engaged followers with a twitter audit of over 98% real followers We have started over 20 Twitter Language translation accounts each with an active #BTK team member running each channel A Telegram following of over 19 000 members has also been achieved through very little promotion of it\xe2\x80\x99s channel along with over 5 active #BTK team admins We have distributed earlier Bitcoin Token to over 32 000 addresses We have secured a good pressence on leading medias like Twitter Facebook Instagram We will look into more airdrops and campaigns in the future Currently Bitcoin Turbo Koin (BTK) will be trading on 5 exchanges (Stex Crex24 CoinDeal Mercatox and Vendit) There are other exchanges we are negotiating with The active #BTK community has initiated voting with 3 larger exchanges and we have signi\xef\xac\x81cant numbers on some of these vote lists that compete with and even supersede other well known established currencies Development is almost complete for a referral based #airdrop script that will increase our social numbers Airdrop to build a stronger and bigger community is important The #BTK team is growing daily with new developers marketers and volunteers of all types committed passionately to the project \x0cE Commerce Plugins and Integration 1 More than 80 percent of the online population has used the Internet to purchase goods and services 2 50 percent of the population online has shopped at Internet retailers more than one time 3 E commerce sales grow more than 19 percent a year 4 The highest growing country for e commerce is India followed by Saudi Arabia Indonesia Australia and the Philippines 5 Most shoppers at 71 percent believe that they can \xef\xac\x81nd a better deal when they shop online rather than going to a store 6 According to eMarketer estimates retail e commerce sales reached $2 3 trillion in 2017 a 23 2 percent increase over the previous year There are 4 major issues with E Commerce Privacy \xe2\x80\x94 information exchanged must be kept from unauthorized parties Integrity \xe2\x80\x94 the exchanged information must not be altered or tampered with Authentication \xe2\x80\x94 both sender and recipient must prove their identities to each other and Non repudiation \xe2\x80\x94 proof is required that the exchanged information was indeed received The \xef\xac\x81nancial services sector still bears the brunt of e crime accounting for 72% of all attacks But the sector that experienced the greatest increase in the number of attacks was E Commerce Attacks in this sector have risen by 15% from 2006 to 2007 (Symantec 2007) Security and Privacy Solutions for E commerce Platforms with BTK Why BTK as a solution BTK is a system that allows for the secure payments of online transactions as method of payment and reliable security measure for E Commerce With Blockchain Technology strong platforms committed to ensuring a safe and secure user experience for crypto investors enthusiasts and entrepreneurs as a representation of a secure and trustworthy ledger with all the entries internal to the system itself BTK has multiple encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques such as encryption public private key pairs and hashing functions It is easier to transfer funds directly between two parties in a transaction without the need for a trusted third party such as a bank or credit card company Fund transfers are done with minimal processing fees allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by most banks and \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions for wire transfers \x0cWHAT IS NEXT FOR BITCOIN TURBO KOIN We constantly thinking forward and are carefully planning for the successful implementation of various
