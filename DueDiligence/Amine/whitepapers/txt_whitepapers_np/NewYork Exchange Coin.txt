Whitepaper) and if given such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized by or on behalf of NYE and/or the Distributor Internet business has come to depend on financial organizations serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments While the system works well enough for most of the transactions it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model Non reversible transactions are not possible since financial organizations can t abstain from intervening disputes The NYE Initial Token Sale (as referred to in the Whitepaper) shall not under any circumstances constitute a continuing representation or create any suggestion or implication that there has been no change or development reasonably likely to involve a material change in the affairs conditions and prospects of NYE and/or the Distributor or in any statement of fact or information contained in this Whitepaper since the date hereof RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Prospective purchasers of NYE tokens (as referred to in this Whitepaper) should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with NYE the Distributor and their respective businesses and operations the NYE tokens the NYE Initial Token Sale and the NYE Wallet (each as referred to in the Whitepaper) all information set out in this Whitepaper and the T&Cs prior to any purchase of NYE tokens If any of such risks and uncertainties develops into actual events the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of NYE and/or the Distributor could be materially and adversely affected In such cases you may lose all or part of the value of the NYE tokens The expense of mediation increases the transaction costs constraining the minimum transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non reversible payments for non reversible services With the prospect of reversal the need for trust binges Traders must be cautious of their customers bothering them for more information than they would otherwise need A certain proportion of fraud is accepted as unavoidable These costs and payment doubts can be avoided in person by using physical currency but no mechanism be present to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party What is needed is an automated payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers In this paper we propose a solution to the double spending problem using a peer to peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the sequential order of transactions The system is secure if authentic nodes together control more CPU power than any conjoining group of attacker nodes \x0cBlock chain Technology What is block chain A Block chain is a series of records known as blocks Such blocks are continuously growing records that are combined and secured using cryptographic technology All the blocks in a block chain inherit \xe2\x80\xa2 A hash pointer as equal as a connection to its previous block A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps the data of an inconsistent size to a string (bit string) of a rigid size known as a hash function which is constructed to be a oneway function which makes it impossible to alter or invert the transactions \xe2\x80\xa2 A Time Stamp The Time Stamp keeps track of the creation time of a block \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction Data All data related to the transaction Master mode Network A master node is a server on decentralized network It is used in such a way that ordinary nodes cannot do It can be used for features like direct send / instant transactions or private transactions The NYE Master node network has been extended from NYE however with the noteworthy reconstruction to a Proof of Stake algorithm The functionalities carried out by NYE master nodes are similar comparatively to those of NYE These nodes are an essential part of the NYE digital ecosystem and important to network usefulness The master node network satisfies a scope of functions free of staking nodes These distinct functions are restricted to master nodes and can\xe2\x80\x99t be completed by a standard staking node These duties are dispersed over the master node network and no single master node has the power in abundance of others in the system Basically Block chain Technology is a way for one user of the internet to transfer an exclusive fragment of digital asset to another internet user in such a way which is assured to be safe and protected every person in the world knows that the transfer has taken place and nobody can challenge the authority of the transfer Requirements for Master node Hosting Block chains are the most secured by construction and can be stated as a distributed computing system with High Byzantine Fault Tolerance That means it tolerates the class of failures known as Byzantine Generals Therefore Decentralized Harmony is therefore achieved with the Block chain Technology As a result the block chains are most convenient for the recording of activities such as Medical data Events Government data Identity Management Transaction Processing Food and other items such as Traceability etc Obtaining NYE for master node hosting is the kickoff requirement Make no mistakes this is not easy but can also be acquired at exchanges listed on nyecoin io The first Distributed Block chain that was conceptualized and implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2008 it serves as a core component of the digital currency Bitcoin There are certain requirements for master node hosting Much as some of them have been itemized earlier let\xe2\x80\x99s shed more light on it 1 000 NYE Dedicated IP Address After acquiring the NYE the next line of action is a dedicated IP address But they always come with servers and computers connected to a network VPS running on Linux Here beginners are strongly advised to get cheap VPS like Vulture and Digital Ocean to test run it and may migrate to higher versions afterward Time Just as most ventures beginners must be ready to invest some time into learning how the system works so as they get the most out of it \x0cMaster node Protocol The master nodes are propagated around the network using a series of protocol extensions including a master node announce message and master node ping message These two messages are all that is needed to make a node active on the network beyond these there are other messages for executing a proof of service request Private Send and Instant Send Master nodes are originally formed by sending 1 000 NYE to a specific address in a wallet that will \xe2\x80\x9cactivate\xe2\x80\x9d the node making it capable of being propagated across the network A secondary private key is created that is used for signing all further messages The latter key allows the wallet to be completely locked when running in a standalone mode A cold mode is made possible by utilizing the secondary private key on two separate machines The primary \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d client signs the 1 000 NYE input including the secondary signing private key in the message Soon after the \xe2\x80\x9ccold\xe2\x80\x9d client sees a message including its secondary key and activates as a master node This allows the \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d client to be deactivated (client turned off) and leaves no possibility of an attacker gaining access to the 1 000 NYE by gaining access to the master node after activation Upon starting a master node sends a \xe2\x80\x9cMaster node Announce\xe2\x80\x9d message to the network containing Message (1K NYE Input Reachable IP Address Signature Signature Time 1K NYE Public Key Secondary Public Key Donation Public Key Donation Percentage) Every 15 minutes thereafter a ping message is sent proving the node is still alive Message (1K NYE Input Signature (using secondary key) Signature Time Stop) After a time to live has expired the network will remove an inactive node from the network causing the node to not be used by clients or paid Nodes can also ping the network constantly but if they do not have their ports open they will eventually be flagged as inactive and not be paid \x0cTransactions We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership The problem of course is the payee can t verify that one of the owners did not double spend the coin A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority or mint that checks every transaction for double spending After each transaction the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double spent The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint with every transaction having to go through them just like a bank We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions For our purposes the earliest transaction is the one that counts so we don t care about later attempts to doublespend The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions In the mint based model the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first To accomplish this without a trusted party transactions must be publicly announced and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received \x0cTimestamp Server The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be time stamped and widely publishing the hash such as in a newspaper or Usenet post The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time obviously to get into the hash Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash forming a chain with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it Network \xe2\x80\xa2 The steps to run the network are as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 New transactions are broadcast to all nodes \xe2\x80\xa2 Each node collects new transactions into a block \xe2\x80\xa2 Each node works on finding a difficult proof of work for its block \xe2\x80\xa2 When a node finds a proof of work it broadcasts the block to all nodes \xe2\x80\xa2 Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously some nodes may receive one or the other first In that case they work on the first one they received but save the other branch in case it becomes longer The tie will be broken when the next proof of work is found and one branch becomes longer the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes As long as they reach many nodes they will get into a block before long Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages If a node does not receive a block it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one \x0cProof of Stake Overview By design to keep the NYE system more secure owing coins in the network is extremely difficult As a community based crypto currency which focuses on privacy NYE ensures that the identity of the person involved in the transaction remains anonymous even though the transaction is verifiable To achieve consensus NYE needed to have PoS 2 0 running wallet software which proves that it has enough Block chain coins to verify transactions Stokers are rewarded based on the amount they contribute Also the more the staking the more secure the network becomes because it becomes increasingly difficult for individual stokers to control the majority of coins in the network NYE Technical Architecture NYE is built up with Script we believe that the future digital world will be a world where the NYE platform operates a highly reliable block chain network that can conveniently utilize the services of the
