 Overview
 	 Path’s goal is to create a globally distributed and decentralized monitor ing node network that connects unused bandwidth and computational power
 to users looking for uptime and performance monitoring for any type of online
 service Anyone with a computer or phone can download Path’s transparent and
 non resource intensive mining client to rent out their device’s bandwidth and
 computational power for Path Tokens (PATH) Hundreds of thousands if not mil lions of path mining nodes will then be able to provide unprecedented visibility
 into the internet making it the leader in internet uptime and performance moni toring solutions 
 	 Path mining nodes can be run via computer browser plugin phone applica tion or on linux based operating systems and will automatically run in the back ground when you choose them too Path will send job orders to be filled by these
 mining nodes rewarding tokens for their completion of such jobs The amount
 of tokens awarded will vary on the type of job completed Users will be able to
 toggle what type of jobs they wish to perform as well as turn off and on the min ing service whenever they please In addition miners can opt in to contribute to
 Path’s free global internet monitoring service As the platform progresses more
 options and features will be added to the miner and monitoring service 
 	 Users looking for uptime and performance monitoring can request such
 services by issuing “jobs” through Path’s client panel Jobs can range from sim ple requests such as having a single node validate whether a service is online to
 more complex tasks such as having hundreds of nodes across the globe validate
 a website’s checkout flow To order these types of services users simply sign up
 to Path’s panel and deposit PATH tokens into their account The user then creates
 jobs for which the tokens are exchanged as the mining nodes complete the jobs 
 	 The entire platform will progress in steps as expanded upon in the devel opment roadmap In the first stage we will have a proof of concept that will
 show all basic features of the service but will not go into full production mode 
 Once Path’s token sale is complete we will have a short closed production period
 (Beta) in which anyone can download and run Path’s miner node However only
 approved clientele will be able to order jobs during this period Once this second
 stage is complete Path’s services will be opened to the public and anyone will be
 able to them

 Objectives
 Primary Milestones
 Phase 1 Building an initial monitoring platform 
 	 The Path team is aiming to create an uptime and performance monitoring service by using blockchain technology and smart contracts This goal will be
 met and these technologies will be incorporated throughout the entire course
 of Phase I which is made up of multiple stages (see Roadmap) Once Phase I is
 complete there will be a complete and comprehensive network that is capable of
 monitoring uptime and performance of any type internet service 
 Phase 2 Develop Network to Commercial Scale
 	 The aim of Phase II is to finalize the network from Phase I and make it com mercially viable on a global scale This means greatly increasing the number of
 Path nodes to handle the increased demand for services and locations Addition ally Path’s client facing panel will have increased granular analytic features for
 monitoring internet services especially on the network level Once Phase II is
 complete the network will have matured to handle tens of thousands of clients
 located anywhere in the world Additional features and services will be added as
 the network continues to grow providing even more benefits to Path’s users as
 well as the implementation of Path’s free global internet monitoring service

 The Path Token
 	 We will be releasing a Path Token or PATH A fixed supply of tokens will
 be issued during the token creation event and no more tokens will ever be created Any tokens unsold during the token sale will be destroyed The tokens will
 be available to be used on Path’s online panel once Path completes its full public
 launch 
 	 PATH will be a key component to the Path Network in that the token will be
 used by clients to buy uptime and performance monitoring and any future services The majority of the token fees will go to the mining node owners (the individual renting out their spare bandwidth and computational power) with a small
 portion going back to development and support All fees will be denominated in
 PATH which is subject to change based on supply and demand 
 	 The previously mentioned node owners will essentially act as miners and be
 incentivized with PATH for their network support Owners will be paid for their in dividual work as they complete monitoring jobs that are issued by paying clients 
 As opposed to typical blockchains mining will be rewarded for sharing bandwidth
 and computing power (performing jobs) 
 	 The token is designed so that it will reflect the growth of the Path Network

 Path Architecture
 Overview
 	 Path works similarly to traditional uptime and performance monitoring solutions in by creating a network consisting of distributed monitoring nodes around
 the world However unlike traditional networks the nodes used to monitor and
 collect information are made up of decentralised independent miner nodes that
 split up the jobs requested by the clients This allows for a wider variety of types
 of data gathering points built in redundancy and an unprecedented number of
 monitoring locations around the world 
 	 Clients wanting to use Path’s monitoring services can do so directly through
 Path’s user facing online panel Once the client has exchanged PATH tokens for a
 monitoring service Path’s mining nodes are given the monitoring jobs and paid
 with tokens for completing them The miners then forward back the requested
 information to Path’s centralized database and clients can access to the informa tion that they requested through the Path panel 
 Path network
 11
 Mining Nodes
 	 Path’s mining node client will start by being offered as a Chrome browser
 plug in When running in the background it will complete jobs and forward the
 encrypted information it collects to Path’s database This all occurs instantly and
 without impacting the mining node user’s internet browsing or other computa tional activities Once the cycle of performing the job and forwarding the infor mation to Path is completed the node will be rewarded with a portion of a Path
 Token Due to the high volume of tasks / token per task nodes will be paid out
 starting at every 250 000 tasks to make sure the token transaction fees do not
 take away from the nodes’ earned profit Individuals can run as many nodes as
 they want and at any number of locations to maximize their earning potential 
 Nodes simply need to be pointed to the wallet that the client will want their
 earned PATH tokens deposited into 
 	 As Path’s services mature node clients will be developed for different
 browser plugins for apple and android phones and finally as standalone OS cli ents In addition advanced API features will be opened to the public so that
 nodes can easily be run directly from code embedded in websites and/or phone
 applications

 Payment Services
 	 Cost of services is dependent on the current market value of the token as
 well as the type of services that are being requested Some services have different
 base prices based on varying factors such as basic uptime monitoring vs website
 performance monitoring Other factors could include how many locations/nodes
 are being used to monitor a service and how often the service requests to be
 monitored Additional services will be added overtime to the platform to compli ment the core service such as SMS updates based on predefined uptime and per formance monitoring rules To purchase the services the client will deposit PATH
 directly into their Path account which can then be used in exchange for services 
 	 Nodes will collect PATH at a value based on the types of jobs they are completing where the nodes are located and how often they are completing jobs 
 The PATH value awarded will also be based on the current market value of PATH 
 PATH will be paid out in blocks to ensure that the transaction cost of awarding
 PATH does not exceed the value of the PATH awarded 
 Path Payment Services
 PATH tokens are deposited in the panel
 and exchanged for

 the Path network and services The following is a tentative breakdown of how we
 are planning to use funds for development 
 Core Development | 30%
 	 The largest portion of funds will go to completing the development of the
 Path Network and panel described in this whitepaper This includes the Path node
 network panel analytic reporting smart contract system support protocols and
 systems end user applications etc 
 Security | 15%
 	 Since users will rely on us to report to them if their service is down as well
 as keep their information safe it is imperative that we ourselves are impenetra ble We will invest in security such as DDoS mitigation redundant core infrastruc ture encapsulation of information and more 
 Operations | 30%
 	 Operational costs will cover the day to day expenses incurred for a fully
 functional global platform Costs include hosting infrastructure staffing out sourcing management and other related expenses

 Funding Breakdown Cont 
 Marketing | 10%
 	 The marketing budget will be used for strategic partnerships and directly
 marketing to consumers This will lead to a larger network with more mining
 nodes and more users using the services Overall more money will be running
 through the system and going to the node owners 
 Contingency | 5%
 The contingency budget will be set aside for future events or circumstances that
 are possible but cannot be predicted with certainty

 Competitive Analysis
 Uptime and Performance Monitoring for Websites and Networks
 	 Uptime and performance monitoring are a must for companies operating
 internet based services When availability equals revenue companies must be
 immediately notified when their services experience degradation or downtime
 so that they can fix the problem The market contains only a few large competitors
 that fail to grow their monitoring footprint in comparison to the natural growth
 of the internet The few leading companies in this space are Pingdom Statuscake 
 ThousandEyes and Luminati Currently these companies must build their own
 expensive monitoring infrastructure which leaves their visibility confined as they
 are limited to hosting only at data centers Luminati is the only company gathering information from home and mobile IPs at this time but their services are extremely expensive and open up their users to possible complications as they run
 their services on a peer to peer VPN 
 Competitor Financial Information
 
 Over $60 000 000 raised to date through top VC’s such as Sequoia Capital 
 Sold to SolarWinds in 2014 for $67 300 000 Estimated yearly revenue at
 $8 000 000 
 Estimate Yearly Revenue $5 000 000
 Acquired in August 2017 for $200 000 000
