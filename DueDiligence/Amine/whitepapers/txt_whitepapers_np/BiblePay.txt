many of the features of other cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Bitcoin with unique community building features and a revolutionary approach to avoiding the irresponsible waste associated with typical heat mining So much more than simple wealth generation BBP endeavors to create a better world and show God\ s love to others via revolutionary technology PROBLEMS WITH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY Existing blockchain technology takes one of several forms each of which has their own difficulty Proof of Work (POW) systems suffer from extremely poor electrical efficiency while Proof of Stake (POS) systems have inherent flaws in their ability to regulate bad actors In addition heat mining for most blockchain based coins or tokens has led to the development of specialized hardware based mining rigs that are outside of the reach of most individuals Bitcoin alone generates more electricity than many countries around the world Add to this the low trust environment of lack of accountability shady ICOs significant pre mining and it is not hard to see why so many are looking for alternatives BIBLEPAY SOLUTION BiblePay utilizes a new proof of work algorithm based on the King James Bible called Proof Of Bible Hash (POBH) It is unique in that every miner has the entire KJV Bible integrated making it virtually impossible to port to GPU or ASIC mining Another key aspect of mining is Proof OfDistributed Computing (PODC) which is a greener alternative to traditional POW and is the primary consensus algorithm BiblePay has built in features that enable it to be self funding and self governing based on the Dash masternode strategy and had no ICO or pre mine Full accountability is built into the wallet itself \xe2\x80\x93 and 10% of every block can be seen to go to highly efficient charities supported by the community 4 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 \x0cMarket Opportunity VISION Our goal for BiblePay is to provide a hedge against hyperinflation while helping orphans and making mining accessible to everyone at the same time We also desire to reduce heat generation by using the Bible Hashing Algorithm in place of Proof Of Work and to make our heat generation more effective and positive via significant community contributions in Proof Of Distributed Computing PROBLEM A number of factors have arisen which materially affect the opportunity for BiblePay to have an impact making now the right time for it to be introduced From a charity perspective the last several decades have seen a consistent increase in average spend (GivingUSA) but a recent decrease in charity efficiency (True and Fair Foundation) In fact in the UK more than 1 5 charities were found in 2016 to spend less than 50% of their total donations on charity while in the US many large charities are spending less than 20% on their declared purpose (Mercola) In addition the buying power of those donations is decreasing with the rapid changes in inflation Traditional currencies are becoming less and less impactful over time Finally cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x93 a potential solution to the inflation issue \xe2\x80\x93 have a variety of issues ranging from trust to malleability to a lack of privacy to inefficiency Proof of Work cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are amongst the worst from a heat waste point of view as the total energy expenditure has been rising exponentially in recent years and is now accounting for more than 0 14% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s total energy consumption (CoinTelegraph) BiblePay addresses the following five key issues Giving Over Time Charitable giving has skyrocketed in the last 60 years from roughly $1B annually to more than $350B At the same time efficiency is decreasing 5 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 \x0c1 Community / Purpose 5 Privacy Many cryptocurrencies aim only to provide a novel way of creating wealth for its holders with the utility of the currency being the means to the end These cryptocurrencies are unlikely to have any wider positive impact on the world around them in a direct fashion as they have been created primarily as wealth generating vehicles rather than impact vehicles Blockchain technology often serves as an example of the unrelatedness of security and privacy Many people do not wish their personal details and complete transaction history to be public knowledge This is especially true in charitable giving and privacy in charity is especially encouraged in Matthew 6 4 2 Accessibility It is an unfortunate reality that for a large number of potential consumers having a meaningful stake in a cryptocurrency is difficult as mining rapidly evolves to include more specialized hardware configurations which are cost prohibitive to the masses For those that could benefit the most from such a technology it remains tantalizingly out of reach 3 Governance In cryptocurrencies that lack a unified wellunderstood governance structure highlyfractured sub communities arise and tensions between groups of holders can slow development and ultimately hinder the coin Users need sufficient power to create change and networks need to be fast enough to approve proposals and implement budgets In addition it must be possible to determine a true consensus to avoid proof of stake fork issues Maximizing Impact In order to ensure that BiblePay has the largest possible impact it has been chartered to work only with highly efficient charities The first selected charity at launch was Compassion International a well recognized and highlyefficient charity supporting care of underprivileged children throughout the world Subsequent charities are selected as budget allows and voted on by the community To ensure continuity of service in our charitable commitments buffer funds are reserved as a hedge against the risk of declining prices in either BBP or its main trade partners BTC and USD 4 Environmental Waste Proof Of Work algorithms by their very nature require a large amount of energy however this computational energy is often wasteful in nature serving little purpose other than to control difficulty and introduce security As such systems scale the environmental impact is consistently rising 6 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 BiblePay works only with highly efficient charities such as Compassion International \x0cOUR CORE VALUES We are honest efficient caring helpful and dedicated to providing a quality service while not compromising integrity With this focus and the high requirement on efficiency we believe that we are positioned to have a significant impact in the community In addition a significant market exists for religious charitable contributions as the graphic below (GivingUSA) indicates \xe2\x80\x93 more than 32% of all 2016 charitable contributions or more than $120B USD were dedicated to religious charities Human services also rounded out the top 3 and received a very healthy $46 8B USD It would not require a very large percentage of penetration to see BiblePay realize its goals While initial charities were selected by the development team all subsequent partnerships are proposal based meaning that a member must put up a stake to submit a proposal which is put up for vote and if successful added to the budget In this way it is possible for any organization which the community decides is worthy to be supported to reap the benefits of BiblePay 7 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 \x0cBiblePay One Pager BiblePay is not a token but a clear cryptocurrency While the coin itself has many of the same properties as other cryptocurrencies and is intended to be utilized for payments and exchange there are other features of the BiblePay system that are worth discussing in greater detail The following sections give some basic statistics and overview information of BiblePay

emission schedule is also available on our website/wiki Difficulty began at 7 min/block Fairness One of the fundamental principles in designing and creating BiblePay was that of fairness To that end there was absolutely no pre mining and no Initial Coin Offering There is no reserved supply and no inconsistent rewards \xe2\x80\x93 every participant has the same ability to reap the benefits of BiblePay Wallet Features BiblePay incorporates a significant number of exciting distinguishing features into its wallet Some of the features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend are derived from Dash although 8 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 others such as native ecommerce prayer requests and tithing are unique to BiblePay Economics The block reward is carefully structured to both serve the BiblePay mission and to appropriately reward effort To that end the basic block economics breakdown is \xef\x83\x98 \xef\x83\x98 \xef\x83\x98 \xef\x83\x98 \xef\x83\x98 \xef\x83\x98 10% to charity through sanctuary

is self regulated by a series of masternodes known as Sanctuaries These masternodes enable the PrivateSend and InstantSend capabilities as well as serve as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) collectively They vote on proposals and on distribution requests and with the high stake requirement help to ensure the security of the overall network The treasury completes the DAO \xe2\x80\x93 it is simply the portion of funds which are spent according to the budgets voted on by the sanctuaries Treasury distributions require minimum voting of a net 10% of sanctuaries and all IT PR and Peer to Peer budgets are funded out of the treasury block rewards \x0cProof Of Bible Hash Details The wallet uses the X11 blockhash to maintain the reference pointers for the blockindex map However it uses the BibleHash to regulate difficulty and prove that a full node generated the biblehash (by requiring a txindex lookup a block hash or a receiving address to be present in the suffix of the hash) In greater detail see the below points on Proof Of Bible Hash 1 The BibleHash function is fed an input X11 hash of the current block template at a point in time This starts as a uint256 It is also fed the reference to the last block index (and previous height and previous block time) 2 The BibleHash function encrypts the x11 hash uint256 using AES512 into a ciphertext vector This ciphertext vector is then converted to base64 (These functions were chosen to raise the bar to reduce the likelihood of porting the hasher to a GPU as AES512 requires the OpenSSL library) 3 The resulting base64 is then md5 hashed 4 The md5 hash is 32 bytes long The BibleHash function breaks the md5 hash into 8 octets of 4 bytes each For each 4 byte octet the hex is multiplied * the IVerseFactor ( 4745708) This IVerse factor points to the corresponding KJV Bible verse between 031101 This resulting verse is chained to the output and this process repeats for octets #2 8 while appending the verses to the chained verse output 5 When the BibleHash function reaches verse #8 it breaks up the source four byte octet into four elements a Hex 2 byte source resulting in a lookback block offset from 0 255 a hex one byte source resulting in a transaction offset of 0 15 a hex one byte source resulting in a transaction output offset of 0 15 and a one byte source 9 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 resulting in a datatype pointer of 1 3 (by multiplying 0 15* 1875) (used to determine if this bible verse will need to reference a blockhash transaction ID or a receiving address) Then the BibleHash calls out to the full node for the resulting DataType from the chain by reading the disk retrieving the result and appending the result to the final chained bible verse (verse #8) 6 Then the resulting chained verses text contents are MD5 hashed to provide a concise input to the X11 hasher 7 The MD5 hash is X11 hashed 8 The X11 hash is sent through a business logic filter requiring the full node business logic of the latest Mandatory version of BiblePay (IE some business logic from the wallet adjusts the resulting hash depending on block number) 9 Next if the block is older than the late block threshold the X11 hash is modified to be easier to solve 10 If the block is a TITHE_MODULUS block the block is easier to solve 11 The resulting X11 hash is sent out of the function as the hash result \x0cProof Of DistributedComputing Details Proof Of Bible Hash (as a POW variant described earlier) is supplemented by our Proof Of DistributedComputing mechanism which will be familiar to those who have utilized POS algorithms PODC works by aligning the BiblePay miners to one or more distributed computing projects that are aligned to BiblePay\ s mission After creating a Cross Project Identifier (CPID) miners add the CPID to their controller wallet and then associate to one or more devices running the BOINC software package Becoming linked to the BiblePay team in each approved project allows for the BOINC Recent Average Credit (RAC) to be utilized as the basis for a staking requirement When the miner puts up a sufficient stake balance of BBP to cover the requirement for the BOINC RAC they are added to the daily superblock that distributes payment to each successfully staked miner according to their magnitude or their individual share of the team total RAC is calculated as a running average over 14 days so users will also be compensated for historical work once they stop computing as long as they maintain an accurate stake balance In order to have the greatest integrity possible in the PODC consensus system PODC update transactions are executed periodically based on task completion (and can also be manually triggered especially when no current distributed computing tasks are running) These update transactions ensure that the stake balance is available and that the data log is complete and accurate by validating the task start time reported by the controller wallet against the time in the distributed computing source system (e g Rosetta@Home or World Community Grid) blocking any SQL credit tampering and ensuring that the signature of the task owner matches the CPID/wallet combination of the reporter preventing any takeover attacks Miners who have not completed a task within the configured network time (currently 24 hours) are considered to have a magnitude of 0 and to be ineligible for superblock rewards Some projects can have individual project weights adjusted to reflect alternative difficulty/credit calculations this is applied universally to every member of the BiblePay team in each project Also staking requirements which can be adjusted over time are not all or nothing partial staking allows for even new users to receive a partial reward from the daily superblock Users are encouraged to balance their own computing power contributions to their available stake balance to ensure accurate rewards In cases of abnormal network activity a hierarchical approach to disaster recovery has been implemented ensuring that miner rewards from the superblock are accurately calculated and distributed with the best information possible 10 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 \x0cSecurity Details There are several well known attacks on major cryptocurrencies which have been considered and evaluated against the inherent security of the BiblePay system One common technique is the well known 51% attack (now thought in practice to operate at as low as 30% with lesser probability of success) in which a miner or small group of miners takes sufficient control of the computing power to affect inappropriate changes This is also commonly executed with botnets so is sometimes referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cbotnet\xe2\x80\x9d attack Within BiblePay this attack is considered to be much more difficult than in many other cryptocurrencies due to a few factors although Proof Of Distributed Computing is a foundational aspect of that defense First we require a distinct CPID to mine each block and limit the amount of blocks that can be solved by a given CPID in a given block range so an attacker would require not only 51% of the hash power but 51% of the distinct CPIDs as well in order to affect such an attack This is not only cost prohibitive but also timelimited as the each CPID would need to have a sufficient RAC built up over time and in the lower probability versions each such failed attack would still result in an increase of difficulty for each subsequent block and thus opens up plenty of opportunity for other legitimate CPIDs to solve a block and wipe the attack out Regarding the time window attack currently used to artificially deflate the block difficulty such that a miner can quickly solve many blocks in a hurry thus creating an opportunity for double spend or other illegitimate activities BiblePay mitigates this risk by having a smaller than average timestamp window for solutions (15 minutes roughly the solve time for 2 blocks) and do not allow clock times to be off by more than 5 minutes In these ways the security of BiblePay granted by the combination of PODC and POBH ensures that the chain\ s integrity remains uncompromised and that users can rest secure in the knowledge that the most wellknown and well exploited attacks are not applicable here As additional attack methods are revealed the BiblePay team is committed to quickly evaluating and mitigating any weaknesses in the system 11 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 \x0cDevelopment Roadmap 12 BIBLEPAY APRIL 2018 \x0cDisclaimers The
