/offline business transactions A customer reward system can be considered a form of e money since customer rewards are pragmatic and can be managed by a computer system However as most reward systems are built and managed by private organizations like companies/corporations the systems own risks and limitations including system volatility interoperability with other systems and security This confines the customer reward systems being recognized as an e money apM Coin project contemplates that applying digital technology including blockchain cloud network and data analysis technology on current customer rewards systems will enhance the strengths of customer reward systems when customers earn/redeem rewards or merchants utilize data of rewards platforms Moreover by conducting the project partnering with proven industry leaders the project has built competitive advantages of business development and implementation apM Group a dedicated partner of apM Coin as a successful corporation in the Dongdaemun fashion wholesale market for 20 years has grown its reputation from the superior quality and fast adoption of the latest trend among other wholesale markets Along with the apM Group s plan to implement its own customer reward system under the objectives of leveraging its competitive advantages apM Coin will cooperate with the company to create its customer reward platform utilizing blockchain and cloud network Through this platform the project is planning to collect dispersed market data efficiently provide advanced customer services on an integrated digital platform and add an efficient and secure digital payment system while developing customer rewards as a digital currency that is well compatible with the market Additionally based on a mass adoption use case with the apM Group apM Coin will extend the platform s service areas to other industries or companies to improve its scalabilities 2 \x0c2 Market Analysis 2 1 Market Size According to Fortune

summarized into three categories the means of payment a unit of account to measure values and store of value There is a type of currency that is widely used and works as a type of currency though not recognized as a normal currency This is customer reward that most people would have gaine d when purchasing goods and services A customer reward is the amount earned a nd accumulated at a certain rate according to the price paid for goods and services and may be used within the supplier s ecosystem or with its partners Customer rewards own the features of a currency The rewards can conduct three functions currency which are the means of payment a unit of account to measure values and store of value Since most reward systems are issued by private organizations like companies in electronic form the rewards can be understood as the digital currency of the issuing companies In other words it can be said that the company issued currency is a means to trade through a digital transactional intermediary Customer rewards are efficient in terms of cost and convenience It is possible to trade with either no fee or a low fee because banks do not perform the transaction Another advantage is that users are at less risk of loss than other payment methods However the reward points currently being used has several limitations First of all customer rewards are legally interpreted as conditional bonds and customers cannot be guaranteed that customer rewards terms will be fulfilled and it is difficult to enforce fair compensation and protection by law enforcement 4 Yeongeun Kim

customers Additionally the programs can collect high quality customer data which enables the forecast of purchasing patterns These data are critical to layout effective business strategies such as the size direction and timeline of business Despite merchandise and service providers contributes significant resources to operating their reward points programs they still have limited access to consumer data 5 \x0c3 apM Coin Project 3 1 Overview As mentioned in a previous chapter customer reward programs are effective tools for marketing and customer acquisitions They also work as big data platforms that can collect valuable data for effective business growth strategies Moreover as more consumers purchase customer rewards to upgrade their products and services and enhance their own post purchase satisfaction customer rewards have become another revenue stream Due to the rise of K cultures i e K pop K drama etc in a global market there are increasing demands about K fashion Dongdaemun fashion market the heart of the Korean fashion industry is also growing Particularly since the superb quality and design of clothing products which are planned manufactured and sold in Dongdaemun fashion cluster Chinese customers acknowledge them as premium products In spite of the massive market size and high ratio of global buyers it is difficult to find a well organized customer reward system in Dongdaemun wholesale market which can manage/use customer data systemically and promote sustainable customer relationships relations Dongdaemun wholesale fashion market is a huge platform where thousands of Korean and global buyers pay regular visits to place orders for business purposes Since a structured loyalty system for this huge market cannot be found yet the apM Coin project confirms the needs of a customer reward platform integrating the buyer information database Also by applying blockchain technology the platform can enhance its features It can share real time information with increased transparency which allows users to earn redeem monitor customer rewards instantly Blockchain technology can improve the security of the platform because customer rewards are tokenized with eigenvalue and are hard to be hacked forged or changed Blockchain protocols can also enable reward issuers of the platform to be interoperable with other issuers in the platform 6 \x0capM Coin project is planning to build a blockchain applied customer reward platform as the project recognizes benefits that technology can bring to the market thousands of B2B business transactions occur at the same time as the majority of customers are global buyers from China Taiwan and South East Asia in particular the market has a strong possibility to cooperate with other industry including lodging transportation logistics service providers the market is growing with the rise of Kculture Through this platform the project aims to efficiently collect dispersed customer data of the Dongdaemun fashion market provide quick and effective customer services that meet the needs of users and develop an efficient and secure digital payment system by developing customer rewards as a payment method optimized for the wholesale fashion market 3 2 apM Chain Platform The services of the apM Coin project are operated on apM Chain Platform built with blockchain and cloud infrastructure The platform with blockchain technology will verify and record information about terms conditions and operation of the reward program on the blockchain network The rewards of buyers and sellers will be managed by their mobile devices and the generated and collected data from the devices will be monitored and handled by apM Chain Platform via a blockchain network The platform will also enhance compatibility with other blockchain networks 7 \x0cservices or IPFS(InterPlanetary File System) through SDK(Software Development Kit) and API(Application Programming Interface) 3 2 1 Terms & Conditions Management through Blockchain Reward issuing companies have to notify the customer of the rewards of contract at the time of execution and terms of reward programs can not be changed unilaterally However in most cases consumers have not acknowledged the unilateral variations of terms and conditions of the reward programs such as changing payment terms with reduced benefits and discount rates of customer rewards apM Coin project aims to secure the means and appliances that protect the right of the customers(buyers) and franchisees(sellers) by transparently managing a reward payment rate and discount rate When modifications and adjustments to the terms are made the data will be recorded on the blockchain Agreements between consumers and customer rewards management entities are guaranteed by a third party through a smart contract and neither party can unilaterally change or violate the terms 3 2 2 Security Enhanced through Blockchain In the existing customer reward systems reward issuers have the sole authority to operate the system so consumers are vulnerable to problems by the issuer such as computational errors or omission of crucial data As customer reward is a valuable asset provided to customers in the form of conditional bonds the rewards should be 8 \x0cindispensably protected with strong security apM Coin project manages a customer reward system across multiple nodes limiting operational risks and enhancing security and reducing costs of trust 3 2 3 Dual Token System apM Coin project operates in dual token structure \xe2\x94\x81 apM Coin( listing token token ticker APM) which can be freely traded and apM Cash( reward token ) which is used as customer rewards in the platform \xe2\x94\x81 which can resolve settlement issues and may act as a currency The listing token apM Coin is based on ERC 20 and is freely tradable after being listed on exchanges The token has value fluctuation and will be compatible with apM Cash the customer rewards where mass adoption can be carried out efficiently to expand further the apM Coin Platform The converting rate between apM Coin and apM Cash is planned to be determined as per the algorithms of circulation and frequency of apM Cash The details on the token conversions will be officially announced after several rounds of trial tests in real world adoptions The reward tokens are issued and managed through a token management system in apM Chain Platform in order to promote real world adoption instantly and accurately This token has a fixed value of KRW 1 per 1 apM Cash on apM Chain Platform and will not be listed on an exchange to allay concerns about value volatility Partners of apM Chain Platform can use apM Coin and apM Cash for their business exchanging between apM Coin and apM Cash will allow indirect transfer and value conversion where users have more control over their intangible assets than other existing reward points systems 9 \x0c4 Usecase 4 1 apM Group The Key Partner of apM Coin Project It is most important that partners of apM Coin project actively adopt and implement their customer reward systems using apM Chain Platform The first key partner of t he project is apM Group the leading player in the Dongdaemun wholesale fashion market 4 1 1 apM Group Introduction apM Group is a dominant player in the Korean wholesale fashion market The company owns the largest wholesale shopping malls in Dongdaemun fashion cluster apM apM PLACE and apM Luxe Since it opened the apM mall in 1999 apM Luxe in 2012 and apM PLACE in 2016 the company has led the trend of Dongdaemun wholesale fashion market and has driven the market growth in the global wholesale fashion scene More than 1 300 wholesale brands are operating their businesses in apM apM PLACE and apM Luxe apM malls are visited by more than 10 000 buyers per day on average which 80% of them are visited from abroad To improve global buyers customer satisfaction apM Group has provided various services such as translation shuttle bus accommodation at its own residence hotel and outsourced professional buyers The company has expanded its business area in an online wholesale fashion market To solidify its business overseas apM Group is planning to expand globally 4 1 2 The Objectives of Cooperation with apM Group Dongdaemun apparel market is one of the top five global fashion meccas The market has enhanced the presence of K fashion in an international fashion market as 75% of wholesale clothing products are exported overseas Demonstrating the popularity of Korean fashion 20% of the Chinese unbranded clothing market are originated by Dongdaemun The remarkable growth of the market is the result of fast responsiveness where advertised clothing seems to appear in the stores the very next day This responsiveness is realized because of Dongdaemun s 10 \x0cgeographical advantages which combine strategic planning production and distribution However Dongdaemun wholesale market has struggled to cope with rapid changes facing the era of digital transformation When most of the other fashion markets are armed with computerized online and digital data the Dongdaemun market still mostly focuses on its offline market and is transacting mainly with cash For this reason both customer and transaction data are manually recorded All information is inevitably fragmented making it difficult to obtain accurate insight from such data Despite Dongdaemun s strong presence as the top five global fashion mecca it can deleverage its strength that the market is not fully implemented a well structured big data management system about its market and customer data To deal with such changes and develop its competitive advantages apM Group is planning to establish a customer reward system that encourages customers to visit regularly and place more orders in the malls by providing satisfying customer services and structurally manage customer and business transaction data which can be a reliable source of business insights Considering thousands of B2B transactions occur simultaneously and large international buyers from China Taiwan and South East Asia the blockchain applied customer reward platform of apM malls will collect dispersed customer data in the Dongdaemun wholesale market provide the quick and effective customer services on the integrated digital platform and aims to add a digital payment system with high efficiency and security while developing customer rewards as the digital currency tailored for the market 4 1 3 Service Application in apM Ecosystem apM Group directly manages facilities for its mall s customers These facilities include cafes residence hotels shuttle buses lockers VIP lounges and purchase of goods by agents Although all facilities and services are actively provided offline due to the lack of structured tools to collect customer data of these facilities it is difficult to collect the customer data which can be used for marketing and business strategies Customers who use these facilities also receive no additional benefits by doing so Thus apM has focused on expanding the usage of the apM Coin to function as a digital currency in addition to reward points functional elements like its 11 \x0cmarketing capabilities for attracting new customers and expanding the base of loyal customers Customers are likely to miss some customer benefits because of the absence of an information sharing platform for various shopping events and customer service information at the malls In this regard a cooperation between apM Group and apM Coin project has been formed as apM Group launches a customer reward system in the malls to take advantage of the system s marketing benefits like acquiring new customers and building customer loyalty while the company is planning to add a digital payment system with the function of buying and redeeming customer rewards The service areas of this loyalty management platform will be gradually expanded in the apM malls considering the feature of the Dongdaemun wholesale fashion market Most wholesalers of the market are not accustomed to e payment and integrated data management system so the sudden introduction of the system may make them uncomfortable Thus apM Coin Project is planning to evenly expand the service areas of the customer reward platform in the apM malls the massive offline wholesale market platform so that actual platform users wholesalers and buyers of the malls can have a sufficient time to experience the service benefits and be adopted to this digital platform As the apM Chain Platform can provide the services that accommodate the needs of the Dongdaemun wholesale fashion market at its best level and secure wholesalers and buyers of apM malls as its users it is expected that apM Chain Platform can expand its business area to other shopping malls or industry 4 2 Services of apM Chain Platform 4 2 1 Tiered Loyalty Benefits Customers can earn customer rewards when purchasing fashion goods at apM malls or using the facilities of the malls A ratio of purchased amounts is converted into customer rewards and accumulated in the apM Chain Platform the data generated is then recorded in the apM network The more customer rewards a buyer earns the more likely he/she is to acquire loyalty benefits of the apM ecosystem 12 \x0cLoyalty & Rewards Program

2 Data Collection and Uses apM Chain Platform will collect customer data of apM malls via apM Members mobile application and the collected data will be used for business growth such as building customer relations and launching marketing campaigns If data is merely collected and a process ends there the data may become obsolete Performing as the CRM platform apM Chain Platform will analyze the collected customer database which can presume the buyers features such as customer s flow and shopping preferences The wholesalers registered for apM Chain Platform will be shared market insights that are projected from the analyzed data utilizing these insights the wholesalers can have their own business insight for business growth and respond to market changes Also the insights can be used by the platform and malls to develop customer services which will lead to new systems for buyers and sellers and improvement of shopping experiences 13 \x0c4 2 3 Quick & Simple Payment Option It is expected that reward tokens can be developed as an additional e payment method that can create more business transactions between wholesalers and customers Reward tokens working as customer rewards are managed on the blockchain network which makes the tokens highly secure can be traded in the peer to peer(P2P) format Customers can use apM tokens as a digital currency when they use facilities of apM malls caf\xc3\xa9s shuttle buses residence hotels lounges etc which are directly managed by apM Group They can engage in P2P transactions through digital currency when available in the online shopping mall 4 3 End User Services via Mobile Application In terms of technology adoption in a real world life usability is one of the most important factors that should be counted apM Coin project will launch the mobile application apM Members (tentative the name can be changed ) where buyers and wholesalers can use the platform services of the apM Coin project through their own mobile devices with ease Through apM Members mobile app buyers can earn and redeem reward tokens (customer rewards) and get updated on the latest shopping information about several customer benefits and events at the malls The app will include a digital payment function where customer rewards can work as one of the payment options Cooperation with existing payment services the project is planning to increase business scalability and enhance shopping convenience 14 \x0c5 Token apM Coin & apM Cash 5 1 Token Utility The users of apM Chain platform can be categorized into two types customers (buyers) who earn and redeem customer rewards using apM Members and sellers(wholesalers) who provide and get paid with customer rewards using sales management services on apM Chain Platform when customers place orders 5 1 1 Token Deposit for Data Uses Sellers are required to deposit a certain amount of apM Coins the equivalent of KRW 50 000 per annum (as of whitepaper written the amount can be subject to change at the time of service launch) in order to have access to a sales management system on apM Chain Platform The sales management system includes payment services customer reward management and data analysis services When sellers deposit the listing tokens to use the platform services the value of apM Coin can be estimated based on the average market price for the last one week at the time of deposit Since the price of apM Coin is equivalent to a fixed value of deposit amount for the service access the number of apM Coin for deposits can be dramatically increased when the listing token value is extremely low in a market To prevent such cases the price of the listing token can be approximated to KRW 100 if an average listing token price of a previous week is lower than KRW 100 (considering KRW 100 is the market s perspectives on lower limit value) 15 \x0c5 1 2 Access to Customer Service Facilities Access to customer service facilities can be varied by previously mentioned customer loyalty categories The apM tokens can be used in facilities of apM shopping malls as following Benefits for all apM Members users (token wallet holders) shuttle bus luggage services The utility of reward tokens extra benefits at the cafes residence hotel access to VIP lounge online shopping mall The utility of listing tokens Access to the exclusive VIP lounges (for who deposits apM listing tokens) token payment for the increase of rental deposit in the future (tentative) 5 1 3 Payment Option Customers can easily purchase products and services with the tokens after converting the listing tokens (apM Coin) to the reward tokens (apM Cash) via a mobile application When a customer transfers the listing tokens it is automatically converted into the reward tokens and the converted reward tokens are transferred to wholesalers apM Coin project is planning to expand the ecosystem by applying a token conversion function between apM Coin and apM Cash 16 \x0c5 2 Token Issued
