it is regulated in some parts of the world Sports betting makes up 30 to 40 percent of the total global gambling market The size of the online global gambling segment was estimated around $37 9bn USD in 2017(1) and is constantly on the rise There is also a trend inside global gambling that more and more people are moving away from mainstream gambling (lotteries casinos poker and other gaming) to sports betting because of the simple fact that there are more betting options and the playing field is fairer In the last few years sports betting has been developing into the crypto space and there are more and more sportsbook sites accepting BTC and other crypto currencies every month At present as this whitepaper is being written there are more than 50 online sportsbooks accepting crypto The purpose of 1X2 Coin is to launch its own 1X2 Sportsbook which will accept 1X2 Coin as deposits withdrawals and the main betting currency In its early stages 1X2 Coin will start out as an advanced Masternode coin with a progressive reward scheme which has a very attractive ROI for its investors (1) https //www statista com/topics/1740/sports betting/ \x0cMasternodes Constant growth and the innovation of our systems is a crucial objective for our strategy Therefore 1X2 is a selffunded system that runs its own dedicated masternodes which supply the funds needed to maintain and improve the project Based on this model we have developed a financial structure that would generate income for all 1X2 Coin owners while utilizing 1X2 Coin itself for the security of the blockchain In the masternode network users of the platform and owners of 1X2 Coins are compensated by the network through the allocation of rewards based upon 1X2 Coin owner contributions to the network as confirmation nodes and masternodes 1X2 Coin is distributed within a hybrid network for securing the blockchain by confirming transactions while ensuring the privacy of transactions and facilitating instant transactions between users of our platform 1X2 Coin is not limited to securing the network it can also be used as an instrument for payments The main goals of 1X2 Coin are to serve as the cryptocurrency that is used by our partners the development of worldwide sportsbooks which accepts cryptocurrency and for the rapid transfer of funds and payments within our platform \x0cCoinholders A coinholder or Staker is an individual who owns some type of digital asset such as cryptocurrency and one individual can be a stakeholder of many different types of cryptocurrencies Most cryptocurrencies provide their own wallets via a link on their websites and the coins can then be transferred from the exchange into the wallet for storage and distribution purposes Coinholders or stakers collect passive rewards on any amount of 1X2 Coins in their wallet When visiting any affiliate exchange users can purchase 1X2 Coins and then transfer those coins to be stored in their digital wallet secured by their password Here the coins stake and verify other parties\ transactions with the purpose of earning more coins for the holder By using our digital wallet users will be part of our exclusive coinholder network which is very user friendly and users can complete their transfer of funds in a quick and easy manner In first iteration of 1X2 Coin coinholders collect all the benefits of 1X2 Coin\ s digital currency without the ability to vote on the blockchain for the initiatives pursues \x0cProof of stake In traditional blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin the preliminary proof of work concept is an energy intensive blockchain technology based on the hashing protocol where miners are used to verify transactions on the network This concept uses a substantial amount of energy computation as well as time needed to mine the coin In this concept there is a clear distinction between stakeholders and miners Stakeholders are individuals who use the network to facilitate a transaction For example if someone sends one Bitcoin on the network the block transaction is then verified by third party miners Miners produce a mathematical computation based on the difficulty set by the network\ s parameter The first miner to solve the mathematical equation is rewarded and this is announced on the network before the block is created to be solved Proof of stake algorithm is based on storage of all the operations in the 1X2 Coin wallet with the distributed database This system is based on the principles of decentralized management in the absence of a single controlling authority The synchronization of 1X2 Coin nodes which run on proof of stake is done through the peer to peer network P2P Proof of stake is more efficient and environmentally friendlier than proof of work which utilizes a lot of energy by using specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines Proof of stake can be used without expensive mining equipment on a normal entry level computer 1X2 Coin user friendly proof of stake removes the need for miners altogether With proof of stake users earn rewards on the coins held in their wallet by following a few simple steps 1 Download the 1X2 Coin wallet from the website 2 Purchase 1X2 Coins from an affiliate exchange 3 Transfer 1X2 coins to digital wallet 4 Coin earn rewards through being staked as collateral to verify transactions on the blockchain
