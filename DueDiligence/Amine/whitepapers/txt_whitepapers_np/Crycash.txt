products for gamers which operates with its own utility token called \xe2\x80\x9cCRC\xe2\x80\x9d As an ecosystem CRYCASH will disrupt gaming industry by creating marketing tools based on innovative technologies for game developers and give gamers the possibility to receive CRC tokens by completing tasks set by game developers buy virtual goods bett and participate in cybersport tournaments For that CRYCASH will build an ecosystem consisting of 4 components Plink application Advertising Platform Decentralized Marketplace for trading games and in game items Cybersport Platform The first one will serve as a messenger and a wallet for CRYCASH tokens Developers will use Plink as a safe payment method and a user acquisition channel that will reinvent the way developers attract players into their games This ecosystem will be built in cooperation with Crytek GMBH Plink and other third party developers CRYCASH Legal Entity will issue ERC 20 digital tokens called CRYCASH (CRC) tokens They will be used as a payment method in the CRYCASH ecosystem Game developers will use CRC tokens to promote their products and attract gamers which in their turn will use them as currency for in game purchases as well as receive rewards for completing game tasks Game developers and advertisers will get the possibility to pay for the services provided by the CRYCASH platform using CRC tokens as well as fiat currency In case game developers and advertisers make payments in fiat currency CRYCASH Legal Entity will provide buyback of CRC tokens in order to be able to pay gamers who completed tasks CRYCASH Legal Entity will get a fee equal 20% that will include 10% fee for Plink In addition CRC tokens allow for getting access to the unique content and become one of the payments methods in products developed by Crytek GMBH such as Warface (Turkey) CRYENGINE Marketplace and future products where suitable CRYENGINE Marketplace will be the first marketplace to join CRYCASH decentralized gaming ecosystem However later any company or developer will be able to join CRYCASH platform using its SDK The cooperation between CRYCASH Legal Entity and Crytek GMBH is very important for both parties since it creates synergy effect and allows users to enjoy most of the functionality of CRYCASH decentralized gaming ecosystem at its early launch Plink is an application that is being developed by Plink in collaboration with CRYCASH Legal Entity It will be the first application that will be used as a wallet for CRYCASH tokens holders In addition Plink is the first application for gamers that enables tracking achievements in games and finding new friends for cooperative game with a neural network technology This application is integrated with CRYCASH Advertising Platform The technology of tracking achievements will allow game developers to create tasks for gamers inside Plink After accomplishment of every task set by game developer will receive rewards in CRYCASH tokens 3 \x0c2 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Sustainable growth of gaming industry will play a major role in establishment of CRYCASH decentralized gaming ecosystem According to Newzoo market research in 2017 2 2 billion individuals across the globe are expected to spend US $108 9 billion on computer games This represents an increase of US $7 8 billion or 7 8% from the year 2016 In addition the global gaming market is expected to reach US $128 5 billion by 2020 [1] Figure 2 1 Global Gaming Market Size in billion US $ 150 100 101 1 108 9 115 8 122 7 128 5 50 0 Market Size Source [1] Digital game revenues will account for $94 4 billion or 87% of the global market Mobile is the most lucrative segment with smartphone and tablet gaming growing 19% year over year to $46 1 billion claiming 42% of the market In 2020 mobile gaming will represent just more than half of the total games market The PC and console game markets will generate $29 4 billion and $33 5 billion in 2017 respectively [1] Growth of in game purchase volumes is another important factor to consider Recently Transparency Market Research has published a comprehensive report on the Global Social Gaming Market It is forecasted to reach US $17 4 billion by 2019 This market has three main segments virtual goods market advertising lead generation Virtual goods market will be the main growth driver for the Global Social Gaming Market with expected CAGR of 15 2% over the forecasted period Surprisingly most of the virtual goods are purchased in so called Free to Play Games (see Figure 2 2 ) [2] 4 \x0cTable 2 2 Virtual goods purchases 54% 60% 34% 40% 23% 20% 0% 12% Free to Play Games MMO Games Social Networks PC Games 9% 9% Console Games Casual Games Source [2] It is important to mention that currently there are no tools that would enable users to transact directly with each other so a third party is needed Gaming platforms usually play role of such intermediaries However they are unable to support all countries their users originate from due to a small size of average purchases (see Figure 2 3 \xe2\x80\x9cAverage size of purchases\xe2\x80\x9d) and high fixed costs associated with money transfers Such situation is a deficiency of current financial system that blockchain provides instruments to solve Figure 2 3 Average size of purchases in US $ 50 40 30 20 10 0 In Game Currency Subscription Codes Equipment Maps/ Levels Weapons Virtual Gifts Power Ups Source [3] So sustainable growth of global gaming market and lack of standardized payment methods as well as inefficient advertising tools generate a need for a new highly reliable advertising instruments and payment methods that CRYCASH strives to fulfil 5 \x0c3 BENEFITS FOR GAMING INDUSTRY Gaming industry is international and diverse by its nature It involves billions of gamers and millions of developers interacting However this interaction is inefficient due to flaws in traditional financial system and outdated marketing approaches It lacks effective tools for players to monetize their game time collaborate and communicate Game developers are challenged by high fees from marketplaces and high costs of acquiring users CRYCASH decentralized gaming ecosystem solves these problems by introducing revolutionary custom tailored products for players and developers The primary goal of CRYCASH is to change the way gaming industry operates by utilizing programmable logic of smart contracts immutability of blockchain ledger and high speed of transactions that blockchain technology enables These features are crucial to CRYCASH Platform and they lie in the core of every product or service that CRYCASH delivers However for making the most of these features a token is necessary CRC token fuels the Ecosystem serving as a utility token which is designed to incentivize users to interact with CRYCASH Ecosystem and make profit Borderless nature of blockchain with the help of CRC tokens will allow peer to peer ingame transactions Distributed essence of blockchain combined with CRC tokens will create a framework for fostering interaction between gamers and developers so the latter can promote their products more efficiently Even though CRYCASH Legal Entity is the only entity in CRYCASH Ecosystem that exercises all managerial and promotional functions it has no authority to control users and developers and thus it has no instruments to resolve disputes within the Ecosystem CRC token is used to align incentives of all stakeholders of the Ecosystem 3 1 Benefits For Gamers Currently there are a lot of inconveniences that users face when playing games There is no easy way to find players that would fit the rest of the squad by such criteria as gaming experience language location and favourite gaming time Players spend hundreds hours of gaming time on finding valuable in game assets that worth something on the market and then they still face difficulties with making in game transactions In addition there are high entry barriers for new players that want to earn money by participating in e sports tournaments CRYCASH Ecosystem solves the above mentioned problems in the following way \xe2\x97\x8f Earn CRC tokens by completing tasks set by game developers \t\t and advertisers at Plink \xe2\x97\x8f Pay with CRC tokens within Crytek products (for example Warface Turkey) \xe2\x97\x8f Pay for products and services on the CRYENGINE Marketplace \xe2\x97\x8f Pay for games in game items and trade with hard to get \t\t rare and collectible items \xe2\x97\x8f Team up with other players at Cybersport platform to create your \t\t own game tournaments or participate in third party challenges \xe2\x97\x8f Make bets for e sports events and win CRC tokens at Cybersport Betting Platform \t\t \xe2\x97\x8f Make a cash out to fiat money or pay within CRYCASH Ecosystem \xe2\x97\x8f Enhanced security of each transaction with CRC tokens thanks \t\t to blockchain technology 6 \x0c3 2 Benefits For Game Developers Each year game developers spend billions of dollars on customer acquisition However considerable amount of that money is wasted due to the inefficient advertising tools that are available on the market right now CRYCASH Ecosystem provides them with a wide range of unique tools for boosting their profits and promoting online products Game developers will benefit from using CRYCASH Platform by \xe2\x97\x8f Gaining a critical mass of users quickly and cost efficiently \xe2\x97\x8f Getting an access to a new efficient and secure way of receiving payments \t\t from gamers \xe2\x97\x8f Significantly reduced customer acquisition cost \xe2\x97\x8f Increased customer lifetime \xe2\x97\x8f Enhanced engagement of new users \xe2\x97\x8f Possibility to use unique gamers targeting instruments (gaming activity \t\t favourite time of playing gaming experience age gender location and etc) \xe2\x97\x8f Increase in returns on per user basis due to in game purchases \xe2\x97\x8f High growth of LTV driven by gamers hunt for items and accomplish tasks \t\t from game developers for CRC tokens 7 \x0c4 CRYCASH ECOSYSTEM GAMING SOLUTIONS 4 1 Plink Application CRYCASH Legal Entity allows investors to earn CRC tokens using PLINK application (Plink) by carrying out tasks of game developers Plink is a blend of messenger and social network for gamers Its neural network allows them to look for friends to play cooperative games with In addition Plink enables users to track each others\xe2\x80\x99 progress in various games get updates on what their friends are playing at a given moment of time form teams (squads) for daily combats communicate with each other via voice conferences and cross platform chats The technology in question (earning CRC tokens for accomplishing tasks) will be made possible by the Advertising Platform that is being developed by CRYCASH Legal Entity This platform will serve game developers as a tool for setting specialised tasks for gamers The aim of such tasks will be to attract new users in games Also this platform will provide game developers with a withdrawal mechanism of rewarding gamers with CRC tokens for successfully accomplished tasks Let us consider an example Warface TURKEY sets a task to a gamer with Advertising Platform This tasks will become available for gamer through Plink Definition of task Register in WARFACE and kill 100 enemies with a head shot and add 5 friends For that user will receive 5 CRC tokens CRYCASH decided to use Plink application to build the technology for rewarding players due to its advanced functionality that allows Plink to track gamers activities crossplatform in games This technology will enable Advertising Platform to monitor the status of tasks assigned to gamers by developers as well as to transfer them CRC tokens These tokens will be delivered to \xd0\xa1RYCASH wallet in Plink CRYCASH Legal Entity has an exclusive partnership with Plink and will promote this application among gamers By doing this CRYCASH Legal Entity will increase number of users and enhance potential profits from advertising opportunities within the app Advertising Platform will charge game developers 20% commission fee of the amount of the gamers\xe2\x80\x99 remuneration in Plink application This fee will be split equally between CRYCASH Advertising Platform and Plink 8 \x0c4 2 Advertising Platform For Game Developers Feedback that CRYCASH received from game developers gives solid evidence that there is a problem of insufficient engagement of new players in video games Developers spend their time and resources on creating state of the art action games that players would love However the latter usually quit playing before they actually get acquainted with gameplay In fact more than half of users spend less than hour in the game after registration That is why they usually do not have enough time to appreciate the quality of gameplay Before game developers had to spend their marketing budgets on inefficient Facebook ads Google ads or some types of CPA advertising However these marketing tools do not fit the needs of modern gaming industry That is why CRYCASH Legal Entity introduces its very own Advertising Platform (AP) which is designed to interact directly with all products of CRYCASH Ecosystem Currently AP utilizes Plink and CRYCASH Cybersport Platform for engaging new users 9 \x0cPlink has a unique task setting system which allows to track users\xe2\x80\x99 progress in accomplishment of quests they took from developers Currently the latter use services of advertising agencies\xe2\x80\x99 to attract new gamers In this business model game developers pay for each user that is registered in the game Usually advertising agencies use bots to create fake accounts so it is hard to evaluate efficiency of such customer acquisition channel In addition it is impossible to calculate the time that a user spent playing the game As a result game developers waste their money Task setting system via Advertising Platform (AP) in Plink introduces an elegant solution to these problems Now game developers will be able to create special intelligent tasks in their games that can not be accomplished by bots Essentially CRYCASH Ecosystem is developing \xe2\x80\x9cProof of Game\xe2\x80\x9d that will make new users prove their active presence in the game by actually playing it It is the role of Plink to track it As a consequence individuals will be fully engaged into the games they play and developers will have better chances to sell in game items It is AP and Plink that track progress so developers have time to actually built new products Mobile application Plink has already started to support tracking users\xe2\x80\x99 activity in more than 90% of the most popular games cross platform API of the Advertising Platform can be used by game developers to interact with users if their game is still unsupported by AP and Plink AP has a wide range of analytical instruments for efficiency assessment of advertising campaigns in Plink and Cybersport Platform All the reports can be accessed through user \xe2\x80\x99s profile Their copies are also sent to the advertisers by an email An advertiser can manage levels of access of its employees through user \xe2\x80\x99s profile AP allows game developers to top up their account with fiat money as well as with CRC tokens In case of account replenishment with fiat money 5% fee is charged It is done to incentivize game developers to utilize CRC tokens as means of payment in the ecosystem Large game developers will be able enjoy postpaid services of CRYCASH Ecosystem For that 30% of raised funds will be reserved for token buyback and elimination of cash gaps Advertising Platform developed by CRYCASH Legal Entity will provide game developers with a possibility to set tasks for gamers with web interface and through the API Game developers can keep track the number of users that started completing tasks and monitor their progress in the game Advertising Platform will make it possible to choose specific tasks This will allow game developers to set tasks with wide range of specific configurations based on users online data and stats such as \xe2\x80\xa2 geolocation \xe2\x80\xa2 gaming preferences \xe2\x80\xa2 gaming experience \xe2\x80\xa2 popular time playing \xe2\x80\xa2 users sex and age 10 \x0cIn addition AP will enable game developers to promote and host decentralized eSports tournaments for both professional and amateur gamers and allow them to receive CRC tokens in such tournaments via CRYCASH Cybersport Platform Cybersport Platform will be integrated with AP as well With the help of AP game developers and advertisers will sponsor tournaments set sponsorship rewards and buy advertising services As of today there are no promotional tools and platforms that would have as revolutionary functionality as AP will provide 4 3 Marketplace Making its way into the market CRYCASH Legal Entity established partnership with CRYENGINE \xe2\x80\x93 the highly advanced development solution for the creation of blockbuster games movies high quality simulations and interactive applications Powered by Crytek CRYENGINE is the only all in one game development solution for the PC and game consoles which brought into the world such legendary bestseller as Crytek\xe2\x80\x99s FarCry as well as dozens of third party games under Crytek\xe2\x80\x99s licensing scheme Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 and SNOW Warhorse Studios uses a modified version of the engine for medieval RPG Kingdom Come Deliverance Introduced in 2016 CRYENGINE\xe2\x80\x99s Marketplace offers developers access to Crytek\xe2\x80\x99s own asset library as well as community contributed materials sounds and 3D objects that can be used to build their games Now CRYCASH will be available as one of the payment methods at CRYENGINE Marketplace in addition to traditional payment options Paying for assets in game items and services has never been so easy and secure Game developers who sell their products at the Marketplace will also be able to receive payments in CRC tokens and either use them to reward gamers for completing their tasks or easily cash out to fiat currencies This innovation will allow the CRYENGINE community to rearrange a seamless payment process for third party developers\xe2\x80\x99 products Moreover CRYENGINE Marketplace will feature the built in CRYCASH SDK delivering the ultimate experience to game developers With CRYCASH SDK developers can integrate CRYCASH into their products and take advantage of making and receiving payments in CRYCASH tokens This integration will be completed in the Q1 2018 and CRYENGINE Marketplace will provide its customers with CRC token payment method in Q2 2018 Integration with the CRYENGINE Marketplace will be an additional incentive for the token\xe2\x80\x99s seamless flow within the CRYCASH Ecosystem The global vision of CRYCASH is to launch an independent blockchain based Marketplace for third party developers The CRYCASH Marketplace will become a secure and a convenient platform for purchasing games with CRC tokens Using CRYCASH SDK will also allow game developers to cut fees which they have to pay with traditional distribution platforms \xe2\x80\x93 for instance for STEAM this fee may be up to 20% CRYCASH Ecosystem plans to expand its integration into other games and distribution platforms such as STEAM BATTLENET OVO and others Launch of the independent CRYCASH Marketplace for games and in game content distribution is scheduled for the end of 2018 11 \x0cCRYCASH SDK CRYCASH SDK is designed for developers to create their in game marketplace to sell in game items and earn CRYCASH By integrating the CRYCASH SDK and adding the list of game items for sale game developers give users an opportunity to sign in using their Plink account connected with their CRYCASH wallet After this users can make purchases in games with their CRYCASH wallet and confirm all transactions via 2FA in the app Smart contract for GameDeveloper \xe2\x80\x99s SDK will guarantee the item\xe2\x80\x99s delivery to the user check user \xe2\x80\x99s balance and offer him particular items etc Various business models will be supported (pay to play free to play and pay to win) The CRYCASH SDK won\xe2\x80\x99t be available publicly but anyone will have a possibility to test it within their product or game by downloading the necessary libraries and using test access Once the product is developed we will verify function call to the smartcontract to exclude any possible errors in the code responsible for the transaction This way we\xe2\x80\x99ll guarantee that all CRYCASH users will receive the assets they paid for All transactions are stored in blockchain and every user can easily prove the fact his purchase has been paid for if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been delivered for some reason Our libraries will work with most of the popular engines such as CryEngine Unreal Engine and Unity3D Other programming languages used by game developers will be added later SDK methods \xe2\x80\xa2 Auth (ApiKey and SellerId) \xe2\x80\xa2 Plink oAuth \xe2\x80\xa2 ItemsList (ItemName Price and etc ) \xe2\x80\xa2 Add \xe2\x80\xa2 Remove \xe2\x80\xa2 Transaction (ItemID UserID and etc )

CRYCASH SDK will be first integrated with the CRYENGINE Marketplace Eventually this SDK will be adapted supported and developed for other popular platforms 4 4 CRYCASH Cybersport & Betting Platform The global e sports market has 14402 active players as of 2017 In 3187 different tournaments over $98 million dollars were distributed as rewards among winners [4 5] It is important to note that such tournaments are extremely centralized and significant entry barriers prevent millions of players from becoming professional gamers In addition to this problem e sports industry suffers from scaling issues and lacks efficient mechanisms of attracting new players 12 \x0cCRYCASH will build a decentralized Cybersport Platform on Ethereum This blockchain was chosen due to functionality that can be achieved by using its smart contracts CRYCASH Platform will allow enthusiasts to compete in their favorite games through a decentralized and automated platform which will 1 Decrease entry barriers for both professional and amatuer players 2 Mitigate risks associated with non payment of rewards to the winners \t\t by different intermediaries 3 Allow less popular and known players to start participating in international \t\t competitions 4 Reward gamers by using API of CRYCASH Cybersport Platform 5 Provide game developers with a unique advertising tool which will increase \t\t players\xe2\x80\x99 engagement 6 Host tournaments for both professionals and amateurs 7 Provide access to new types of events that can be bet on CRC token will become an inevitable part of CRYCASH Ecosystem that will allow its users to \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \t\t \xe2\x97\x8f \t\t \t\t \t\t Bet on e sports events registered on CRYCASH Cybersport Platform Win CRC tokens by competing in various tournaments Web/PC/Game consoles/ iOS/Android games will be supported Access additional premium functionality such as getting rewards for taking different actions within the Ecosystem (e g linking social network accounts to the Platform attracting new users and accessing premium content of CRYCASH) For the first time users will have a complete control over their funds which is possible due to the decentralized nature of CRYCASH Platform The payments and payouts made by the players and settled on the Ethereum blockchain without being processed by a bank or any third party entity This decentralized model reduces transaction and other operating costs Saved funds will be passed on to the consumer by adding value that competitors cannot provide Existing centralized solutions put consumers at risk since gamers\xe2\x80\x99 accounts and deposits can be hacked embezzled or even blocked The CRYCASH Cybersport Platform will host both centralized and decentralized gaming tournaments Decentralized Tournaments Platform\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized tournaments will be set up and run by users of the platform who have CRC tokens The latter will be the only accepted tokens in the decentralized tournament ecosystem CRYCASH plans to use smart contracts to allow gamers to create tournaments for Web/PC game consoles (Xbox PlayStation) and Mobile (iOS Android) games Similar to CRYCASH itself these tournaments will be under full control of the players with witnesses to verify results In addition gamers can create their own tournaments and use their own CRC tokens or virtual assets as prizes This will allow all interested gamers to participate in tournaments by using smart contacts embodied in the CRYCASH Cybersport Platform 13 \x0cCentralized Tournaments Centralized gaming tournaments will take place as well They will be run by developers and used for promotion of their games through CRYCASH Advertising Platform These tournaments will serve as an instrument to encourage player participation within a particular game Gamers will earn CRC tokens from sponsorship contributions from game developers Gamers that have achieved a certain profile status based on CRC tokens earned or held may have special eligibility into some or all of these tournaments Future Vision CRYCASH aims to be the preferred global platform for skill\xc2\xad based eSports competitors and to play an essential part in shaping the future of blockchain\xc2\xad based projects This project will initially focus solely on gaming community but will expand to include all of the major competitive eSports games Ultimately CRYCASH will be a leading brand in competitive e sports affiliated with P2P gaming as well as influential regional and global tournaments CRYCASH will also work with game developers by forming symbiotic relationships to enhance the gaming experience for all users Doing so will encourage a higher level of participation on both parties\xe2\x80\x99 platforms and bring CRC tokens and decentralized applications one step closer to mainstream CRYCASH INTENDS TO OBTAIN ALL THE NECESSARY APPROVALS FOR THIS IMPORTANT FEATURE AS ONE OF THE KEY STEPS POST ICO 14 \x0c5
