b WebDollar Cryptocurrency Native to the World Wide Web Whitepaper Draft 0 6 23 03 2019 Alexandru Ionu\xc8\x9b Budi\xc5\x9fteanu \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar Abstract WebDollar (WEBD) is a Browser based Peer to Peer cryptocurrency that aims to signi\xef\xac\x81cantly increase the worldwide adoption of decentralized currencies WebDollar o\xef\xac\x80ers the possibility to send and receive payments online on any Browser directly from one party to another without going through a \xef\xac\x81nancial institution while the con\xef\xac\x81rmations of these transactions are secure on the blockchain without passing them through potential vulnerable channels like a Web Server or RPC intermediary as in BTC Cryptocurrencies have been very technical requiring the installation of speci\xef\xac\x81c terminal applications for running nodes and mining downloading the entire blockchain before starting to mine and dedicated wallet software To solve the worldwide adoption challenge WebDollar focuses on three core advantages 1 Simplicity o\xef\xac\x80ering an intuitive and non technical user experience addressing more than just IT savvy crypto enthusiasts but also the common citizens 2 Lightness WebDollar introduces a trustless light node of the blockchain for mining and verifying transactions without requiring to download the entire blockchain history from Genesis but only the hardest proofs and blocks that distinguish attackers to honest nodes (miners) who keep the correct blockchain This breakthrough light version of the Blockchain is called Non Interactive Proofs of Proofs of Work (NiPoPoW) and was proposed by some researchers [2] 3 Ease of integration with the Web Integrating electronic crypto payments represent a di\xef\xac\x83cult challenge for web developers because at the moment Web Applications have to communicate with an internet protocol that is not native to the browser or the HTTP layer Most web and mobile apps validate transactions by communicating with an intermediary Web Server (REST) that runs a full node and communicates blockchain results through JSON RPC or WebSockets opening the apps to new security risks A Browser (WEB) Peer to Peer solution would simplify the usage of the entire cryptocurrency system because everything (Wallets Blockchain Transactions Payments API) are handled in Javascript trustless running in every browser node js and OS As such every browser in the world can i) Run and connect as a Light node to the entire WebDollar blockchain network trustless in seconds ii) Mine instantly iii) Open Referral Pools iv) Store Digital Wallets in browser iv) Send and con\xef\xac\x81rm payments 2 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar 1 A brief history of money and cryptocurrencies evolution devolution and revolution Money responds primarily to the need for indirect exchange This need is natural and emerges immediately as an economy grows past the most basic levels As soon as the nexus of exchanges becomes greater than a few families and types of goods exchanged the problems of non coincidence of wants and indivisibility of directly exchanged goods become signi\xef\xac\x81cant When two individuals want to exchange two goods and have one of the aforementioned problems a third good is the solution The exchange becomes a two step process instead of a one step process First you buy an intermediary good with the good you want to sell Then you exchange some of the intermediary good (or medium of exchange) for the good you want to buy now or later Conceptually and historically we can see and understand how society selected money out of the goods it already produced A medium of exchange that is selected for its marketability out of other means of exchange and becomes accepted in virtually all exchanges and for all goods can be \xef\xac\x81nally called money What money can o\xef\xac\x80er that less adopted means of exchange cannot is social calculability This is a detail of tremendous importance When there is a constellation of prices obtained in de facto exchanges intermediated by a type of money it is possible for people to start thinking entrepreneurially in terms of that money and the possibilities for complex businesses are open This generalized adoption process is accompanied by a gradual increase in the purchasing power of money because more and more people demand it for its monetary services until virtually everybody has some of it on stock [9] There was a long process of selection out of which the precious metals gold and silver were singled out for their qualities of being easily standardized checked for authenticity divisible fungible relatively scarce \xe2\x80\x93 sand has all the other qualities \xe2\x80\x93 and not to take humans for less the emotional beings that they are for their sound and esthetics \xe2\x80\x93 precious metals are traditionally called sound money for this reason Commodity money was the money of the free market Precious metals were extracted and minted by merchants or local rulers in their e\xef\xac\x80ort to establish their brands and gain wider circulation in a competitive process Later it was merchants and bankers that started issuing money substitutes such as deposit certi\xef\xac\x81cates and banknotes to help with long distance payments clearing safekeeping and divisibility Parallel to this evolution there was a devolution of money The state has always hijacked usurped and destroyed for its own interest what the market produced in the interest of people It happened with money too The king\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly on minting the royal branding on coins debasement legal tender exchange rate controls fractional reserve banking \xef\xac\x81duciary substitutes and \xef\xac\x81nally \xef\xac\x81at money without any backing are all poisoned fruits of this devolution The juxtaposition of the dire state of money and banking on the one hand and the technological advancements of the internet on the other hand prompted a revolutionary 3 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar step The breakthrough came in 2008 when an anonymous programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a new peer to peer Proof of Work blockchain coin [0] The bene\xef\xac\x81ts include decentralization anonymity \xef\xac\x81nite supply and a matured blockchain infrastructure The solidity of the currency he created stood the test of time in the last 9 year and despite a few forks a bad reputation (unjustly associated with the dark web) and seeing wild \xef\xac\x82uctuations in value managed to not only thrive but also provide a model for a host of other cryptocurrencies that have followed As of January 2018 there are over 1400 cryptocurrencies valued at a total market capitalization of $740 billion USD Unlike conventional currency cryptocurrencies are not controlled/regulated by an authority their value is determined entirely by the market They are also impossible to counterfeit thanks to the complicated mathematical models that encrypt transactions with digital signatures ensuring privacy and security for every user At the time of writing this White Paper Bitcoin is at the historical value of 14 000 USD while the market capital value is reaching the psychological value of 250 billion USD However if we put those numbers in the context of the world \xef\xac\x81nancial system they seem meager \xe2\x80\x93 the entire Bitcoin capitalization is just 0 6% of the total \xef\xac\x81nancial value in the world If we add all the other cryptocurrencies to the mix we barely get to 2% of the world total This is partly due to the fact that cryptocurrencies are still a fringe and technical topic requiring specialized knowledge from their users The usage of cryptocurrencies is very limited and this excludes the older generations and the less IT literate people WebDollar aims to tackle this issue by creating the world\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81rst browser cryptocurrency where mining wallets transactions and other features are all browser based providing a level of simplicity never achieved before 2 WEB Blockchain Bitcoin is not a web application but a desktop software that you have to download and install on your computer in order to run the Bitcoin Node connecting to the network Without the internet Bitcoin can\xe2\x80\x99t be used but at the same time Bitcoin is NOT a WWW/Web HTTP Application that runs in the Browser and it requires one to download the entire blockchain history that is 219GB of raw data All these disadvantages make Bitcoin hard to be integrated into real life Web applications for P2P electronic payments Di\xef\xac\x83cult development of applications for Bitcoin is stopping Bitcoin from reaching massive adoption by the general public Bitcoin and all the Altcoins to date are still very hard to use by the mainstream In order to mine Bitcoin or check a transaction you have to manually install the Full Node software which is a desktop software application install it in your terminal con\xef\xac\x81gure your miner to a Pool (for mining) and then you need to download the entire blockchain history (219GB in 2019 respectively 1TB for Ethereum) WebDollar\xe2\x80\x99s solution to convert the desktop blockchain software into a Web Application together with a simple UI devoid of technical terms will make the blockchain accessible to everybody A research paper proposed by Aggelos Andrew and Dionysis proposes a new blockchain architecture called Non Interactive Proofs of Proofs of Work [2] introducing 4 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar interlinks pointers making the WebDollar very light and in the same time trustless Getting rid of the necessity to download the full blockchain also allows for smaller portable devices to be used for mining such as tablets and smartphones whose vast processing power lays mostly dormant Making the Blockchain available by a single click in the browser on the World Wide Web will boost the mass adoption by individuals and disrupt current Blockchain applications making them real time and easy to develop in the world WebDollar is a Web Blockchain Protocol allowing p2p transactions directly in browsers To include the WebDollar library on a web page you just need to write one line <script src=\xe2\x80\x9dcdn //WebDollar Protocol js\xe2\x80\x9d> Then your website with just a single click can mine have wallets send payments check the balance etc directly in the browser trustless using the NiPoPoW light blockchain To include the WebDollar User Interface on a web page you just need to write one line <script src=\xe2\x80\x9dcdn //WebDollar User Interface js\xe2\x80\x9d> Then automatically your website will have the entire User Interface functionality to mine webdollars verify transactions send transactions buy sell WEBD etc The Web is scalable while the Desktop is not For mIRC it took 10 years to get traction and eventually it became obsolete because it was a desktop software that used the internet while Facebook Messenger is a web application that runs online and it is easy to use anywhere on any device 5 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar 2 1 WebDollar Protocol Solution This WebDollar white paper proposes a mini blockchain scheme combined with a light trustless blockchain based on the Non Interactive Proofs of Proofs of Work [2] and a peer to peer scalable solution in Javascript that works directly in any web browser using WebRTC and Websockets for signaling only 2 2 Mining in WebDollar 1 Mining Pools \xe2\x80\x93 light nodes that use NiPoPoW proofs to verify proving the authenticity of the last K blocks without relying on a trusted party The Mining Pools will have to synchronize to the main network every time they start operating their mining pool 2 Mining Nodes \xe2\x80\x93 receive tasks of new proposed serialized blocks to mine from the Mining Pools ( Light Nodes) They just generate tons of nonces and apply the PoW Hash Function to see if the blocks\xe2\x80\x99 nonce respect the Mining Global Target (Di\xef\xac\x83culty) H (block + nonce) > T arget The Mining Pools manage and receive the puzzles to generate the next blocks 2 2 Peer to Peer directly in the Browser For security reasons even in the year 2018 the Websocket Server is not allowed to be initiated to listen to incoming connections on any browser Moreover the \xef\xac\x81rewalls and routers make opening Listening Servers a di\xef\xac\x83cult challenge to solve namely most machines will need to use either a STUN (Session Traversal of User Datagram Protocol) or TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) to connect each other directly in case one of them has symmetric NAT The only solution to listen to other connections in the browser is to use the newly introduced Peer to peer WebRTC protocol alongside a simple Signaling Protocol and a list of public STUN/TURN servers Peer to peer protocols for online payments couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done directly in the Browsers before the introduction of WebRTC protocol ( 2011 \xef\xac\x81rst introduction in Chrome) and their adoption by other browsers (Internet Explorer 2015 and Safari 2017) In 2008 when Satoshi proposed the Bitcoin Blockchain it was totally impossible to enable Browsers to support Peer to Peer communication and now Bitcoin cannot be used directly in the Browser 2 4 Signaling Protocol facilitating WebRTC peer to peer protocol to work WebRTC protocol to establish peer to peer connections between two browsers requires that the two browsers connect \xef\xac\x81rst to a common Signaling Server for acknowledging (signaling) each other WebDollar is proposing a new solution to this requirement by making a special compiled Bundle called the \xe2\x80\x9cWebDollar Protocol\xe2\x80\x9d that runs also in the Node js servers This bundle can open a Websocket server directly in the terminal facilitating the browsers to connect each other After the signaling process is done and the WebRTC connection is established between the two browsers each Peer will also become a Signaling Server for the other Web Peers 6 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar connected to them in order to propagate This will maximize the number of WebRTC peer to peer connections in the browser WebDollar peer to peer protocol for using WebRTC in a Web Blockchain 2 4 1 Facilitating for Symmetric NAT WebRTC Protocol has to use STUN and TURN ICE servers to allow browsers to generate ICE candidates connecting the browsers each others because otherwise it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be possible to identify themselves automatically Here is a list with some computers connected through socket io (client 1) while the others (webpeer2 and webpeer3) are using WebRTC Some computers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t connect because no TURN ICE server was provided 7 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar 2 5 Javascript The WebDollar was developed in Ecmascript 6 Using Babel and Browserify we were able to transpile the library into a pure Javascript bundle that can be executed by every modern browser in the world Javascript enables every Mobile Tablet Laptop Computer in the world to execute the Blockchain library directly in the Browser with just one click for Wallets Transactions Balance Check Blockchain (full node) Mining and other applications 2 6 Mini Blockchain for Accountant Tree 2 6 1 Blockchain Bitcoin is using Blockchain as a data structure in order to keep track of all the transactions done in the system involving valid bitcoin transfers [1] The Blockchain introduces the notation of Transaction but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any speci\xef\xac\x81c notation for Balance Merkle Trees are built in order to keep a public ledger of all the previous transactions validating them and allowing SPV (Simple Payment Veri\xef\xac\x81cation) The balance of an address is done by processing the Merkle Trees to \xef\xac\x81nd and validate previous transactions associated with that speci\xef\xac\x81c address In this way the balance of an address is calculated every time when requested in order to validate the funds of a speci\xef\xac\x81c transaction To calculate the balance the blockchain system requires to have the entire blockchain downloaded and stored on the drive and then for each transaction it needs to track down all the previous transactions involving the requested address and so on This leads to having to access the same multiple blocks many times and check multiple Merkle Trees in order to calculate a simple balance 8 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar The above diagram shows the proposed solution of Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s Blockchain concept and a sample Merkle Tree that contains the hashes of a couple of transactions The challenge that comes with Blockchain is that over time the size of the blockchain increases exponentially due to the fact that blockchains accept micropayments and each of these transactions requires Merkle Trees which are also large in data For example after just 8 years Bitcoin blockchain size is 140GB of data while Ethereum is 80 GB of data and they are still growing Because we aim to run the Blockchain in the Browser only Full Nodes (but not Miners and Light Nodes) will have to download the entire blockchain data which will further promote WebDollar as a viable solution for mass adoption by the general public 2 6 2 Mini blockchain Scheme Mini blockchain Scheme [1] is a di\xef\xac\x80erent implementation of a blockchain solution that \xe2\x80\x9celiminates\xe2\x80\x9d the concept of unspent output transactions and introduces a new concept of balance The mini blockchain scheme introduces a new data structure called an Accountant Tree in order to keep track of balances of all non zero addresses The accountant tree is just a Radix (Patricia) Tree of storing the balances for all non zero addresses So instead of storing the transactions and a Merkle Tree of transactions the mini blockchain scheme stores a Radix (Patricia) Tree for the balances of all non zero addresses Radix (Patricia) Trees must be combined with a Merkle Tree to allow SPV (Simple Payment Veri\xef\xac\x81cation) for ultra light nodes that will only download the NiPoPoW proofs and just a logarithmic number of hashes in order to validate a balance or to validate a smart contract Ethereum is the most known blockchain technology that uses Radix (Patricia) Merkle Trees 9 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar The blocks in the mini blockchain scheme contains header hashes for validations (like in the normal blockchain scheme) and instead of transactions the blocks contain the changes that must be done to the Accountant Tree and the new hashes Pruning can also be done after a long period of time when the mini blockchain ensures safety to prune very old blocks but keeping a long not pruned blockchain By pruning the very old blocks this will mean that some transactions can be discarded maximizing a little bit the anonymity of the addresses 10 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar 2 7 Non Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work Non Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work is proposed by Aggelos Kiayias Andrew Miller and Dionysis Zindros [2] WebDollar has two types of nodes 1 Full Nodes (trustless nodes) have a complete snapshot of the blockchain (or the last M blocks from the blockchain where \xce\x94T M could be 1 year or 2 years) and they are required to be used in the WebRTC signaling process to connect two browsers each others We term the name of Provers to the full nodes that are able to generate NiPoPoW Proofs used by the light nodes 2 Light Nodes (trustless nodes) receive the NiPoPoW Proofs from multiple Provers and identify the honest nodes from attackers by verifying the proofs and determine the most di\xef\xac\x83cult and valid proofs given from all nodes Light Nodes are known also as Veri\xef\xac\x81ers The \xef\xac\x81rst notion introduced in NiPoPoW by [2] is that they extends the Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s [0] Blocks with a new data structure called interlinks a vector containing pointers to multiple previous blocks including the hash of the previous block The interlink data structure contains pointers to more blocks than just the previous block [2] So every block instead of pointing only to the previous block the NiPoPoW interlinks vector points to some previous blocks with the property that an algorithm presented in [2] can trace back to the Genesis Block Given two hash functions H and G modelled as random oracles the hash known also as id of a block is de\xef\xac\x81ned as hash(Block) = H(nonce G( Block data interlink)) In WebDollar H and G are to be proposed Argon2d as ASIC resistant and GPU not very friendly Valid blocks satisfy the proof of work condition hash(Block) \xe2\x89\xa4 T where T is the global mining target from the main network Some blocks will achieve a lower id If hash(Block) \xe2\x89\xa4 T 2\xc2\xb5 we say that the block is of level \xc2\xb5 All blocks are level 0 (Genesis) Blocks with level \xc2\xb5 are called \xc2\xb5 superblocks \xc2\xb5 superblocks for \xc2\xb5 > 0 are also (\xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\x92 1) superblocks By convention for Gen we set hash = 0 and \xc2\xb5 = \xe2\x88\x9e Graphical depiction of Interlink \xc2\xb5 levels data structure stored in each block [13] 11 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar To describe the security properties of the blockchains that are equipped with the newly introduced interlink data structure a few new concept of chain quality inspired by the de\xef\xac\x81nition of this property called superchain quality were introduced (Locally good superchain) A superchain C \xe2\x80\xb2 of level \xc2\xb5 with underlying chain C is said to be \xc2\xb5 locally good with respect to security parameter \xce\xb4 is de\xef\xac\x81ned as follows local \xe2\x88\x92 g ood\xce\xb4 (C \xe2\x80\xb2 C \xc2\xb5) if \xe2\x88\xa3C \xe2\x80\xb2 \xe2\x88\xa3 > (1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb4) 2\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\xa3C\xe2\x88\xa3 where \xe2\x88\xa3C\xe2\x88\xa3 = length of C (Superchain super quality) The (\xce\xb4 m) super quality property of a chain C pertaining to level \xc2\xb5 with security parameters \xce\xb4 \xe2\x88\x88 R and m \xe2\x88\x88 N states that for all m\xe2\x80\xb2 \xe2\x89\xa5 m it holds the following property That is all su\xef\xac\x83ciently large su\xef\xac\x83xes are locally good local \xe2\x88\x92 g ood\xce\xb4 (C\xe2\x86\x91\xc2\xb5 [\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\xb2 ] C\xe2\x86\x91\xc2\xb5 [\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\xb2 ] \xe2\x86\x93 \xc2\xb5) where C \xe2\x86\x91\xc2\xb5 is upchain de\xef\xac\x81ned as {B \xe2\x88\x88 C \xe2\x88\xa3 level(B) \xe2\x89\xa5 \xc2\xb5} C \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x86\x93C is downchain de\xef\xac\x81ned as C [ C \xe2\x80\xb2 [0] C \xe2\x80\xb2 [\xe2\x88\x921] ] (Multilevel quality) A \xc2\xb5 superchain C\xe2\x80\x99 is said to have multilevel quality written multi \xe2\x88\x92 g ood\xce\xb4 k1 (C C \xe2\x80\xb2 \xc2\xb5) with respect to an underlying chain C = C\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x86\x93 with security parameters k 1 \xce\xb4 if for all \xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\x99 < \xc2\xb5 it holds that for any C * \xe2\x8a\x86 C if \xe2\x88\xa3C * \xe2\x86\x91\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2 \xe2\x88\xa3 \xe2\x89\xa5 k 1 then \xe2\x88\xa3C \xe2\x88\x97 \xe2\x86\x91\xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\xa3 \xe2\x89\xa5 (1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb4) 2\xc2\xb5\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2 \xe2\x88\xa3C \xe2\x88\x97 \xe2\x86\x91\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2 \xe2\x88\xa3 In case it will not have the last property then multilevel quality will not exist (Good superchain) A \xc2\xb5 superchain C\xe2\x80\x99 is said to be good written good\xce\xb4 k1 (C C \xe2\x80\xb2 \xc2\xb5) with respect to an underlying chain C = C \xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x86\x93 if it has both super quality and multilevel quality with parameters (\xce\xb4 m) NiPoPoW Veri\xef\xac\x81ed algorithm for Light Nodes Light Node = Veri\xef\xac\x81er Full Node = Prover 1 The Veri\xef\xac\x81er starts to connect to the main network made of Provers and Attackers noted as P via Sockets and WebRTC 2 Thee Veri\xef\xac\x81er starts to ask the Provers or other Light Nodes for the NiPoPoW proofs (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) where \xcf\x80 is the proof and \xcf\x87 last k blocks 3 The Veri\xef\xac\x81er collects the NiPoPoW proofs (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) \xe2\x88\x88 P and starts validating the Proofs \xef\xb8\xbf from the P set by checking v alidChain(\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) \xe2\x88\xa7 \xe2\x88\xa3\xcf\x87\xe2\x88\xa3 = k \xe2\x88\xa7 \xcf\x80 \xe2\x89\xa5m \xcf\x80 and it will choose the \xef\xb8\xbf \xef\xb8\xbf best (most di\xef\xac\x83cult) proof (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) from the set (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) \xe2\x88\x88 P by using a de\xef\xac\x81ned operator \xe2\x89\xa5m that

(\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) the Light Node \xef\xb8\xbf needs to ask to receive the blocks after \xcf\x87 by validating these new blocks\xe2\x80\x99 interlinks In case the fork is in the past and it is short the Veri\xef\xac\x81er can check the fork if it is right \xef\xb8\xbf not but in case the fork is longer than \xcf\x87 the Veri\xef\xac\x81er will require another NiPoPoW proof for that fork \xcf\x80A

proof (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) and in case it already has the (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) proof it will just send it to the Light Node In case it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) already calculated it will just generate the (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) by the following steps 2 It takes a \xc2\xb5 superchain and the last m blocks by \xef\xac\x81lling a range of blocks with blocks from the superchain of level \xc2\xb5\xe2\x88\x921 below that respects the good\xce\xb4 m property namely M ultilevel quality and S uperchain super quality All the \xc2\xb5 superblocks which are within this m blocks range will also be (\xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\x92 1) superblocks and so we do not want to keep them in the proof twice 13 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar 2 6 3 WebDollar Transaction The initial WebDollar transactions will enable the moving of funds from one address to an unlimited number of output addresses The input of a WebDollar Transaction is just one address while the output can be multiple output addresses The transaction must be signed using an elliptic curve algorithm Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) WebDollar test net used the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in the 2008 original Bitcoin implementation y 2 = x3 + 7 Other remarkable ECDSA includes Schnorr signatures that agrees on a group G of prime order q with generator of g in which the discrete logarithm problem is assumed to be hard to crack on current computers (but not on quantum computers) A Schnorr signature is a hash function H {0 1} * \xe2\x86\x92 Z q 2 7 Hybrid Mining WebDollar is the \xef\xac\x81rst browser hybrid mining with a special mining design which is composed with 2 di\xef\xac\x80erent mining algorithms WebDollar\xe2\x80\x99s hybrid algorithm includes 33 (3)% Proof of Work & 66 (6)% Proof of Stake which is increasing the security of the network especially to avoid 50%+1 attacks Using two di\xef\xac\x80erent di\xef\xac\x83culty targets one for 14 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar PoS and one for PoW this algorithm is decreasing the exposing risk for an 50%+1 PoW attack The attacker cannot make a 50%+1 using only PoW power even he has 100% of the PoW power of the network he will also need 33 (3)% of the circulation supply in order to have a chance to make a 50%+1 attack and an attack where you\xe2\x80\x99re a big holder doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any logic In order to achieve consensus in the network WebDollar is using the cainhash which represents the identity of the main chain to avoid the network splitting into forks betweenPoS rounds One round contains 10 blocks Each round has only one di\xef\xac\x83culty target for PoS respectively PoW Our hybrid mining is composed with repetitive rounds cycles of 1 PoW round and 2 PoS rounds One full cycle has 3 rounds (30 blocks) A Proof of Work Mining ASIC resistant and GPU unfriendly WebDollar is designed to be a Proof of Work blockchain like Bitcoin at least at the beginning The only di\xef\xac\x80erence is that we propose the mining to be ASIC and GPU resistant which will lead towards mass adoption by users not promote a hardware intensive backbone We want to avoid the clustering of large mining farms because this will make the network and mining more centralized and pro\xef\xac\x81table only to a few who invest large sums in dedicated computers Using ASIC resistant hashing we want to have more and more people involved in the mining process creating a social layer on the mining process We have analyzed a couple of ASIC resistant hash functions including Scrypt Argon2 (Argon2d) and Cuckoo Cycle At the moment we propose an Argon2d function for Hashing because in 2017 Argon2d is probably the best ASIC resistant hash function but it is a little bit GPU friendly for the new video cards The WebDollar community should also consider adopting other ASIC resistant hash functions in the near future for avoiding ASIC or dedicated mining computers (quantum etc ) including CryptoNight that is only CPU friendly because of the high usage of the CPU 2mb cache To avoid mining farms made by GPU WebDollar community should adapt CryptoNight or other CPU cache intensive for the PoW Hash Function In PoW each Block contains a Transactions Merkle Tree respectively an Account Tree/Radix (Patricia) Tree for mini blockchain The blocks are hashed through a Hashing function in order to validate it and the previous blocks making the network choose only the largest blockchain fork of the network A \xe2\x80\x9chash\xe2\x80\x9d is an injective and non invertible function h (x) = y Usually x = (M S ) where M is the message we want to hash and S is a salt ( a random string ) A hash has a few more properties i) Determinism ii) De\xef\xac\x81ned range iii) Continuity iv) collision resistance (injectivity) v) Compression 15 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar A hash function h(x) = y to be ASIC resistant must be memory intensive where a memory array B [] must be \xef\xac\x81lled with a compression function G and indexing functions \xcf\x86i() B [0] = H( M S ) B [i] = G (B[\xcf\x861(i)] B[\xcf\x862(i)] \xc2\xb7 \xc2\xb7 \xc2\xb7 B[\xcf\x86k(i)]) i = 1 t Argon2 [3] is based on a internal permutation compression function G with two inputs of 1024 byte a 1024 byte output and an internal a B lake2b hash function H For avoiding parallelism the function G is iterated m times To be memory intensive at the step i a block with index \xcf\x86(i) < i is taken from the memory array B [] and \xcf\x86(i) is either determined by the previous block in Argon2d The generalization of Argon2 ( t > 1 ) is described in [3] where it clearly shows the memory intensive usage B t [i][0] = G(B t\xe2\x88\x921 [i][ q \xe2\x88\x92 1] B[ i\xe2\x80\xb2 ][ j \xe2\x80\xb2 ]) \xe2\x8a\x95 B t\xe2\x88\x921 [i][0] B t [i][j] = G(B t [i][ j \xe2\x88\x92 1] B[ i\xe2\x80\xb2 ][ j \xe2\x80\xb2 ]) \xe2\x8a\x95 B t\xe2\x88\x921 [i][j] where \xe2\x8a\x95 is X OR and block B[ i\xe2\x80\xb2 ][ j \xe2\x80\xb2] may be either B t [ i\xe2\x80\xb2 ][ j \xe2\x80\xb2 ] for j \xe2\x80\xb2 < j or B t\xe2\x88\x921 [ i\xe2\x80\xb2][ j \xe2\x80\xb2 ] for j > j \xe2\x80\xb2 Once the T iterations have been done over the entire memory array B [] it is necessary to compute the \xef\xac\x81nal block B f inal by XOR ing the last columns B f inal = B T [0][q \xe2\x88\x92 1] \xe2\x8a\x95 B T [1][q \xe2\x88\x92 1] \xe2\x8a\x95 \xc2\xb7 \xc2\xb7 \xc2\xb7 \xe2\x8a\x95 B T [p \xe2\x88\x92 1][q \xe2\x88\x92 1] It is obvious that Argon2 is memory intensive to calculate B f inal in order to get the output of the hash function This property of being memory intensive at the moment in 2017 put great challenges for semiconductor manufacturers to create fast and optimized Application Speci\xef\xac\x81c Integrated Circuits and to scale that memory on every device By using Argon2d or in the future other memory intensive hash functions WebDollar would be mined by the computers of individuals and not by mining farms Satoshi had this idea of \xe2\x80\x9c1 cpu 1 vote\xe2\x80\x9d ASICs and GPUs unbalance the mining and this forces individuals to acquire dedicated hardware for mining This unbalance will push into a centralized mining by only controlled more and more by the people who has accept to acquire fast the best ASICs and best GPUs on the market 16 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar B Proof of Stake Mining instant reward SHA256(prevhash + address + timestamp) <= 2^256 * balance / diff WebDollar Proof of Stake algorithm is using the above formula Each wallet involved in staking has a number of chances directly proportionally with the balance of the wallet divided to all others stakes The di\xef\xac\x83culty target for Proof of Stake is adjusting every PoS round (10 blocks) Using chainHash WebDollar is avoiding to create unwanted forks in the network By this way chainHash is keeping all nodes from the network aware of the main Blockchain PoS rounds 2 8 Mining Di\xef\xac\x83culty WebDollar is a blockchain Proof of Work decentralized solution and we propose this Mining Di\xef\xac\x83culty inspired from the Bitcoin The di\xef\xac\x83culty of a block is noted as \xce\x9b while timestamp of a block is noted as \xce\x93 The Bitcoin Di\xef\xac\x83culty is adjusted every 2016 blocks ( 2 \xc2\xb7 7 \xc2\xb7 24 \xc2\xb7 60 min \xc2\xb7 1 / block time where block time is 10 min ) The di\xef\xac\x83culty can described as the following if the \xce\x94T to get 2016 new blocks was less than 2 weeks \xe2\x87\x92 Di\xef\xac\x83culty will be increased otherwise \xe2\x87\x92 Di\xef\xac\x83culty will be reduced The formula that recalculates the di\xef\xac\x83culty every 2016 blocks is based on algorithm that uses a modi\xef\xac\x81ed Taylor series for the logarithm [4] The disadvantage of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s di\xef\xac\x83culty is that in case a large mining pool will just turn o\xef\xac\x80 their mining devices the di\xef\xac\x83culty will be hard in the system for the next 2016 blocks ( 2 weeks) and the decentralized system will have a long pending list of transactions 2 8 1 WebDollar Mining Di\xef\xac\x83culty The \xef\xac\x81rst proposed WebDollar Proof of Work mining Di\xef\xac\x83culty is based on the Ethereum Homestead di\xef\xac\x83culty that adjust the next Target every block (namely 15 seconds) but eliminating the \xe2\x80\x9cbomb\xe2\x80\x9d equation [6] \xce\x9bT = \xce\x9bT \xe2\x88\x921 + \xce\x9bT \xe2\x88\x921 2048 \xc2\xb7 max( 1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\x93T \xe2\x88\x92\xce\x93T \xe2\x88\x921 10 99) where the division is integer division the fractional part (remainder) is discarded \xce\x94T = 1 \xce\x9b is adjusted every block and block time is 15 seconds 2 9 Transactions Per Second Centralized Systems for the next years will still outnumber the decentralized systems Ripple for instance it is not a Blockchain technology and it is not decentralized The Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s 17 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar network theoretical maximum capacity with the 1MB block size limit sits between 3 3 to 7 transactions per second (tps)[13] Bitcoin 10 min/block 1 MB block size => 3 3 tps (low) or 7 tps (high) WebDollar 40sec/block 1 MB block size => 132 tps (low) or 280 tps (high) Future settings in the near future Block every 5 seconds 1 MB block size => 396 tps (low) or 840 tps (high) Block every 5 seconds 8 MB block size => 3168 tps (low) or 6720 tps ( high) These are pure estimates based on the current Bitcoin scalability numbers By lowering the block time generator it will create longer blockchain forks in the world This can be achieved over time when the internet latency will lower By increasing the block size it will make light nodes to download more data to validate the NiPoPoW (\xcf\x80 \xcf\x87) proof This can be achieved over time when the internet latency will lower Lightning Network and o\xef\xac\x80 chain transactions are also taken in consideration to increase the number of transactions per second 2 10 Monetary Supply The medium of exchange function is the primary function of money All others are secondary such as store of value and unit of account [10] For this primary function to be ful\xef\xac\x81lled any quantity of money is su\xef\xac\x83cient The pricing of money (establishment on the market of its purchasing power or the formation of the prices for virtually all goods) is dependent on its supply and demand In the case of goods selected as means of exchange the non monetary use is less and less important than the monetary use The monetary use involves transfers and preservation of substance whereas in the case of non monetary uses consumption involves substantive loss (from an economic point of view) Thus the physical destruction of money through usage is insigni\xef\xac\x81cant when compared with other goods and even in the case of commodity money an increasing supply of it is not necessary This is another reason why precious metals whose supply is naturally di\xef\xac\x83cult to boost were considered suitable as money When discussing the monetary function economists try to understand the laws that apply to monetary uses and ignore the non monetary uses Economists have argued since David Hume that any quantity of money is always optimal Increasing the quantity of money does not increase the services rendered by money This observation was only quali\xef\xac\x81ed by the fact that the non monetary uses of money justi\xef\xac\x81ed an increasing supply of it 18 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar Cryptocurrencies are closer to being purely money in this sense because their intangibility makes them less suited for non monetary uses The age old observation about the optimality of any quantity of money is ful\xef\xac\x81lled even better in their case WebDollar follows Bitcoin in adopting this model of a \xef\xac\x81xed supply with gradual release Cryptocurrencies are rather like commodity money to the extent that their supply is not discretionary In the case of precious metals production has to compete with all other uses that its valuable factors of production can service It is in this way impersonal In the case of cryptocurrency this impersonal character is maximized with a \xef\xac\x81xed supply Any in\xef\xac\x82ationary model is a suboptimal solution a compromise from scienti\xef\xac\x81c rigor because it includes a particular judgement about how the new coins should dilute the value of old coins A cryptocurrency that allows for any degree of discretion in the future is further compromised from the start Having a \xef\xac\x81xed supply and a continually changing demand established by the market solves a problem of uncertainty and makes the price adjustment model simpler Bitcoin controlled supply is based solely on a scarcity model The rate of block creation is adjusted every 2016 blocks to aim for a constant 2 week adjustment period The number of bitcoins generated per block is set to decrease geometrically with a 50% reduction every 210 000 blocks or approximately 4 years The result is that the number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million The block reward \xce\xa9 adjustment can be approximately modelled by the following equation [5] 25 inf \xe2\x88\x91 \xce\xa9 (Blockheight ) = height=0 \xe2\x88\x91 21\xc2\xb7 i=0 50 10 8 2i 104 The decreasing generation algorithm was chosen because it approximates the rate at which commodities like gold are mined in the real world This decreasing supply algorithm increases the value of the coin based on scarcity 2 10 1 Emission scheme Total supply 42 000 000 000 (42 Billion) WEBD Named subunit WebCent = 0 01 WEBD Smallest subunit 0 0001 WEBD The coins will be issued through mining over a 100 year time span with 9 9% (4 1568 Billion) reserved for WebDollar Genesis 19 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar Emission charts 20 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar Genesis split The WEBD reserved from the Genesis will be used for the further development of the technology & ecosystem and to reward the development work done so far They will be distributed as follows and released gradually according to the funding needs of the project Also all the pro\xef\xac\x81ts from mining with Genesys will be used for promoting WebDollar in form of bounty campaigns and rewards for contributors 2 10 2 De\xef\xac\x82ation and hoarding is there a reason to worry People erroneously refer to the model above as a de\xef\xac\x82ationary model Here we need to clarify that there are two uses of the words de\xef\xac\x82ation or in\xef\xac\x82ation \xe2\x97\x8f in\xef\xac\x82ation or de\xef\xac\x82ation of money supply or \xe2\x97\x8f in\xef\xac\x82ation or de\xef\xac\x82ation of prices The classical and relevant use in our case is the \xef\xac\x81rst So technically speaking the WebDollar money supply is \xef\xac\x81xed If less people would demand it then its purchasing power would be lower (prices expressed in WEBD would increase) so it becomes price in\xef\xac\x82ationary \xe2\x80\x93 although early massive adoption would have price de\xef\xac\x82ationary e\xef\xac\x80ects Markets can deal both with a general high level in prices and with a general low one Price de\xef\xac\x82ation does not lead to depression [12] Hoarding is just an emotionally charged name for demand for money and there is no problem with it from an economic point of view Intensive demand for money during the \xef\xac\x81rst phases of a worldwide adoption process is to be expected and welcomed not countered One particularity of any cryptocurrency is that it is in\xef\xac\x81nitely divisible because it is intangible Gold could be minted in small coins only to a point beyond which it became impractical to use The reason silver was adopted at times instead of or along gold to ful\xef\xac\x81ll the money role was its increased abundance and capability to serve in small everyday payments despite its other disadvantages to gold (e g tarnishing) Such coexistence of moneys is impractical because it introduces the need to keep account of the exchange rate between to two metallic moneys One major blight of monetary history was the inability or malevolence of authorities that enacted a \xef\xac\x81xed exchange rate between the two also known as bimetallism This \xef\xac\x81xed bimetallism often engendered Gresham e\xef\xac\x80ects \xe2\x80\x93 overvalued money replacing undervalued money on the market \xe2\x80\x93 to the great losses of market actors 21 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar This \xef\xac\x82exible exchange rate between two moneys is not to be confused with the de\xef\xac\x81nitions of subdivisions in the case of one money that are always \xef\xac\x81xed as with the relation between one ounce of gold and half an ounce or 100 grams and 1 gram Likewise banknotes and deposits emerged as substitutes for metallic money to solve payment security divisibility and portability problems In the case of honest issuers the issue was perfectly covered in money reserves and again there was a \xef\xac\x81xed de\xef\xac\x81nition of the substitute in terms of metallic reserves not a variable price The arrival of the blockchain solves portability security and payment to di\xef\xac\x80erent degrees with di\xef\xac\x80erent cryptocurrencies Moreover \xe2\x80\x93 and the importance of this fact cannot be overemphasized \xe2\x80\x93 cryptocurrencies do not have the divisibility problem As we can see in the case of Bitcoin technically it is possible to divide one bitcoin into 100 million satoshis with intermediary bitcents milibits and microbits While not technical the divisibility problem is rather psychological In expectation of a very steep worldwide adoption curve on a scale several orders higher than Bitcoin we decided to assign to our one time creation of the \xef\xac\x81xed WebDollar supply a corresponding granularity A technical problem that Bitcoin has not solved satisfactorily and WebDollar is designed to solve is the portability problem The relatively low number of transactions is not caused by hoarding but by the technical speci\xef\xac\x81cations of Bitcoin We consider that this is the reason why we see such low transaction numbers and high fees for cryptocurrencies from the Bitcoin family 2 11 Security concerns WebDollar implementation is using the mini blockchain scheme for storing the Accountant Tree instead of using Transactions Merkle Trees The security concerns for using the mini blockchain are very similar to Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Work Blockchain solution and it has been proven to be safe in Ethereum WebDollar Full nodes are inheriting all the security advantages and properties from the blockchain PoW solution proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in [0] WebDollar Light nodes that download only the Non Interactive proofs will inherit all the properties and security concerns from the NiPoPoW Non Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work [2] By having also a main net of Full Nodes (it is required to have node js servers for WebRTC signals) the attacker will also need to attack the honest Full Nodes from the main network or at least to either to generate better NiPoPoW proofs or suspend (stop) the connections with honest full nodes 2 11 1 Security in Blockchain 2 11 1 1 Change History Attack 22 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar To hack the blockchain the attacker needs to build a longer valid blockchain To build a longer valid blockchain the attacker will need a considerable % of the main network hashrate Because of this in case the attacker will fail to have >= 50% of global hashrate the attacker is in a competition with other honest miners and it will be more pro\xef\xac\x81table for him to become a WebDollar miner instead of remaking the blockchain from scratch or even forking the blockchain to keep the rewards for himself So to change an old history is almost impossible for an attacker because it requires to own more than 50% of global hash rate and sustain it in secret for a considerable time to make a successful fork that changes signi\xef\xac\x81cant history This way an attacker could maximum create a fork altering only recent events and keep the recent rewards from miners for himself In case the attacker doesn t posses a next generation technological advantage (quantum computer) the attacker must have the network domination over a similar ~timespan as since the genesis block began 2 11 1 2 Double Spending Attack Attackers that dominates a large percentage of the Main Network can try to create some double spending attacks in the Blockchain Technology by creating and mining their own forks Thankfully Blockchain handles very well the double spending attacks making the attacks probabilistic and not guaranteed Actually Satoshi Nakamoto did even some computer simulations in 2008 [0] to calculate the probabilities of some double spend attacks with di\xef\xac\x80erent percentages of the network dominance In reality the probabilities of success for an attacker are very small and it would be way more pro\xef\xac\x81table for him to mine the coin and not to try uncertain attacks that may lose money Nowadays Bitcoin is more vulnerable to Double Spending than never especially because the mining pools started to become more centralized The top 4 mining pools (see diagram) are all from China and they own over > 50% of the entire Bitcoin Global Hashrate This means a collaborative attack from these four chinese Mining Pools could have a signi\xef\xac\x81cant probability to launch a successful Double Spending Attack but not guaranteed WebDollar allows the creation of mining pools and referral link sharing to other people who would like to mine in that mining pool This way WebDollar will decentralize the mining pools reducing considerably the risks for Double Spending Attacks In addition to this mining with Genesys funds will considerably improve the security against 50%+1 attack considering Genesys amount in relation to the global distribution 2 11 1 2 1 Double Spending Attack Solution #2 TBA 23 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar 2 11 2 Quantum Threat Absolutely but absolutely all cryptographic functions used in Banks Stock Exchange Internet Security communications and Bitcoin are threatened in 20 30 years by Quantum supercomputers Although Quantum supercomputers are not a today s\xe2\x80\x99 reality D Wave quantum computer is an Adiabatic Annealing Machine that can solve probabilistic only Adiabatic Equations are D Wave is NOT a General Quantum Computer So Adiabatic Annealing Machines like D Wave can not be used to generate 2256 or even 2128 to crack either the private keys or respectively the digital signatures by cracking the the elliptic curves (ECDSA Schnorr) used in Bitcoin or in WebDollar The only solution in that very unlucky scenario in the next 20 years is to make the system more quantum resistance is that instead of working with 32 bytes private & public keys 20 bytes for public addresses the protocol should work with way longer private keys and addresses But this is not ideally because of high memory usage in blocks moreover also at the moment there is no real threat from adiabatic quantum computers but also for the next years 2 11 2 1 Reducing Addresses\xe2\x80\x99 private key collisions from 2^96 down to 0 The biggest issue in Bitcoin is that although the total numbers of private keys and public keys are 2256 the total number of unique addresses in the Bitcoin system is 2160 This exploit appears because in Bitcoin early Bitcoin programmer Hal Finney used the RIP EM D (SHA256 ( publicKey )) function reducing the length of the addresses by converting the public address keys from 256 bits into 160 bits addresses RIPEMD hash function initial purpose was to be used as a backup in case the SHA256 could have been cracked The problem is that RIPEMD160 is generating Bitcoin addresses making a lot of collisions that all addresses have multiple private keys attached The birthday problem can be applied to estimate the probability of addresses collisions given the size of the hash function [7] The Probability Calculations in Hashing [8] can be used tp to estimate the private key collisions in public addresses as follows To get all k = 2160 addresses it is enough to use k * ln(k) + k = 160 * 2160 + 2160 = 161 * 2160 = 2167 32 keys If you use only 2160 private keys you will have about 63% of all addresses [7] Although 2160 seams a big number by using the RIPEMD160 the system could be attacked by an early and primitive Quantum computer that can generate 2167 quickly and could crack all Bitcoin addresses By extending the domain of the addresses from 2160 to 2256 this will give WebDollar an extra bu\xef\xac\x80er time in case in the near future (10 20 years) a real 24 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar quantum computer will be invented and able to generate cracking the RIPEMD 2160 function but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to generate 2256 so quickly as cracking 2160 2 11 2 2 Increasing Quantum Resistance By replacing the RIPEMD160 with SHA256 the security exploit for a future Quantum computer still remains in In order to solve this we propose that WebDollar over the time should use more Quantum resistant cryptographic functions The advantage is that the community can create a hard fork replacing the obsolete ECDSA to use a Post Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) functions or to use functions like Winternitz signatures (~1 4kb) instead of using 256 bit Elliptic Curve Cryptography At the moment it is not very useful to switch to Post Quantum Cryptographic functions because all PQC functions use way much memory to store the signatures than by using regular 256 bit Elliptic Curves 3 The advantages of WebDollar A Simplicity Our goal is to create and foster the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies In order to make that vision a reality we need to address all kinds of users not just the tech savvy like all the other cryptos do For that we aim to create the simplest possible user experience with regard to using cryptocurrencies And in our quest to achieve that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the basic premise that while very few people know how to mine Bitcoin or install a software wallet just about everybody knows how to use a browser This is why WebDollar was designed from day one to be native to browsers and to the World Wide Web Written entirely in Javascript WebDollar will be available directly in your browser That means \xe2\x97\x8f No Installation \xe2\x97\x8f No Download \xe2\x97\x8f Mining directly in the landing page Unlike any other crypto you will be able to mine and create value for yourself in less than 5 seconds just with a simple click on a button Not only it is simple but it is also fair Our hash function of choice Argon2d at the moment does not create a preference for specialized hardware and you can run it e\xef\xac\x83ciently on any PC Also you can run as many threads as your hardware allows having full control on the impact on your processing power \xe2\x97\x8f Access your wallet fast and safe in the browser Without going through the hassle of installing dedicated complicated software and generating private keys that you have to save somewhere else you can generate a new wallet with a single click and easily access from there all the needed functionalities while not compromising security o Send or receive payments o See your transactions o Check your balance 25 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar B Versatility of mining hardware In order to make it easy for everybody to use it anytime and anywhere we rely on a light blockchain structure involving the usage of mini blockchain scheme and Non Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work (NiPoPoW) consensus building That greatly reduces the size of the data that has to be downloaded into the browser in order to be able to become consensus and start having a mining pool in the browser In turn this created the opportunity to mine on any PC or laptop regardless of disk space and even to mine on mobile devices tablets and smartphones C Rethink mining from the bottom Mining is a slang term for the veri\xef\xac\x81cation of transactions We have been using the term \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d for so long that sometimes we forget it is a social act \xe2\x80\x93 one that creates trust in the network without the need of a centralized authority The way the traditional POW cryptos were mined and the GPU/ASIC intensive hash functions were used over time tended to stimulate the centralization of the network around large mining centers where processing power and hardware have the ultimate say This has created an undesirable situation in which the network is dependent on the political climate in certain countries For example for Bitcoin 80% of the processing power of the network is based in China and over 50% of the network control lies in the hands of the 4 mining farms This goes against the vision that Satoshi Nakamoto himself had for the Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x93 to be a decentralized coin WebDollar wishes to return to that vision by rethinking mining from a hardware intensive activity to a social activity We do that by using a hash function that does not create a preference for specialized hardware (is ASIC resistant) and by creating a referral system Everybody can easily earn from referrals when inviting friends to create wealth together by mining in a pool Through this social network approach both the \xe2\x80\x9cregular miners\xe2\x80\x9d and the pool owner gain value \xe2\x80\x93 for each reward obtained by people mining in one\xe2\x80\x99s pool the pool owner gains a small percentage This encourages a strong stimulus to create expand and maintain mining pools thus decentralizing the network It will also help create the initial awareness for WebDollar by capitalizing on the early adopters\xe2\x80\x99 social networks D Create real value for content creators and monetize your social network You can do this by embedding a script in your webpage that harnesses the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 processing power to create value for you in a consensual transparent way No more need to insert ads into your website or beg for support on donation sites You can directly capitalize your tra\xef\xac\x83c by easily inserting a script that creates value for you based on the frequency and duration of visits on your site with users permission 26 \x0cWebDollar io github/WebDollar E Smart contracts The primary purpose of WebDollar is to act as currency on the World Wide Web to truly become the currency of the internet To expand on this view WebDollar aims to support smart contracts which will allow decentralized organizations to create their own tokens taking full advantage of the technological upper hand of our protocol F Anonymity By using an optional o\xef\xac\x80 chain solution we will be able to provide to our users the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of full anonymity far superior to the level of anonymity o\xef\xac\x80ered by Bitcoin or Ethereum G The speed of transaction con\xef\xac\x81rmation In order to be a scalable digital currency any crypto has to have a fast transaction con\xef\xac\x81rmation time To meet that objective our protocol matches some of the fastest transaction con\xef\xac\x81rmation speeds generating a new block every 40 seconds H Logarithmic fees policy WebDollar aims to become a widespread and very easy method of transferring value on the internet In order to stimulate the \xef\xac\x82ow of WebDollars we devised a logarithmic function for calculating the fees Starting from a very small value (we have implemented a Large numbers function allowing for up to 18 decimals) the value of the fee expressed as a percentage of the transaction value becomes smaller and smaller as the value transaction gets larger The fees for monetary transactions will be considerably less than current digital services like Visa PayPal or Western Union I Integrated end user app for money transfer By using our peer to peer exchange facility you will be able to send money directly from your account to someone on the other side of the globe in their own account or crypto wallet via an automatic o\xef\xac\x80 chain exchange service using WebDollars J Creating an inclusive healthy and diverse ecosystem With the funds reserved for Genesys we aim to further expand the crypto community by hardening the real economy behind the WebDollar value integration for payments in real online services and creating a marketplace are two of the top actions to be undertaken in this direction WebDollar will build on Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s original intention to create a truly decentralized coin by rethinking mining from a hardware intensive activity to a social one With WebDollar your time IS money 27 \x0cWebDollar
