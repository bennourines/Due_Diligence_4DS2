our team the overall ecological situation on the planet is worsening exponentially due to the increase in world production and technology development Hundreds of millions of tons of domestic solid waste (trash garbage refuse rubbish) which is a waste type consisting of everyday items are generated annually by people Up to 45% of domestic solid waste (or municipal solid waste MSW) is not declared worldwide as per our estimate That means that such a big share of waste remains out of official statistics of waste generation worldwide People throw it in water forest desert etc This project represents the unique alternative solution in arranging funds for environment oriented projects internationally The decentralized cryptocurrency fund ASGARD is based on socioenvironmental blockchain platform The uniqueness of the ASGARD PLATFORM are \xe2\x80\xa2 the motivation of the Earth s inhabitants in finding a hidden environmental damage \xe2\x80\x93 an undeclared waste \xe2\x80\xa2 decision making processes to address the elimination of environmental violations identified \xc2\xa9 5 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 Moreover there is always the rule the more intensively a hidden environmental damage is detected \xe2\x80\xa2 the faster the volume of accumulated waste declines \xe2\x80\xa2 the higher reward in digital crypto tokens receive ASG members DECENTRALIZED CRYPTO ECOLOGICAL FUND \xc2\xabASGARD\xc2\xbb (from now on the \xc2\xabASGARD ECO FUND\xc2\xbb) provides alternative financing of technologies which have been tested over decades with a focus to the environmental damage elimination caused by undeclared plastic wastes (the overall situation is reflected in Figure 1) Figure 1 Share of undeclared plastic (polymer) waste in total solid waste worldwide 6 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 As figure 1 shows \xe2\x80\xa2 the growth rate in the volume of polymer waste is much bigger than the volume of its recycling It is important to note that the recycling traditionally consists of sorting landfilling and deep processing of waste \xe2\x80\xa2 the growth rate in the volume of undeclared polymer waste on the planet According to the ASGARD team opinion the absence of investment tools being loyal to a high risks environmentally protective projects from the banking system point of view is the reason of the growth rate in the volume of undeclared polymer wastes We produce waste today but the next two generations will suffer from the negative impact of decomposing polymers because the plastic wastes decomposition process could last for centuries The conflict between man and nature reaches its critical point Today we still have the possibility to analyze and take a decision regarding Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environmental improvement Tomorrow perhaps it will be too late to make any changes Air water land \xe2\x80\x93 these natural elements are already suffered from human activities \xc2\xa9 7 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 AIR POLLUTION \xe2\x80\xa2 4 2 million people die every year due to exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution The deaths and disease from lung cancer stroke acute lower respiratory infection chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \xe2\x80\xa2 5 4 billion people live in areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed the World Health Organization limits All regions of the world are affected from low income to high income countries (according to the materials by the World Health Organization) In our view slowly decomposing plastic debris is one of the most hazardous waste generated by human activity Its decomposition causes harmful air pollution When plastic wastes burn or are under the solar rains the dioxin extremely toxic chemical releases into the atmosphere Moreover we breathe it Dioxin is the poison with low degradation which accumulates in in the human body Dioxin has long term health impact by causing cancer and damaging the nervous reproductive endocrine and immune systems ASGARD ECO FUND contributes to finding solutions to the problem of air pollution caused by decomposing plastic wastes using an alternative crypto financing program ASGARD ECO \xc2\xa9 8 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 FUND supports effective technologies and green technical solutions aiming a polymer wastes processing and its conversion into industrial goods WATER POLLUTION At the World Economic Forum on January 2016 the report \xe2\x80\x9cThe New Plastics Economy Rethinking the future of plastics\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6plastic production has increased from 15 million tons in the sixties to 311 million tons in 2014 and is expected to triple by 2050 when it would account for 20% of global annual oil consumption \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6Each year at least 8 million tons of plastics leak into the ocean \xe2\x80\x93 which is equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute If no action is taken this is expected to increase to two per minute by 2030 and four per minute by 2050\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time polymer wastes not only decontaminate water but also are extremely hazardous for the entire marine ecosystem \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6there are over 150 million tons of plastics in the ocean today In a business as usual scenario the ocean is expected to contain 1 ton of plastic for every 3 tons of fish by 2025 and by 2050 more plastics than fish (by weight)\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d It is important to note that the decomposition of plastic wastes could last more than 100 years in water It infects all living things \xc2\xa9 9 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 around getting into stomachs and reducing the number of fishes birds other creatures Great Garbage Patch garbage islands in the ocean ocean garbage map \xe2\x80\x93 there is our today\xe2\x80\x99s reality Not only the marine ecosystem suffers from floating polymer wastes Same decomposing plastic trash gets in the human body from eating fish and seafood storms and currents throw hundreds of tons of polymer wastes to the ocean and sea coasts and it continues to decompose on the ground As figure 2 shows the main ocean garbage patches consisting of floating plastics and other debris coincide with the main ocean currents Garbage islands and archipelagos exist in Indian Atlantic Pacific oceans ASGARD ECO FUND contributes to finding solutions to the problem of water pollution caused by decomposing plastic wastes by offering an alternative crypto financing program ASGARD ECO FUND supports effective technologies and green technical solutions aiming the collection of a polymer waste in rivers seas oceans and shorelines with its further processing and conversion into industrial goods \xc2\xa9 10 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 Figure 2 Main ocean garbage patches SOIL CONTAMINATION AND DESERTIFICATION According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations soil pollution is a dangerous threat to agricultural productivity food safety and human health At the Global Symposium on Soil Pollution in May 2018 the report \xe2\x80\x9cHidden soil pollution a hidden reality\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 the global production of municipal solid waste was estimated to be 1 3 billion tons per year in 2012\xe2\x80\xa6 Future predictions are worrying however as waste production is expected to rise to 2 2 billion tons by 2025 \xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa9 11 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 As figure 3 shows that infertile land constitutes about 41 3% of Earth s land surface Reports by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization found that one out of three people in the world lives on drylands caused both by human activity and environmental factors At the same time World Bank reports state that more than 50% of municipal solid waste is going to landfills or dumping sites This waste could be recycled to compost for reaching the soils However only one from 10 countries covered by reports has more than 50% share in recycling and composting from the total volume of municipal solid waste Figure 3 Correlation of fertile and infertile soils 12 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 ASGARD ECO FUND contributes to finding solutions to the problem of soil contamination and desertification by offering an alternative crypto financing program ASGARD ECO FUND supports effective technologies and green technical solutions in composting from other types of waste related to the collection and recycling of undeclared polymer wastes To sum up in this chapter we stressed the following environmental issues \xe2\x80\xa2 steadily increasing the volume of decomposing polymer wastes on the ground as well as in seas and oceans \xe2\x80\xa2 rapid growth in municipal solid waste volume with a small share of its recycling into compost for unfertile soils reaching ASGARD ECO FUND addresses the outlined problems by offering an alternative crypto financing program supporting effective technologies and green technical solutions in reducing the environmental damage caused by the growth of the volume of undeclared polymer wastes ASGARD ECO FUND is created on the base of the socioenvironmental blockchain platform ASGARD (from now on the \xc2\xabASGARD PLATFORM\xc2\xbb) and intends the creation of community from active ASGARD members who are not indifferent to environmental problems globally \xc2\xa9 13 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 An important addition The unique feature of ASGARD PLATFORM is an effective system of the motivation of Earth s inhabitants in finding of a hidden environmental damage (non counted and undeclared wastes) and in voting for its liquidation The following rule always work the more intense the identification of environmental violations \xe2\x80\xa2 the faster the volume of waste reduces worldwide \xe2\x80\xa2 the higher reward in digital ASG crypto token receive ASG members The history of the project team and the reasons we came to the idea of blockchain use in environmentally oriented business are reflected in our HISTORY \xc2\xa9 14 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 CHAPTER 2 THE PROBLEM THAT THIS PROJECT SOLVES PROBLEM DECLINE IN DEEP RECYCLING AND PROCESSING OF HAZARDOUS POLYMER WASTES INTERNATIONALLY ASGARD ECO FUND solves the problem by offering an alternative digital financing tool for small and medium sized enterprises professionally involved in waste management The reason for the focus on small and medium sized business such environmentally oriented enterprises inevitable face the difficulties in plant and equipment renewal investments It could affect production efficiency and lead to bankruptcy helping in the growth of undeclared polymer wastes on the ground in seas and oceans The project\xe2\x80\x99s team considers undeclared polymer wastes as the main focus and divide it into two groups based on their morphology \xe2\x80\xa2 Group 1 Polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene wastes \xe2\x80\xa2 Group 2 PET packaging waste (polyethylene terephthalate) According to experts of our team the gap between the volume of production and consumption of plastic packaging and its recycling and processing as waste grows every year \xc2\xa9 15 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 As figure 4 shows the share of undeclared PET waste is considerable Figure 4 Statistics of PET waste generated recycled & processed undeclared PET waste (million tons annually) THE PROBLEM SOLUTION ASGARD ECO FUND offers an alternative crypto financing tool for projects and solution in the collection of a polymer waste with its further processing and conversion into industrial goods polyester fibers The timing of implementation is reflected in chapter 4 \xc2\xa9 16 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 EXPECTED OUTPUT 7 9 % annual reduction in the volume of undeclared polymer waste As a secondary focus the project team considers that it is evident to fund deep recycling and processing of \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d waste received from polymer wastes segregation The final output \xe2\x80\xa2 SRF (Solid Recovered Fuel) / RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) \xe2\x80\xa2 compost The secondary focus decision is based on self thirty year experience in collection transporting and deep recycling of mixed polymer wastes \xc2\xa9 17 \x0cWHITEPAPER v \xce\xb123 10 18 CHAPTER 3 SOCIO ENVIRONMENTAL BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM ASGARD DESCRIPTION ASGARD PLATFORM is a decentralized blockchain with a distributed data storage
