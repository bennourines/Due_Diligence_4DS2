b Wrapped Tokens A multi institutional framework for tokenizing any asset Whitepaper v0 2 Jan 24th 2019 Kyber Network BitGo Inc Republic Protocol \x0cAbstract With the rise in popularity of ERC20 digital tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem have emerged as an important asset class These tokens have all the advantages that blockchains and Ethereum have to offer in terms of transparency in total number of coins owners minting fast confirmation times transactions details and smart contract execution Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain can serve several different functions this paper will specifically focus on asset backed or wrapped tokens The prices of these tokens reflect the price of the asset backing them and hence they can also be called stable coins Asset backed tokens are usually done in two different ways \xe2\x97\x8f Algorithmic\xe2\x80\x8b This is a mechanism followed by some tokens on Ethereum where demand and supply are controlled by smart contracts in order to keep the price of the token in line with a fiat currency Some examples of this are Dai Basis Carbon and NuBits \xe2\x97\x8f Centralized\xe2\x80\x8b Assets are stored with an organization which publishes proof of reserves This is the case with Tether True USD USDC (USD) Digix (gold) Globcoin (a mix of fiat currencies) and AAA reserve (governmental bonds) Wrapped tokens follow the centralized model but instead of relying entirely on one institution they rely on a consortium of institutions performing different roles in the network This whitepaper proposes a framework for issuing asset backed tokens by addressing challenges with scalability trust regulation and governance The first wrapped token we launch will be an ERC20 token backed by Bitcoin (BTC) and will be appropriately named Wrapped BTC (WBTC) Unlike centralized solutions (USD) WBTC will be fully accounted for and proof of reserves posted on the BTC chain There is no additional secondary utility/payment token required to use WBTC and no transfer fees other than blockchain fees WBTC uses a simple federated governance model and strives to promote usability \x0cUse Cases Tokenization The act of tokenizing assets can \xe2\x97\x8f Increase speed of transactions Ethereum blocks are created every ~15 seconds and it is possible to have a fair deal of confidence in the irrevocability of a transaction in less than 5 minutes This speed is faster than transacting natively compared to many other assets including Bitcoin gold and fiat currencies \xe2\x97\x8f Reduce the number of intermediaries One of the key benefits of assets on a blockchain is their ability to be transacted without intermediaries This can be done through atomic swaps decentralized exchange protocols and lightning/raiden style channels \xe2\x97\x8f Enhance security Tokenization enables users to have full control of private keys of the asset Users who do not want to hold keys can reduce counterparty risk by moving it from exchanges to a security focused custodian \xe2\x97\x8f Usability The ERC20 standard has been adopted by a large number of institutions and products This provides users with a variety of exchanges wallets and Dapps to use while handling their tokenized asset They also have the ability to move tokens quickly 24/7 \xe2\x97\x8f Improve Transparency The total number of tokens token creation transactions token removal transactions number of token holders and rules for transfers can be seen on a public block explorer by anyone This level of transparency is not usually available for assets like fiat currencies commodities and stock Liquidity on decentralized exchanges and dapps The majority of ERC20 trading in centralized exchanges today is done with BTC and not ETH Most decentralized exchanges offer only ETH/Token and not BTC/Token trades Wrapped tokens can bridge this gap and provide more liquidity on decentralized exchanges In addition other decentralized applications/protocols (like funds lending payments) will also benefit from having access to greater liquidity that a BTC token can bring WBTC brings the ease of creation of smart contracts to Bitcoin Benefits of fiat tokens Tokens backed by fiat currencies offer a safe way for traders to keep their money in a cryptocurrency without having to worry about price fluctuations This is particularly useful for traders on both centralized and decentralized exchanges where there is no direct way of transferring fiat currencies Fiat currency backed tokens also promise a world in which a \x0ccryptocurrency can replace traditional finance Notably it can be used in e commerce by both buyer and seller without having to worry about conversion rates or taxes (buyers are required to pay capital gains tax calculated at the time of purchase in the US) Interoperability between cryptocurrencies As we see an expansion in the number of cryptocurrencies today each one focuses on some aspect of monetary exchange Some such aspects are transactional throughput privacy cheap transaction fees smart contract ability and decentralization of nodes/miners The wrapped framework would make it easy to represent any other cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin on Ethereum and thereby enhance it with all the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain One such use case is the ability for initial coin offerings (ICOs) to be directly funded and mint tokens on deposits of wrapped Bitcoin tokens In the future centralized exchanges and other institutions which accept cryptocurrencies would not need to maintain multiple cryptocurrency nodes and instead could just develop on Ethereum On chain ways to enforce policies Tokenization also provides a way to enforce policies on chain On chain policy enforcement makes rules more transparent and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on one single party to enforce them Based on the type of asset there could be a need to enforce rules on asset transfer or trade Securities for example require whitelisting holding periods and identity management Common Issues Scalability As of January 2018 the maximum practical gas limit on Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s mainnet topped out at 8 000 000 gas per block \xe2\x80\x8b[1]\xe2\x80\x8b This limit is both hardware and software bound While there are several scalability solutions proposed many require significant developer lift (state channels) or are too early in development for practical use (plasma sharding) This is a problem for Dapps and users of the network because gas prices skyrocket during periods of contention (hot ICOs CryptoKitties) Earlier this year in July transactions caused by Chinese exchange Fcoin caused all time high transaction fees \xe2\x80\x8b[2]\xe2\x80\x8b Trust Asset backed tokens usually involve trust in the institution(s) holding the asset This goes against the ethos of cryptocurrencies which seeks to minimize need for trust in operations Some key questions to answer here are \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Is the asset holder authorized in the existing legal framework to hold the asset Can the custodian create an arbitrary amount of tokens How does the custodian prove possession of the asset under custody \x0cRegulation Custodians of asset backed tokens need to be licensed to hold the asset This license may vary based on the asset and geographical jurisdiction of the custodian Custodians must also prove reserves regularly given that a lack of 1 1 backing would undermine the whole system KYC and AML restrictions also apply to users engaging in asset backed tokens These restrictions need to be enforced at the time of purchase redemption or transfer of tokens Governance When there are multiple stakeholders in the system there is a governance challenge with how to handle changes made to the token Most asset backed tokens are entirely reliant on the asset custodian to make changes to the rules/smart contract governing the token Usually in the case of ICOs the issuer of the token has full control of protocol changes There have been some cases like decentralized autonomous initial coin offerings (DAICOs) where users have voting rights but they face the challenge of a low voter turnout \xe2\x80\x8b[3]\xe2\x80\x8b Implementation and Technology Key Roles \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Custodian\xe2\x80\x8b The institution or party who holds the asset In the case of WBTC this will be played by BitGo \xe2\x80\x8b[4]\xe2\x80\x8b Custodians hold the keys to mint tokens Merchant\xe2\x80\x8b The institution or party to which wrapped tokens will be minted to and burnt from Merchants play a key role in distribution of the wrapped token In the case of \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f WBTC this will be played initially by Kyber \xe2\x80\x8b[5]\xe2\x80\x8b and Republic Protocol \xe2\x80\x8b[6]\xe2\x80\x8b Each merchant holds a key to initiate minting of new wrapped tokens and burning of wrapped tokens User\xe2\x80\x8b The holders of the wrapped token Users can use wrapped tokens to transfer and transact like any other ERC20 token in the Ethereum ecosystem WBTC DAO member\xe2\x80\x8b Contract changes and addition/removal of custodians and merchants will be controlled by a multi signature contract Holders of the keys to the multi sig contract will be held by institutions as part of the WBTC DAO Custodians exchange assets for wrapped tokens with merchants This is done through two different types of transactions minting (creation of wrapped tokens) and burning (reducing supply of wrapped tokens) These transactions will be available publicly and can be viewed by anyone through a block explorer After the initial exchange merchants aim to maintain a buffer of wrapped tokens so that they can exchange it with users The two step minting process helps reduce the time it takes for users to get wrapped tokens as minting and burning are more time consuming processes Custodian wallet setup Custodians are expected to have a pooled wallet for all merchants The wallet will use multi signature with all keys controlled by the custodian The wallet will only be able to send to the whitelisted merchant address on chain All minting and burning transactions are expected to be done within 48 hours of submission to the custodian Note that in case of multiple custodians a single wallet might not have enough funds to redeem all pending wrapped tokens Minting Minting refers to the process of creating new wrapped tokens Minting in the wrapped framework has to be done by a custodian but needs to be \xe2\x80\x9cinitiated\xe2\x80\x9d by a merchant It is important to note that minting does not involve the user It is a set of transactions done between the merchant and the custodian \x0cSequence of minting events for WBTC \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f

\xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f User requests wrapped tokens from a merchant The merchant does the required AML KYC procedures and gets identification information from the user The user and merchant perform an \xe2\x80\x8batomic swap\xe2\x80\x8b or use a trusted exchange with the merchant receiving Bitcoin and the user receiving WBTC Burning Burning refers to the action of redeeming BTC for WBTC tokens Only merchant addresses can burn wrapped tokens In order to do so the \xe2\x80\x98burn\xe2\x80\x99 function is called in the contract with the amount of tokens to be burnt on the Ethereum chain By doing so the amount is deducted from the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s WBTC balance (on chain) and the supply of WBTC is reduced ` Sequence of events for burning WBTC tokens \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f The merchant creates a burn transaction burning X WBTC tokens Custodian waits for 25 block confirmations of the ETH transaction Custodian releases X BTC to the

requests the redemption of tokens from a merchant The merchant does the required AML KYC procedures and gets identification information from user The user and merchant perform an \xe2\x80\x8batomic swap\xe2\x80\x8b or use a trusted exchange where the user receives Bitcoin and the merchant receives WBTC tokens On Chain transfer restrictions Based on the token there could be restrictions in place for the transfer of tokens For WBTC there will be no restrictions on transfers Governance The wrapped token contract is governed by a multisig contract in which signatures are required from DAO members in order to add/remove members All custodians and merchants will be DAO members but other institutions can also be included as a member without having a custodian or merchant role An \xe2\x80\x9cM of N\xe2\x80\x9d signature signature will be used in the contract where M is the required number of signatures in the multisig contract and N is the total number of members The values of M and N will be decided mutually between members keeping in mind security as well as the ease of adding/removing members Side chain for wrapped tokens Initially WBTC will be launched on the Ethereum mainnet chain The mainnet chain is easily accessible and usable as there are a network of exchanges block explorers wallets and other Dapps on it One of the key benefits of tokenization is cheap transactional cost But with gaining popularity of Ethereum and increased Dapp creation transaction costs of wrapped tokens could rise to the point where it is not cheap to do so on the main chain The collaboration of multiple institutions in the wrapped framework enables the ability to deploy a practical scalable solution to increase transactional throughput \x0cThis can be done through the use of a pegged sidechain using existing software (\xe2\x80\x8bparity bridge\xe2\x80\x8b) run among DAO members The chain will run on it\xe2\x80\x99s own proof of authority network \xe2\x80\x8b[7]\xe2\x80\x8b using the Aura consensus algorithm \xe2\x80\x8b[8]\xe2\x80\x8b Blocks will be created every 4 seconds predictably and in a performant manner Currently there is already such a chain (Kovan testnet) and it has been in operation since March 2017 Wrapped tokens will be pegged between the main and side chain by creating a 2 way multi sig wallet on mainnet and on the sidechain \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bSide chains provide much needed scalability on ethereum Some benefits of a side chain for trading and transferring wrapped tokens are \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Scaling with minimal development costs (same EVM) Dedicated increased throughput seperate blockchain on separate hardware and potential proof of authority (PoA) advantages (faster blocks) Easy to support in existing clients and wallets Chain is free from other \xe2\x80\x9cnoisy neighbors\xe2\x80\x9d Minimal transactional cost (to prevent spam) Validators (block generators) will be chosen from wrapped partners and other trusted parties who will be geographically distributed and represent several different domiciles / governments Validators will also maintain the 2 way peg between the main and side chain To peg the value of wrapped tokens on both chains we propose a multi signature contract to be used on the mainnet and the sidechain \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f To send from Ethereum mainnet to Ethereum sidechain \xe2\x97\x8b Send from mainnet address to the federated mainnet multi sig address \xe2\x96\xa0 It is recommended to send the amount while calling the \xe2\x80\x9csendToSidechain\xe2\x80\x9d method on the multi sig address specifying as the argument the destination address on the sidechain \xe2\x96\xa0 If sent without a method the destination address on the sidechain will be assumed to be the same as the source address \xe2\x97\x8b An event is generated on the mainnet to record the send \xe2\x97\x8b Federated signers \xe2\x80\x9clock\xe2\x80\x9d tokens on mainnet \xe2\x97\x8b After a \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmation period\xe2\x80\x9d multisig authorities on the sidechain can validate the send event on the mainnet and disburse the amount to the destination address on the sidechain less transaction fees To send from ETH sidechain to ETH mainnet \xe2\x97\x8b Identical (symmetric) WBTC will be the first asset on the sidechain and will use a combination of these components working together to create an ecosystem \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Node Software and Configuration Block Explorer Wallet Providers \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Block Validators Multi sig Authorities Incentivization Transactions will be charged at the minimal starting gas price of 1 Gwei to cover running block validators and to prevent spam on the sidechain Validators can also be incentivized off chain for each Dapp or have block rewards Details of distribution/management of Ether on the sidechain are still to be determined Atomic Swap Atomic swaps can be used between merchants and users in order to exchange WBTC and BTC If the user would like to receive WBTC or BTC more quickly a trusted method of exchange could also be done through the merchants Once KYC is completed the steps for users to atomically swap BTC for WBTC with the merchant are \xe2\x97\x8f User generates a secret and a hash of it is provided to the merchant off chain The user and the merchant also agree on other swapping details such as receive addresses (ETH and BTC) \xe2\x97\x8f The user creates a Bitcoin HTLC (Hashed Time Lock Contract) using the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s Bitcoin address user\xe2\x80\x99s refund address secret hash and expiration time This is used to create a P2SH address which the user funds with X BTC \xe2\x97\x8f After 6 confirmations the merchant will create an HTLC contract on Ethereum by using the user\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum address merchant\xe2\x80\x99s refund address secret hash and expiration time The merchant then transfers X WBTC to the atomic swap contract \xe2\x97\x8f The user reveals the secret in order to move X WBTC from the atomic swap contract to the user\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum address \xe2\x97\x8f The merchant uses the secret in order to move Bitcoin funds from the P2SH address \xe2\x97\x8f If the user does not claim the WBTC within the expiration time the transaction does not go through and the user can claim the BTC back Some important things to note here \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f In order to deploy the atomic swap contract and send WBTC to it there are transaction fees involved Hence the user will have to pay an atomic swap fee before initiating a swap Atomic swaps take time and multiple transactions on both the BTC and ETH chain The user may have the option of doing a trusted swap in which BTC is transferred to the merchant address and after 6 confirmations on the bitcoin network the merchant sends WBTC to the user This involves trust in the merchant but it is quicker and cheaper \x0cWBTC vs Atomic Swaps Atomic swaps can be performed without WBTC for users which only want to perform a BTC ETH trade They can be done on a decentralized exchange outlined through a mechanism by the Komodo platform \xe2\x80\x8b[9]\xe2\x80\x8b However it is important to note that WBTC provides a representation of BTC on the ETH chain which is required for DAPPs and the ecosystem to interact with A few other tradeoffs to consider while comparing atomic swaps with WBTC \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f They require price discovery to be done by whoever does the atomic swap In wrapped tokens price discovery only needs to be done while trading on a decentralized exchange after having already obtained WBTC Requires atomic swap technology to be supported by existing wallets and decentralized exchanges Wrapped BTC will be available for use in any ERC20 supported wallet They are really slow because every transactions is as slow as multiple confirmations on the ETH chain and then the Bitcoin chain (as opposed to WBTC where the initial minting/tokenization is slow but after creation it\xe2\x80\x99s easily tradable on the ETH chain) Doing an atomic swap on a decentralized exchange requires a separate deposit and a atomic swap fee as well This is inconvenient each time users want to swap currencies Fees Transfers of WBTC between users will have no cost apart from network fees There are three ways in which different parties in the network can earn fees \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Custodian fees This is taken by the custodian at the time when a merchant mints or burns wrapped tokens Merchant fees This is taken by the merchant who the user exchanges wrapped tokens with for the asset Sidechain transaction fees This fee is predominantly aimed at preventing spam on the sidechain This is shared equally among all institutions running nodes on the sidechain Legal Binding Contract between custodians and merchants The process of minting and burning tokens does not involve the user and is between trusted institutions Merchants are required to hold the identity information of the user securely Custodians are required to publish details of assets under custody quarterly and perform minting/burning duties in a timely manner Failure to meet these criteria can lead to removal from the network \x0cIt is to be noted that there can be multiple custodians in the network but this comes at the cost of increasing the risk involved in the network A model where custodianship is shared by different institutions holding keys to a multi sig wallet is also possible in the future Though operationally minting/burning/auditing would require more coordination and time A security breach among any of the custodians would cause the loss of trust and could lead to mass withdrawals A security breach with a merchant is much less severe as all outstanding tokens will still be backed up by custodians but instead could lead to a loss of KYC/AML user data Trust model In some sense custodians are trusted in the wrapped framework as assets could be stolen or they might not honour the one to one backing However the wrapped framework aims to minimize this trust in a few ways \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Quarterly audits will be conducted by external third parties to verify that all wrapped tokens minted have an equal amount of asset stored among all custodians In the case of WBTC proof of reserves can be shown by publishing signatures from the addresses which bitcoin is stored in Custodians will not be able to mint tokens on their own but would instead require the initiation of a merchant in order to do so Hence creation of new tokens involves both the custodian and the merchant The user is insulated from interacting with the custodian through a set of merchant institutions An individual merchant does not need to be trusted but instead all merchants together would need to be Existing credibility of the institutions involved is at stake for all the institutions involved with the framework Transparency There will be full transparency in the functioning of the wrapped token All key details of the network will be reflected in a dashboard some of which are \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f Names and details of institutions performing different roles in the network Status of mint and burn orders (pending processing cancelled complete) Total amount of BTC stored by custodians Total amount of WBTC in the network (Will be the same or slightly lower than BTC stored) Quarterly audits in the form of transactions which prove that the custodian has the keys to the Bitcoin Merchant and Custodians ethereum addresses The Bitcoin address associated with each merchant controlled by the custodian Links to the open source token contract code / deployed contract on a block explorer \x0cAn example of what the dashboard might look like Conclusion Through wrapped tokens we propose a solution to make assets interchangeable and representable on the Ethereum chain Global liquidity increased fractional ownership smart contract programmability and reduction in transaction fees are some of the key benefits of tokenization WBTC will be the first such token enabling Dapps easy access to Bitcoin All transactions contracts and audits will be publicly viewable to maintain transparency and enable trust in the network The framework also provides a way in which multiple institutions in the cryptocurrency space can perform different roles to get past common issues faced by asset backed tokens \x0cGlossary Custodian\xe2\x80\x8b The institution or party who holds the asset In the case of WBTC this will be played
