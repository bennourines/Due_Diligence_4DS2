because it can revolutionize the way we interact as a society Distributed ledgers are disruptive for ancient business models in the same way email disrupted the mailbox Applied correctly a blockchain will facilitate the digitization of recordkeeping processes related to the trade of assets even in scenarios when intermediaries and brokers are incentivized to resist revolution The blockchain can improve the transportation of commodities in every country across the entire globe and beyond We\xe2\x80\x99re launching ShipChain to make that leap possible PAGE PAGE3 3 PLAN Despite the revolution brought on by the advent of the cart the ship the engine and the airplane the shipping industry as a whole has been one of the slowest markets to adapt and evolve over the past century The Information Age has disrupted nearly every major workforce on the planet Globalization has opened new trade routes technology has changed the way we shop and spend and so naturally the demand for shipping has reached an all time high It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that most shipping customers are shocked and dismayed to find their brokers still relying on artifacts like paper records written manifests and spoken words to get cargo from point to point It\xe2\x80\x99s time for a breakthrough in how we handle freight ECOSYSTEM Trade in turn is our second oldest and most important pivot From long distance trading our economies were established which allowed modern civilizations to thrive The oldest coin based currency can be thought of as a proxy for trading values greater than two hands can carry or for trading commodities that aren\xe2\x80\x99t physically available nearby and so currency itself necessitates logistics Together trade and logistics form the backbone of human achievement INTRO Consider the magnitude of the logistics industry Looking back through history the wheel is essentially the cornerstone of modern civilization It brought us transportation and transportation afforded us the systematic transfer of goods From farm to market and from market to table the movement of products in bulk has been the single most important adaptation of the last 10 000 years \x0cOVERVIEW \xe2\x80\xa2 Unfortunately the supply chain has major bottlenecks The lack of a unified communication platform prevents the various players from interacting efficiently Most land transportation providers carriers governments customs brokers and freight forwarders have outdated ways of keeping track of their goods According to PAGE 4 But as freight volume increases so do customer expectations Both industrial and individual customers expect faster shipments with more flexibility more transparency and lower prices Shippers can find it challenging to handle all the complexities of booking tracking tracing and regulatory compliance unless they hire teams of full time experienced staff This puts smaller shippers at a disadvantage and makes larger shippers extremely inefficient PLAN \xe2\x80\xa2 The market\xe2\x80\x99s global value was $8 1 trillion in 2015 and is expected to grow to $15 5 trillion by 2023 (1) making it one of the largest industries on the planet 55 billion tons of freight was transported in 2015 with expected growth to 92 billion tons by 2024 In the United States freight and logistics spend in 2015 totaled $1 48 trillion nearly 10% of the country\xe2\x80\x99s GDP (2) ECOSYSTEM \xe2\x80\xa2 KPMG 40% of global manufacturers lack information and material visibility across their supply bases (3) In some cases companies are still using paper ledgers to track their products Given that upwards of 65% of the value of a company\xe2\x80\x99s products or services is derived from its suppliers and its supply chain (4) utilizing older highly ineffective systems results in tremendous amounts of wasted time resources and money INTRO The movement of goods impacts daily life for people around the world at a staggering scale For additional perspective here are some stats \x0cHOW IT WORKS TODAY Carriers provide freight transportation services \xe2\x80\xa2 Carriers may be rail air sea truck or other \xe2\x80\xa2 Most carriers only handle one segment of a trip \xe2\x80\xa2 Usually a multi leg trip involves several carriers \xe2\x80\xa2 A carrier usually owns a fleet of delivery vehicles \xe2\x80\xa2 Carriers often have poor transparency and records Drivers are the operators of a single vehicle in a fleet \xe2\x80\xa2 Some are \xe2\x80\x9cowner operators\xe2\x80\x9d acting also as Carriers \xe2\x80\xa2 Sometimes handoffs lack accountability \xe2\x80\xa2 Tracking fleets of drivers can be hard \xe2\x80\xa2 Drivers don\xe2\x80\x99t have incentives to save gas \xe2\x80\xa2 Drivers can lose or damage goods PAGE 5 PLAN Brokers coordinate carriers to organize multimodal orders \xe2\x80\xa2 Brokers act as the gatekeepers of the industry \xe2\x80\xa2 They choose combinations of reputable carriers \xe2\x80\xa2 They get payment from shippers and insure goods \xe2\x80\xa2 They often provide some basic tracking services \xe2\x80\xa2 Brokers charge a high middle man markup ECOSYSTEM Shippers are the customers of the logistics services they are the actors who have freight and need it transported \xe2\x80\xa2 Shippers don\xe2\x80\x99t want to coordinate multiple drivers \xe2\x80\xa2 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want logistics headaches \xe2\x80\xa2 They want a predictable price \xe2\x80\xa2 Shippers want freight accountability INTRO The process of shipping freight can occur across many channels including air sea rail or truck Four major entities make up the lifecycle of any shipment regardless of the channel being used \x0cPROBLEMS PAGE 6 5 Misaligned Incentives The above issues can be summarized simply as a problem of misaligned incentives It behooves carriers to provide poor tracking because they gain deniability in the case of lost or damaged freight There\xe2\x80\x99s negative incentive for brokers to be honest about the whereabouts or handlers of a shipment because they need to protect their exclusive relationships and always be able to shift the blame Drivers are incentivized to carry using unsafe practices that may risk damage to goods Everyone gains from dishonesty to the next party and to break laws or safety regulations Shippers and customers are thus incentivized to find a better solution PLAN 3 No Accountability The US Federal Bureau of Investigations estimates annual cargo theft losses exceeding $30 billion USD in 2016 and rising with an average theft value of $190 000 (5) Cargo theft raises prices across the industry approximately 20% negatively impacting all customers of the shipping industry\xe2\x80\x93nearly every person on earth The combination of tracking and transparency failures together lead to a lack of account 4 Middleman Markup Brokers and forwarders are largely to blame for all of the above issues acting as gatekeepers to the industry and incentivizing poor transparency and tracking practices and yet they typically charge a significant premium\xe2\x80\x93sometimes 30 50%\xe2\x80\x93for their claim of making freight easier to manage and ship In reality they are high maintenance increasing the cost of freight and decreasing what carriers get paid ECOSYSTEM 2 Lack of Transparency Bad tracking is both the cause of and caused by equally harmful gaps in transparency While tracking issues are systemic and inherent to the task of moving goods the failures of transparency are largely due to bad data handling practices (or worse due to parties being incentivized not to share accurate data) Often due to fragmentation uncertainty or to protect the exclusivity of their arrangements brokers can\xe2\x80\x99t or won\xe2\x80\x99t tell a shipper exactly what carrier and driver are carrying their freight ability As brokers withhold information on who is moving which cargo and fragmentation amongst carriers causes uncertainty about where the cargo actually is at any given time shippers often have no way of knowing who is responsible for the cargo Handoffs are one of the largest sources of error in freight with neither side wanting to take responsibility for a container that didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it from the ship to a truck INTRO 1 Bad Tracking For end users the regularity and reliability of shipping status updates is the primary factor in the perceived quality of a shipping experience If a package is slow or late but has regular updates customers are less likely to complain or file chargebacks against merchants But the shipping industry has not kept up Tracking across multiple carriers is extremely fractured and tracking provisions vary between modes of transportation Tracking problems lead to confusion among carriers failed handoffs failed deliveries and even lost shipments Economically this is a disaster Lost efficiency wasted fuel and time and missing products combine to cost the shipping industry billions of dollars per year costs that brokers rarely cover and are ultimately passed on to shippers \x0cOUR VISION PAGE 7 PLAN With the upcoming Electronic Log Device (ELD) mandate from the United States Department of Transportation (6) ShipChain will work with the most popular ELD developers to integrate directly and march toward our first goal completion of Track & Trace technology The initial step of working with these providers will allow us to integrate immediately into the largest network of US based trucking freight companies giving our platform a full network of freight movement without the arduous requirement of connecting to individual freight companies (or even individual Owner operator trucks) one at a time ECOSYSTEM Tracking & Transparency We will unify shipment tracking across the Ethereum blockchain using our ShipChain side chain to track individual encrypted geographic waypoints across each smart contract With this system the meaning of each waypoint will be encrypted accessible for interpretation by only the parties involved This will give shippers more visibility across their supply chain and allow carriers to communicate with ease reducing delays and miscommunications Information about loads geo waypoints and basic compliance information will be recorded and publicly validated within the sidechain Upon delivery and confirmation the contract will be completed and recorded on the main blockchain releasing any payment escrows INTRO ShipChain was founded with the mission of solving the greatest problems facing the logistics industry today Our solution requires deep technology but our vision is quite simple Imagine a fully integrated system across the entire supply chain from the moment it leaves the factory field or farm to delivering the finished product to the customer\xe2\x80\x99s doorstep federated in trustless transparent blockchain contracts This is ShipChain the future of shipping \x0cTrustless Incentives By encoding and encrypting waypoint information and data about which loads belong in a shipment digital escrows can be used to fairly assess whether goods actually arrived in a particular shipment Conflicting accounts of the whereabouts of goods are eliminated and individual players can be rewarded for their participation in a system that operates without trusting any particular party\xe2\x80\x99s story about what happened In future iterations of the platform we plan to provide driver rewards for obeying speed limits behaving safely and observing green fuel economy practices Unified Management Subsequent to the implementation of blockchain federation of the fair and secure transportation of goods ShipChain will build a unified management platform for leveraging the smart contracts to provide modern and usable services across the shipping industry ShipChain is dedicated to building to an open ecosystem and although ShipChain Web will be the first application our Smart Contracts will be a building block that thousands of other platforms can freely build upon to solve shipping issues big or small The decentralized brokerage will be an open marketplace connecting shippers to carriers and ShipChain will provide the first app for cargo booking shippers will be able to log on and place an PAGE 8 PLAN Asset Security Deploying blockchain technology into the freight industry to encode geographic data will increase cargo visibility and thereby dramatically decrease theft By using barcodes or hardware RFID integration assets can be automatically verified each time electronic logs are reported increasing security and providing peace of mind for all parties Permissioning immutability and encryption are inherent benefits of blockchain technology allowing select individuals to access examine and add critical transport data but no one will have the ability to change or delete existing data By bringing accountability to every step of the process the blame game between carriers brokers and shippers is mitigated ECOSYSTEM Decentralized Brokerage In the current system freight brokers exist to facilitate the transactions of loads from shippers to carriers they are typically asset light and focused on sales Brokers find loads mark them up and sell them to a carrier which increases the cost of shipping and reduces profits for carriers and their crew The ShipChain blockchain will supplant the need for brokers by allowing carriers the ability to find shipments and intelligently route their team for multimodal transportation based on factors such as distance traffic weather conditions fuel use and more This load system will generate a smart contract upon pick up and will hold payments in escrow until conditions for release are met while using the main blockchain and side chain for tracking and cargo security monitoring INTRO Similarly there is an opportunity for us to integrate with the major US railroads global ocean freight providers and major airlines one by one to tie in and create our multimodal blockchain based tracking system The internal tracking of each carrier will be the first step in unification with their internal confirmations being fed to the blockchain Individual pallets or crates will be tied to the address of the container they are on and containers will be tracked as a whole Over time business development will assist these carriers with the replacement of their base internal tracking with the ShipChain system allowing a greater level of visibility across all of their multimodal shipping partners \x0corder from \xe2\x80\x9cPoint A\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cPoint B\xe2\x80\x9d using suggested routing and shipping methods based on cost time in transit and contents INTRO ECOSYSTEM PLAN PAGE 9 \x0cTECHNOLOGY ShipChain Web The decentralized brokerage system will be comprised primarily of an open marketplace connecting shippers and carriers ShipChain will allow open access to its blockchain marketplace but also build the first platform of services upon it ShipChain Web Platform a centralized system for booking and managing freight shipments across many carriers and modes of transportation If for example the shipper has five full shipping containers of shoes coming from China to the United States the system will recognize that a sea carrier rail carrier and final truck carrier will be the best optimization for cost and speed based on the size and type of shipment The shipper will then be able to see the capacity on each leg book their own routes see estimated delivery times and have full control over their supply chain without the need for a broker Carriers will be able to post capacity for their shipping vehicles and lanes dynamically set pricing based on supply/demand adjust for estimated fuel cost and have cargo booked to their routes automatically PAGE 10 PLAN That contract will be completed on delivery with validations and waypoints recorded to the blockchain along the way If all waypoint validations are affirmed the contract will be executed (and each contract will be able to specify its own terms for how any disputes will be resolved including third party arbitration) The full cargo validation system will be in place alongside the tracking system Carrier partners will be able to pull data from the ShipChain tracking system and post to their systems and websites for wide use creating a unified tracking system that eliminates the need for internal P R O numbers or multiple tracking numbers ECOSYSTEM When a shipment order is placed a smart contract will be initiated That contract will include a hash sum signature of the delivery information for the shipment including beginning address final delivery point carriers used number of items in shipment (as granular as preferred with an address for each item being possible) weight dimensions quantities HS codes intermediary data and more Anyone with a valid copy of these values can verify the signature and assert the validity of the contract on the main Ethereum blockchain The data itself can optionally be encrypted and stored in a sidechain for more specific point by point and piecewise package tracking In result this essentially provides a more detailed Bill of Lading INTRO Contracts & Side Chains The ShipChain Contract is an Ethereum EVM smart contract that can be duplicated and used by anyone to orchestrate a shipping escrow on the distributed ledger The overall shipment completion will be stored on the main Ethereum blockchain and to keep costs low individual tracking waypoints and load data can be stored and verified in an associated side chain operating on the ShipChain Protocol (fork of Ethereum software) such as the one ShipChain Foundation will implement and maintain called \xe2\x80\x9cShipChain Prime \xe2\x80\x9d Large partners will be able to operate their own ShipChain Protocol side chains with (or without) aid from ShipChain Foundation \x0cINTRO Customs brokers if needed will also be granted account rights to assist with paperwork filing With all necessary information held in a smart contract this process will be quicker and easier than ever before Regulatory compliance may require ShipChain to be licensed in freight brokerage freight forwarding and have an internal customs brokerage While shippers will book their own routes ShipChain may need to be the official booking agent for freight for compliance purposes ECOSYSTEM PLAN Our target rollout date for the first version of the ShipChain Web Platform unified tracking system is Q3 2018 Maintenance and continued carrier integrations will be an ongoing process for the tracking system PAGE 11 \x0cTHE SHIP TOKEN Initial Token Generation Event The problems ShipChain will tackle are systemic to a multi trillion dollar industry one historically slow moving and resistant to change We have plans for delivering our offering on our current funding but bringing our full vision to life is a huge endeavor and would be best served by opening ourselves to outside funding Therefore we are running a Token Generation Event or \xe2\x80\x9cTGE\xe2\x80\x9d to sell an initial supply of our tokens in order to jumpstart the ShipChain economy and supplement funding to help us deliver the best product possible This \xe2\x80\x98TGE\xe2\x80\x99 will occur in multiple phases including Pre Sale Sale 1 and Sale 2 Pre Sale and Sale 1 will occur immediately ending after January 2018 Sale 2 will occur upon the completion of several milestones including the live use of our web platform version 1 0 of our full tracking system and generation of live revenues with real client shipments We anticipate Sale 2 will occur between 1 2 years after Sale 1 PAGE 12 PLAN Tokens valued at up to 20% of each freight transaction will be given to the driver/carrier as \xe2\x80\x9cgamified\xe2\x80\x9d incentives for safe and timely deliveries as well as environment focused such as reduced idle time From there drivers will either be able to sell their tokens on exchanges or redeem those tokens via partnerships ShipChain will form for various rewards such as gift cards fuel discounts and more ECOSYSTEM Transactions on the blockchain for freight shipments will be paid in tokens and settled in tokens The ShipChain Web platform connecting to the blockchain will allow users to pay either directly in tokens they hold or purchase tokens from ShipChain for booking freight (allowing for example USD EUR or cryptocurrency payment) INTRO Usage Purpose Supply and Demand Ownership of at least 1 full SHIP

AmazingSocks club needs to ship a container of fleece footwear from the supplier in China to their warehouse in Chicago but they won\xe2\x80\x99t use a broker because of bad experiences with dishonest intermediaries charging 50% fees just to lose their shipments Instead they have hired Steve full time (plus nights and weekends) staff member whose only job is to research carriers and plan the logistics of moving socks around the globe Steve is a highly skilled logistics professional but due to the time involved in planning ships across the ocean consulting with customs at the port and negotiating with independent owner operators his role is now the bottleneck preventing AmazingSocks from scaling up to meet the Christmas rush and have a record Q4 Now management needs to hire a second Steve which will push logistics to over 12% of sock company\xe2\x80\x99s payroll ShipChain can help Using ShipChain Web Steve can fill the role of a mega shipping broker using our advanced interface to search and filter compatible sea freight customs agents and schedule handoffs between multiple drivers He can quickly find and match any combination of drivers and freighters to meet his needs based on pricing speed or freight class \xe2\x80\x93 or he can request bids from operators not on PAGE 15 PLAN Enter ShipChain a novel blockchain solution that allows Chik A Burg to instantly find and connect with drivers and carriers who meet their regulatory needs The loads previously carried in their trucks can be verified as not hazardous waste medical equipment nor other non compliant materials \xe2\x80\x93 without revealing sensitive information about previous clients \xe2\x80\x93 validating that the loads would comply with food supply chain safety mandates Using the ShipChain Prime side chain for granular tracking RFID and barcodes can be combined with ELD integrations allowing full traceability and visibility of supply literally from farm to table Retailers carriers and customers alike can all validate the source farm lot number distribution center port information and even individual trailer on a burger by burger basis If a closer audit is needed regulatory authorities can be provided a set of private encryption keys allowing them access to the full history of a given trailer\xe2\x80\x99s loads and hauls ECOSYSTEM The Major Food Production Company Chik A Burg Meats is facing increasing regulatory burden from the USDA and FDA with harsh fines and penalties for non compliance requiring end to end tracking of anything that touches the food supply New rules in the Food Safety Modernization Act say that livestock feed must be traced from farm to trough food products must be tracked throughout the supply chain and all transport trailers need audit logs of their prior loads and cleaning histories Larger third party freight companies are hesitant to comply which forces Chik A Burg to hire mostly independent drivers who feel overburdened by this new litany of checks and measures INTRO In order to illustrate some cases where ShipChain might be most useful we\xe2\x80\x99ve invented a few fictional stories about made up companies \xe2\x80\x93 based on real problems faced by thousands of similar businesses across the world Any similarities to actual brands and trademarks are either innocent coincidences or systemic commonalities \x0cThe Clever Mega Broker Box2U is one of the leading European shipping brokers they deal with hundreds of carriers that manage thousands of drivers delivering millions of containers (worth billions of dollars) each year Aware of shrinking margins obligations to customers demanding faster and cheaper deliveries and the problems inherent with the tracking systems used by many of their partners Box2U began development on an advanced Web 2 0 platform for shippers to keep better track of their assets The bad news They started building it 4 years ago and today the system is only barely ready to use Drivers and carriers aren\xe2\x80\x99t voluntarily submitting accurate data and the whole project seems like a dead end and sunk cost Box2U knows it is not a software company After sinking millions of dollars into a problem that is rapidly proving to be out of scope for their business model management notices a use case just like this described on the ShipChain website The ShipChain API is a fast cheap and secure ledger for storing all their shipment data plus trustless escrow contracts and ELD integrations \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s everything Box2U has been trying to build and more Since the whole system is built using blockchain technology in a free and open manner even a competitor like Box2U is able leverage ShipChain technologies to power their own branded interface for managing freight PAGE 16 PLAN Today Alice uses ShipChain to manage her associates\xe2\x80\x99 hauls She can oversee all the drivers in her coop match new work to the best available drivers and she always has access to compliance and regulatory paperwork whenever necessary Everybody knows where they\xe2\x80\x99re going and what they are hauling If there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem with a driver or they need to schedule time off Alice can find supplemental trusted drivers in the ShipChain marketplace to fill in the gaps or take over a route Even better Alice is now able to identify problems in the team by insights into historical data and can help encourage everyone to drive safer and slower not only to extend their lifespan but also to maximize profitability from the ShipChain Safe Driving Rewards ECOSYSTEM The Freelance Freight Broker A co op of a dozen owner operators in the southeast has grouped together to handle booking and coordination of freight amongst themselves eschewing carrier After several years of informally calling one another to ask about availability and scheduling a broken leg accident took Alice off the road and she began organizing handoffs from a hotel room in Atlanta

ShipChain Foundation is forming alliances in the logistics space with large corporations small businesses freight companies truckers brand evangelists and other partners much like the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance did for Ethereum and corporate partnerships This initiative is an important piece of our strategy not only from a marketing perspective but to bolster widespread support of the ecosystem we\xe2\x80\x99re building In the coming months ShipChain will announce partnerships that will support this effort ShipChain\xe2\x80\x99s core team and advisors have a combined century of experience in marketing and public relations many with decades of history advertising for large brands and social media influencers The team is uniquely equipped both directly and through

right people in the shipping and logistics industry We will handle P R and communications both internally and via 3rd parties keeping our community constantly updated about developments initiatives and new relationships Our communications strategy consists of press and marketing but also community engagement through our core team PAGE PAGE2525 PLAN Operations Operations and development teams will begin within the United States but also to support the Perdue pilot program South America as well as Asia and Europe to further partner with additional carriers Support teams to operate hardware and troubleshoot issues will be necessary and field integrations with legacy systems Cloud and server infrastructure will be necessary with the web platform ECOSYSTEM Research and Development ShipChain will be at the cutting edge of blockchain technology including a full development team for Solidity as well as our web platform for UI/UX Frontend and Backend We will also bring on hardware and IoT developers to further advance the amount of data that can be tracked Research into sidechain tech will be done and the team will consider the acquisition of an existing logistics/trucking company in order to accelerate both the physical development and adoption of the platform INTRO We are committed to spending our funding responsibly Below are our plans for properly allocating the assets to deliver the best possible solutions as quickly as possible We are limiting the total contributions in the crowdfunding to $30 million USD because we feel taking more money would not be responsible and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to a better product any faster Below is a preview of our best estimates of what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do with any money we raise in the TGE \x0cINTRO Business Development We will attend both US based and international conferences to build our network and find new leads We\xe2\x80\x99ll focus more on private 1 on 1 development with US transportation firms ShipChain will host educational evenings in different cities to attract local business owners and invite them to join our platform We will also focus on finding strategic partners internationally both on a corporate and a political level for quicker implementation and mass adoption We will have team members on both coasts of the U S Expanding ShipChain Intellectual Property portfolio as well as the acquisition of key technologies is pivotal We will retain counsel for Food Safety and Modernization Act review and create proposals for approaching key partners in the industry We will work with strategic partners to encourage government and administrative bodies to utilize the platform for Proof of Concept testing Retaining key personnel to work with the Food and Drug Administration to encourage adoption of blockchain technology is an additional step we will take We will also continue to develop strategic partnerships with domestic and international partners to help with the proliferation of the platform at both the government and corporate level Eventually we will hire a dedicated lobbyist to encourage adoption of the platform as the industry standard and overall proliferation of blockchain We will develop additional license agreements for the platform as well PAGE 26 PLAN Legal Legal is an important aspect for ShipChain We will retain outside counsel with

also hire at least one team member in Europe to cover a larger geographical area The team will be able to cover conferences all over the world meet with more potential strategic partners and customers and build more relationships \x0cREVENUE MODEL PAGE PAGE2727 PLAN ShipChain Enterprise ShipChain will also develop custom sidechain solutions for large enterprises that need to utilize different data sources and information ShipChain will do this as a development contractor with all new sidechains still tying into the main blockchain This will be custom quoted per client but will be on the scale of large ERP implementations that routinely run over seven figures ECOSYSTEM ShipChain Web ShipChain\xe2\x80\x99s web platform will enable shippers to connect directly to carriers without the traditional brokerage model Fees will be a low percentage of the cost of shipping and ShipChain will avoid having to hire typical telemarketing brokers keeping the cost of selling at a minimum This base percentage fee will be the primary income source for ShipChain Web followed by partnerships for Cargo Insurance as well as partner value add services upsold on top of shipments With a transparent fee system ShipChain will show shippers the actual cost from the carrier and how much they save versus the traditional brokerage model Instant booking will be done versus the traditional 3 4 day wait period INTRO ShipChain will employ a two fold revenue model focusing on both the Small and Mid size Business market (SMB) as well as Enterprise platform development This includes the following

a Common Goal ShipChain plans to support and encourage a better environmental policy in the freight industry We strongly support a shift away from heavy polluting \xe2\x80\x9cbunker fuel\xe2\x80\x9d in sea freight to cleaner natural gas or even electric container ships the encouragement of freight rail for its high efficiency the use of fuel economy improving technology and gamification of fuel efficiency in the trucking industry and the use of AI to reduce fuel usage Protecting our environment is critical and the freight industry should constantly work to improve its carbon footprint ECOSYSTEM Transparency ShipChain plans to significantly increase the level of transparency in the blockchain space With community managers working with supporters in public chat and forums our team also plans to release scheduled quarterly progress reports detailing software development progress as well as progress on all plans detailed in this whitepaper These quarterly progress reports will be scheduled after the initial token sale and include statements from the development team statements from the operations team executive overviews updated timetables and other pertinent information to the progress of the ShipChain project INTRO Self Driving Vehicles The self driving revolution is coming and ShipChain will be prepared for it Currently drivers facilitate the handoff and delivery of loads allowing for a carrier level security verification at each event We propose a novel method for preventing cargo theft or mishandling is a combination of RFID tagging 2D barcoding plus cargo trailer sensors that communicate with the blockchain The unauthorized unloading of cargo by receivers will be noted and combined with the geographical data This information will be publicly verifiable This method holds receiving and shipping parties accountable for any mishandled lost or stolen goods \x0c
