bellow Figure 7 UQUID Eco System Stages 4 1 Stage 1\xe2\x80\x93 Indirect Spending This stage defines the initial steps of the project up to taking the UQUID System live and releasing first of its kind

fee of 0% attracts many new coins creating a long list of new coins eager to become part of the UQUID universe The UQUID system aims at further on boarding other coins and by 2018 to support over 200 altcoins The criteria for new joining coins are to already have an existing lifespan of over 6 months whilst exceptions will be made for highly liquid assets 4 2 Stage 2 Saving Execution of this part of the project has already begun The time line below reflects the shortest time possible based on all tokens sold Figure 10 Project Plan Stage 2 COPYRIGHT\xc2\xa9 UQUID ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Page | 12

Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s altcoin or fiat currencies directly on the system Figure 11 Multi Currency e wallet Storing assets on virtual carriers provides lack of confidence and security concerns especially related to the storage on mobile devices To avoid customer dissatisfaction and plausible uncertainty related to security threats UQUID has adopted the latest multi signature technology that provides an advanced privacy protection with a two factor authentication system and an anti phishing protection The multi signature e wallet technology consists of three keys one held by the security provider one held by the user and one held on behalf of the user by a third party Key Recovery Service (KRS) Every transaction is authorised by two signatures the user and the Service Provider where the Service Provider will not co sign a double spend This leaves only the user and the KRS to double spend The Service Provider has set up a prevention campaign of double spent that liaise with any KRS used to give a notice period prior to any signatures it makes Figure 12 Multi Key Technology COPYRIGHT\xc2\xa9 UQUID ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Page | 13 \x0cUQUID customers can be assured that their Bitcoin or altcoin will be stored securely on their UQUID e wallets The capabilities of the UQUID mobile app will not only provide e wallet storing for 200 coins but also a range of fiat currency 4 2 2 UK E Money Licence To further diversify the freedom of payment methods available to our customers UQUID will require an FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) authorisation UQUID\xe2\x80\x99s global strategy has planned to start the FCA accreditation process immediately after the ICO completion 4 2 3 Real Time Spent Having implemented the multi currency e wallet customers will now be able to deposit and store their currencies for free on the UQUID e wallet When shifting assets from the wallet to the card two main fees will apply \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 0 1% fee of the transferred amount when using UQUID Coin 0 5 % of transferred amount when any other currencies fiat or crypto used Figure 13 Coin Transfer Fees Currently in order to make a crypto payment the user will have to follow 3 simple steps Figure 14 Current Payment Process Diagram 1) Deposit currency and /or coins to the UQUID multi sign e wallet 2) Transfer money manually to the card (Fees applied as per Figure 13) 3) Pay or Purchase by UQUID Plastic or Virtual Card COPYRIGHT\xc2\xa9 UQUID ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Page | 14 \x0cReal Time Spend is a unique first of its kind system that enables further simplifying of the steps described above This system will allow the user to access their wealth on the go bringing great untapped value to these assets and eliminating the need of preloading the UQUID Card With the implementation of this system users would only need to follow a simplified process of two steps 1) Deposit currency and or coins to the UQUID multi sign e wallet 2) Pay or Purchase by UQUID Plastic or Virtual Card Figure 15 Real Time Spent Diagram Transfers between wallet and card will occur automatically only on payment demand and will be governed by the Real Time Spent System (RTSS) During the operation of RTSS the multi signature ewallet protocol will be triggered instantaneously as part of the security protocol and protection 4 3 Stage 3 Exchange The ability of the UQUID e wallet to store together coins and fiat currencies has driven the need to incorporate another unique feature in to the crypto station Figure 16 Stage 3 Time Plan Fo usi g o the customer first UQUID syste ith an

security compromise especially when holding big amounts The user is exposed to a direct risk of losing all assets UQUID has addressed these issues by providing its customer with multi key ewallets as described in the section above Blockchain trading platform combined with capabilities to trade/exchange fiat currency is an enterprise that requires a great deal of expertise and development In order

to date security trends will be implemented to provide its users with a secure trading environment COPYRIGHT\xc2\xa9 UQUID ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Page | 16 \x0c4 4 Stage 4 Investing In conjunction with UQUID Trading Platform (UQTC) launch a Social Fund Management Campaign will start Following the blockchain idea of decentralisation and asset transfer freedom the UQUID System have planned to release a Social Coin Management Fund (SCMF) feature Figure 18 Stage 4 Time Plan Once completely built and developed these systems will be available as a part of the trading platform It will be possible for non UQUID users to access the Social Coin Manager but only for viewing purposes Once logged in to the SCMF system users will be able to link their accounts to the UQTP and maintain this automatically In the SCMF successful traders will be able to build a portfolio and view their rate of success Depending on the overall profitability the trader will be awarded with an Investment rating Should their rating be sufficiently high they will be given the option to share the content of their portfolio with less experienced traders If both parties agree the less experienced trader will pay a minor percentage from their newly acquired portfolio returns Figure 19 Investment Rating Once the trader has engaged in tracking the portfolio of the experienced user the less experienced investor will be able to provide feedback to the original portfolio creator which will be visible to all other system users COPYRIGHT\xc2\xa9 UQUID ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Page | 17 \x0cThe rating system introduced will

Rating Criteria The rating criteria as such will encourage the main idea of the SCMF where only members with over four star rating will be able to share their portfolios In trading to secure great returns constant market monitoring will be necessary Recognising the need of being informed in real time UQUID will provide its users with daily Bitcoin updates Even a special statistic tool will be available to advice of when it is best to sell or buy coins This will also act as investment protection protocol Once the price drops sharply or below a certain point the system will alert the user that it is time to sell now to avoid losses Another very important feature will be the ICO Display All future and newly released ICO\xe2\x80\x99s will be viewable on this display In this way UQUID SCMF will keep its users constantly updated with what is coming and what are the potential investment opportunities 4 5 Stage 5 Direct Spending Figure 20 Conventional Block Chain Shopping The lack of regulatory authority on coin price control still stands as a risk for merchants when accepting payments in virtual currency Currently online merchants have not even considered altcoins as an alternative payment option COPYRIGHT\xc2\xa9 UQUID ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Page | 18 \x0cFigure 21 Traditional Shopping Nevertheless our traditional e commerce is on the edge of a huge revolution The conventional finance system will slowly be substituted with the evolved more pragmatic and more cost efficient way of shopping Figure 22 Future Block chain Shopping As part of the UQUID Global mission building a bridge between the two financial systems will be a vital part of the future development of the UQUID Coin Shopping System \xe2\x80\x93 UQCSS This feature will be embedded into the main system and will feed assets to commit online payments directly from the e wallet UQCSS will allow its users to pay directly with their preferred coins when purchasing online from Amazon eBay and other

feature content will be developed by a team of experts living and breathing in this environment ensuring an unrivalled level of customer experience whilst building the system Highest security protocols will ensure that customers\xe2\x80\x99 e wallets are safe and unauthorised transaction will never be released In brief UQCSS will provide its customers with a direct link to our conventional economic environment allowing them to commence hassle free payments directly with crypto currencies Figure 24 Future Coin Payments 4 6 Stage 6 Cashout Figure 25 Money Transfer COPYRIGHT\xc2\xa9 UQUID ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Page | 20 \x0cThis feature will allow any coin owners to transfer coins or cash to other users accounts or end destinations When UQS receives the payment request and the coins have been deposited to UQS the UQS will forward the request to partner platforms Once the request has been received the partner system will transfer the money to the requested end destination Usually such transfers will take time before all parties have reviewed the senders request and authorised it This time lag will usually occur when altcoins or Bitcoins have been deposited When senders use UQC the
