Foreword 1 1 Vigorous development of cryptocurrency In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper describing Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s electronic cash system in the Cryptography Mailing List of Metzdowd The Genesis block of Bitcoin was created on January 3 2009 and the first 50 Bitcoins were created simultaneously Bitcoin was free from the constraints of \xe2\x80\x9ctrusted third party\xe2\x80\x9d with distributed ledgers and which was called \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d by Satoshi Nakamoto As a kind of cryptocurrency Bitcoin has great advantages over traditional currencies Decentralization Bitcoin is the first type of distributed virtual currency with the whole network composed of user nodes and no central bank Algorithms serve as the guarantee for Bitcoin security Global circulation Bitcoin can be managed from any computer connected to the Internet There is no complicated formality or line of limit for its transaction You can make payment if you know the Bitcoin address of the other party Convenient to use compared with cash and various precious metal currencies Bitcoins cost almost nothing to carry and keep and there is no wear and tear Cryptocurrency ecosystem might seem like a slow start but its evolvement became faster and faster in the last two years It is a sign that the tech giants like Microsoft Dell and Dish etc are embracing cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment This is a revolutionary solution and cryptocurrencies have benefited numerous businesses and industries while the financial and technology industries have become the vortex of cryptocurrency and blockchain storm \xe2\x80\xa2 Financial industry Financial institutions are probing into how to use their advantages effectively Banks are adapting to blockchain technology and carrying out transactions of derivatives or even cotton with it A consortium of multiple banks is supporting IBM to create a blockchain technology that can be used for cross border transaction Australian Stock Market is the world\xe2\x80\x99s first stock trading platform based on blockchain 3/22 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Banking industry More than 2 billion people in the world have no personal bank account Cryptocurrency accounts enable them to transfer money and receive payments The countries with unstable or nonproblematic banking systems for instance Venezuela have turned to cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and etc \xe2\x80\xa2 E commernce Many large online retailers have begun accepting the payment with token coins such as Bitcoin or Ether etc Overstock com Expedia Shopify and other large companies have accepted cryptocurrency as a mode of payment Merchants and users can complete transactions more safely and faster and avoid credit card fraud meanwhile they need not to worry about payment service providers freezing funds for all kinds of reasons any more We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen how cryptocurrency can change the world in more ways than people can imagine 1 2 Current problems for Bitcoin and its competitors Bitcoin has emerged as a kind of peer to peer electronic cash system since Satoshi Nakamoto published the White Paper which is just the design goal of Bitcion As people gradually explore the application possibility of Bitcion in terms of store of value world monetary base global settlement network derivative financial system and global notarization system etc Bitcoin has been given more and more important significance nevertheless all these purposes are not likely to be achieved simultaneously as a result an increasing number of divergences have appeared among the development teams miner manufacturers and miners in the Bitcoin eco system due to the different economic and political prospects in the future In particular the centralization problem of research and development teams in the expansion and HashRate war has raised serious worries about the future political risks of Bitcoin Bifurcation always exists in Bitcoin (BTC) In the previous bifurcation the status of BTC was never challenged in the field of cryptocurrency but the market share of BTC fell sharply to about 34% from above 90% early due to the network congestion resulted from too small blocks in the cryptocurrency bull market in 2017 Although it returned to more than 50% BTC congestion still existed in the next rising cycle so it is difficult to predict it in the future In most people\xe2\x80\x99s opinions the expansion of block was originally a consensus which was a simple thing but the dispute was about how to make expansion Nevertheless the debate contradiction and even war caused by the seemingly simple issue has cast a shadow on the development of BTC and all kinds of problems 4/22 \x0cresulted from the minor issue of expansion have made the future of BTC and many forked coins based on HashRate POW gradually unclear In addition the twists and turns confronted by the giant company of miners in listing and the dull of sale of Asic miners have blocked the channel for many potential users of digital currency to access digital currency market through mining thereby making the channel for funds to enter digital currency market become the purchase of USDT we believe it will harm the future development of digital currency market Meanwhile it is always difficult for many digital currencies based on GPU and FPGA mining such as ETH and GRIN etc to become the mainstream choice due to the high price of GPU and POS digital currency cannot undertake the heavy task of anchoring real world assets therefore it is also difficult to introduce more funds into the digital currency field Hence we created the Volume Network and we hope the miners and new entrants could obtain digital currency through hard disk mining with the aim of enabling new users to acquire digital currency through lower barrier mining thus entering the digital currency market 1 2 1 Division of consensus in BTC ecosystem BTC has been divided out into BCH and BSV in the past two years and we will not make more detailed description of its complicated and eccentric process here The source of BCH was a bifurcation initiated by ABC team and Bitmain when the Core team of BTC refused the Elastic Volume solution but chose SegWit and Lightning Network for capacity expansion which might cause the decline of BTC competitiveness in the future This bifurcation gave birth to BCH After this bifurcation BTC would gradually develop into the global settlement network and value reserve currency rather than the world base currency In addition Lightning Network will become the main transaction channel for micropayment uses while the main chain of BTC will become a settlement network as a result the transactions through the main chain of BTC will decrease However the miners\xe2\x80\x99 earnings will gradually decrease as the number of small transactions decreases and the safety level of BTC may be reduced The future prospect of BTC depends on the Core team and the Core team s insistence on crypto punk culture as well as small block and utopianism hidden in the crowd will make it possible for BTC to keep away from the needs of mainstream Therefore the centralization of development teams has brought great political risks to the prospect of BTC and restricted the progress of ecosystem Supported by the capacity expansion supporters the ABC development team of Bitcoin developed a Bitcoin client with a volume of 8M blocks around July 2017 which was launched and operated 5/22 \x0cindependently from BTC network on August 1 2017 namely the BCH now In the following year although Bitcoin Unlimited Bitprim nChain Bitcrust ElectrumX Parity VOLT and other teams were involved in BCK development ABC team still undertook the main development work and mastered the dominant right BCH is a kind of digital currency adhering to the path of exploration and renewal in which the technologies including block by block difficulty rule DAA Two level intelligent contract wormhole and etc have been introduced Nevertheless the development of BCH has brought unpredictable risks due to the division of BSV After ABC launched 0 18 version upgrade on Bitcoincash org (the official website of BCH) CSW strongly criticized it and released BSV version proposing to cancel 0 18 version upgrade of ABC and adopt BSV version in the whole network Due to the support of CSW and the introduction of a similarly religious development mode as well as the personality cult and rationalism BSV has greatly split the BCH community consensus but BSV has also weakened the originally great development potential of BCH regardless of the future development of BSV thereby resulting in the difficult implementation of the huge global economic vision of global monetary base and electronic cash BTC BCH and BSV have coexisted since the beginning of expansion war which has brought difficulty for people newly entering the digital currency market to make choice The consensus split in Bitcoin community has also led to the deviation from the great goal of e cash We hope to provide a new additional solution for the new crowd to understand and acquire digital currencies with a very low entry barrier just as BTC before 1 2 2 Development team centralization and development team motivation The formation and development of Bitcoin ecosystem heavily relied on the innovation interest and idealism enthusiasm of early participants of which the developers and Geek groups played the most important role however as time goes on and the currency prices rise the miners and mining machine manufacturers gain huge benefits but the developers groups obtain no immediate interest in the development of currencies Therefore as the core developers of Bitcoin constituted BlockStream and developed the Lightning Network system and the problem of centralized code review authority has become increasingly urgent Essentially the Core team spared no effort to fulfill the vision of Lightning Network and global settlement network which also embodied the fact that developers needed economic incentives 6/22 \x0cHowever under the current system neither Core team nor ABC team can directly benefit from the development of digital currency which will cause great problems 1 2 3 Public relations problems caused by the waste of power resources Cryptocurrency miners are tight lipped about the exact amount of electricity they use in mining but everyone declares that the electricity consumption is huge when asked According to the cryptocurrency energy consumption index issued by digiconomist net a cryptocurrency news agency the annual energy consumption for Bitcoin mining is about 42 15~54 11 TWh (1 TWh 100 million KWH) which accounts for about 1 2% of the annual electricity consumption in the United States 5 1% of that in Russia 10 4% of that in French 15 7% of that in the UK 14 7% of that in Italy 20 4% of that in Australia 36 4% of that in the Netherlands and 72 2% of that in the Czech Republic This number will increase year by year as new miners join the network and mining becomes more difficult It is even predicted that according to the current growth rate virtual currency mining will account for all of the world s electricity generation by 2024 7/22 \x0cIt is terrible It means that Bitcoin will emit the equivalent of 2 000 tons of carbon dioxide a year which is a blatant defiance of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate and anyone who enjoys the coastal forest and unthreatened death from mosquito bites From another metaphorical perspective Bitcoin P2P network is basically a distributed super AI that is turning all energy (i e matter) in the universe into Bitcoin So will we really use up electricity due to Bitcoin mining At present governments around the world have noticed the resource depletion trend caused by Bitcoin and the NDRC has introduce policies to eliminate Bitcoin mining for its backward production capacity on April 8 2019 the NDRC announced on its web site a file named Catalogue of Guidance for Industrial Structure Adjustment (Exposure Draft 2019) aiming to encourage limit or eliminate all kinds of industries and optimize the industrial structure In the Catalogue of Guidance for Industrial Structure Adjustment the catalogues of various industries that need to be encouraged or eliminated were listed in which the presentation of virtual currency \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d activity appeared in the catalogue of industries to be eliminated It was also specially explained in the document that it was the production process of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies 8/22 \x0cIn the document classification the mining activity belongs to \xe2\x80\x9cbackward production equipment\xe2\x80\x9d and the time limit for elimination is immediate elimination It is worth mentioning that mining activity is classified together with some toxic and polluting technologies/processes The period for soliciting public opinions for the Catalogue of Guidance for Industrial Structure Adjustment (Exposure Draft 2019) is April 8 2019 May 7 2019 in other words if no one puts forward opinion on the elimination of mining industry before May 7 mining activities will undoubtedly be eliminated by the state In this context PoST with hard disk capacity as the cryptographic consensus algorithm basis can be used as a basic consensus algorithm to generate new digital currencies 1 2 4 Entry barrier resulted from the centralization of HashRate There s no trick for Bitcoin s POW consensus mechanism SHA 256 algorithm has no alternative to Brute Force This means that the computer should be constantly running with a fan operating constantly to cool the overheated and overloaded processor And this is where the egalitarianism collapses and mining pools with centralized HashRate begin to emerge At the beginning cryptocurrency geeks could operate mining software on their home computers with standard CPUs Afterwards people began to be aware of that GPUs were better suited for hashing than older CPUs After a few years people began to customize FPGA chips purchase kits and then customize them for mining And then people preferred ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) which were customized according to Bitcoin algorithm and deployed to the specific data center According to the statistics of block mining in the past year the top five mining pools in the world have accounted for 62 6% of the HashRate of the whole network and the top ten mining pools have accounted for 86 3% of the HashRate of the whole network It is almost impossible for an individual to get the block reward 9/22 \x0cCurrently only a small proportion of the global population own digital currencies and more and more people are gradually accepting and understanding digital currencies However the high entry threshold of Bitcoin will keep these people out of digital currencies We hope that the emergence of Volume Network will solve this problem 1 2 5 Network centralization In the Bitcoin blockchain a decentralized network HashRate is power In November 2018 the bifurcated Bitcoin cash bifurcated again due to the disagreement of community opinions According to the statistical data of Forl Lol BCH\xe2\x80\x99s overall hash value rose from 9 54% to 15 43% from November 10 2018 to November 17 2018 simultaneously BTC\xe2\x80\x99s hash value dropped by 7% in those days from 90 46% to 84 57% The final result was that BitcoinABC represented by Bitmain won the victory BitcoinABC held more than 51% of the HashRate of the whole network with the HashRate of 4000P of Bitcoin com mining pool at the critical moment The HashRate war has shown that it will take just enough centralized HashRate and a little greed to manipulate the Bitcoin network This is exactly the opposite of Nakamoto s original intention of peer to peer decentralization In the design of Volume Network the consensus based on HDD capability will make the whole cryptogram consensus process more dispersed Moreover the HashRate of the whole system will be distributed in the hands of each miner more evenly in the absence of Asic 10/22 \x0c1 3 What is Volume Network and what are its advantages Volume Network is dedicated to building a large scale cryptocurrency that can be applied in the real commercial society We firmly believe that the real large scale is that everyone can participate in mining and the total cost of network maintenance can be reduced as much as possible Therefore we propose a more energy saving and environmental friendly safe and anti Hacking cryptocurrency Volume Network with a low entry barrier which can be truly applied in the commercial society on a large scale 1 3 1 Ultra low entry barrier Unlike PoW mining which requires expensive and dedicated ASIC rig or GPU Volume Network mining can be achieved with an extra laptop and a USB HDD As long as you have one extra PC and terabytes of disk space to access the mining game you can basically mine several VOL every day Due to the very common redundancy in storage space as well as the cheap hardware and less intense competition more people can participate in PoST mining which means the network is more dispersive and decentralized We believe that hard disk mining can really lower the entry barrier for mining and fulfill the vision that every family has mining machine and everyone can participate in mining At present the price of an ordinary hard disk with a capacity of 3T is about RMB 500 Yuan and you can participate in the mining of Volume Network based on cryptogram consensus process with an ordinary PC which is a very low barrier for people to understand and enter the field of digital currency for the first time 1 3 2 Energy saving and environmentally friendly Hard disk is provided with many advantages such as low power consumption no heat generation no heat dissipation low noise low purchasing threshold and no incorporation into ASIC Dozens of hard disks placed at the corner are enough and you do not need to worry about the huge cost of electricity 11/22 \x0cIn the Volume Network the average power consumption of mining with 5T hard disk is less than 7W Bitcoin ASIC miner consumes about 1 350 2 000W while Volume Network requires only 7090W which is only 1/20 of the power consumption of bitcoin ASIC miner An ASIC miner will consume about 17 520 KWH every year while a hard disk miner will only consume about 700 KWH The hard disk miner not only consumes very little electricity but also produces very little noise and almost no heat compared with Bitcoin ASIC miner The hard risks with larger capacity will be required for the mining earnings in the future and the used hard disks can be used to store movies and data or used as the arrays of independent drives Therefore the residual value and preservation rate of hard disk is very high 1 3 3 Safe and anti Hacking Proof of Time is an auxiliary mechanism of spatial \xe2\x80\x9ccultivation\xe2\x80\x9d To be precise Proof of Time is a Verifiable Delay Algorithm which is a special Proof of Work During the verification process a certain period of time and a specific number of iterations is required Each iteration can be accelerated but parallel computation cannot be carried out across iterations Meanwhile it also is required to ensure that the operation results are verifiable and authoritative if any two different nodes are verified the computation results are consistent and other nodes in the network can verify the results In this mechanism Volume Network can even set the computation result of Proof of Time in one block as the starting computation point of Proof of Space in the next block By virtue of the Proof of Time and Proof of Space the generation of each block will take the Proof of Space as a starting point and the Proof of Time as the ending point and ensure a block is indeed a block (that is what we call the finalized) and the weight of each block are equal then the attacker won t be able to rewrite the whole chain from a solitary block 12/22 \x0c2 Technology solutions of Volume Network PoST (Proof of Space and Time) is taken as the basis of consensus algorithm in the Volume Network 2 1 Architecture of Volume Network Before probing into the details of mining it is necessary to understand the architecture of Volume Network first A PC or a mining pool is a mining node Mining nodes need to be connected to at least one node in the Volume Network Mining node needs to store the mining private keys The miner client can be started locally or connected to several other miner clients and then connected to the hard disk through the client 2 2 Consensus algorithm Proof of Space and Time (PoST) PoST (Proof of Space and Time) is to introduce the time domain operator based on the original PoC(Proof of Capacity) algorithms and compulsively require the miners to make arithmetical operation with certain time intensity after obtaining the candidate block data based on the characteristics of Verifiable Delay Functions and make block selection by combining the rapid 13/22 \x0cverification results and candidate block data so as to alleviate the vulnerabilities in similarly selfish mining rewriting attack and other security aspects in POC (Proof of Capacity) algorithm PoST consensus algorithm can be divided into two parts plot based hard disk mapping algorithm and VDF based proof of time According to the size of different hard drives it will take days or even weeks to complete mapping We use a very slow hash algorithm called Shabal for mapping Because it is very slow to complete the computational process of Shabal hash algorithms we must precompute and store them in hard disks which is called hard disk mapping A large number of pre computed Nonces created during the mapping process will occupy the harddisk space The larger the hard disk space allocated to mapping the more Nonces you can store The more Nonces you can store the larger probability for you to successfully mine When a Plot file is generated it is essential to provide a Volume Network account Because each account is different even if the numbers of Nonce are the same each miner s Plot file is different Meanwhile we also designed a VDF based Proof of Time algorithm in which the probability of the network choosing a miner to create a new block is in direct proportion to the relationship between the current miner s storage capacity (S) and the whole network capacity (A) We designed the algorithm so that the miners had to provide storage and computation to prove that a consensus could be reached after the data was stored 2 3 Key technologies 1 Plot based hard disk mapping algorithm The miner will firstly generate a Plot file based on their public keys and Shabal algorithm which is known as a P drive mapping The larger the hard disk capacity is the more the Hash values will be filled in the Plot file and the higher the probability of mining block will be 2 VDF based Proof of Time algorithm After informed of the transactions received by the wallet the miner will form a block and look for the best matched Nonce in the hard drive based on the hash value of this block and convert the 14/22 \x0cNonce to Deadline The miner is required to perform mathematical operation with certain time intensity on the Nonce so as to obtain the VDF proof and broadcast the block and VDF proof Below we introduce the technical details of hard disk mapping algorithm and VDF Proof of Time algorithm 2 3 1 Plot based hard disk mapping algorithm The pre computed Hash data stored in the hard disk is called Plot file P drive mapping is the process of generating Plot file in the hard drive The 256 bit Shabal algorithm is adopted in Volume Network which is a time consuming Hash function and an algorithm to resist ASIC This algorithm is more suitable for PoST consensus Plot file consists of a large number of Nonce files The size of each Nonce is 256K Each Nonce has a unique number from 0 to 18446744073709551615 Each Nonce is divided into 4 096 segments and each segment is called a Scoop Each Scoop includes 64 bytes and two Hash values In order to create nonce we first create the first seed which contains Plotter ID and nonce number and then generate the first hash value by using the shabal256 function as Scoop#4095Hash#1 15/22 \x0cThen Scoop#4095Hash#1 is attached to the start seed as the seed for the next round of shabal256 computation Then attach Scoop#4095Hash#0 and Scoop#4095Hash#1 to the starting seed as the seeds for the next round of shabal256 computation In turn FinalHash value will be generated Use FinalHash or any other Hash and store in the Plot file 2 3 2 VDF based Proof of Time algorithm Base target is calculated from the nearest 24 blocks Base target is used to adjust the difficulty in mining The lower the Base target the harder to mine Because of the adjustment of difficulty Volume Network can guarantee to generate a block every four minutes or so If you mine in a mining pool the awarding is involved which in fact is to tell the Volume Network 1) all your earnings are distributed to the pool 2) The pool can use the Deadline found in your Plot file and generate the block signature Before mining the miner is required to staking a certain number of coins to get mining qualification The miner should send the transaction of staking coins to the whole network and the whole network nodes will record the staking information in the local block after receiving the transaction of staking coins The first thing of mining is that the miner asks the wallet about the mining information block packaging signature base target and height of the next block The wallet is responsible for the 16/22 \x0cblock packaging signature and the height of the next block which can be used by the miner to generate Generation Hash based on Shabal256 algorithm Then Scoop numerical value can be obtained through modular arithmetic (4096) All Scoop numbered with the above results are read from the Plot file For each Scoop the upper block signature is merged and then processed by Shabal256 to obtain Target Target is divided by the Base Target to get an 8 byte Deadline The miner shall check whether the Deadline is low enough which can be used as the alternate block data if low enough Input the Deadline into the Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) and perform VDF calculation with a certain percentage of time from the current time to the Deadline so as to obtain at least L evidence chains and the final calculation result R where (T L R) are publicly verifiable The miner can calculate whether it meets the block requirements according to (T L R) If it meets the formula requirements and no one else has mined the block before you after the Deadline for the mining of the last block you can mine the block and get an award The miner shall submit information to the wallet account ID and Nonce numerical value If you are an independent miner you also need to provide the key If it is a pool the pool key should be used After receiving the Deadline information submitted by the miner the wallet will create the corresponding Nonce to verify the VDF and Deadline If VDF verification is successful the wallet will check whether the current system time meets the Deadline and continue to wait if the current system time is before the Deadline If another wallet generates a valid block that meets the Deadline when the miner is waiting it is necessary to discard the block (since the block is no longer valid) If two or more miners submit the Deadline the wallet will choose the earliest Deadline When the Deadline is met the wallet will start generating and broadcasting the block The wallet will check each transaction packaged into a block for example whether the transaction signature is correct whether the time is correct and so on The wallet will calculate all the amounts and fees for the block The block will only record the transaction ID and Sha256 information of all transaction information After receiving the block the wallets of other nodes will verify the block transactions one by one and reward the miners When calculating the reward the wallet will first retrieve the staking 17/22 \x0cinformation in the local block and gets the full reward if the miner s staking coins meet the staking conditions defined in the economic model 3 Token economy model Block chain platform is essentially a fair value circulation market so the cost basis of all economic behaviors lies in the transaction cost VOL coin is the carrier of transaction cost which will be used for the following incentive purposes from this perspective 1 Rewards for bookkeeping (mining) 2 In the consensus the token holding of VOL will affect the weight of individual cases (i e node block selection) 3 The participants of Volume Network ecosystem will promote the rewards of ecological progress in underlying code development peripheral tool/service supply propaganda of ecological influence and implementation of application scene and other aspects 3 1 Token distribution Volume Network(VOL) Token model 1 Total supply 10 billion VOL 2 Block reward 4000 VOL per block 3 Premine 3%VOL will be premined to IEO and the rest 97%VOL will be mined normally 4 Miners 9 1 billion VOL of block reward is rewarded to miners which is 3752 5 VOL/block 5 VOL Ecosystem 600 million VOL of block reward (247 5 VOL/block) will be rewarded to VOL Ecosystem including core code upgrade contributor mining pool service provider mining machine service provider promotion team and following participants 3 2 Calculation of miner\xe2\x80\x99s earning According to the PoST consensus mechanism the HashRate of each miner is determined by the available hard disk storage space and the earning is determined by the success rate of block mining and the current block earning Assuming that miner A has A 10T hard disk and that there are 10P in the whole network at this time and that the CPU of miner A is at the average level the probability of miner A successfully mining block is 0 1% 18/22 \x0cAt the current stage the block award is 4 000VOL with one block mined every 4 minutes and 360 blocks per day The average earning of miner A is 3600*4000*0 1%=1440 VOL/day 3 3 Increase in mining for staking Staking bonus will be added to PoST consensus mechanism Additional mining rate will be given according to miners\xe2\x80\x99 staked VOL token The total amount of staked VOL will extremely approach to 100% amount of VOL total supply With the increasing of miner staking the bonus of per unit will decrease The calculation formula is as below 4 Roadmap March 2019 the establishment of core contributor team as well as the technical route and economic model survey of Volume Network project has been
