 Background 
 
 
 
 
 
 With global policy development and adoption of digital assets underway an increasing 
 number of professional investment institutions are looking to enter the digital asset 
 management market However the main pain point in the industry is that investors have 
 limited access to good investment or wealth management products while it is also 
 difficult for trading teams or digital asset management firms to reach out to the right 
 investors for their fundraising purpose 
 
 
 
 
 
 The root cause of this issue derives from the lack of formal broker dealer structure in 
 the digital asset industry In traditional finance a broker dealer is an integral part of 
 capital market structure which functions to connect investors with investment products 
 and supporting client trading and capital raising needs However this broker dealer 
 function is yet to be fully developed for the digital asset industry leading to lack of 
 effective communication mechanism between investors and investment targets 
 
 
 
 
 
 Therefore it is critical to establish this collaboration channel for both investors and 
 asset management firms In the current market a digital asset exchange is the only 
 effective platform connecting and serving both trading clients and investors through its 
 trading products and wallet management capability 
 
 
 Our Vision 
 
 
 
 
 
 Building on deep strategic collaboration with all the top tier digital asset exchanges and 
 brokers UAT strives to provide investors with a professional investment service 
 platform for selecting quality asset management products as well as to effectively 
 support fund raising needs of trading teams and crypto funds Furthermore the platform 
 will offer the wide range of fund administrative services for trading teams and funds 
 including but not limited to account management performance auditing PL reporting 
 asset transfer etc All these services whether provided to investors trading teams or 
 funds will be provided through 
 web based reporting or on adhoc basis As a result the 
 
 
 trading teams and funds can focus their resources more on their own trading and 
 investment strategies to potentially achieve higher return

 UAT is a non refundable functional utility token which will be used as the payment 
 medium of service exchange between participants on the UAT platform The goal of 
 introducing UAT is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement 
 between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the UAT platform UAT does 
 not in any way represent any shareholding participation right title or interest in the 
 Foundation the Distributor its affiliates or any other company enterprise or

 UAT provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to 
 participate in the ecosystem on the UAT platform UAT is an integral and indispensable 
 part of the UAT platform because without UAT there would be no incentive for users

 Risks 
 
 
 You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing 
 UAT holding UAT and using UAT for participation in the UAT platform In the worst 
 scenario this could lead to the loss of all or part of the UAT which had been purchased 
 IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE UAT YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE 
 ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS 
 
 
 
 
 
 Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions The regulatory status of UAT and 
 distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions The 
 regulation of virtual currencies has become a primary target of regulation in all major 
 countries in the world It is impossible to predict how when or whether regulatory 
 agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such 
 technology and its applications including UAT and/or the UAT platform Regulatory 
 actions could negatively impact UAT and/or the UAT platform in various ways The 
 Foundation the Distributor (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in 
 the event that regulatory actions or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to 
 operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary 
 regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction After consulting with a wide 
 range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure 
 of virtual currencies a cautious approach will be applied towards the sale of UAT 
 Therefore for the token sale the sale strategy may be constantly adjusted in order to 
 avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible 
 
 
 Inadequate disclosure of information As at the date hereof the UAT platform is still 
 under development and its design concepts consensus mechanisms algorithms codes 
 and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated 
 and changed Although this white paper contains the most current information relating 
 to the UAT platform it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated 
 
 
 by the UAT team from time to time The UAT team has no ability and obligation to 
 keep holders of UAT informed of every detail (including development progress and 
 expected milestones) regarding the project to develop the UAT platform hence 
 insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable 
 
 
 Failure to develop There is the risk that the development of the UAT platform will 
 not be executed or implemented as planned for a variety of reasons including without 
 limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset virtual currency or 
 UAT unforeseen technical difficulties and shortage of development funds for activities 
 
 
 Security Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere 
 with UAT and/or the UAT platform in a variety of ways including but not limited to 
 malware attacks denial of service attacks consensus based attacks Sybil attacks 
 smurfing and spoofing Furthermore there is a risk that a third party or a member of 
 the Foundation the Distributor or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally 
 introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of UAT and/or the UAT platform 
 which could negatively affect UAT and/or the UAT platform 
 
 
 Other risks In addition the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive 
 and there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) 
 associated with your purchase holding and use of UAT including those that the 
 Foundation or the Distributor cannot anticipate Such risks may further materialise as 
 unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks You should 
 conduct full due diligence on the Foundation the Distributor its affiliates and the UAT 
 team as well as understand the overall framework mission and vision for the UAT 
 platform prior to purchasing UAT
