Whitepaper 02 Introduction In August 2017 XPA reached its \xef\xac\x81rst ICO launch as a cryptocurrency asset focused on online media The market capitalization of XPA soared from an equivalent of $100 million to $320 million in just four months as XPA skyrocketed into the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the world At the same time the global economy is still facing currency in\xef\xac\x82ation increasing monopoly of vested interests a widening gap between rich and poor economic crises that lead to social tensions and chaos in the cryptocurrency market Faced with the greatest opportunities and challenges in this era we hope to come up with a solution that will restore the essence of the blockchain by achieving a truly decentralized economy and ful\xef\xac\x81lling Satoshi Nakamura\xe2\x80\x99s original dream In January 2018 the XPA team continued its creative research and development process moving XPA from a single purpose entertainment platform to a new digital asset ecosystem that combines decentralized trading asset mortgage and access to external funding A new asset management ecosystem neXt Personal Assets is a next generation personal asset platform that provides users with an asset management infrastructure that seamlessly connects traditional and digital assets The XPA team based on a profound understanding of economics incorporating the economic theory into the blockchain smart contracts built the world s \xef\xac\x81rst cryptocurrency ecosystem stable enough for long term investment token to token trades and easily converted to \xef\xac\x81at money for daily use XPA\xe2\x80\x99s asset management ecosystem aims to realize bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s original vision a fully decentralized economic system one where money was not controlled by the whims of any large institution but \xef\xac\x81rmly in the hands of the people In a hypothetical cryptocurrency economy instead of relying on banks or other large \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions anyone would be able to have full control over the money they need with safety and privacy guaranteed by the neutrality of the blockchain \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 03 The XPA Asset Management includes XPA XPA Assets and XPA Exchange Its advantages are XPA Assets are digital assets pegged to \xef\xac\x81at currency that avoid the turbulence of the current cryptocurrency market and solve the volatility and speed problems that plague cryptocurrency transactions making it possible for cryptocurrency to be used for ordinary goods and services XPA is a practical cryptocurrency that is stable with stored value circulation and payment features Second XPA contains innovative transaction scenarios By introducing a safer decentralized trading mechanism centralized exchange liquidity as well as traditional trading models such as mortgages leverage and futures index contracts XPA has become not just way to buy and sell cryptocurrency but also an integrated platform for asset management and control Third XPA is breaking the barrier between physical and virtual worlds because XPA Assets are pegged to \xef\xac\x81at value they have a liquidity that makes it easier to shift from cryptocurrency to \xef\xac\x81at money This is most useful as XPA can be used online and o\xef\xac\x84ine for a variety of industry applications and use scenarios Combined with external access to industry partners XPA and XPA Assets can be quickly traded with legal currency not only to provide liquidity for the entire system but also to create entirely new application models Market Opportunities The Internet has been developed for over two decades However most people still manage assets in a traditional manner in the sense that assets are monitored and regulated by the government authorities and regulations of each country Global liquidity and transactions across borders are still managed by ine\xef\xac\x83cient \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions and backward transaction models \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 04 The digital world needs its own digital asset distribution and management architecture Existing blockchain assets (such as BTC XRP or ETH) have to some extent achieved this goal but widespread speculation and a turbulent cryptocurrency market compared to real world assets has greatly hampered the rate of acceptance by average people The XPA team realized the most pressing issues with cryptocurrency investment today 1 Tedious exchange certi\xef\xac\x81cation and deposit procedures For ordinary people who have not yet entered the world of cryptocurrency converting their existing assets (such as legal tender) into cryptocurrency requires complex and time consuming access and entry procedures Many also have to wait long periods of time for the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s audit mechanisms and for deposits and withdrawals Thus the investment threshold is high and many often miss the time period for desired investments 2 The cryptocurrency market \xef\xac\x82uctuates wildly fueled by speculation That volatility is not only an investment risk but also an obstacle to using cryptocurrency for daily life 3 Most cryptocurrencies are still at the stage of technical exploration and infrastructure buildout with very few scenarios in which they may be actually used Blockchain technology and its extended assets provide the basis for the digital world but at this stage better assets management and business models are needed to guide the seamless migration of traditional assets to the digital world The blockchain world lacks a bridge between the virtual currency and the real world XPA Blockchain Asset Management Ecosystem The XPA team and its associated TideiSun team based on the core value of XPA incorporated macroeconomic perspectives into blockchain smart contracts creating an innovative \x0c05 XPA 2 0 Whitepaper blockchain asset to meet user\xe2\x80\x99s needs The team\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to try to realize Satoshi Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s original intention to build a decentralized digital currency system XPA Assets Fiat Currency Figure 1 XPA \xef\xac\x81at currency and XPA Assets have the best triangular relationship between investment stability and consumer demand XPA XPA includes the blockchain and main network assets of the same name (XPA temporarily running on the Ethereum network) and decentralized transaction mechanisms (XPA Exchange temporarily running on the Ethereum network) XPA Assets XPA Assets is a secure cryptocurrency that is anchored to the legal tender currently based on the ERC20 format and acquired through mortgaging XPA via smart contract The series of assets anchored with the \xef\xac\x81at currency includes but is not limited to XPAUSD / XPACNY / XPAEUR / XPAJPY / XPATWD with XPAUSD anchored USD at a ratio of about 1 1 XPAJPY anchored to the Japanese yen and so on \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 06 XPA Assets hedges currency devaluations and price \xef\xac\x82uctuations to balance market risk Investors can trade at any time to convert XPA Assets into \xef\xac\x81at currency or use XPA Assets to invest in other cryptocurrencies XPA Assets are a link between the real world and virtual assets allowing cryptocurrency to be stable enough to store value and be used for payment and circulation We\xe2\x80\x99ve connected XPA Assets to the existing range of traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial services such as money management trading payment transfer and seamless integration with future blockchain assets This \xef\xac\x82exibility to travel through the world of traditional and virtual currency assets is achieved through various services of the XPA ecosystem including the XPA Exchange decentralized trading mechanism TideBit centralized trading platform and user asset managers TidePay and TideWallet and integrated into a new blockchain asset management ecosystem Since XPA Assets are automatically generated by the contracts activated by the asset holder XPA Assets cannot be tampered with The quantity and provenance of XPA Assets are publicly available on the blockchain based entirely on trust in the blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s global consensus At any time XPA Assets holders can buy and sell XPA Assets at current exchange rates from TideBit s exchange platform (for example selling 1 XPAUSD for about $1) XPA and its a\xef\xac\x83liates will use their own funds in the market to provide liquidity support Figure 2 Linking Blockchain Assets Ecosystem with XPA Including Exchanges Fiat Currency Cryptocurrency and Wallets \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 07 XPA Exchange XPA Exchange is the next level decentralized trading mechanism that primarily supports ETH and ERC20 currency transactions The biggest di\xef\xac\x80erence XPA Exchange has with centralized exchanges is that with XPA Exchange users have complete control of user assets do not need certi\xef\xac\x81cation do not need registration and do not need complicated security deposit procedures XPA Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s distinguishing points are 1 Blockchain matching All transactions are fully matched on the blockchain with smart contracts and exchange rates and transaction data are recorded and validated by the blockchain available to users at any time making XPA more trustworthy and transparent 2 Innovative asset management XPA Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract interface and connections can be linked to any wallet including TideWallet and TidePay Users can directly use any Ethereum wallet for both transactions and asset management for a comprehensive digital asset management experience The XPA Exchange fee is about 70% of the current application and the transaction speed is about 2 5 4 times faster The decentralized trading mechanism is based on smart contracts with full transparency security and reliability Transactions are conducted directly and assets transferred directly to users wallet Users only need to trust smart contracts rather than having to trust an exchange At this stage XPA Exchange is a decentralized trading service based on a series of smart \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 08 contracts running on an Ethereum backbone Though its \xef\xac\x82agship coins are XPA and XPA Assets XPA Exchange supports most ERC20 tokens The \xef\xac\x81rst version of the function will be primarily spot trading of underlying assets with subsequent features such as leveraged trading peer to peer lending futures contracts index contracts and more In the future after XPA launches its own backbone XPA Exchange will have a completely new operating experience making it the preferred trading platform for new assets Through external smart contracts and atomic cross chain transactions XPA will work to achieve the decentralized trading of most mainstream assets such as BTC / XRP / NEO / QTUM and more TideBit TideBit supports cash withdrawal and deposit with local \xef\xac\x81at currency solving investors most pressing pain points of transforming \xef\xac\x81at money into cryptocurrency assets This practice also provides a good starting point for XPA Assets as TideBit has a liquidity that makes it easier to shift from cryptocurrency to \xef\xac\x81at money XPA Assets holders can exchange legal tender at any time on the TideBit exchange at market price for example about 1 US dollar for 1 XPAUSD with more liquidity with the help of TideBit TideWallet and TidePay Wallet TideWallet and TidePay provide comprehensive user support for XPA Exchange TideWallet is used for identi\xef\xac\x81cation and asset management and TidePay is useful for payment and settlement both online and o\xef\xac\x84ine All TideWallet assets are owned and managed by the user and are more secure TidePay helps users manage assets through an IOU model with minimal fees \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 09 How XPA Blockchain Asset Ecosystem Operates The XPA blockchain asset platform will include asset exchange asset management and asset transaction Part of the applications will be realized by XPA own implementation while most rely on external partner platforms to complete Asset Exchange Asset Management Asset Transaction Figure 4 XPA application architecture is divided into asset exchange asset management and asset transaction The XPA ecosystem is aligned with asset management and blockchain infrastructure for future service deployment TideBit o\xef\xac\x80ers transactional liquidity TidePay o\xef\xac\x80ers online / o\xef\xac\x84ine payment TideWallet o\xef\xac\x80ers asset management / mortgage management and online / o\xef\xac\x84ine consumer scenarios and Crebit o\xef\xac\x80ers investment returns and other innovative application scenarios XPA believes strongly in the necessity and urgency of moving the existing \xef\xac\x81nancial architecture to the blockchain value network and provides a large number of products and services to accelerate that process \x0c10 XPA 2 0 Whitepaper User Anonymous User Users can remain completely anonymous while using XPA Exchange with no need for registration or authentication XPA Exchange Users can trade most ERC20 currencies on XPA Exchange Cash withdrawal / Deposit Bank Wire transfer In the XPA ecosystem users can use \xef\xac\x81at money and the XPA and XPA Assets cryptocurrencies for investment liquidity and asset growth Our decentralized exchange powered by smart contracts has asset management asset mortgage and trading capabilities TideBit TideBit\xe2\x80\x99s global exchange will realize a bridge between cryptocurrency and \xef\xac\x81at money with its XPAUSD XPAHKD XPAJPY and XPANTD TideWallet & TidePay Users can use XPA for daily circulation Figure 5 How XPA Ecosystem Operates Market Prospects XPAUSD and a series of XPA Assets mortgage asset tokens will not only become stabilizers of the cryptocurrency world but also connect cryptocurrency with the physical \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 11 world opening up a channel between tranditional and digital assets With TidePay and TideWallet average users can use XPA digital assets o\xef\xac\x84ine opening a path between the legal currency and cryptocurrency worlds and attracting more users to hold and use XPA Assets For example Japanese consumers can convert their coins to XPA directly using BTC / ETH then pay directly with XPAJPY using TidePay / TideWallet payment enjoying shopping discounts and system points from participating merchants Users could also use XPA Assets on e commerce platforms For example Hong Kong and Taiwanese users can convert legal currency to XPATWD / XPAHKD enjoying discounts on online shopping due to lower payment costs and higher e\xef\xac\x83ciency Rebate points will be earned after shopping which can be exchanged for XPA in the market and get the discount again to form a daily consumption scenario linked by virtual currency Smart Contracts Built with Economic Theories Based on a deep understanding of economics XPA team implemented the theory of \xef\xac\x81nancial economics in the blockchain smart contract and established the world s \xef\xac\x81rst stable and circulating cryptocurrency ecosystem The XPA cryptocurrency ecosystem is trying to realize Satoshi Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s original intention when he invented bitcoin to build a fully decentralized economic system \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 12 This innovative design of incorporating economic theories into blockchain smart contracts aims to possibly realize bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s original vision The XPA ecosystem mainly including XPA XPA Assets and XPA Exchange decentralized trading mechanism is breaking the barrier between physical and virtual assets because XPA Assets are pegged to \xef\xac\x81at value they have a liquidity that makes it easier to shift from cryptocurrency to \xef\xac\x81at money XPA provides the expectation for growth typical of other current cryptocurrencies and XPA Assets provide a currency stable enough for long term investment token to token trades and are easy conversion to \xef\xac\x81at money for daily use XPA Exchange Decentralized Smart Contract Currently operates on Ethereum Asset Management Currently users can reload ETH or any ERC20 tokens into an Ethereum based asset management contract XPA Exchange will support various assets such as BTC / XRP / LTC through payment channels or sidechains in the future Users have complete control over their own assets and can readily withdraw unlocked assets belonging to their own account in the contract channel or sidechain Asset Lending Users can lock in existing assets and borrow assets from other users through the lending subcontract O\xef\xac\x80chain s monitoring service will help users automatically avoid losses Trading Varieties Current trading types are mostly spot trading of all assets In the future decentralized trading of some varieties of futures contracts and index contract will be activated via liquidity support \x0c13 XPA 2 0 Whitepaper XPA Assets Smart Contract XPA Assets is a series of asset distribution and management contracts relying on the XPA Exchange contract with the following two contractual relationships 1 1 Deposit XPA 1 4 Withdraw XPAUSD 2 1 Balance XPA 2 4 Withdraw XPA or 1 2 Query XPA Price 1 3 Return XPA/XPAUSD 2 2 Query XPA Price 2 3 Return XPA/XPAUSD XPAUSD User Figure 6 Relationship between XPA Assets contract and XPA Exchange contract The contract is mainly divided into three parts 1 Smart Contract (1) User send XPA for example 10000 XPA to XPAUSD contract (2) The XPAUSD contract inquires XPA Exchange contract for the latest transaction price of XPA/XPAUSD (3) XPA Exchange returns the latest prices and transaction depth For example if current market rates are 1 XPA = 0 02 XPAUSD the total accumulated demand will be 10 million XPAUSD \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 14 (4) XPAUSD contracts lock the 10 000 XPA deposited by the user according to the 50% mortgage rate (the mortgage rate is 20% ~ 50% which needs to be calculated according to the XPAUSD circulation and the exchange buyout depth to avoid liquidity risk as much as possible) and generate 100 XPAUSD paid to the user (5) After the user receives their XPAUSD it can be traded to get USD or other digital asset in return at TideBit (6) Users can balance their account at any time to return XPAUSD to redeem part or all of their XPA collaterals 3 O\xef\xac\x84ine Audit (1) Monitor XPA s prices to various types of mortgage assets (2) After the settlement line is reached automatic settlement service is started for mortgage rate below 70% \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 15 XPA Team XPA is the result of the TIDEiSun Group\xe2\x80\x99s innovation and development e\xef\xac\x80orts TIDEiSun Group is a media operations technology development and capital investment group primarily headquartered in Hong Kong and Taiwan It has technology development and marketing o\xef\xac\x83ces in Taipei Tokyo and New York and over 100 employees in Hong Kong and Taipei The Group s products and services include the development and promotion of In\xef\xac\x81niteChain blockchain technology the operation of cryptocurrency exchanges TideBit and XPA Exchange the

Ethereum ERC 20 Accepted Currency ETH To achieve the goal of global \xef\xac\x81nancial services the following adjustments of XPA sales model will be made \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 16 \xe2\x97\x8f 10% First round of sales (completed) \xe2\x97\x8f 10% Second round of sales (expected 2018 Q2) \xe2\x97\x8f 5% Third round of sales (TBD) \xe2\x97\x8f 25% To provide liquidity to the decentralized exchange (expected to begin 2018 08 gradually release over 25 months) \xe2\x97\x8f 50% Injection into asset collateral contract (expected 2018 04) The \xef\xac\x81rst round of sale mainly via TideBit (private equity and auction) and smart contracts has sold 1 billion XPA (issue price 23 000 XPA = 1ETH reference price was 1ETH = 290 USD about 0 0126USD) The second round of sale will be mainly through smart contracts and will split evenly into 10 million XPA everyday for a period of 100 days The total sale is 1 billion XPA The third round of distribution will take place after XPA moves to its main chain primarily to previous XPA holders (no more than 200 million XPA holders during the snapshot will receive 10% reward) and to active customers of XPA mortgage and decentralized exchange services (no more than 200 million XPA split among the top 10 000 mortgage and exchange customers) The 25% that XPA Management Limited holds (a total of 2 5 billion XPA) will be mainly used in the future decentralized exchange and will be gradually distributed after switching to the main chain over the course of 25 months 50% of the maximum amount of tokens (5 billion XPA) will be fully locked in XPA Assets mortgage contracts (previously based on ETH ERC20 token contracts and later switching to XPA s main chain contract) and later create various assets for global asset service XPA total circulation will not exceed 5 billion XPA Full circulation is scheduled for August 2020 \x0c17 XPA 2 0 Whitepaper XPA quantity in circulation Issuing (M XPA) Circulation Supply (M XPA) 6000 5000 4000

continue to provide services on the Ethereum main network (which will run in parallel after XPA main chain is on) continuing to transform various existing \xef\xac\x81nancial services and explore new business models into more services and platforms XPA plans to switch to its own backbone in Q2 2018 and expand on a global basis across all types of \xef\xac\x81nancial services based on this new backbone due to existing problems of Ethereum limited transaction volume high fees and long processing times XPA to Establish Own Main Chain XPA is currently running on Ethereum but existing Ethereum architecture cannot meet high frequency transactions for decentralized orders and withdrawals GAS is also expensive and the XPA team will continue to enhance transactional e\xef\xac\x83ciency and cost optimization with own architecture Cross chain Asset Exchange The establishment of XPA main chain will be more e\xef\xac\x80ective in cross chain \x0c18 XPA 2 0 Whitepaper token to token transaction requirement It is di\xef\xac\x83cult to break through for existing exchanges In the future XPA main chain will be able to support not only XPA / XPA main chain assets and ETH / ERC20 assets but also other asset main chains that supports payment channel or other sidechain technologies Through asset management smart contract or channels a truly decentralized transaction of XPA and XPA main chain assets will be realized Figure 8 Cross chain asset exchange \x0c19 XPA 2 0 Whitepaper Major Milestones \xe2\x97\x8f Dual functionality (asset mortgage and decentralized exchange) \xe2\x97\x8f XPA Exchange begins token trading \xe2\x97\x8f XPA provides \xef\xac\x81at pegged mortgaged \xe2\x97\x8f TideBit supports \xef\xac\x81at pegged mortgaged digital assets digital assets \xe2\x97\x8f XPA will launch its own main chain and implement asset and code migration \xe2\x97\x8f Once all assets and code are migrated onto the new chain development of atomic cross chain trading will begin \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 20 FAQ 1 Why launch XPA Assets Currently cryptocurrency values \xef\xac\x82uctuate sharply making investment risks high The market is missing a cryptocurrency that has the stability of \xef\xac\x81at money a currency able to be used with \xef\xac\x81at money business models that allows you to trade in any currency at any time XPA Assets is the perfect token for all participants because of its liquidity and transaction hedging features 2 How do you ensure that XPA Assets are pegged to \xef\xac\x81at money The value of XPA Assets are derived from XPA at a rate of no less than twice the value of XPA With XPA Assets\xe2\x80\x99 liquidity XPA Assets will be able to be exchanged with \xef\xac\x81at currency at a rate of about 1 1 Though the real time price of XPA Assets may vary the average value will be stabilized Users can also change their XPA Assets to other XPA Assets or other digital currencies at any time 3 Why is XPA starting its own network Although the current Ethereum network supports smart contracts it has a limited load capacity Furthermore all operations need to consume Gas which is unfriendly to a trading volume that involves a large number of operations In order to provide the best service to all participants the XPA team has begun development of its own main network \x0cXPA 2 0 Whitepaper 21 4 When will XPA\xe2\x80\x99s main network be online The schedule is tentatively set at June 2018 but may change based on development progress Just as networks like Ethereum are also constantly updating and iterating users can use the XPA network before the main network has launched After the switch to the main network is completed we will reward early adopters with tokens 5 What tokens does XPA Exchange support Currently XPA supports ETH and most ERC20 tokens Functionality for other smart contract assets (such as NEO and QTNM) will be added when the main network opens in the future 6 What other plans do you have for XPA Assets in the future In the early stage TideBit is currently providing liquidity support In the future XPA Assets will be supported by other platforms and even docked with traditional assets such as stocks bonds and precious metals \x0c
