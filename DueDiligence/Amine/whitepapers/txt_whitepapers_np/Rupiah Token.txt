b Author\xe2\x80\x8b PT Rupiah Token Indonesia (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //rupiahtoken com\xe2\x80\x8b) Version v1 0 (July 2019) Disclaimer\xe2\x80\x8b This whitepaper might be updated as the company and project progresses Abstract IDRT is the first Indonesian Rupiah collateralized stablecoin that is pegged 1 to 1 to the Indonesian Rupiah IDRT is issued by PT Rupiah Token Indonesia an Indonesian based startup As an ERC 20 token built on Ethereum IDRT inherits the speed security transparency and other desirable characteristics of the Ethereum Blockchain This combination of the Ethereum Blockchain and Indonesian Rupiah as a legal tender resulted in a digital asset that provides consumers with a stable store of value The amount of Indonesian Rupiah stored and IDRT in circulation will always be of equal value creating a constant 1 to 1 peg Customers can always purchase 1 IDRT for 1 Indonesian Rupiah and during such purchase we store the Indonesian Rupiah as custody in trustworthy banks and financial institutions in Indonesia We also allow customers to redeem IDRT back into Indonesian Rupiah at any time after customers send us their IDRT we will burn the IDRT (thereby removing the tokens from circulation) and give Indonesian Rupiah back to the customer This 1 to 1 peg will result in a stable rupiah denominated digital asset ensuring 1 IDRT to always worth 1 Indonesian Rupiah Users can be assured of the 1 to 1 peg through a monthly audit / bank report we provide on our website \x0cBackground and Historical Context A Brief History of Money Over the vast history of mankind money has been a key invention that enables humans to effectively cooperate in producing goods and services which in turn propels the economy and civilization forward Before the existence of money the people of early civilizations would barter goods (such as livestock and agricultural produce) they had in surplus for the ones they lacked This proved to be cumbersome and inefficient as the goods are perishable and there is no standard \xe2\x80\x98unit of value\xe2\x80\x99 To solve this issue civilizations around the globe invented various forms of physical money some were rudimentary coins made of cowrie shells (used in Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s Batu Islands and West Africa) while others are more sophisticated metal coins made of bronze silver and/or gold As civilization and the global economy system advanced mankind invented even more convenient forms of money paper money credit/debit card contactless payment card and even various digital forms of money Money in the 4 0 World Blockchain as the future medium Today we live in a world of unprecedented change and innovation For the last 20 years the rise of distributed computing network called the internet has enabled billions of humans to connect and share information instantly and securely with zero consumer cost The benefit is immense and immeasurable For example the internet has enabled people from developing countries such as Indonesia to access high quality educational materials such as Software Engineering Videos on Youtube and Free online courses from Stanford University In the last 2 3 years we have seen the rising adoption of QR Code based payment systems in Indonesia These payment systems are operated by digital wallet providers as Go Pay and OVO While these services bring tremendous convenience for \x0cIndonesians to transact locally there are two weaknesses of this approach First all of the balance records and financial transactions that ever happened on these platforms are stored in a centralized entity meaning that a sophisticated malicious attacker could potentially infiltrate and manipulate those balances and transactions Secondly as closed platforms the money stored at any service provider can only be used by users and merchants within the system which prevents important use cases such as cross application settlement cross border remittances and international transactions We believe that distributed ledger technology or blockchain will bring the next step in the evolution of money Just as the internet allowed for borderless and instantaneous movement of information blockchain technology will allow us to exchange value and transact with one another in the same way instantly globally securely and at low cost Digital assets such as Bitcoin is too volatile We have seen that throughout history money can take various forms and shapes Every asset class that can act as money needs to fulfill three main functions 1 as a means of exchange 2 as a standard unit of account 3 as a stable store of value The Bitcoin boom and bust in 2017 2018 period have shown us that the prices of non collateralized crypto assets are notoriously volatile Even today we believe that for the foreseeable future Bitcoin and similar crypto assets are likely to remain more volatile than well managed national currencies or gold Such volatility might be interesting for speculative investors and day traders but it makes the asset unable to be a stable store of value For money to exist in the blockchain we need an alternative class of asset that can maintain a stable value Stablecoin is the solution We believe that stablecoin is the solution to the aforementioned problem Stablecoins are crypto assets that has been designed to reduce or even eliminate price volatility \x0cIn contrast to the volatile prices of crypto assets such as Bitcoin where speculative supply and demand forces dictate the prices minute by minute stablecoins are designed such that their prices match or closely mimic the performance of well managed government issued currencies (such as USD GBP and so on) Various projects globally have been experimenting with several different approaches in designing a stablecoin The approaches are listed below \xe2\x97\x8f National Currency collateralized\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bNational currency in reserves act as collateral for the tokens This provides price stability because the tokens are redeemable for national currency Examples include USDT (Tether) USDC (USD Coin) PAX (Paxos) TUSD (True USD) All of these tokens are worth $1 USD each \xe2\x97\x8f Traditional Asset collateralized\xe2\x80\x8b The stablecoins are backed by hard assets such as commodities that are not national currencies One such example is Digix (DGX) a stablecoin made in Singapore that is backed by physical gold \xe2\x97\x8f Crypto collateralized\xe2\x80\x8b On chain \xe2\x80\x8bCrypto assets act as collateral to stabilize price The most notable example is DAI which token value is backed by ETH (ether) reserves that consumers need to deposit / lock as collateral in a smart contract \xe2\x97\x8f Algorithmic (no collateral)\xe2\x80\x8b The tokens are not backed by real assets Rather software algorithms will allow the circulating supply of tokens to inflate or deflate depending on supply and demand As of today national currency backed stablecoins has been the most common and successful approach The largest stablecoin USDT (Tether) has close to $4 Billion USD equivalent of tokens in circulation and has been trading at stable price of $1 USD per token in the last 4+ years \x0cDesigning a Stablecoin for Indonesia While USD backed stablecoins have enjoyed wide acceptance in several countries they are not a suitable solution for Indonesians First most Indonesians cannot redeem USD backed stablecoins into USD because such redemption requires a US based bank account for the stablecoin issuer to transfer USD to Secondly even if redemption is possible USD is not accepted as legal tender in Indonesia all economic activities and transactions within Indonesia has to be denominated in Indonesian Rupiah The same factor applies for the widely publicized Libra initiative from Facebook According to its whitepaper Libra will exist as its own currency being backed by a basket of currencies from stable and reputable central banks While one might argue that Libra might one day be tradable / convertible into Indonesian Rupiah Libra needs to first face tough regulatory challenges globally and it is unclear what Libra\xe2\x80\x99s actual timeline will be Considering the factors above we believe that RupiahToken (IDRT) will be the solution Basics RupiahToken (IDRT) is a token that is backed 1 to 1 by Indonesian Rupiah deposits and issued by PT Rupiah Token Indonesia 1 IDRT is always worth 1 Indonesian Rupiah because we guarantee that IDRT is always available to be purchased 1 to 1 with Indonesian Rupiah and redeemable 1 to 1 to Indonesian Rupiah as well For each IDRT minted we store 1 Indonesian Rupiah in a designated collateral bank account Upon IDRT redemption back to Indonesian Rupiah we will \xe2\x80\x9cburn\xe2\x80\x9d or destroy the redeemed IDRT thereby removing those from the supply As a result the supply of IDRT on the blockchain will always be equal to the amount of Indonesian Rupiah stored in our designated collateral bank accounts As an ERC 20 token IDRT combines the speed security transparency and other desirable characteristics of the Ethereum Blockchain with the credibility and trust of the \x0cIndonesian Rupiah as a legal tender This combination produces a digital asset that provides consumers with a stable store of value Benefits and Strengths of IDRT \xe2\x97\x8f IDRT is built on the Ethereum blockchain which gives it the inherent security and transaction immutability of Ethereum \xe2\x97\x8f IDRT follows ERC 20 token standard which means it is very easy to integrate and inherently compatible with many existing Ethereum based applications \xe2\x97\x8f Other stablecoins such as USDC DAI PAX DGX etc all follows ERC 20 token standard as well With IDRT Indonesian Rupiah can now participate in a global platform of stablecoins as well \xe2\x97\x8f All transactions are executed according to the rules of smart contract which eliminates human error \xe2\x97\x8f The security of IDRT smart contract has been audited and verified by CertiK a world class Smart Contract Auditor IDRT is ready to be listed for all exchanges around the world \xe2\x97\x8f As an ERC 20 token on the Ethereum blockchain the total supply and transactions of IDRT can be publicly verified by any public blockchain explorer such as Etherscan com (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //etherscan io/token/0x998FFE1E43fAcffb941dc337dD0468d52bA5b48A\xe2\x80\x8b) Tradeoffs of IDRT \xe2\x97\x8f As with all ERC 20 tokens transaction confirmation follows the speed of Ethereum network (about 1 3 minutes) This is much faster than Bitcoin but still slower than instantaneous settlements by e wallet applications such as Go Pay and OVO \xe2\x97\x8f As part of the Ethereum blockchain protocol all transactions in the Ethereum network requires the transaction initiator to pay \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d fees in the form of Ether (ETH) the native crypto asset of the Ethereum blockchain This \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be paid in IDRT or any other ERC 20 tokens However this trade off can be resolved with side chain/sharding developments such as plasma and raiden network \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f The gas fees required by the Ethereum blockchain network varies depending on the load / congestion of the network As a rough estimate typical transfer costs around 0 0005 ETH which is $0 14 USD or 1900 Indonesian Rupiah at the time of writing (12 July 2019) Use Cases and Target Markets Considering the strengths and tradeoffs of IDRT as described above we believe that IDRT is very well positioned for all transactions that require one of the following characteristics \xe2\x97\x8f Transactions that require interaction with blockchain ecosystem (such as digital asset exchanges or smart contracts based decentralized finance applications) \xe2\x97\x8f Transactions that require borderless settlement / exchange of value \xe2\x97\x8f Transactions that require irreversibility and security (tamper resistance) which is provided by the distributed consensus mechanism of Ethereum blockchain Early stage Use Cases As with all ERC 20 tokens IDRT usage requires at least a basic familiarity of using Ethereum Users need to at least know how to use an ERC 20 compatible Ethereum wallet and hold at least a very small amount of ETH to transact IDRT Because of that knowledge barrier we believe the early adopters of IDRT would be existing players in the crypto asset industry The first early use case of IDRT would be to facilitate crypto asset trading Indonesian crypto traders need to exchange their volatile digital assets into stable store of value and the largest exchanges in the world typically does not have Indonesian Rupiah trading pair With IDRT Indonesian traders now have the option to convert their volatile tokens into an Indonesian Rupiah collateralized asset anytime they want Not only this is beneficial for the traders crypto exchanges will benefit tremendously from the increase in trading volume as well because traders can directly purchase IDRT to trade in those exchanges \x0cAs IDRT usage grows to a sufficient size liquidity and credibility we believe IDRT will also be used in Decentralized Finance (\xe2\x80\x8bDeFi\xe2\x80\x8b) applications Just to give an example several blockchain based decentralized P2P financing platforms have been launched in the last two years Notable examples are Compound (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //compound finance/\xe2\x80\x8b) and Dharma (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //www dharma io/\xe2\x80\x8b) These platforms uses Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to allow anyone to borrow and lend crypto assets (including stablecoins) with interest rates that are automatically adjusted based on demand and supply Most of the stablecoins listed are ERC 20 tokens such as USDC and DAI which means IDRT can also be easily integrated into those platforms if there are enough customer demand While the space of decentralized finance is still young and nascent we believe that within several years these applications will bring a new level of financial inclusiveness and efficiency globally Late Stage Use Cases Beyond its use in global commerce we also believe that the IDRT will enable a new class of developers to create new and exciting projects that can integrate easily with IDRT No longer would developers need to spend large amounts of time and resources to create integrations into the financial system With an open standard any developers will be incentivized to use the IDRT for their application Herein lies our true edge we believe in open sourcing our code Developing a common standard in an open way will spur developers to work with code that is not controlled by any one party and in the process raising the standard of security and diversity of developers/ applications being built with it Transparency and trust remains the core offering of the blockchain from day one Anybody at anytime has the ability to track and trace transactions throughout the history of the blockchain providing financial analysts a complete view into the history of money flow This can be a powerful tool for regulators not only to track illicit funds but also to prevent money laundering and terrorism By playing an active role regulators can monitor the usage of IDRT through the blockchain and accurately & precisely flag transactions that may be suspicious \x0cOur version of the future is one where the existing financial players blockchain native projects and government coexist on an open financial system to support frictionless and safer transfer of value for consumers and businesses alike \x0cDetailed Technology and Operations Ethereum and ERC 20 Token Standard Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that allows software programs called Smart Contracts to be written and executed on the blockchain ERC 20 is a standard on the Ethereum blockchain that defines a common list of rules that all Ethereum tokens must adhere to We will not attempt to explain the entire Ethereum and ERC 20 Token standard on this paper because such discourse will be too long Instead we invite readers to read some of the following resources to learn more 1 https //github com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook 2 https //github com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White Paper#notes 3 https //github com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip 20 md Security of IDRT Tokens and Smart Contract Ethereum Blockchain is tamper proof Similar to Bitcoin past transactions in Ethereum are final and can never be altered As of this writing there are currently around 8 000 Ethereum nodes running worldwide To \xe2\x80\x9chack\xe2\x80\x9d and alter data / state in the Ethereum network a malicious actor need to have more than 51% of the computing power of those nodes which is highly improbable Ownership of IDRT Tokens are directly in users\xe2\x80\x99 hands Unlike traditional e wallet applications where the issuer holds the balance of each users inside the issuer\xe2\x80\x99s centralized system we do not hold custody of users\xe2\x80\x99 IDRT tokens When users purchase IDRT tokens from us we directly send IDRT to users\xe2\x80\x99 wallet \x0caddress From that point all ownership (and therefore responsibility) of the IDRT tokens directly belongs to users IDRT Smart Contract has passed CertiK Audit Security is always on the top of our minds and our Smart Contract has been audited by CertiK (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //certik org/\xe2\x80\x8b) to be secure Smart Contracts are upgradeable if necessary In the very unlikely event that we need to upgrade our smart contracts for further security enhancements we have set IDRT smart contracts to be upgradeable This is done by creating two separate layers of contract \xe2\x80\x8bProxy \xe2\x80\x8band \xe2\x80\x8bImplementation\xe2\x80\x8b Similar to how object oriented programming languages separate the concept of interfaces and implementation the Proxy contract acts as an interface that calls the Implementation contract where IDRT ERC 20 implementation code resides This ensures that the IDRT will be upgradeable as the Proxy contract can be adjusted to call a new Implementation contract \x0cMulti signature design reduces single point of failure We only hire the best trustworthy people and we believe there are no malicious actor(s) inside our company However we believe we still need to mitigate risk and ensure the security of our internal operations by not allowing a single point of failure to exist This is achieved using multi sig smart contract design During IDRT smart contract deployment to Ethereum blockchain we established one address as the \xe2\x80\x8bOwner and three addresses as Administrator These addresses are each controlled by separate hardware wallets Any critical operations require at least two signatures as follows 1 Two signatures are required for minting up to 100 million IDRT 2 Two signatures are required to burn IDRT tokens at a pre defined burn address (i e we cannot burn tokens located outside of that specific address) 3 Two of three admins PLUS owner signatures are required for 1 Minting above 100 million IDRT in a single transaction 2 Transferring the token management of the IDRT ERC20 3 Upgrading contract implementation 4 Replace add or remove an admin Signature of transactions happen in an offline air gapped computer To enhance the security of IDRT operations even further all transactions that interact with IDRT smart contract (such as minting burning etc) are done in an offline air gapped computer We then use a separate device to broadcast/transmit the signed transaction to the ethereum blockchain As such the computer used to compose the signed transactions are safe from external attacks \x0cIDRT Minting and Purchasing Process Purchasing of IDRT Customers can purchase IDRT directly through our website \xe2\x80\x8bhttps //rupiahtoken com\xe2\x80\x8b For every 1 Rupiah that customers deposit into our bank account we will send 1 IDRT to their Ethereum address of choice We require customers to pass standard KYC / AML process as we need to comply with Indonesian Regulations Minting of IDRT All minting of IDRT always follows the following rule For every IDRT minted there has to be an equivalent amount of Indonesian Rupiah (1 to 1) stored in our Collateral Bank Accounts Minting is a relatively time consuming and expensive process that we need to optimize Each minting requires two approvals (which takes 2 x 2 minutes to be confirmed on the blockchain) and roughly 0 0016 ETH (around $0 5 USD or 6 300 Indonesian Rupiah at the time of writing) For large IDRT purchases we will mint IDRT directly to users\xe2\x80\x99 wallet However for small purchases the operational time and cost of minting directly to users\xe2\x80\x99 wallet is too prohibitive as we do not take profit from any purchase To mitigate this issue PT Rupiah Token Indonesia may perform batch minting based on operational needs In batch minting we will deposit our operational capital (In Indonesian Rupiah) into IDRT collateral bank account to mint the equivalent amount of IDRT We store the IDRT in our ethereum reserve wallet and when users made small IDRT purchases we will transfer those IDRT to users from our reserve wallet There is no impact to the 1 to 1 peg because all tokens we minted in batch are collateralized by our own Indonesian Rupiah capital IDRT Redemption and Burning Process The Redemption and Burning process of IDRT is straightforward For every KYC verified user registered in our platform we assign them a specific ethereum \xe2\x80\x9credemption addresses\xe2\x80\x9d that they can send IDRT to be burned To redeem IDRT user need to first \x0csend IDRT to their unique Redemption Address This is necessary so we can properly account each IDRT to be burned to their respective users User then submits a Redemption request upon which we will process by transferring the equivalent amount of Indonesian Rupiah to the user\xe2\x80\x99s verified bank account We then transfer all IDRTs from users\xe2\x80\x99 redemption addresses into a single burn address and initiate burn transactions (which requires two approvals) to remove those IDRT from circulating supply Indonesian Rupiah Collateralization Proof Because IDRT is built on top of public Ethereum blockchain the IDRT token supply at any given date can be retrieved by public block explorer websites One such example is through \xe2\x80\x8bEtherscan token balance checker (\xe2\x80\x8bhttps //etherscan io/tokencheck tool t=0x998FFE1E43fAcffb941dc337dD0468d52bA5b48A\xe2\x80\x8b) To prove that the amount of Indonesian Rupiah that backs IDRT is 1 to 1 we will release reports from financial institutions to show the amount of Indonesian Rupiah reserve we hold at the end of every month The reports will be available at our website https //rupiahtoken com \x0cOur Team
