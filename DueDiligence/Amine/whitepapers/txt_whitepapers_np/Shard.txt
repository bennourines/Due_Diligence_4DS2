Disclaimer Whitepaper is not an offer document Whitepaper warranties Shard is not a security Local law obligations \x0cVISION Our vision for Shard is to create a secure and desirable cryptocurrency ideal for a broad range of everyday uses To achieve this Shard must have low fees high scalability decentralised security strong community support good liquidity and diminished volatility With Shard s significant and easily accessible proof of stake consensus we hope many users will take part in maintaining the network Providing greater scalability and decentralisation while keeping transaction fees to a minimum To both assist with the sustainability of these block rewards as well as liquidity and volatility is the Shard Community Reserve along with Shardax and it s multiple large scale projects Importantly at all times we respect and appreciate our communities opinions and support and hope that it will only grow stronger over time We aim to make digital assets more accessible to the average user and allow for wide scale adoption Shardax has unique projects featuring Shard such as a digital asset exchange which will allow users to trade stake review new coin offerings manage their portfolio and much more The Universal Infinity Wallet allowing users easy access to their many different coins in one place on their desktop or mobile trade straight from their wallet and easily pay for services goods and more on the go with a very simple and secure interface Along with the yet to be revealed Quantum Project We are looking to revolutionise the cryptocurrency experience allowing users easy access and usability bringing it to the mainstream for day to day life 4 \x0cABOUT TEAM While the scope of the Shard project is broad and to complete our vision may take several years we have an experienced and enthusiastic team and community who are dedicated and ready to make this vision a reality The Shard team brings together a unique collection of experts within cryptocurrency and technology with out of the box thinking to resolve situations and overcome obstacles INTRODUCTION Shard is designed to be a secure decentralised open source cryptocurrency with fast low cost transactions scalability and network stability while being user friendly Shard can be used not only as a cryptocurrency but also as a utility coin in multiple Shardax projects Such as a Digital Asset Exchange & Staking Platform Universal Infinity Wallet and Quantum Project In addition to the extra benefits when using Shard on these platforms Shardax uses 20% of their profits for liquidity buying and burning Shard This will decrease the existing supply while coin holders can continuously stake without excessive inflation The Shard blockchain is based on the proof of stake consensus with unique enhancements giving holders the opportunity to stake their coins to secure the network This is a more energy efficient approach to validation of the transactions in the blockchain as opposed to proof of work 5 \x0cStaking does not require coins to be locked up in any way and is fully automated while running the Shard wallet with our unique Automated Stack Targeting Feature Our long term vision for Shard is to be one of the most scalable and user friendly blockchains while ensuring security decentralisation fast speeds and low transaction fees To achieve this our team will be researching and implementing many new advancements to the Shard chain making Shard even more unique One potential advancement is Sharding which could allow much more transactions to be processed by the Shard network per second Another is the implementation of smart contracts and tokens within Shard one of the most scalable and stable networks Allowing for businesses and applications to be created on the chain and multiple other solutions without limitations This will increase the usability of Shard as a functional and desirable global cryptocurrency with a strong focus on the future 6 \x0cFEATURES OF SHARD Shard is a cryptocurrency that uses the proof of stake consensus It has some distinct differences from other coins in the market Some of the features include \xe2\x80\xa2 Cryptocurrency and utility coin Shard gives holders the benefit of being both a cryptocurrency and utility coin Allowing holders to transact directly in Shard or enjoy its utility in multiple partnered projects such as Shardax \xe2\x80\xa2 Easily calculable % based proof of stake rewards Shard holders have the option to stake their coins to help secure the network and gain % based rewards the more Shard you are staking the higher the block reward received Holders will be able to stake their coins in their wallets on Shardax or with our multiple partnered pools \xe2\x80\xa2 Secure and confidential As a blockchain based cryptocurrency Shard uses cryptographic encryption to protect the information in the blockchain Additionally pseudonyms are used when adding transaction histories on the blockchain to protect the confidentiality of the holder The combination of the cryptographic encryption pseudonyms and advanced security protocols make Shard secure for day to day transactions 7 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Transparency Shard uses a distributed ledger that is synchronised across all nodes As a result all the transactions are authenticated preventing any internal fraud Users can view all the transactions on the blockchain \xe2\x80\xa2 Enhanced stability The Shard network is one of the most stable networks with proof of stake enhancements that strengthen against chain splits and potential attacks \xe2\x80\xa2 Fast transaction speeds Shard uses proof of stake consensus The algorithms have low latency this enables a high volume of transactions to be handled at the same time without a drop in the speed The target rate of updating the transaction blocks is 120 seconds which enables transactions to be confirmed 5 times faster than Bitcoin \xe2\x80\xa2 Scalability and robustness PoS coins can be scaled allowing more users to join the platform or hold the coin Even though the coin supply is limited the blockchain is scalable allowing users to transact using Shard at the same time without any inherent latency \xe2\x80\xa2 Open source decentralised blockchain The Shard blockchain is open source allowing the community to contribute to code changes Any fundamental changes to the blockchain must be adopted by a majority of users to be passed 8 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Energy efficient The Shard blockchain utilises an energy efficient proof of stake algorithm no longer requiring unsustainable amounts of resources to be consumed by mining to secure the network \xe2\x80\xa2 Low fees Shard has one of the lowest transaction fees and with its future scalable solutions these fees will remain low even after mass adoption 9 \x0cPROOF OF WORK Proof of Work (PoW) is a validation mechanism used in certain blockchains Bitcoin and many other coins follow this method of consensus to ensure the authenticity of the transactions However PoW blockchains have some disadvantages that Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus can help to alleviate PoS chains are more scalable however they also have limitations and this is why we are looking to integrate more scalable solutions such as Sharding which could allow scaling via PoS indefinitely Some of the problems with PoW have been listed below \xe2\x80\xa2 Requires an unsustainable amount of energy contributing to global warming and higher electricity bills \xe2\x80\xa2 Requires specialised computing hardware which is expensive and wastes natural resources \xe2\x80\xa2 Possibility of miners reallocating their resources to mine a different coin if the reward is higher there causing the chain to be less decentralised and more prone to 51% attacks \xe2\x80\xa2 The typical method of PoW reward distribution incentivises a very small amount of validators typically large mining companies or pools This results in a loss of decentralisation as the average user can not individually contribute to the validation of the network making PoW chains more susceptible to 51% attacks 10 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 PoW chains are less scalable compared with PoS chains due to the reduced number of validators and additional overheads of the PoW mechanism \xe2\x80\xa2 PoW chains typically have large transaction fees due to their lack of scalability even though solutions have been proposed to help with this issue these fees are still high Shard has been designed to solve most of these problems however as with all chains none are currently able to solve all problems The main problem facing cryptocurrencies today is scalability and we are looking to integrate more scalable solutions within the future At launch Shard was mineable via PoW by the community The block reward in the 1 1000 range of blocks was 5 Shard while those between 1001 5000 were 20 Shard each However as the current block is now above 5000 the mining reward element of Shard has ended The final proof of work block was generated on the 19 th of March 2018 PoS is now the exclusive blockchain validator and the only method of generating new Shard coins 11 \x0cBelow you will find two graphs representing bitcoins unsustainable energy consumption Currently the Bitcoin network uses more energy than 159 individual countries There are only 195 countries on Earth That means 82% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s countries use less energy than Bitcoin The map above shows which countries consume less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining Click here to see latest Stats 12 \x0cGlobal Bitcoin mining consumption compared with each countries electricity consumption 13 \x0cPROOF OF STAKE Unlike cryptocurrencies that use Proof of Work (PoW) mining such as Bitcoin and Ethereum which require extensive amounts of resources and energy to achieve consensus the Shard blockchain is based on Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus Proof of Stake rewards are based on the number of coins each participant has in the Shard network and participants are rewarded for their participation in validating and securing transactions and blocks on the network This alternative method of achieving distributed blockchain consensus offers a number of advantages over PoW consensus algorithms \xe2\x80\xa2 It uses a vastly reduced amount of computing resources and electricity to secure the blockchain which is more economically friendly compared with Ethereum and Bitcoin s PoW mining costs PoS is therefore much more sustainable and environmentally friendly in comparison \xe2\x80\xa2 PoS allows for greater decentralisation and more individual participants taking part in validating transactions within blocks It does not matter what resources your computer has since a Shard node can operate on virtually any computer and each participant only needs to run 1 computer rather than many custom mining machines This means there is no need for centralised mining farms as you see with many PoW coins This in return creates greater decentralisation making it more difficult to attack the network 14 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 PoS allows for faster transaction times and further scalability The enhancements applied by the Shard team to the network has made the Shard chain more stable and able to confirm many more transactions than bitcoin every 10 minutes In the future we look to increase this up to millions of transactions per second using PoS \xe2\x80\xa2 The odds of a specific users wallet being selected to secure the blockchain is based on their coins weight Unlike PoW coins of which the block validator is based on resources spent solving an arbitrary calculation PoS validators are selected at random based on the amount of coins they have and how long they have been staking These and other benefits of PoS provide the Shard Blockchain with a secure foundation Nodes on the blockchain network have to be holders of Shard in order to participate in securing the network and be rewarded meaning they have a natural incentive to protect and maintain the value of Shard Anyone with a Shard wallet can secure the network requiring no configuration or setup Simply download the Shard wallet transfer your coins and run the wallet to help process validate and secure the network and start earning rewards The Shard target block spacing is 120 seconds meaning that around every 2 minutes a single user with mature coins will confirm a transaction and earn a stake reward for securing the blockchain The minimum maturity period before your coins are eligible to confirm transactions and stake is 9 hours while the maximum maturity period is 72 hours This has been designed to ensure maximum participation in securing the network 15 \x0cSPECIFICATIONS Architecture & Consensus Shard has its own main net blockchain that is based primarily on proof of stake consensus and unlike many other chains Shard is pure PoS with no masternodes A main net is a stand alone blockchain that does not rely on any other cryptocurrencies which sets it apart from many altcoins/tokens that are based on another cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain such as Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s There are a variety of reasons why Shard has not implemented masternodes however we have listed some of them below \xe2\x80\xa2 Masternode blockchains have reduced liquidity since the majority of the coin supply is often locked in masternodes \xe2\x80\xa2 Masternode blockchains result in reduced decentralisation and less users securing the network \xe2\x80\xa2 Masternode blockchains prioritise users with more funds to set up a masternode causing very few to be incentivised to stake \xe2\x80\xa2 Masternodes reduce the amount of coins staking and typically have more frequent split blocks and security issues \xe2\x80\xa2 Masternodes are not user friendly and generally require multiple dedicated servers to run multiple nodes making it difficult for most novice users to run the chain hence counter to mass adoption 16 \x0cMasternodes do have some advantages however such as instant send privacy and budget voting However these are also possible to implement into a pure PoS blockchain and as Shard advances we will be looking into such solutions in the future As a stand alone blockchain Shard transactions will be faster because products of the platform will only be subject to Shard\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain latency limits as opposed to parent child chains that share a blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s latency limits thereby reducing the speed of transactions The validators (the equivalent of miners in PoW platforms) are chosen based on the number of coins they are staking combined with the age of staked coins (their weight) This is not processor or GPU intensive unlike blockchains that use only PoW consensus The more coins staked and the longer a holder stakes their coins the greater their value as a validator increases and the more transactions blocks that will be authenticated on their node This results in better earnings Key reasons why Shard opted for the PoS consensus are to reduce the likelihood of 51 percent attacks the ability to integrate more features and also to render the blockchain more scalable for future adoption as compared with PoW based blockchains 17 \x0cSecurity Protocols The Shard blockchain uses multiple security protocols to protect the blockchain from Sybil attacks to prevent double spending and coin theft The first element is the use of an effective hashing algorithm Essentially public keys are used to receive coins during transactions but the authentication of transactions is done using private keys The use of the PoS consensus protects the Shard blockchain from Sybil attacks where malicious individuals give users on the platform false information (i e fraudulent public keys which can result in coin theft) Double spending is prevented by continuous authentication of account balances Given an initial and then a duplicate transaction only the first transaction would be completed while the duplicate would be rejected 18 \x0cBasic Specifications Github https //github com/ShardcoinRepo/shard 19 \x0cPoS Reward Specifications The PoS Rewards and Max supply was updated in version 2 0 0 1 and these changes allow for a more scalable long term future We estimate it will take well over 120 years to reach the new max supply which was reduced by 77% to 210 000 000 20 \x0cAutomated Stack Targeting If you are a seasoned cryptocurrency enthusiast you may have heard of something called a \xe2\x80\x9csplit threshold\xe2\x80\x9d In traditional Proof of Stake (PoS) wallets you have the option to set the threshold at which your coin stacks will split and form a new stack With that system the user is able to choose whether their stacks will split at 2000 coins 5000 coins or whatever number they want If a split threshold is set to 5000 this means your coin stack will grow with each staking reward up until your stack reaches the 5000 coin mark at which point it will split into two stacks of 2500 coins each Those two stacks will then grow until they hit 5000 each and then split again thus multiplying the total number of stacks Since the amount of coins held in a stack greatly contributes to its staking weight many users are tempted to set their split threshold to a high number in order to keep their coin stacks large and increase the frequency of their staking rewards While this sounds great at first glance there are severe disadvantages to it When many holders of a PoS coin set their split threshold to a high number this reduces the total number of coin stacks that are available on the network Blockchains are built on the idea of consensus giving verification to our funds When we have fewer stacks with mature coins on the network our possible options for creating a new block and thus verification of transactions on the network are reduced and the stability of the network then suffers By widening the reach of possible blockchain validators through reduced stack sizes and increasing the number of total stacks the network is strengthened against split chains and possible attacks 21 \x0cIn striving to create the perfect balance between network stability and staking speed we have developed this unique feature that we call Automated Stack Targeting This advanced feature eliminates the traditional \xe2\x80\x9csplit threshold\xe2\x80\x9d and automatically determines the optimal stack size for each Shard wallet user based on the current network conditions This will provide an incredibly stable blockchain network while also granting you the consistent rewards for securing the network Since the beginning the Shard blockchain has included automated splitting which was a stepping stone to what has now become the Automated Stack Targeting feature With automated splitting we were able to greatly increase the stability of the network This has been a large contributing factor as to why the Shard blockchain has never experienced a split chain since the creation of the genesis block The Shard Team has now gone a step further in our efforts to create the most stable and secure blockchain network possible Automated Stack Targeting is the combination of automated splitting as well as automated combining of stacks As the Shard blockchain grows the network conditions are constantly being assessed and your stacks will now be split or combined depending on what is most beneficial to the current needs of the network So now if the network has more than enough stacks to choose from a coin stack that is staking can pull in another one of your stacks and receive a reward alongside it causing them to combine into a single stack This will result in individual stacks that stake sooner and are less likely to become backlogged waiting unnecessarily long periods of time to earn a staking reward With this new feature the Automated Stack Targeting will ensure Shard withstands the test of time and continues to run for generations to come 22 \x0cSHARD WALLET The Shard wallet is unique from other wallets of many popular coins out there We strive to continually adapt and improve our wallet in many ways usually influenced by the community\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations The community\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is of the utmost importance to us and we continually use their voice as a tool to integrate and innovate new features into the coin Shard strives to be a community leader establishing standards set forth by every user of Shard coin but exceeding them in every way possible During Q2 2019 we launched the Shard v2 0 0 1 wallet which contained a full UI update that is completely different compared with other QT wallets with a fresh enhanced design and multiple new and unique features not found elsewhere Alongside the UI update and features we also implemented consensus changes and integrated our new staking method that will ensure optimal network stability while providing frequent staking rewards and further network security We have already reduced CPU and RAM requirements as well as minimised the amount of bandwidth required to run the wallet and will continue to minimise resource usage as much as possible We will always take into consideration the communities opinions and ideas on what features are most needed and wanted 23 \x0cSome of these latest updated features can be found below \xe2\x80\xa2 Automated Stack Targeting this is a new unique feature developed by the Shard team to automate splitting and combining of staked stacks targeting an optimal balance between network stability and staking speed \xe2\x80\xa2 77% reduced maximum supply this is more in line with the current supply and better represents Shard s scarcity \xe2\x80\xa2 Stake % changes have been made for a more scalable long term future estimated to take well over 100 years to reach the new max supply \xe2\x80\xa2 Monitor the Shard price via a multi timeframe graph with 5 minute 15 minute 30 minute 1 hour 1 day 1 week and 1 month options \xe2\x80\xa2 Monitor your Shard balance via either the Daily or Weekly Graph \xe2\x80\xa2 Monitor your staking gains per Day or per Week \xe2\x80\xa2 View Shard price market cap 24h volume and 24h % change \xe2\x80\xa2 View your total balance in $USD \xe2\x80\xa2 View how much each transaction you send receive or stake is worth in $USD \xe2\x80\xa2 View a transaction on the block explorer by clicking on the txid \xe2\x80\xa2 View your Shard balance for each address on the receive page \xe2\x80\xa2 You can once again view estimated potential stakes on the coin control page 24 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 You can now accurately compare your staking weight against the network weight by hovering over the staking icon \xe2\x80\xa2 You can now get an estimate of when your next stake will be without needing to go to coin control Currently Shard has desktop wallets for Windows Linux and MacOS available from the website with the Shardax Universal Infinity wallet that is in development and to be launched within the near future We have also partnered with multiple 3 rd party services which offer mobile wallets web wallets and staking options New Shard wallet UI with Graph and many other features 25 \x0cSHARD COMMUNITY The Shard community is the heart of this project Since its inception individuals in the Shard community have not only shared their ideas and aspirations for this project but they have also guided the direction of the project The community started with a small group of early adopters using only Discord and has since grown to well over 70 000 users across social media channels using mainly Discord and Twitter but also Telegram Blockfolio BitcoinTalk and most recently Medium Reddit and Binance Info The community is always active and there is always a core team member or community member available in the Discord to provide support or answer questions to help users learn Our community is very positive and is built up from people who believe in blockchain support the project and are non judgmental and eager to support each other and the success of Shard In our efforts to increase community contribution we will be creating a community development program for the Shard chain With which we aim to incentivise more community members to take part in Shard\xe2\x80\x99s developments and be rewarded for developments on the chain after they have been proposed and accepted This will encourage further decentralisation and allow for the community to choose what changes they would like to be applied to the Shard chain 26 \x0cSHARD COMMUNITY RESERVE The reserve has the core purpose to increase market liquidity and reduce volatility Other uses of the SCR may include funding exchange listings development and marketing The key functions of the reserve can be summarised into the following two roles \xe2\x80\xa2 To provide Shard with additional market liquidity This makes it more resilient to volatility pressures \xe2\x80\xa2 To counteract inflation by burning excess Shard held in the community reserve This reduces the circulating supply of Shard Shard holders can contribute to the reserves by staking their coins The newly minted coins will be distributed 80 20 based on the Shard PoS reward split 80% of the reward will go to the user who originally staked the coins while 20% will be sent to the reserve address with consensus of the staking majority As a cryptocurrency and utility coin supply and demand decides the value of Shard If market forces change significantly the value of Shard may vary As the SCR aims to reduce volatility but does not determine the market value The Shard held by the reserve address can be observed using the block explorer The total amount of Shard burned is displayed on the official website with links to view the individual burns provided There are future plans to make this reserve fully decentralised so the community can vote on what these funds are used on 27 \x0cSHARDAX Crypto Exchange & Staking Platform Shardax is a registered UK company which has multiple large scale projects featuring Shard Shardax exchange is a new and unique exchange that combines the advantages of top tier crypto exchanges with the ability to earn rewards from your deposited proof of stake coins allowing users to trade and stake all in one place Shardax will make it easy to buy all types of leading cryptocurrencies removing the need to go between multiple exchanges and cryptocurrencies In the cryptocurrency space at this time investors must buy coins and tokens from a variety of exchanges to get the coins they want In contrast Shardax will make it easy to invest in cryptocurrencies as investors will be able to trade many cryptocurrencies in one place including Shard Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies Shardax makes staking your coins a breeze as we understand that knowing how staking works can be difficult for some proof of stake holders as having some technical knowledge is helpful However we have made the staking concept more approachable for novice proof of stake holders by offering an easy to use staking option Some benefits of staking on Shardax are that once a holder adds their coins to the staking pool the staking process is fully automated by the pool from that point forward Your coins will stake without requiring your computer to be running 24/7 saving on electricity costs Also by combining smaller groups of coins together into a single large pool every contributor\xe2\x80\x99s coins can produce a larger quantity of stake rewards than they would in isolated groups on individual wallets 28 \x0cSHARDAX ECOSYSTEM The Shardax ecosystem consists of 4 platforms in one and is the only exchange at this time to combine all these features into 1 platform \xe2\x80\xa2 Advanced Trading Platform The Shardax advanced trading interface has been designed

this project will be released at a later date to protect the idea with development planned to start in 2020 37 \x0cDEV TEAM Below you will find some of the members which are part of the core development team however since Shard is open source everyone is part of the team and can contribute to the Shard chain 38 \x0cDEVELOPMENTS Below you will find some of the current Shard developments To get the latest and past developments on Shard click here 39 \x0cCONCLUSION Shard is unique within the cryptocurrency market How is it different First it relies on its main net blockchain versus non blockchain based currencies or those that rely on other blockchains like Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s As a result Shard is substantially faster in transaction speed while supporting higher volumes The architecture uses PoS staking which is more energy efficient as opposed to PoW mining used in coins such as Bitcoin Additionally the Shard team is looking to make large advancements within blockchain making an even more unique and scalable blockchain for day to day use Shard has use not only as a cryptocurrency but as a utility coin within Shardax projects Both Shardax with their 20% profits for liquidity buying and burning Shard and the Shard Community Reserve assist with market liquidity and coin burns Fewer Shard in supply will allow continued staking of new coins promoting higher staking
