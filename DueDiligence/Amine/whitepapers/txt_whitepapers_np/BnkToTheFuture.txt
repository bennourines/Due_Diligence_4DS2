OVERVIEW & HISTORY 7 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment 2 1 IT STARTED IN 2010 In 2010 Bnk To The Future was one of the \xef\xac\x81rst organizations to break through the barriers and challenges surrounding compliance driven methods of investing in private equity online Prior to starting this mission almost all investing in private equity was done o\xef\xac\x84ine by angel investors friends family venture capitalists and later stage private equity houses Several companies in the UK set about allowing investors to invest online in private equity the same year that Bitcoin was launched in 2009 Bnk To The Future was one of those companies This was considered a very strange business by regulators at the time so in order to help build this new sector several companies participating in the space joined forces and formed the UK CrowdFunding Association (UKCFA) Our CEO Simon Dixon was both a founding member and Director of the UKCFA After several years a few of the member companies managed to launch under the supervision of the first regulator to issue a license for this industry \xe2\x80\x94 the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) These registrations occurred either through full authorisation or via an appointed representative we were one of the first few added to the FCA register 8 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment 2 2 OUR HISTORY WITH BITCOIN In 2011 at the same time that He also wrote what may have Bitcoin was growing in popularity been the \xef\xac\x81rst published book to and the \xef\xac\x81rst Altcoins were being include the subject of Bitcoin launched our CEO Simon Dixon \xe2\x80\x98Bank To The Future Protect Your spoke at the world\ s very \xef\xac\x81rst Future Before Governments Go Bitcoin conference in Europe Bust\xe2\x80\x99 Simon Dixon later became one of the \xef\xac\x81rst founding members and Directors of the UK Digital Currency Association (UKDCA) 2 3 THE INVESTMENT PLATFORM The term \xe2\x80\x98Equity CrowdFunding\xe2\x80\x99 was \xef\xac\x81rst popularised in the UK and UK regulators were the \xef\xac\x81rst to permit investing in private equity online The problem was that it was only open to UK companies and UK investors 9 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment At BnkToTheFuture com we were one of the minority believers in Bitcoin during the early days of the cryptocurrency sector and were accustomed to the way that Bitcoin was designed \xe2\x80\x94 global transactions unrestricted by government borders We wanted to use our platform to drive investment into a sector that was receiving very little investment from traditional players Because the market was still small and niche at the time we had to think beyond the UK borders to get the liquidity needed to grow the cryptocurrency sector 2 4 TOKENS MOVED FASTER THAN REGULATORS Equity CrowdFunding grew in the UK and later caught the attention of the United States as they set about lifting their previous restrictions in order to permit investing through the JOBS Act This Act attempted to allow the general public to invest small sums of money into private equity and securities online rather than those options being permitted for qualifying investors only The JOBS Act took several years to come into existence whilst in the meantime the very \xef\xac\x81rst token sales started to appear whereby crypto project owners were raising funds by creating Altcoins and selling them to any person who wanted to purchase them using Bitcoin 10 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment 2 5 WE NEEDED TO BE GLOBAL As we witnessed and analyzed the impacts of the cryptocurrency market at the global scale we decided that it was time to leave the UK deregister with the FCA and expand our corporate structure to foster a global company vision At the time investing in Bitcoin companies was risky since the underlying community was still very small The mission could only be successful if we could engage the entire crypto community around the world rather than one jurisdiction We decided that we wanted to support this niche sector exclusively so we set about registering with the Cayman Island Monetary Authority (CIMA) and spared no cost or time setting up a multi jurisdictional global online securities business Later the JOBS Act came into force and online investing continuously expanded as more countries adjusted to the new directive in order to allow for online investing to boom 2 6 THEN CAME ETHEREUM As the online investing sector was booming and Bitcoin value and adoption was growing Ethereum set about completing a token sale We were one of the \xef\xac\x81rst purchasers of the Ethereum token during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) 11 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment Several years later the ERC20 standard made it easy for anybody to create a token and the number one application for Ethereum smart contracts became token sales and ICO\xe2\x80\x99s Banks governments and corporations all over the world started promoting Blockchain technology and despite every institution best efforts Bitcoin became the highest performing digital currency for seven consecutive years out of the last eight with only one low performing year 2 7 THEN THE VC\xe2\x80\x99S STARTED TO PLAY We were investing in the equity We saw four booms over the of many companies that at the years taking us into both a time were too strange even for pro\xef\xac\x81table growth company and venture capitalists In 2013 an asset holding company with venture capital activity in our bene\xef\xac\x81cial interests in most of sector started to take off and the companies that listed on we were able to co invest in our online investment platform many of the largest Bitcoin companies with venture capital Those four investment booms grade due diligence and open were Bitcoin Equity in them up for co investment on Blockchain companies Altcoins BnkToThefuture com and Tokens (ICO\xe2\x80\x99s) 12 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment 2 8 THE 2017 BOOM Forward to 2017 within our niche sector of Bitcoin and Blockchain investing in token sales started to overtake venture capital investing and regulators all around the world started to define their stance on the fast growing industry As token sales started to become more and more liquid we started to see a major appetite from our investors to make their investments more liquid As a result we began exploring ways in which we might facilitate our investors to sell their private equity investments to one another with compliance in mind As we evaluated automating this process we realised that the regulatory challenges were huge We also witnessed the ability for people to tokenize assets like venture capital and private equity with many ignoring regulations all together as was the case with the infamous DAO tokens 2 9 INNOVATION & REGULATIONS We have been continuously innovating and adapting our platform to match the challenges and updates of regulatory requirements market needs and technological advancements in each jurisdiction as they unfold 13 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment We started the process of acquiring stakes in companies that had relevant securities licenses including a FINRA registered broker dealer and the only Alternative Trading System (ATS) we knew about that was registered with the SEC and had permission to provide a secondary market for private equity so we could partner with them in our growth We also set about partnering with the only clearing \xef\xac\x81rm we knew of that was authorised to clear Blockchain securities and crypto exchanges (that we were investors in) to help with liquidity 2 10 REGULATORY CLARITY Our original vision of an alternative \xef\xac\x81nancial system that operates independent of banks has become a reality and now we feel the regulatory environment is ready for us to launch our own token We also feel the time is right to launch a compliance driven secondary market for other securities tokens We decided to launch the BF Token before we launch our secondary market in 2018 to help us solve some of the major challenges we are facing as our industry scales and grows beyond anything our team can handle We are now at the stage where the number of applications for investment on our platform is scaling way too fast for us to keep up with and we need the support of the community to scale BnkToTheFuture com to reach its full potential in line with the industries growth 14 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment Today the difference between utility tokens and securities is becoming clearer each day and the legal frameworks for investing online in products we support on our platform (including SAFT\xe2\x80\x99s (Simple Agreement on Future Tokens) SAFE\xe2\x80\x99s (Simple Agreement on Future Equity) Convertible Notes Tokens Funds and Equity) is validated the more regulators we engage with all over the world 2 11 WE STILL REMAIN TRUE TO OUR ORIGINS We still remember what it was like when nobody cared about Bitcoin when no venture capitalist would look at a Bitcoin company when the \xef\xac\x81rst venture WE LOOK BACK AT THE INDUSTRY TODAY AND ARE PROUD AT HOW capitalists started investing in MUCH IT HAS GROWN WE Blockchain companies when no HAVE A FULL TIME TEAM regulator would look at such a DEDICATED TO business as ours when the \xef\xac\x81rst UNDERSTANDING THIS Altcoins were launched when the SECTOR AND STILL crypto markets started THINGS PASS US BY generating volume when banks and corporations started trying to popularise Blockchain over Bitcoin when ICO\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81rst started 15 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Industry Overview Platform & History Online Investment 2 12 THE BF TOKEN MIGHT JUST BE THE ANSWER We see our role as it has always been \xe2\x80\x94 supporting the growth of companies and technologies involved in the future of \xef\xac\x81nance In achieving this we must stay on top of compliance and innovation while maintaining as much of what being a Bitcoiner meant all those years back The crypto sector has treated us very well and we aim to continue supporting the space as we believe it may grow to a trillion dollar market and beyond We feel the market is now ready for the BF Token to solve some of the scaling bottlenecks we are facing and can allow us to open up to a wider audience We aim to do this through a membership and rewards token outlined in detail in this whitepaper We know that traditional banks and \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions now want to take over our sector as it grows large enough for them to take notice but we aim to support companies that make them less relevant not more relevant To do this we are proud to introduce to you the BF Token 16 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER \xe2\x80\x94 03 BNKTOTHEFUTURE COM & THE ROLE OF OUR MEMBERSHIP TOKEN 17 \x0cHaving watched the growth of We know \xef\xac\x81rsthand how ICO\xe2\x80\x99s and Token Sales our important it is to get the investors are demanding similar regulations technicals and liquidity secondary market market conditions correct trading and live pricing for equity all while preventing as investments but with the same much market manipulation reputable deals and investor as possible WH IT EPA P ER BnkToTheFuture com & Online Investment Platform the role of our membership token 3 1 WHAT\xe2\x80\x99S NEXT FOR BNKTOTHEFUTURE COM protections that they have been used to when investing through We believe that we are now BnkToTheFuture com They also ready to combine the power want more frequent updates on of Blockchain technology the companies they have with the years of best invested in practices in the equity markets to launch We have been working on this equity backed tokens goal for half a decade now but utilizing smart contracts to the regulatory technical and trade on a secondary market hurdles have been market in a regulated extremely challenging environment 18 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER BnkToTheFuture com & Online Investment Platform the role of our membership token 3 2 WHAT OUR INVESTORS WANT Our investors on the BnkToTheFuture com platform want us to offer them a solution that is very simple to understand and utilize but this presents us with three major challenges that need to be solved 01 Real time pricing of their equity investments 02 Liquidity to exit their private equity investments when they want 03 Transparency for trading their private equity and access to updated information Sounds like a reasonable request right But to achieve this it requires breaking new ground simultaneously in three areas \xe2\x80\x94 regulatory technical and market 3 3 REGULATORY CHALLENGE We have been working through regulatory challenges for over 7 years now and have built what we believe to be the most convenient and compliance driven on boarding process for qualifying investors with an aggressive roadmap of improvements to make this even better _09 19 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER BnkToTheFuture com & Online Investment Platform the role of our membership token 3 4 TECHNICAL CHALLENGE Blockchain enables new Often the technical developments technical possibilities for us fail to comply with existing laws with regards to transparency and they always proceed of information fast regulatory changes meaning new settlement and new technology often has to be liquidity but in the shoehorned into outdated investment sector it needs to securities laws We believe we operate within existing have struck the right balance securities law to remain legal between technical innovation and and compliant compliance 3 5 TRANSPARENT MARKET CHALLENGE We believe we have overcome the regulatory and technical hurdles but our next challenge is the hardest one how to create the most transparent market possible To achieve this goal we feel that the introduction of a new membership and rewards token can be used to create market incentives that should lead to a more transparent market for our industry _10 20 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER BnkToTheFuture com & Online Investment Platform the role of our membership token 3 6 PROBLEMS WE HAVE SOLVED SO FAR On the regulatory side we are a compliance driven company and we are proud of our multi jurisdictional structure that allows for the buying and selling of private equity for qualifying investors around the globe Our legal structure allows private companies to deal with only one institutional investor while bene\xef\xac\x81ting from the liquidity of many investors in over 25 traditional currencies and 35 cryptocurrencies while we reduce the regulatory and compliance burden for the company and give investors additional protections through our unique syndicate structure On the technical side we have built a proven model that has facilitated investments through over 47 500 qualifying investors with over 100 of the top FinTech Bitcoin and Blockchain companies in the primary markets Through our platform we have co invested in funding rounds with top tier Venture Capital \xef\xac\x81rms We believe we now have the technology partners and regulatory structure to launch our secondary market for tokenizing and trading private equity using the Blockchain in a compliance driven way 21 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER BnkToTheFuture com & Online Investment Platform the role of our membership token 3 7 THE PROBLEMS THE BF TOKEN AIMS TO SOLVE On the transparent market side we have identified three major challenges to overcome 01 Sourcing & researching good FinTech Bitcoin & Blockchain deals is currently a hugely centralised and ine\xef\xac\x83cient process 02 Performing due diligence on FinTech Bitcoin & Blockchain companies before listing them is heavily dependent on a few skilled people 03 Investor relations is expensive and very time consuming for our listed companies and yet not frequent enough to satisfy our investors appetite for information In the public market these problems have traditionally been tackled through tighter rules regulations and internal standards that create a more transparent market but lead to slow expensive and time consuming legal and audit processes that still result in billions of dollars in market abuse and \xef\xac\x81nes Public companies hire dedicated personnel to deal with their investor relations a luxury that startups don\xe2\x80\x99t have We believe we can chip away at these problems one step at a time by introducing BFT the BF Token that powers the next phase of growth for BnkToTheFuture com Through incentivising certain behaviour through a membership and rewards token we feel we can break some new grounds that make for a more transparent marketplace To be clear the BnkToTheFuture com platform is aiming to allow for the trading of equity backed tokens but BFT itself is not an equity backed token BFT is our membership and rewards token that will be used by members as described in this whitepaper 22 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Online Investment Platform \xe2\x80\x9404 THE BF REWARDS & MEMBERSHIP TOKEN (BFT) 23 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER IThe BFRewards & Platform Online Investment Membership Token (BFT) 4 1 OUR MEMBERSHIP AND REWARDS TOKEN The goal of the BF Token is to use a community of incentivized token holders to help us create a fairer more transparent and e\xef\xac\x83cient marketplace for Fintech Bitcoin and Blockchain companies on BnkToTheFuture com who are rewarded by the value of their participation whilst achieving the goal of creating a more transparent market The BF token acts as a membership and rewards token that unlocks certain parts of our platform and gives VIP access to token holders but without access to the investment part of our platform and having to meet the requirements of a qualifying professional investor WE AIM TO CHIP AWAY AT OUR THREE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS ONE BY ONE BY ALLOWING OUR INCENTIVISED TOKEN HOLDER COMMUNITY TO STAKE AND BID ON BOUNTY PROGRAMS THAT DECENTRALIZE PARTS OF THE THREE PRIMARY PROBLEMS WE IDENTIFIED ABOVE THE END RESULT IS TO USE THE BF TOKEN TO CREATE A TRANSPARENT TRADING MARKET FOR FINTECH BITCOIN & BLOCKCHAIN EQUITY TOKENS 24 \x0cA L E SS C E N T RA L I S E D P R O C E SS F O R W H I T E PA P E R IThe BFRewards & Platform Online Investment Membership Token (BFT) LET\xe2\x80\x99S EXPLORE SOME SOLUTIONS TO THE THREE PROBLEMS STEP BY STEP L I ST I N G R E Q U I R E M E N TS Our current policy for listing on BnkToTheFuture com involves a highly centralized approach performed by our team analyzing hundreds of online applications and rejecting roughly 95% of them based upon our \xef\xac\x81ltration process We believe that a more decentralized approach can be achieved by involving the whole community and incentivizing them to identify select and conduct research on the best deals in the industry The BF Token can be used to stake on deals that our community would like to see listed on our platform while rewarding those that \xef\xac\x81nd and perform research on new deals 25 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER IThe BFRewards & Platform Online Investment Membership Token (BFT) A CO M M U N I T Y E N H A N C E D D U E D I L I G E N C E P R O C E SS Before listing on our online investment platform our BF team performs a due diligence process with the companies which involves the creation and veri\xef\xac\x81cation of documentation materials and videos that are fair clear and not misleading to investors While our BF team and regulated partners conduct additional checks on pitch information we are unable to verify real time content on pitch forums etc without signi\xef\xac\x81cantly slowing down the process which does not work in a live secondary market environment We aim to introduce a hybrid model where our securities businesses and registered broker/dealer partners undertake the compliant part of verifying material data certi\xef\xac\x81cation and other processes such as research analysis of deals and fact checking while the community is rewarded for performing additional research analysis and due diligence In order to participate in the marketplace companies and token holders will be required to use the BF Token 26 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER IThe BFRewards & Platform Online Investment Membership Token (BFT) I N C E N T I V I S E D I N V E STO R FAST R E L AT I O N S T RA N S PA R E N CY O F A N D R E A L W I T H T I M E M O R E I N F O R M AT I O N As listed private companies progress the need for investor relations can become a big burden to an already stretched private company yet investors want regular updates on company progress to make more informed decisions By using the BF Token our listed companies can be rewarded for providing more frequent investor updates while our community of token holders are rewarded for sharing commenting posting press releases and discussions around publicly available information on our investor forums Fake news or data can be punished whilst good research and reliable sources of data can be rewarded We believe this will keep more investors up to date with the latest information while freeing up companies to focus on their already existing public relations process and incentivising token holders when they take time out for investor updates Community token members with a good reputation can be rewarded for hosting live video interviews with companies whilst the company is rewarded for taking the time out for giving such interviews with the aim of improving the \xef\xac\x82ow of updates and information from the companies to our qualifying investors 27 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER At Bnk To The Future we hold equity in some of the most BnkToTheFuture com & the Online Investment Platform role of our membership token 4 2 EQUITY BACKED TOKENS valuable companies in the Bitcoin and Blockchain sector Each investment is held within its own investment vehicle through our sister company By taking each of these special investment companies and making each share exchangeable for a token backed by shares our investors are able to hold their own investments on a whitelisted smart contract that can be exchanged with other whitelisted qualifying investors allowing them to trade with each other with securities laws in mind To be clear these equity backed tokens are not connected to the BF Token While the BF Token was designed to bring transparency to our markets and be available for all to participate qualifying investors will be able to bene\xef\xac\x81t from tokenizing their equity into equity backed tokens that give them the ability to hold their securities within their control and trade them with other whitelisted members in a compliance driven way We feel that using Blockchain technology and smart contracts in this way allows us to solve the most common requests from our investors whilst simultaneously allowing for a wider audience to participate in the utility of our BF Token 28 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER \xe2\x80\x9405 THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE The buying selling and trading of securities is a highly regulated \xef\xac\x81eld From day one we have been working with legal counsel in multiple jurisdictions to ensure as best we can that we are in compliance with major international securities laws and that we secure the required registrations with regulators While every effort has been taken to ensure compliance with international securities law there is still regulatory risk that our planned roadmap may not go as planned experience signi\xef\xac\x81cant setbacks and delays for regulatory reasons or even be prohibited altogether due to regulatory hurdles and changes in international securities laws We have followed a regulatory compliance roadmap to make every effort to ensure we are in compliance with some of the major international securities laws T H I S R OA D M A P S E V E RA L C A N B E B R O K E N D OW N I N TO P H AS E S 29 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER The Regulatory landscape Online Investment Platform 5 1 PHASE 1 We started our journey by engaging legal counsel to comply with UK Securities law and allow UK high net worth and sophisticated investors to purchase private equity in UK companies This involved allowing sophisticated investors that are su\xef\xac\x83ciently quali\xef\xac\x81ed to understand the risks of investing in private equity to use our online investment platform We also introduced our suitability quiz that tests investors qualifying status on their understanding of investing in private equity to ensure they understand that investing in startups and early stage businesses involves risks including illiquidity lack of dividends loss of investment and dilution and it should be done only as part of diversi\xef\xac\x81ed portfolio BnkToTheFuture com exclusively targets investors who are su\xef\xac\x83ciently sophisticated to understand these risks and make their own investment decisions 5 2 PHASE 2 We then set out to build our platform in a compliance driven way that may meet the required compliance status with more international securities laws excluding investors residing in the United States This involved obtaining additional registrations with the Cayman Island Monetary Authority bringing in additional legal counsel to develop our compliance processes further and developing unique user on boarding processes and procedures for multiple jurisdictions 30 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER The Regulatory landscape Online Investment Platform 5 3 PHASE 3 We engaged some of the top US legal counsel to help us develop a unique process in compliance with SEC / FINRA rules and regulations This also involved several acquisitions and partnerships whilst developing a unique structure to separate US clients from non US clients 5 4 PHASE 4 We engaged further legal counsel to develop a process for the compliant purchase of tokens through our online platform through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) so we can host other clients completing token sales through utility or security tokens 5 5 PHASE 5 In order to facilitate the compliance driven trading of privately held securities we partnered with invested in and sought approval for an Alternative Trading System (ATS) registered with the SEC 31 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER The Regulatory landscape Online Investment Platform 5 6 OUR REGULATORY ROADMAP We believe that our carefully We have overcome some planned strategy and major regulatory challenges investment in legal counsel but our complete plan and and compliance with multiple execution may still be subject

in membership and rewards order to facilitate the buying token its utility is dependent selling and trading of privately upon the successful execution held securities and tokens We of our planned roadmap that also have relationships with involves regulatory risks that the most valuable companies may slow down or prohibit in the sector in many cases the execution of our plans being one of their

different member/user types Staking the BF token will \xe2\x80\x98unlock\xe2\x80\x99 new functions for these different member/user types enabling the tokens to serve as a stake and perform special actions on the platform where they could lose their stake if they break established rules First and foremost members will stake their tokens to constitute membership There are a variety of roles that members play on the platform each requires a certain staking balance This balance can be lost over time if the member undertakes certain actions on the platform Members can play multiple simultaneous roles but they would need to stake enough tokens to satisfy requirements for all of them In almost all cases violating rules can result in some stake being burned 33 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Token &

exposure proof of resources for our to the ownership bene\xef\xac\x81ts of the qualifying investor veri\xef\xac\x81cation BF tokens 37 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Token & Platform Online Function Investment Supply 6 5 COMMUNITY INSIGHTS Token holders can also have access to the insights generated on the platform Even people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t qualifying investors can stake tokens to read the results of the community assessment this will help them seek out alternative ways to purchase tokens outside of the BF platform or make their own determination even if the sale is not listed on the BF platform At minimum the community review process is likely to sort the market into broad categories of project quality 6 6 STAKING PROCESS AND AMOUNTS When users opt to stake their tokens they are locked for a period of time and only functional on the platform Staking amounts will be denominated by Bnk To The Future though Bnk To The Future will be periodically adjusting them based on market prices to ensure membership is not out of reach for new members 38 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Token & Platform Online Function Investment Supply 6 7 REWARD POOLS When users perform actions on the platform they can be rewarded with tokens from several reward pools which are dedicated speci\xef\xac\x81cally to different members which shall be subject to the approval and acceptance by the BF team at BF discretion The distribution will most likely be done by Bnk To The Future though the method of distribution and the method of calculation will be transparent and auditable on the Blockchain Each pool has its own method of distribution all based on the quality of contribution performed by the member These are discussed in greater detail in the Appendix A The pools will be seeded by releasing tokens held in a reward reserve pool and can be \xe2\x80\x98topped up\xe2\x80\x99 by Bnk To The Future itself using either its own token reserve or purchased tokens Since the community is helping offset costs Bnk To The Future can divert some BF tokens toward the reward pools to further incentivize contribution It could also add to the reward pools if BF felt that the reward pools balance was insu\xef\xac\x83cient At no time can Bnk To The Future take tokens from the reward pool for itself Please see the Appendix A for a discussion on the rewards pool 39 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Token & Platform Online Function Investment Supply 6 8 ADDITIONAL TOKEN ISSUANCE At contract creation Bnk To The Future will mint all BFT that will ever exist However a portion of those tokens will be withheld for issuance approximately over ten years though the timeline may vary based on several conditions Issued tokens will seed the reward pools that ultimately reward community members for their contributions BF\xe2\x80\x99S INTENTION IS TO RELEASE THESE TOKENS PERIODICALLY TO COINCIDE WITH PLATFORM GROWTH THE INITIAL PLAN IS TO RELEASE A NUMBER OF TOKENS EQUAL TO A PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE TRANSACTED ON THE PLATFORM FOR EXAMPLE BNK TO THE FUTURE MAY SAY IT WILL RELEASE 2% OF THE USD VALUE OF INVESTMENTS CONDUCTED OVER THE PREVIOUS MONTH IF FOR EXAMPLE US$20 MILLION WAS ISSUED AND SOLD US $100 000 WORTH OF BF TOKENS WOULD BE RELEASED INTO THE REWARD POOLS 40 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER \xe2\x80\x9407 TECHNICAL OVERVIEW & ROADMAP Our journey and the birth of Bnk To The Future began in 2010 we started

Segregated Portfolio of Bnk To The Future Capital SPC and has been appointed to issue the tokens from the Cayman Islands Our token sale is broken into two phases Phase 1 is for investors that wish to invest in our investment contract that gives them an entitlement to BFT in the future Phase 2 is for the community members that wish to purchase and use the token\xe2\x80\x99s utility and become members of the BFT community Qualifying investors on BnkToTheFuture com are the only ones who are able to invest in the BFT Investment Contract during the pre sale phase and must meet the criteria to be eligible to invest through BnkToTheFuture com We have engaged a US broker dealer Keystone Capital Corporation who is registered with FINRA/SEC to act as our placement agent for US investors and have appointed Bnk To The Future to facilitate the investment for non US investors The public sale is where any non US user that wishes to use the token can purchase between US$1 000 and US$10 000 worth of the token at a set ETH exchange rate that will be set just prior to the public token sale going live They will need to have a BnkToTheFuture com account and get their ETH Address whitelisted The public sale will be for a minimum of 300 to a maximum of 3 000 purchasers only who wish to purchase approximately US$1 000 to US$10 000 worth of BF Tokens We are limiting the purchase as we want to do what we reasonably can to attract purchasers that are not purchasing the tokens with the misconception of thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s an investment or that they are not using the token as an \xe2\x80\x98investment\xe2\x80\x99 and instead they intend to use the token to contribute to our BFT community All investors and purchasers pay the same price There is no tiered pricing and no discounts or bonuses that favour any single investor or purchaser 46 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER The BFInvestment Token Sale Platform Online 8 2 IMPORTANT DATES Pre sale started Tuesday 5th of 01 December 2017

VALUES WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT 01 We believe we have enough demand to make a fair offering on the token sale price for both the pre sale and public sale with no back door deals bonuses or discounts that could dilute value Everybody gets the same price 02 We are already oversubscribed through whitelisted commitments within our network our goal is to achieve large leftover demand for our token 03 We have thought greatly about aligning the interests of our clients investors token holders & company 04 We are already well capitalised and will be focusing on the value of our tokens with a 2 year lock in agreement for our company tokens We are not doing this as a substitute for raising \xef\xac\x81nance 05 We have learned a lot about what makes a good token sale and market we have aimed to setup a compliance driven legal structure (structured as a Reg D pre sale offering) 06 We have been here since 2010 launched the platform to go live o\xef\xac\x83cially in 2015 and we are committed to one clear mission with no plans to jump ship to the next money grab opportunity _09 50 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER \xe2\x80\x9409 ROADMAP TO IMPLEMENTATION & COMPETITION We have broken our technical roadmap

\x0cWH IT EPA P ER Conclusion Online Investment Platform 11 1 MISSION & FUTURE PLANS We believe that by launching the BF Token we are able to signi\xef\xac\x81cantly improve aspects of the BnkToTheFuture com platform that enables us to launch a transparent trading market in a regulated environment for both the primary and secondary listing of the biggest and most valuable FinTech Bitcoin and Blockchain companies that we could not have launched without the token and the resulting community 11 2 REAL TIME PRICING By achieving this goal it may be possible for our sector to have accurate and real time index and pricing data on FinTech Bitcoin and Blockchain companies for the \xef\xac\x81rst time This data may be used by third party researchers and data providers as well as for new investment products Real time pricing and information may also be used to perform advanced research and analysis of our sector and give the private FinTech Bitcoin and Blockchain equity market the liquidity it needs while creating more trading opportunities for our qualifying investors using Blockchain as the backbone 69 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Conclusion Online Investment Platform 11 3 UNIFICATION OF TOP TIER COMPLIANT CRYPTO EXCHANGES We believe we can unite the top tier crypto exchanges that we have invested in both centralized and decentralized to allow for the compliant trading of private FinTech Bitcoin and Blockchain companies built by the community for the community as we grow our platform into a compliant API layer for crypto exchanges in the future 11 4 WIDER PARTICIPATION International regulations mean that our platform can only be used by qualifying investors but due to the rise in crypto wealth this number of high net worth investors has exploded Should we reach our goals the BF Token can be used by all to participate in our ecosystem through our membership utility token without having to be a high net worth / qualifying investor 70 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Conclusion Online Investment Platform 11 5 MORE HIGH NET WORTH CRYPTO INVESTORS As our eco system grows this may contribute to growing the number of high net worth investors that qualify to invest through our online investment platform The more that qualify to invest the more invest via our platform supporting the growth of the industry The more investment the more liquidity in the secondary market The more liquidity in the secondary markets the more investment in the primary markets The more investing and trading the higher our FinTech Bitcoin and Blockchain industry market capitalisation can grow 11 6 CONCLUDING THOUGHTS The BF Token exists to incentive higher quality and transparent information \xef\xac\x82ows between companies and investors If we achieve our goals this should lead to better deals being listed on our online investment platform With every deal listed we believe the value of the BF token eco system can grow We believe that the more investment \xef\xac\x82ows into new \xef\xac\x81nancial innovation (that is independent of traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial players like investment and retail banks) the larger the market capitalisation of our token and equity market grows 71 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Conclusion By powering the BnkToTheFuture com platform with the BF Token we aim to create a feedback loop and eco system that plays its role in driving the crypto and equity market cap for the FinTech Bitcoin and Blockchain sector to US$1 trillion and beyond With ICO\xe2\x80\x99s gaining the attention of regulators all around the world the industry will have to adapt to more regulations Either our industry will give all the business to the very banks and \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions we set out to disrupt or we can use platforms like BnkToTheFuture com that were founded by a team that believed in Bitcoin before it was cool to believe in Bitcoin and Blockchain We have been working with regulations from Day 1 have been a part of the growth of the industry and investing in the sector since 2011 We are supporters of the decentralised unregulated markets too but we believe there will be two markets in the future \xe2\x80\x94 both regulated and unregulated and the two can support each other This philosophy made us the only choice for many of the largest and most reputable Bitcoin Blockchain & FinTech companies to \xef\xac\x81nd investment without too much of a huge regulatory burden and this is something we aim to continue Thank you for taking this journey with us and being part of the most exciting time to be alive in \xef\xac\x81nancial history We thank all who have contributed to the growth of the crypto community and for working on something that we believe will change the future of \xef\xac\x81nance forever 72 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Online Investment Platform APPENDIX A BFT Functionality and User Experience Ability to Source Deals (Community Sourcing) Anyone with a stake in BFT can provide info on a company (this helps to reduce spam) and submit their info of the company for community review Once a company information is submitted for review it goes into a batch alongside other companies in order to compete for votes for an average of two weeks period (time may be adjusted based on participation) To vote users can stake BFT to serve as a vote on behalf of individual companies Voting per company per user will be capped in BFT (explained in further details below) At the end of the voting period the company with the most overall votes will move on to the next round of review which could involve entering the queue of projects reviewed by the community or could involve BF directly contacting the company In addition Bnk To The Future will have discretion to nominate any other projects for follow up review/interview People who vote and those who submitted high quality information for vote and in affect the companies get selected for follow up interview with BF team will be rewarded BFT tokens from the rewards pool in proportion to their staked BFT All voting stakes for companies that do not pass this round of interview with BF team (companies that do not receive enough votes) will be returned to voters minus a fee to keep voting from being risk free 73 \x0cWH IT EPA P ER Voting caps There will be a dynamic cap on voting such that the cap on each successive vote is lower than that on the vote before This will help ensure early voters are rewarded and that people can\xe2\x80\x99t easily log in at the last minute and \xe2\x80\x98bet on the winning horse \xe2\x80\x99 diluting the rewards for previous voters An example of how the caps will work is as follows the \xef\xac\x81rst vote will be capped at 10 staked BFT the second at 95% of this cap (9 5) the third at 95% of that (9 052) and so forth until votes reach a minimum \xef\xac\x82oor Separately but related during the voting period qualifying investors with access to the trading and investment platform (registration required) can also stake BFT to a prospective company\xe2\x80\x99s listing This stake does NOT count as a vote though the same investors can also vote for companies in the same manner as everyone else If the company is selected members who staked during these early stages will get priority access to a small portion of issued shares proportional to the USD value of BFT they stake up to a maximum of US$50 000 Staking from quali\xef\xac\x81ed investors might be a stronger signal of a potential successful sale BF will extract a small fee (TBD tentatively set at 1%) from these staked tokens to

sourcing review (as well as any additional companies BF decides to include) will be subject to a second phase of community review aimed at further narrowing the \xef\xac\x81eld of prospect companies This assessment review runs as follows 01 If a member would like to assess deals s/he stakes BFT and indicates their availability Applications are randomly allocated to those who stake and express interest 02 These members must answer a set of questions about a project including a recommendation on whether it \xef\xac\x81ts BF\xe2\x80\x99s platform 03 These answers are then reviewed by another set of reviewers called \ Super reviewers\ Serving as a Super reviewer requires a higher BFT stake This review process will involve highlighting the best response and \xef\xac\x82agging particularly poor ones 04 Rewards will be drawn from the reward pool and are split between the reviewers with the best review getting slightly more and the poor ones losing a portion of their staked BFT BF initially proposes that reviewers must stake between US$50 US$100 in BFT to participate (the more the stake the higher the probability of being selected by the system and the higher the potential rewards from the reward pool) with 10% lost if their report is deemed inaccurate or unusable by the Super reviewers and/or BF due diligence team Bidding to be a Super reviewer will require US$1 000 in
