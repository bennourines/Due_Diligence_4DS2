SHARES 39 OUR ROADMAP 41 Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 1 \x0cEXECUTIVE SUMMARY Stellar Classic unlocks potentials in information technologies and blockchain solutions for financing and investment We present an easily navigable marketplace that supports new classes of real world assets notably exotic assets and product futures much of which have been illiquid and/or indivisible Our unique auction method together with our innovative adoption of distributed ledger technology empowers fundraisers and investors with efficiency and robustness hitherto unseen Currently inefficient processes unnecessary restrictions and misaligned interests plague financing and investment Access\xe2\x80\x93cost\xe2\x80\x93flexibility and access\xe2\x80\x93returns\xe2\x80\x93stability are two notable sets of tradeoffs where existing alternatives continually disappoint fundraisers and investors Combining marketplace format auction method and exchange support Stellar Classic offers transformational combinations of high access low cost high flexibility and high liquidity to new asset classes that can quickly grow into a trillion dollar market We identify openness easy navigation efficiency and robustness as our unique selling propositions To build a symbiotic relationship between the Stellar Classic team and our user community we introduce the Stellar Classic token With such functions as Discount Referral Award Staking and Fundraising Bonus and the feature of Token Burn the Stellar Classic token delivers meaningful and tangible value to our user community drives active use promotes organic growth and supports continued adoption In this Token White Paper we begin by identifying the pain points that we address and present our solution Then we review the competitive landscape and size the total addressable market Details of the Stellar Classic token including its features and issuance schedule follow We also discuss how we will be using the proceeds from our token sale and deduce the utility value of the token Towards the end we delve into a couple of specific features of our business and offer three high level examples Our timeline concludes this paper Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 2 \x0cCURRENT PAIN POINTS & A BRIGHT SPOT Three notable pain points in financing and investment lead to suboptimal resource allocation in the economy Fundraisers and investors are not the only ones who suffer \xe2\x80\x94 as our economy under creates value and unfairly distributes it we all do Stellar Classic is tasked to address these pain points To begin with financing and investment are currently plagued with inefficient processes Except for public offerings by mature companies existing channels for financing and investment are bound to \xe2\x80\x9cbilateral\xe2\x80\x9d deal flow The fundraiser connects with a number of investors exchanges information with each and attempts to reach a deal While some aspects of these interactions can be reused the whole process comprises of a series of deal attempts that involve considerable repetitions as well as inter temporal uncertainties Consequently bilateral deal flow leaves optimization across deal attempts costly and ineffective \xe2\x80\x94 it essentially precludes optimal fundraiser\xe2\x80\x93investor matching Likewise the lack of a market mechanism for price discovery has led to an abundance of over valued and under valued deals Mismanaged deal optimization may result in failure to reach the financing goal or in forfeiture of gains when exiting investment positions Due in part to these inefficiencies in processes financing and investment also suffer from unnecessary restrictions In terms of access fundraisers with a few potential investors lined up tend to stop exploring better deals due to feasibility constraints given bilateral deal flow the same is true with investors Imbalances across geographies industries and networks exacerbate this problem as information expertise and trust are asymmetric Beyond access many valuable aspects of a firm\xe2\x80\x99s operations have been absent in financing Flexibility in financing and investment is regrettably low Poor access and inflexibility only aggravate the difficulty in efficient fundraiser\xe2\x80\x93investor matching Figure 1 Pain points that Stellar Classic addresses Even when deals are closed misaligned interests are frequently an issue Impracticality in prescribing for all contingencies information asymmetry disparity in experience and mischief are all thorny realities Wellstructured strong governance systems that align the interests among fundraisers and investors hardly extend beyond the stock market Similarly the structuring and fulfillment of the terms of investment are usually impromptu There lacks a parameterized system that averts misunderstandings mishandlings and misfortunes It is therefore hardly surprising that fundraisers and investors frequently walk into deals that they do not fully understand and whose outcomes they cannot fully predict Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 3 \x0cIn recent years distributed ledger technology (DLT) has promised to revolutionize financial services Notably immutability distributed databases and smart contracting have provided the tools for innovative and efficient management of asset classes that has hitherto been infeasible They collectively enable increased transparency and parameterized governance of investment terms While currently tokens powered by DLT have been primarily tokens with only on chain value tangible assets with off chain value can also be represented by DLT tokens Though the issuance exchange and fulfillment of these tokens together have the potential to transform financing and investment a compelling solution that fully develops this potential remains absent Notably there is an aching need for an easily navigable fully compliant convergence point for sellers and buyers We believe that a financing and investment solution that effectively tackles these issues will greatly contribute to value creation and that a simple reasonable and robust business model can be built for it Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 4 \x0cTHE STELLAR CLASSIC SOLUTION Stellar Classic resolves these pain points with an easy to use service marked by efficiency and robustness The three key pieces of the puzzle are (i) our marketplace interfaced with distributed ledger (ii) our unique auction method that empowers multilateral financing deal flow and (iii) our fully compliant manipulationresistant exchange Marketplace for Tokenized Assets Two decades of continual innovation has online marketplaces deeply ingrained in how we shop Consumers enjoy broad selection of merchandise well organized in adaptive categories AI aided suggestions filters detailed descriptions and peer reviews further empower them Door to door delivery options complete the experience one can navigate through tens of thousands of products visit dozens of shops choose the most appealing offer at the best available price and have the purchase delivered before the day ends Stellar Classic transforms financing and investment by bringing the convenience and efficiency of marketplace to the world of DLT tokens Powering new asset classes is the first step we take in building Stellar Classic Here we aim to bring attractive financing and investment opportunities to a larger audience hence instead of going down the rabbit hole of complex derivatives we stick to realworld assets with off chain value From the perspective of investors individuals can easily understand these assets and corporate actors may readily integrate their investment into their supply chain and/or business model (e g by flexibly trading unused capacity or by sourcing through B2B presales) From the perspective of fundraisers these asset classes reflect valuable aspects of their existing operations that have been regrettably overlooked as financing resources Specifically we introduce exotic assets and product futures While presold products are physically delivered after maturity exotic assets are rent generating Some notable examples of presell able products include fine wines consumer electronics and electronic components etc Their customers may be either the end consumer or the next link in the supply chain Product futures share many features of commodity futures Notably the investor need not be the consumer \xe2\x80\x94 combined with the possibility to delay delivery this dramatically broadens the investor base and increases the number of units an investor can purchase at a time Before Stellar Classic exotic assets were indivisible their ownership was highly illiquid Collectible art real estate infrastructure and production capacity are some notable examples Traditionally external investment in these assets only occasionally made sense and only for a few investors Stellar Classic makes Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 5 \x0cit possible for investors large and small to participate by enabling partial ownership governed by smart contracting These assets can act either as a haven in periods of market instability or a source of passive income Beyond these new asset classes we will also support traditional securities such as shares and bonds This option is empowering for startups The benefits in investor engagement however also apply for mature firms Further we will continually integrate new functionalities to the DLT tokens on our marketplace hence investors as well as fundraisers will enjoy exceedingly excellent experiences \xe2\x80\x94 a feature that traditional investment channels cannot match We discuss the asset classes and their fulfillment in further detail in the <Market Sizing> and <Features Deep Dive> sections below With a high number of assets in a wide array of categories navigation is key We integrate intelligent and adaptive search and filtering functions found in leading e commerce platforms such as Amazon Investors can browse search filter and compare asset listings These functionalities greatly facilitate navigation comparison and decision making they also boost fundraiserinvestor matching as more precise searches become a reality Last but not least as a marketplace we also secure the fulfillment of the investment terms with smart contracting Fundraisers that have presold products will deliver them physically to investors post maturity (either upon maturity or with the option to delay delivery) Those that have auctioned off exotic assets shares or bonds will distribute rents dividends or coupons respectively While we will work with investors in the unfortunate event of a breach of the investment terms we leverage smart contracting to optimize parameterized handling of cash flow in order to prevent this from ever happening Moreover we will continually integrate the latest developments in DLT protocols so as to elevate investor engagement to a new level These aspects all contribute to interest alignment Please refer to the <Features Deep Dive> section below for further details Auction & Multilateral Deal Flow In addressing some of the current pain points in financing we introduce a unique auction method on Stellar Classic Upon the fundraisers\xe2\x80\x99 application we conduct initial screening before allowing the fundraiser to customize the auction and to establish the terms of investment Upon approval the auction is announced on Stellar Classic and broadcast to subscribers interested in similar investment opportunities After a defined delay for investors to study the opportunity the bidding window opens Investors can submit and update a series of competitive bids As the bidding window closes all winning bids will be awarded tokens at the same price determined from the competitive bidding For more detailed description on how auction works on Stellar Classic please refer to the <Features Deep Dive> section The Stellar Classic Auction Method is instrumental to multilateral financing deal flow Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 6 \x0cFigure 2 The three components of The Stellar Classic Solution Fundraisers and investors alike benefit immediately from optimal price discovery by market mechanism Unlike bilateral deal flow where uncertainties and poor access hinder deal optimization in an auction inputs from all participating investors together determine the final price of the tokens The auction mechanism is designed such that all winning bidders are willing to pay at least the final auction price given all public information and that all losing bidders are prepared to pay at most this price (at the final auction price the firstcome first served principle is observed) By design therefore our auction method ensures correct valuation The price discovered through this process is also the one that the secondary market is ready to support Multilateral deal flow in our marketplace setting drastically transforms access with Stellar Classic financing and investment are marked by transparency and openness For the fundraiser the marginal cost of an additional investor is zero For the investor the marginal cost of exploring an additional asset is also largely eliminated part of this reduction comes from improved navigation offered by our marketplace part of it arises directly from the price discovery mechanism \xe2\x80\x94 placing bids in an auction is significantly less costly than engaging in a series of negotiations Consequently investors have much better odds of building a balanced portfolio of assets that they understand and are interested in Fundraisers too experience a welcoming boost in their matching with investors Broad access together with the resulting improvement in matching further strengthens the foundation for interest alignment Last but not least while yielding better outcomes multilateral Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 7 \x0cdeal flow also saves time Once an auction is announced and all pertinent information shared every interested investor can find the announcement research the asset and decide whether and how they will bid separately The fundraiser can engage all investors in parallel for example by making answers to frequently asked questions public Hence the waiting period before one party gets an \xe2\x80\x9canswer\xe2\x80\x9d or manages to schedule the next \xe2\x80\x9cmeeting\xe2\x80\x9d is effectively gone By cutting deal time while securing better deal outcome our multilateral deal flow minimizes the opportunity cost The end result is more effective resource allocation and value creation Manipulation Resistant Exchange The third piece of the puzzle is our integrated manipulation resistant exchange As we introduce new asset classes particularly ones that are formerly illiquid a means to sustain a liquid market is instrumental for establishing these assets as viable investment options To that end several levers on Stellar Classic help maximize liquidity given the nature of the assets (i) Our marketplace facilitates fundraiser\xe2\x80\x93investor discovery and matching Consequently the amount of buying interest is more likely to be captured into buying actions (ii) Fulfillment governed by DLT makes asset management more effective Investors save considerable energy in tending to the execution of each deal Thereby they have more time and energy for trading (iii) We ensure that our integrated exchange is safe and compliant so as to provide a conducive environment for investment (iv) Last but not least the Stellar Classic token (XLMX) that we offer to our user community has Discount and Referral functions The Discount function can reduce the opportunity cost and thereby make more trades attractive The Referral function incentivizes our users to help us bring in new active users Together these functions boost liquidity further We believe safety and compliance are critical for our success as well for reasons beyond transient liquidity Observing the cryptocurrency market one can note the damaging effects of legislative uncertainty to public adoption Because Stellar Classic is a marketplace for assets that already have legislative certainty (such as physical products physical assets shares and bonds etc ) we have the relative luxury of knowing how to achieve full compliance Combining marketplace auction and exchange innovatively Stellar Classic offers an Amazon / eBay like experience for investors and fundraisers alike We believe this unique mix effectively addresses current pain points in financing and will greatly facilitate the adoption of DLT in value creation in our economy Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 8 \x0cSuccess Fee Business Model As a marketplace that supports the issuing and exchange of asset backed tokens Stellar Classic enjoys a simple success fee model Fees collected on first issuance executed orders and currency exchange are the three notable branches While they start off as highly competitive users can further reduce these fees with the help of the Stellar Classic token (see the <The Stellar Classic Token> section) Figure 3 Overview of our success fee business model First we charge the fundraiser a 5% flat fee on funds raised For them the absence of a listing fee is advantageous they only pay when their funding goal is reached Our analytics team will guide them in customizing their own auction in order to optimize their success rate Second we charge 0 2% on all executed orders on our exchange (secondary market) on both buy and sell sides For the types of new asset classes that we support this represents a markedly lower transaction cost than existing alternatives (see the <Competitive Landscape> section) This difference will serve to boost liquidity on our marketplace and attract fundraisers from existing high cost alternatives It is noteworthy that this fee also serves to maintain market stability \xe2\x80\x94 without it \xe2\x80\x9cwash trades\xe2\x80\x9d which are trades by a single trader or a single group of traders intended to manipulate the market would be possible As a marketplace we enlist not only assets initially issued on Stellar Classic We will also support tokens issued elsewhere that nevertheless meet our high standards At the same time some tokens will be taken off the market once the terms of investment tied to them have been fully fulfilled With these factors combined the number of listings on the secondary market that each investor can find at any given time may differ significantly from the total number of assets ever issued via auction on Stellar Classic As third parties come into this market in droves the total number of listings will be considerably higher Third we support a wide range of fiat and crypto currencies whenever an exchange is needed (when the token is issued or traded natively in a currency different than the one preferred by the investor) we charge a one way fee of 0 5% for fiat to fiat and 0 2% for fiat to crypto pairs For fiat to fiat pairs we can offer this advantageous rate thanks to demands from both sides of the trade Throughout our service only success fees are charged Browsing registering issuing bidding and placing Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 9 \x0corders etc are all free of charge In the future we will build on our success fee model and introduce other value added services Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 10 \x0cCOMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE With Stellar Classic we are not merely entering a market we are creating a new one Much like the case of cars and horse drawn carriages or that of email and fax however alternatives that serve the same purpose already exist In this section therefore we explore the current competitive landscape and identify how Stellar Classic will drive the paradigm shift and sustain competitive advantage for the foreseeable future Stellar Classic as a marketplace serves both fundraisers and investors Unlike traditional two sided platforms however our inclusion of the secondary market means investors can also be sellers Publicly traded securities and ICO tokens are two main existing alternatives that share this feature Therefore investors of tokenized assets on Stellar Classic enjoy some new dynamics that open up new investment strategies fundraisers in turn also enjoy broader access and higher flexibility In the following analysis we take the perspectives of fundraisers and investors in succession then we tie them together with a holistic view of the competitive landscape before identifying our unique selling propositions Fundraisers Fundraisers\xe2\x80\x99 primary concern is financing namely what the criteria are to access financing and how costly the process is As each fundraiser\xe2\x80\x99s need varies another consideration is whether the option is suitable for the specific scenario Therefore we analyze the various financing alternatives along three dimensions Access How accessible is this financing option Cost How costly is it to raise funds with this option Flexibility How flexible is this option Auction houses serve fundraisers with exotic assets Access is stringent as qualified venues are few and their capacity limited At the same time auctions are costly and the outcomes are at times unpredictable Only select assets such as collectible art fine wines antiques and real estate etc with considerable value and welldefined audience are suitable Small business owners frequently resort to bank loans Loans are generally issued against collateral to the fundraiser and thereby exacerbate personal risk exposure Moreover few scenarios beyond small businesses are suitable to apply for bank loans for a multitude of reasons The size of loans also tends to be smaller than most alternatives Corporate investors represent one of the most attractive options The nominal cost of seeking corporate investment is low and the process can be part of a firm\xe2\x80\x99s usual business development The size of investment can vary from medium to high depending on the specific needs However corporate investment is hard to come by Each investor is likely to be interested only in a specific type of investment with a well defined set of Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 11 \x0cqualities Worse corporate investors rarely communicate their preference openly Overall access to corporate investment is therefore highly restrictive Crowdfunding is a low cost alternative for startups to bootstrap their operations Rather than connecting with investors startups presell their products or services to end consumers In general crowdfunding has few restrictions however not all startups are suitable to be crowdfunded when the development cost is high or when the products or services do not target individual consumers crowdfunding is inappropriate Blockchain startups originally used ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) to raise funds from the public for the development of their services Hence ICOs could be considered a variant of crowdfunding Recently nonblockchain startups have also been exploring this financing option It is usually less restrictive than traditional crowdfunding because \xe2\x80\x9cbuyers\xe2\x80\x9d (investors) of ICO tokens need not be the end consumer of the services that the startups offer thanks to the existence of exchanges At the same time regulators have noted that some ICOs are indeed securities offerings There are two compelling cases where tokens can be argued not to be securities (a) when the token is the product and (b) when the token can be exchanged for the product (loosely referred to as \xe2\x80\x9ccurrency\xe2\x80\x9d) The second case means access to ICOs is open to many firms startups or otherwise insofar as the firm is ready to adopt tokens as payment for part or all of its products and services The cost for an ICO is usually lower than it is for public securities offerings though it remains high due largely to considerable marketing costs as there is no marketplace for these tokens and each ICO needs to make its own market from scratch Figure 4 Access\xe2\x80\x93cost\xe2\x80\x93flexibility analysis for fundraisers Inventory financing bears some resemblance to corporate investment the investor usually operates within well defined boundaries Nevertheless it is usually more accessible for the length of commitment is shorter Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 12 \x0cAt the same time the costs for inventory financing are higher than corporate investment and flexibility is confined to that of the production of the fundraiser Publicly traded securities cover a wide range of financial instruments They are perhaps the most established means of financing and are highly flexible However issuing securities to the public is costly and generally only suitable when the amount to be raised is high Financial institutions have also been packaging multiple assets or asset classes into synthetic securities This however is not a case that we explore for they are products of financial institutions rather than means of financing by fundraisers Traditionally startups that require external funding have relied on venture capital investments In recent decades the stages at which venture capitalists enter have gradually shifted the majority of \xe2\x80\x9cventure capital\xe2\x80\x9d firms indeed focus solely on growth capital As a result the already selective process has grown increasingly demanding Further venture capital only caters to startups and always results in significant dilution of ownership therefore it is unsuitable for mature firms and unappealing to firms with more attractive options In comparison Stellar Classic combines some notable advantages offered by these options while avoiding their restrictions Specifically goods suitable for auction houses can also be auctioned on Stellar Classic because we can fractionize the asset into numerous tokens and each investor need not purchase the asset in its entirety auctioning on Stellar Classic attracts more interested buyers the fundraiser therefore is likely to achieve higher raises Corporate investors can also integrate Stellar Classic into their investment strategy at the same time fundraisers on Stellar Classic need not limit their target investors to any single corporate investor Compared to ICOs Stellar Classic offers well defined financing options backed by goods and services in our purpose built marketplace The costs to raise on Stellar Classic are therefore considerably lower Moreover our broad support means fundraisers unsuitable for ICOs can also raise funds on Stellar Classic In the near future we will also provide support for securities Thanks to DLT securities on Stellar Classic will enjoy better transparency and governance functions Figure 4 provides a qualitative overview of the competitive landscape from the point of view of fundraisers Investors Investors are concerned with a different set of qualities that collectively affect the success of their investments From their point of view we compare various investment alternatives along the following three dimensions Access How accessible is this option Returns What is the typical level of return on investment that an investor can expect Volatility How volatile is this investment option What is the level of variance among specific investments within this option Commodities usually trade in high volume Nevertheless their performance is closely tied to political and macroeconomic environments in recent times uncertainties on the global scale have kept commodity prices volatile Further as commodities are physically delivered upon maturity a large portion of investors in this Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 13 \x0cmarket are corporate investors who use it as part of their supply chain Other major players are financial institutions Cryptocurrencies (pure currencies such as Bitcoin as opposed to ICO tokens) in comparison are fully open Since their invention investors have seen astronomical returns At the same time due to slow adoption cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile There is also significant variance among specific currencies with Bitcoin as the apparent leader It remains to be seen whether cryptocurrencies can sustain in the coming years the levels of returns that they have so far achieved Closely linked to cryptocurrencies are ICOs Among investors there is confusion as to whether ICO tokens are \xe2\x80\x9ccurrencies\xe2\x80\x9d when their use case is the payment of goods We draw a distinction between the two based on whether global payment is within their scope for us cryptocurrencies are to be used across platforms like cash while ICO tokens are to be used for selected services like coupons (or indeed tokens) ICO tokens are highly volatile Performance heterogeneity is astoundingly high too However the average returns from ICOs underperform cryptocurrencies in general Access to ICOs used to be open though recently some jurisdictions have imposed temporary restrictions Due to the lack of a marketplace the processes of researching and investing in ICOs are also complex M&A at times can be considered an investment option for corporations As few if any viable candidates exist at any given time access to M&A is understandably restrictive Unlike most other investment options corporations who conduct M&A rarely profit by selling their positions Nevertheless returns can be assessed by comparing the performances of the firm before and after M&A Heterogeneity is relatively high as textbooks are full of stories of successful and failed M&As Private funds tend not to be volatile as the fund management usually has long term investment strategies that seek consistency On the other hand heterogeneity among funds is nonnegligible a significant number of funds fail to match the performance of the market and access to proven high performing funds is usually restrictive The costs of private funds are also high for investors Real estate is a common choice for many investors For retail investors real estate investment provides benefits in utility and tax deductions For corporate investors ownership of office building or manufacturing facilities cuts down cost and may supply an additional source of income For governments investment in infrastructure drives social and economic development Overall historic returns from real estate have been reasonably high and stable It is also reasonably accessible However real estate investment is highly illiquid Publicly traded securities tend to be more volatile and more accessible than private funds Heterogeneity in performance among securities is high but thanks to relatively high liquidity investors can exit easily It is feasible to outrun the market which also tends to yield higher returns than real estate As in the previous subsection we are referring primarily to the stock market and exchange traded funds rather than derivatives From the investor\xe2\x80\x99s point of view those instruments are useful in professional trading but are rarely assets that are worth holding on their own In comparison Stellar Classic offers the highest level of accessibility to investors with all types of backgrounds and interests Our broad support for new as well as traditional asset classes makes it exceedingly easy to build a balanced portfolio Admittedly such breadth also means the heterogeneity in performance among assets can Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 14 \x0cbe relatively high still our efforts in curbing asset price manipulation combined with the off chain value of our asset listings should ensure lower price volatility than cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens Figure 5 Access\xe2\x80\x93returns\xe2\x80\x93stability analysis for investors Stellar Classic does not intend to replace commodities securities real estate funds or any other form of investment Rather with our open marketplace and DLT support we introduce them to a more efficient format Hence investors on Stellar Classic can access these types of investment options more easily For example compared to traditional real estate investment investors will be able to purchase the asset in part and exit their positions by selling directly on our exchange These advantages greatly boost access and makes higher returns possible Last but not least while Stellar Classic cannot substitute M&A some aspects of corporate investment can be complemented by integrating product futures offered on Stellar Classic into the supply chain As Stellar Classic is much more affordable and agile we believe this option will greatly empower corporate investors Figure 5 provides a qualitative overview of the competitive landscape from the point of view of investors Synthesis Financing and investment are complex activities Many professionals dedicate their careers to a small part of a single option Nevertheless if we focus on the overall experience it remains possible to form a clear understanding of the competitive landscape Before Stellar Classic we can generally consider access\xe2\x80\x93cost\xe2\x80\x93 flexibility and access\xe2\x80\x93returns\xe2\x80\x93stability as two sets of tradeoffs Stellar Classic transforms financing and investment by offering an alternative that largely mitigates these compromises Table 1 provides a synthesis of the above analysis Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 15 \x0cTable 1 The Competitive Landscape Access Auction

alternatives we offer four unique selling propositions (USPs) that are clear understandable and easy to communicate open easily navigable efficient and robust First openness is our greatest asset As a marketplace we welcome a broad range of assets and bring them features that used to be exclusive to publicly traded securities Exotic assets such as collectible art infrastructure and factory capacity etc can now be fractionized owned and traded by numerous investors Product futures based on fine wine electronic components and inventory etc offer opportunities of business model innovation to fundraisers and investors alike Soon we will also support traditional securities Thus the level of flexibility is unprecedented Beyond flexibility we make attractive financing and investment opportunities more accessible Fundraisers can find on Stellar Classic financing options that readily match or eclipse most existing alternatives \xe2\x80\x94 now cheaper and less restrictive Similarly investors can find on Stellar Classic investment options that readily match or eclipse most existing alternatives \xe2\x80\x94 now more secure and easier to manage Second an open market could be cluttered and hard to navigate In contrast Stellar Classic boasts an easilynavigable marketplace format that offers exceptional user experience We meticulously curate an adaptable catalogue and will leverage artificial intelligence to help investors search discover and research Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 16 \x0cthroughout our listings Further we leverage smart contracting to govern the fulfillment of the terms of investment thus completing the user experience from discovery to fulfillment Currently there is no financing or investment alternative that offers comparable experience let alone for the new asset classes that we propose Third financing and investment on Stellar Classic is exceptionally efficient Our innovative auction method provides a market mechanism for optimal price discovery in financing Details of this method are covered in the <Features Deep Dive> section This easy to understand mechanism simultaneously benefits fundraisers and investors by cutting down financing costs and yielding fairer valuations Auction houses are the only alternatives that support a similar feature though an auction for large quantities of tokens differs from an auction for a single item Beyond price discovery fundraiser\xe2\x80\x93investor matching is greatly empowered thanks to our marketplace format as well as high degrees of accessibility and flexibility Essentially fundraisers and investors enjoy much better chance of interacting with the most suitable audience Figure 6 Our USPs Fourth Stellar Classic is also designed to be robust In general our asset listings enjoy superior transparency and governance By moving governance and transaction on chain while keeping private data off chain it is possible to achieve high levels of trust while preserving privacy tokens not only represent the underlying asset but also provide functions that underpin governance functionalities Further we will ensure full compliance with all pertinent regulations and the levers discussed in the <The Stellar Classic Solution> section will be able to sustain levels of liquidity rarely found in existing alternatives Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 17 \x0cMARKET SIZING Stellar Classic addresses both financing and investment The overall turnover on the secondary market can be considerably higher than the size of the primary market (i) asset price can appreciate over time (ii) some assets can remain in trading years after issuance and (iii) we will enlist tokenized assets issued elsewhere that nonetheless meet our standards As tokenized assets (beyond cryptocurrency) are new and the first tokens are expected in 2019 we take two steps in sizing this market First we estimate the annual financing market in ten years as substitutes or complements to existing alternatives Then we estimate what evolutions of the primary market could mean for the market capitalization in the same time frame In the first step we consider the annual markets of auction house real estate asset financing infrastructure crowdfunding ICO supply chain and venture capital These will be grouped into the three main asset classes on Stellar Classic Current markets that constitute alternatives to exotic assets include collectibles auction commercial real estate infrastructure and asset financing Data published in France show that in 2012 the auctions for collectibles (art antiques jewelry wines and others) reached \xe2\x82\xac1 23 billion with arts and antiques accounting for 67% of the totali Globally fine art auctions have summed at around $15 billion annually in recent years ii If we ignore antiques in the former figure and assume that the French market is representative this will conservatively put the annual auctions market for collectibles at over $22 billion With dramatically higher access and lower cost (yielding better results for the seller while safeguarding their privacy) we expect a significant portion of this market will move over to distributed ledger technology further collectors who are currently not using auction houses may adopt DLT based solutions Contribution from this source can therefore be around $20 billion per year globally in 2028 In the first half of 2018 global commercial real estate transaction volume reached $341 billioniii The market that we propose makes real estate investments significantly more agile and less costly It is therefore reasonable to foresee a considerable portion of commercial real estate investment turn to DLT based solutions At the same time we also must acknowledge that this is a highly conservative market and that adoption will be gradual If we conservatively assume that the commercial real estate market will not grow and that 1/4 of it will be on blockchain in ten years that represents a market contribution of roughly $170 billion per year globally Asset financing is currently used by firms to get loans against the asset that they own In 2016 this market has passed the $1 trillion mark globallyiv Exotic assets that we propose are not limited to loans instead uses of the assets can be sold and traded We believe this can be an interesting alternative for it solves the problem of idle capacity On the other hand because this is a new proposition for the sake of prudence we will assume that in 10 years this market will grow to 1/10 that of asset financing today at $100 billion per year Our specific marketplace format can further transform public infrastructure investments now commonly funded by tax income public private partnerships (PPPs) or governmental debt \xe2\x80\x94 by empowering the PPP model with lower cost higher access stronger governance and superior agility This market currently stands at $2 6 trillionv If we assume that in ten years 1/20 of that will be underpinned by DLT it will be a $130billionper year market Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 18 \x0cWhile for exotic assets we primarily view the market that Stellar Classic creates as substitutes for existing alternatives for product futures we see it as a complement to crowdfunding ICO and supply chain investment In 2018 total crowdfunding transaction volume reached over $9 3 billion with 45 6% year on year growthvi This number is expected to reach over $25 billion by 2022 On top of traditional crowdfunding ICOs amassed over $20 3 billion in 2018vii Some startups due to uncertainties in their future pricing and limited target market size may be more suitable for crowdfunding Other startups may choose to adopt a special \xe2\x80\x9ccurrency\xe2\x80\x9d for their service Nevertheless for most startups product futures offer a superior solution Unlike crowdfunding investors need not be end consumers and the secondary market supplies liquidity for flexible entry and exit Unlike ICOs where tokens are considered \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d and are highly volatile with product futures tokens represent the products or services that the startup will offer Relative certainties and prospects of growth in their value makes them a more viable investment We believe it is reasonable to expect this source to grow in ten years to at least the size of current crowdfunding and ICO combined at over $30 billion per year Compared to crowdfunding and ICO supply chain investments vary from sector to sector Some specific examples of products that could benefit from the product futures model include x86 computer processors ($42 billion in 2017viii) and NAND flash ($52 billion in 2017ix) This market has great potential Given the superiority of our solution we believe a considerable portion of non commodity supply chain will move onto blockchain(DLT )based solutions At the same time it remains possible that each leading supplier would resort to their proprietary blockchain solutions If we (or indeed one of our competitors) are successful this market can easily surpass the $100 billion per year mark within ten years Figure 7 Breakdown of primary market in 2028 For traditional securities such as shares and bonds we only focus on the space occupied by venture capital for two reasons (a) earlier access to the public via DLT backed shares makes future IPO redundant and (b) our product and business asset backed financing options also represent attractive substitutes to debt securities The year 2017 saw global venture capital deals reach $155 billion globallyx and this number has been surpassed already by the first three quarters of 2018xi The market we propose offers efficiency advantages to startups and investors alike While some startups may prefer product futures those that are still far in their development stage from delivering products or services have the choice of raising funds against their stocks The enthusiasm Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 19 \x0cof STOs (security token offerings) in the blockchain community echoes this observation We believe this source can easily surpass 1/2 of the sum of current venture capital deals within ten years amounting to at least $80 billion per year globally The above sources together make for a primary market sized at roughly $630 billion per year in 2028 Figure 7 offers a breakdown Figure 8 Market cap projections for 2028 Beyond the primary market we need to account for market exit and growth to deduce the market capitalization The nature of the new market means this exercise can offer at most a general idea and cannot be considered an educated estimate for no existing data readily sheds light on (a) what the market exit rate is for each asset class (b) what pattern of growth each asset class will experience or (c) how the price in the secondary market will change overtime We therefore make the following assumptions A The market exit rate for each asset category is as follows a Exotic assets 10% per year b Product futures 50% per year c Traditional 15% per year B The primary market will grow linearly to the 2028 estimate C The prices of the assets will on average remain unchanged Under these assumptions we would have a 2028 total market cap of $2 15 trillion Figure 8 breaks down the market cap projections Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 20 \x0cTHE STELLAR CLASSIC TOKEN In this section we lay out the key values that we want to deliver by introducing the Stellar Classic token its functions and features and the token issuance and allocation plan Foundational Values of the Stellar Classic Token To offer a marketplace that is open easily navigable efficient and robust is a significant undertaking A vibrant committed user community comprised of both fundraisers and investors must grow with us for Stellar Classic to succeed and for the values that we stand for to prevail We therefore seek a solution that aligns us with a continuously growing community There are four foundational values that must be deeply rooted in this solution (i) It must be a win win solution that provides meaningful and tangible value to our user community (ii) It must encourage our community members who have invested in it as well as those who have not to use our service and thereby stay actively engaged (iii) It should also incentivize our community members to help grow our community proactively (iv) Last but not least it should not only motivate earlyadoption but also help us galvanize lasting support from all our users regardless of the timing at which they join First the value this solution provides to our user community must be meaningful and tangible In the blockchain community there is currently growing interest in security tokens backed by shares in companies Investors in these tokens are shareholders and enjoy the rights that this status confers These tokens add investor engagement features to equity rights and represent an asset class that we offer at Stellar Classic However this type of security tokens serves primarily investors rather than community members who actively enjoy the service of the issuer While this may be preferred in many cases it would weaken the value provided to our user community Further investing in shares of companies before said company has achieved profitability or at least established considerable income streams is not always suitable for most investors it is difficult to value the company correctly under these circumstances Our opinion therefore is that security tokens backed by shares are not advisable for average investors unless the issuer has achieved profitability or established considerable income streams Otherwise the value of the token is usually neither meaningful nor tangible Second this solution must help keep our community actively engaged through use Whether the use case is fundraising or investing a well designed utility token can offer functionalities that encourage usage Community members who hold these tokens can directly enjoy their functionalities This process is conducive to a more diversified asset pool with higher liquidity Members who do not hold these tokens therefore also enjoy meaningful and tangible value indirectly as we will be able to offer better services at lower opportunity cost Thanks to a more diversified asset pool and the more dynamic user base that it attracts investors will have broader choices with which to build a balanced portfolio and fundraisers will have an easier time matching with interested investors Thanks to higher liquidity and the more active user base that it supports investors can fill their orders faster with smaller spreads and fundraisers can avoid funding failures and flash crashes more readily Third this solution must incentivize the organic growth of our community Indirectly it entails the dynamic raised in the preceding point for a more vibrant active user community improves the value that we can provide to all users A positive feedback loop thereby becomes viable More directly we should incentivize our Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 21 \x0ccommunity members to help grow our user community proactively A straightforward referral program is therefore a valuable addition that can reward our community members who make the largest contribution to our growth with meaningful and tangible value Fourth this solution must encourage adoption continuously While early adopters should enjoy the benefits for longer periods of time this solution must not be set up in a \xe2\x80\x9cpyramid like\xe2\x80\x9d fashion such that early adopters enjoyed disproportionately more benefits at the expense of late adopters To achieve this we should offer higher incentive at the beginning to encourage early adoption but never distinguish among community members by their tenure We have designed the Stellar Classic token with these values in mind Figure 9 The foundational values of XLMX and its token features Token Features As a utility token the Stellar Classic token (XLMX henceforth) will have four main functions and one additional feature Together these features incentivize active engagement of the entire community and underpin the value of XLMX through usage Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 22 \x0cDiscount In its first function XLMX offers users discounts on fees when it is used for these fees Specifically both fundraisers and investors can choose to pay their success fees in XLMX and receive a discount Provided that the user holds sufficient amount of XLMX we will deduct from their account the amount that corresponds with the fees after discount valued at the market price denominated by the currency that denominates the trade Otherwise the discount only applies until the entire balance of XLMX in the user\xe2\x80\x99s account is exhausted the remainder of the fees will be covered in the currency that denominates the trade The discounts that XLMX offers follow a simple schedule Within the first year after the official launch of our marketplace (scheduled in late 2019) the discount rate is 40% In the second year after launch the discount rate is reduced to 30% In the third year it is further reduced to 20% Beyond the third year XLMX will always offer 10% discount on fees In general let x be the undiscounted fees to be paid m be the discount rate and z be the value of XLMX that the user holds both x and z are denominated in the currency of the transaction 1 If no discount applies and the final fees paid are 2 If discount applies only to fees covered by z and the final fees paid are discount fully applies and the final fees paid are 3 If The Discount function is a key driver of the four foundational values of XLMX First discounts are meaningful and tangible for our user community The value of XLMX is always superior to them than it is to others by at least the discount that the token offers at the current market price Second Discount makes it less costly for users to raise funds and to buy and sell assets more fundraising and investing activities become viable as a result For investors while without these discounts our fees are highly competitive with cryptocurrency exchanges they can be further reduced with XLMX \xe2\x80\x94 and we offer new asset classes in an open and easily navigable format unfound in cryptocurrency exchanges For fundraisers we proffer an open and easily navigable format as well as our unique and highly efficient auction method for optimal price discovery \xe2\x80\x94 again unfound in cryptocurrency exchanges We are therefore confident that this function will help drive active use and promote organic growth of our user community Third the Discount function has no expiration date While we offer higher discounts in the first three years to incentivize early adoption our entire user community can continue to enjoy this benefit The value of XLMX derived from this function will therefore not suddenly vanish All users can at any time purchase XLMX and start enjoying fee discounts Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 23 \x0cReferral Award In its second function XLMX offers referral awards for introducing new active investors Specifically users can send private invitations to others who are not yet members of our user community After the new user registers as an investor with the unique link inside the invitation each time they pay fees using the Stellar Classic token the referee receives 20% of the XLMX collected This referral award has no expiration date though it works only with direct referral For example user Charles uses the unique referral link sent by user Anna to register on Stellar Classic Charles buys 20 coins of Firm Delta at 500 EUR / coin The transaction totals at \xe2\x82\xac10 000 and the fees incurred total at \xe2\x82\xac20 before discount Suppose Charles holds sufficient XLMX and that the discount is 40% at the time of his transaction He pays \xe2\x82\xac12 worth of XLMX in fees Anna receives a referral award of 12 \xc3\x97 20% = 2 4 EUR Months later Charles invites his friend\xe2\x80\x99s company Echo to register on Stellar Classic in order to raise funds for an expansion project Though the administrator of Echo uses Charles\xe2\x80\x99 link to register because Echo is a fundraiser Charles will not receive a referral award when Echo successfully raises funds on Stellar Classic The referral award function further drives the foundational values It is valuable primarily to our community members who actively help us grow As our active user community grows dynamics similar to that described under the Discount function come into play our services will improve and the opportunity costs will drop Further the referral award only applies to direct referrals \xe2\x80\x94 contrary to \xe2\x80\x9cpyramid\xe2\x80\x9d referral schemes As a result disproportionate benefits are not given to early adopters at the expense of late adopters Indeed the value of the referral award relates only to investment activities of the new users and is independent of the time at which referral is made Staking The third function of XLMX is staking for fundraisers in certain catalogue ranking scenarios Specifically in the default view of keyword searches and catalogue browsing asset listings that have the highest numbers of XLMX staked will appear higher than otherwise When the results of keyword searches and catalogues are sorted by other criteria for example date of issuance or price and when several results otherwise rank the same asset listings that have the highest numbers of XLMX staked will appear higher than otherwise For example suppose Assets X Y and Z are all the infrastructure projects in Europe currently in trading If a user searches the keyword \xe2\x80\x9cinfrastructure\xe2\x80\x9d and refines the results with \xe2\x80\x9cEurope\xe2\x80\x9d as the location and \xe2\x80\x9cin trading\xe2\x80\x9d as the status X Y and Z are the only assets that remain in the search Suppose X has 1 000 XLMX staked Y has 500 staked and Z has none Asset X will appear first followed by Y and Z Suppose further that X is priced at \xe2\x82\xac10 Y \xe2\x82\xac20 and Z \xe2\x82\xac20 If the user further chooses to sort the Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 24 \x0csearch results by price in descending order Y will appear first followed by Z and X In general staking XLMX potentially improves the search ranking of the corresponding listed asset We must emphasize that the effects are a possibility rather than an eventuality Functionalities in navigation for example filtering and sorting as well as the user\xe2\x80\x99s set preferences are our priority We will never intentionally compromise the search results When other criteria and preferences have been exhausted staking will help improve search ranking This function serves fundraisers It presents a way for them to bestow more visibility to their asset listings and hence represent meaningful and tangible value At the same time the function is so devised that all other features and functions that we provide are fully protected Demand for XLMX from staking therefore drives up the value of the token at no cost to our user community Fundraising Bonus In its fourth function XLMX grants fundraisers who choose to raise exclusively in XLMX an additional discount on fees Specifically if a fundraiser auctions off an asset on Stellar Classic and chooses to accept only XLMX they will receive an additional discount on top of that from the Discount function This additional discount follows a simple schedule It is not activated within the first year after the official launch of our marketplace (scheduled in late 2019) hence the discount rate is 0 In the second year after launch the fundraising bonus function becomes active for XLMX The initial discount rate is 12 5% In the third year it is increased to 25% Beyond the third year XLMX will always offer 50% discount to fundraisers who accept XLMX exclusively in their funding auctions For example suppose company N raises funds on Stellar Classic Assume further that it is able to close a raise worth \xe2\x82\xac10 million at the end of the auction If N holds no XLMX and has chosen to accept euro only our success fee amounts to 10 000 000 \xc3\x97 5% = 0 5 million EUR Suppose that the discount offered by XLMX is 20% If N holds sufficient XLMX it will only have to pay a fee in XLMX worth 0 5 \xc3\x97 (1 \xe2\x80\x93 20%) = 0 4 million EUR On the other hand if N has chosen to accept XLMX exclusively in its auction an additional discount will apply Suppose this additional discount is 25% In this case N only pays a fee of 0 4 \xc3\x97 (1 \xe2\x80\x93 25%) = 0 3 million EUR Note that when the fundraiser chooses to accept XLMX exclusively in their funding the two discounts are compounded In general let x be the undiscounted fees to be paid m be the discount rate for all fees paid in XLMX and n be the additional discount rate for funding auctions that accept XLMX exclusively The final fee that the fundraiser pays is This Fundraising Bonus function offers an interesting choice to fundraisers who may be sensitive to fees At the same time it provides another source of demand for XLMX thus further supporting its value Investors Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 25 \x0cwho actively use XLMX therefore can enjoy higher value per token from both Discount and Referral functions It is worth noting that we choose not to activate this function in the first year of our launch for two reasons First before our service becomes well established and our community fully fledged we expect the market to have diverging views on the valuation of XLMX Consequently its initial volatility may be high and its price may be difficult to predict despite our best efforts We believe these may not be the most conducive conditions for successful financing and would not encourage fundraisers to accept XLMX exclusively As our service and our community become more mature accepting XLMX exclusively will grow into a viable and attractive option Second the Discount function is scheduled to grant lower discounts on fees having the Fundraising Bonus function grant higher discounts allows us to maintain the value of XLMX derived from the demand side Table 2 Stellar Classic token overview Rate Users served Condition Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Beyond Fee paid in Stellar Classic token 40% 30% 20% 10% Fee paid in Stellar Classic token 20% Discount Referral All Investors Staking Fundraisers Does not interfere with functions Fundraisers Accept exclusively Stellar Classic token Acts as an appreciation mechanism Fundraising Bonus Token Burn All n/a 0 12 5% 25% 50% 10% Token Burn The final feature of XLMX is a mechanism that continually reduces the total supply As we accept XLMX as fee payments it is necessary for us to sell them back into the market so that the circulating supply does not dry up In order to stabilize the value of XLMX in a cryptocurrency market marked by extreme volatility we build into the design an appreciation mechanism through systematic reduction of the total supply Specifically we sell back at most 90% of the tokens that we accept as fee payments from our user community This means that at least 10% of the tokens will be burnt after being used once For example suppose in a certain month we collect 50 million XLMX as fee payments We will burn 10% of them i e 5 million XLMX at the end of the month We can choose to sell back at most 45 million of these tokens In this we will take the utmost care in minimizing the impact of these transactions on the market price of XLMX Table 2 offers an overview of the features of our utility token Token Supply and Issuance We fix the total supply of the Stellar Classic token (XLMX) to slightly over 3 4billion Of these 70% are allocated to the community with just over half of them (30%) to our initial Airdrop 15% to community Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 26 \x0cdevelopment and 15% to talent recruitment and interest alignment (For our Marketplace) A broad basket of currencies will be accepted under a demand adjusted token pricing schedule Jointly these details help ensure that XLMX will be able to deliver on its four foundational values Total Supply For the interests of transparency we fix the total supply of XLMX to 3 450 990 960 (3 4 billion) Currently an intricate mechanism in ICO the continuous bonding curve is popular With this mechanism the unit price of the token goes up continuously as long as the demand for new tokens sustains and vice versa It essentially eliminates the need for cryptocurrency exchanges at least for the currency or asset to which the token is bonded However we do not believe these qualities align with the foundational values that we have established above Bonding to a single currency or asset makes broader exchange with other currencies and assets more cumbersome Each such transaction will have to involve the base currency and be exposed to volatilities related to it This reliance goes against the key principle of our marketplace openness and the compounded volatility runs contrary to our goal of driving active use and organic growth In comparison a fixed total supply is easy to understand Starting from a number that is also easy to remember our user community can track our token usage and token burn more readily Moreover because the supply does not confound with value as would be the case with a bonding curve it is more feasible to value XLMX correctly Token Allocation Since our primary motivation in creating XLMX is to foster a win win dynamic between the Stellar Classic team and our user community the token allocation that we propose follows the same principle The majority of the tokens are allocated to our user community and the remainder of the tokens are allocated either to activities that benefits our community directly or for the Stellar Classic team to attract talents and align our interest better with that of our community First 70% of the tokens are allocated directly to our community and divided in two parts Of the total supply 30% will be distributed as Airdrop and 40% will be locked in escrow for potential future sales Our reasons for locking tokens away for potential future sales are twofold Immediately selling all the tokens would result in wasted funds and dilution of token value On the one hand there would be funds sitting idle that were not actively serving our community On the other hand the value that each token holds would be diluted making it harder for XLMX to deliver on its foundational values Together these dynamics would hurt the interests of our user community and indeed weaken the long term development of Stellar Classic as a company By locking close to half of the tokens in escrow in comparison we reserve the possibility of increasing the circulating supply of XLMX as our community grows We also fully eliminate the possibility of increasing the total supply at any future date which serves to assure our community members who use XLMX of its longterm value A potential drawback of this arrangement would be the negative pressure on token price if clarity would be missing from potential future sales We negate this pressure by committing to a strict procedure in handling Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 27 \x0cthe tokens in escrow (a) Before any future token sale could be organized all XLMX holders have the opportunity to vote on this decision We will provide a specific token sale plan as well as an application for this vote at least one month before it is scheduled to take place Only with the approval of a simple majority of the votes will we carry out any further steps (b) Once the decision to conduct a future sale is approved by voting a delay of at least one month is necessary before the sale can begin (c) Five years after our initial token sale (ICO) we will destroy all remaining tokens in escrow thereby capping the circulating supply definitively Second 15% of the tokens are reserved for community development initiatives that directly benefit our community Some examples include bounties challenges events and partnerships etc For example we will set up security check bounties for every aspect of our software to reward community members who identify vulnerabilities in our service and help rectify these vulnerabilities We will hold open challenges for our community to contribute ideas and solutions to improve our service We will also partner with reputable service providers and open source blockchain communities in order to improve our service Figure 10 XLMX token allocation Third 15% of the total supply is reserved for the Stellar Classic team We will use these tokens to attract talent and align the team\xe2\x80\x99s interests with those of our user community In order to secure interest alignment further these tokens will be earmarked and cannot be sold within the first three years after our initial token sale This simple mechanism allows every Stellar Classic team member who holds these tokens to share the same interest in growing our business and our community together We believe that this allocation plan works in concert with the token features in driving the foundational values of XLMX All key stakeholders are accounted for and the allotment is conducive to bringing them together in growing our user community Long term plans for potential future sales and for reallocating tokens reserved for market making further assure our community of our awareness of contingencies in our development Token Issuance and Listing We will issue XLMX on the Ethereum blockchain under the ERC 20 standard In our initial token sale we will be accepting a basket of fiat and crypto currencies including euro (EUR) US Dollar (USD) Bitcoin Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies These choices are made with consideration of the breadth that we should reach in building our community Indeed at Stellar Classic we have no ideology but openness in supporting Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 28 \x0ctechnologies it makes perfect sense therefore to acknowledge that members of our user community may be enthusiastic of other blockchain projects too With this pricing schedule token price goes up as realized demand increases It serves as a market mechanism for valuation until all tokens will have been sold in our initial sale at which point the mechanism confirms that the market values the Stellar Classic token to be no less than 0 08 USD / token We will enlist XLMX on major cryptocurrency exchanges In the months immediately after our initial token sale we will accelerate our software and business development so as to support full token functions as planned Token holders will also be able to exchange the Stellar Classic token against other assets on our marketplace TOKEN FUNDS UTILIZATION In this section we itemize the utilization of the funds raised through our token sale at a high level We must emphasize that uncertainty is inherent to business operations macroeconomics regulatory changes technological development and shifting tastes of potential users etc all point to agility as a key success factor As a result the following itemization should be considered only as a guideline Our priority will always be the long term success of the symbiotic relationship between Stellar Classic and our user community To begin with roughly 20% of the proceeds from the token sale must be put aside for taxes as well as legal and accounting fees Because utility tokens represent services that the issuer is committed to provide proceeds from the token sale are currently considered taxable revenues in all jurisdictions that recognize utility tokens This item is therefore a relative constant regardless of the outcome of our token sale The remainder of the proceeds will be divided into three categories research and development (R&D) operations and compliance (OPS) and marketing and business development (MBD) R&D is responsible for developing maintaining and continually improving our software as well as hardware OPS is charged with regulatory compliance financial analytics and client support MBD is responsible for developing partnerships growing our user community and building meaningful long term relationships If we manage to close our token sale with the entire allotment sold we will receive \xe2\x82\xac58 million There will be sufficient funds for us to develop our software fully and integrate up to date support of a broad selection of blockchain protocols Beyond R&D we will also be able to manage compliance in more jurisdictions and thereby serve a broader audience and we will establish close relationships with industries outside the blockchain community in order to drive mass adoption of the DLT based new asset classes that we propose Roughly 20% 35% and 25% of the funds will go to R&D OPS and MBD respectively Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 29 \x0cFigure 11 Projection of personnel size and income statement highlights in the best case scenario According to our projection of personnel size and income statement in the best case scenario (Figure 11) a little shy of \xe2\x82\xac30 million in expenses will be incurred in the first two years before Stellar Classic can be soundly profitable This roughly corresponds with the goal of our token sale TOKEN UTILITY VALUE Before wrapping up the discussion of the Stellar Classic token (XLMX) we believe that deeper economic analysis can help our community understand it better Please keep in mind that analyses in this section are academic and should not be taken as investment advice Specifically we deduce token utility value that can be supported by different levels of market share and token utilization We must precede it however by stressing that we account for solely the utility value It may be argued that the total value for our utility token is higher to active users than it is to token holders who only focus on its appreciation potential Token utility value is essentially the additional value to token users on top of market valuation Because XLMX is meant to create a symbiotic relationship between Stellar Classic and our user community so that we can excel together we choose not to discuss the market valuation in this analysis If we temporarily omit the Staking function (due to its amorphic nature) and the deflationary pressure from Token Burn overtime the transient utility value of XLMX is the sum of the values derived from other functions (1) Where subscripts D R and B represent the Discount Referral and Fundraising Bonus functions respectively Before going further we give a rundown of the symbols used Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 30 \x0c1 Subscripts a Time t b Trade T c Fundraising F 2 Volume v 3 Fees rates f 4 Transactions a Share of transactions where XLMX is used b Share of transactions by users registered through referral c Share of funds raised using exclusively XLMX 5 Function rates a Rate of the Discount function b Rate of the Referral function ( does not vary overtime) c Rate of the Fundraising Bonus function We assume that the shares and are independently distributed With these we can express the transient utility value from Discount as (2) which equals the total discounts that XLMX can offer at the time on fees at the applicable rate for trading and fundraising combined It is worth noting that fees apply to both makers and takers The transient utility value from Referral is (3) which equals the referral awards for fees collected from applicable trades after Discount is applied The transient utility value from Fundraising Bonus is Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 31 \x0c(4) noting that (5) (6) It

example if we assume XLMX would be that the total utility values of (8 a) (8 b) (8 c) (8 d) With these we can further Sizing> section to valuation are possible at plug in results from the <Market understand at what levels of utility which market share Before doing so let us briefly examine how these numbers can add up for a cryptocurrency exchange using (8 a) Currently the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume is Binance At the time of this analysis (January 2019) Binance has had a volume of \xe2\x82\xac14 8 billion in the last 30 days If we assume that volume remains at this level billion EUR/year Even if we ignore this would entail a utility value of at least \xe2\x82\xac254 million per year In fact from just trading alone the volume from a cryptocurrency exchange ranked between 30th and 40th in overall volume would be able to provide roughly \xe2\x82\xac50 million per year in utility value if the volume is kept at the rate of January 2019 In the <Market Sizing> section we conservatively estimate that in 2028 the new asset classes that we propose will make a primary market of $630 billion (\xe2\x82\xac550 billion) per year with a market cap of $2 15 trillion (\xe2\x82\xac1 9 trillion) If we assume that the market cap is turned over 10 times per year (in comparison currently the cryptocurrency market turns over more than 50 times per year) this makes a secondary market of roughly \xe2\x82\xac19 trillion Let p be the percentage of market share that Stellar Classic holds we get for 2028 (9) Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 33 \x0cThat is if our market shares are 1% for both the primary and secondary markets (i e 190 billion EUR/year in trade volume and 5 5 billion EUR/year in funds raised) the value of XLMX in 2028 alone will be \xe2\x82\xac156 8 million If our market shares are 10% for both the utility value of XLMX will be over \xe2\x82\xac1 56 billion just in 2028 Before concluding this section we should reiterate that the discussion here revolves around utility value This is value that only our user community can actively enjoy We think that it could be understood as part of the total value of XLMX That is (10) FEATURES DEEP DIVE In the preceding sections we have covered the motivation outline and highlights of Stellar Classic we have also detailed how the Stellar Classic token will help us build a symbiotic relationship with our user community We encourage the reader to visualize the experience and give us feedback on our implementation \xe2\x80\x94 this white paper is intended to serve as a framework upon which we will tirelessly improve Still a couple of features by virtue of their innovativeness call for more thorough explication Asset Classes & Fulfillment We emphasize three main asset classes for they vary in their implications to financing and investment Nevertheless the user experience pre auction and in auction is the same regardless of asset class User experiences differ primarily post auction in fulfillment Our innovative use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) underpins them Product futures gives the fundraiser two options in physical delivery to specify prior to financing In the first option products are delivered upon maturity In the second delivery after maturity is on demand a lead time will sit between the point when the investor schedules a delivery and the point when the fundraiser finally fulfills the order In order to understand why the second option may be attractive we need to delve deeper into product futures as a financing and investment format Among the most attractive features of product futures to the fundraiser is the \xe2\x80\x9clock in\xe2\x80\x9d effect it helps the fundraiser seize a sizable market before the product or service is available thus gaining advantage over competitors in similar stages of development This allows fundraisers that leverage presale better market clarity and consequently easier strategic planning On the other hand the most attractive features of product futures to investors differ depending on whether the investor is a would be customer When the investor is not a customer or when the investor is a customer but has also invested more than s/he could take delivery of being able to exit post maturity is valuable Even when Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 34 \x0cthe investor is motivated by using presale as part of its supply chain being able to schedule delivery reduces inventory cost and allows for just in time manufacturing In contrast the fulfillments of exotic assets and traditional securities are similar in that gains are automatically accredited to the investor\xe2\x80\x99s account their main differences rest in investor engagement Exotic assets and shares allow investors to participate in important decisions in management of the asset or of the firm Fundraisers of exotic assets in particular need to specify an initial list of management terms whose parameters the investors will be able to adjust by voting Shares also have built in voting systems that allow investors to exercise their shareholder rights from the comfort of their homes At the same time firms can leverage the collective wisdom and knowledge of their shareholders through polls As mentioned many times before thanks to the ceaseless effort of the DLT community we will continually upgrade these investor engagement functionalities \xe2\x80\x94 at no additional cost The Stellar Classic Auction Method Our auction leverages competitive bidding innovatively to secure optimal price discovery To understand how this works we need to examine some principles of auctions in general The simplest auctions involve one item that can only be sold to one bidder if it ever gets sold Usually this entails either first or second price auction and economics theory teaches us that optimal price discovery is ensured by design in both cases As we move to multiple items however modifications are necessary to optimize price discovery Why Because the auction then runs the risk of leaving different bidders paying different prices The simplest way to avoid this difference is to let all winning bidders pay the minimum acceptable price \xe2\x80\x94 this is an auction method called OpenIPO We extend this method by allowing bid updates as new information from the bidding process gets incorporated in the decision making This market mechanism thereby facilitates the achievement of consensus on pricing One may wonder why does the fundraiser not auction off the two items separately As it turns out insofar as the two auctions proceed in parallel and are second price auctions the outcome would be exactly the same This remains true as the number of identical items increases (and as the feasibility of multiple simultaneous listings decreases) However while the outcome would be the same as two auctions in parallel it would differ from two auctions in series On the other hand increasing the number of auctions is impractical when large quantities of tokens are involved This is where the starting price comes in Specifically the fundraiser sets a starting price (p0) Each bidder i commits both a price (pi) and a quantity (qi) Our system automatically ranks all valid bids in descending order by their prices Until the sum of all quantities from all valid bids surpasses the total number of tokens to be auctioned off the starting price remains the current price (p) Once this sum becomes larger than the total number of tokens the current price becomes the lowest price at which token(s) can still be allocated All bidders can increase their bids (both price and quantity) but not decrease them during the auction after the bids are initially placed As the bidding window closes the last Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 35 \x0ccurrent price is the final price (P) in the auction All bids higher than the final price are awarded tokens at the final price and for all bids at the final price tokens are allocated following the first come first served principle This auction method enjoys four qualities Price uniqueness All winners pay the same unique winning price Price consensus All winners would pay (and have bid) at least the unique winning price and all losers would pay (and have bid) at most the unique winning price Competitiveness adjustment The seller can adjust the starting price in order to gain control over the competitiveness of the auction Purchase in whole It is possible for an investor to purchase the entirety of the tokens in the auction (with the highest bid and a volume equal to the total supply) By allowing the seller to adjust the starting price we can protect the fundraiser while allowing the auction of large quantities of tokens The level of this price should ensure that the price discovery process does not disadvantage the fundraiser and that investors will be attracted to the auction We will continually track and study the real world performance of this parameter and assist fundraisers in choosing it Marketplace Interface A key differentiator between Stellar Classic and other tokenization services is our easily navigable marketplace interface It introduces e commerce like experience and efficiency to investment thereby dramatically improving discoverability and matching Our marketplace has two key pages the search page and the asset page Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 36 \x0cFigure 13 The search page The search page is where a user reaches when one of four actions are taken (a) when the user clicks on the \xe2\x80\x9cCatalogue\xe2\x80\x9d link in the header (b) when the user clicks on any \xe2\x80\x9cAsset Class\xe2\x80\x9d link (c) when the user clicks on any suggested \xe2\x80\x9cKeyword\xe2\x80\x9d or (d) when the user conducts a keyword search by using the \xe2\x80\x9cSearch Bar\xe2\x80\x9d in the header Among these Actions a b and c are special cases Action a calls out the entire asset listing it is equivalent to conducting a keyword search without entering a keyword Action b is equivalent to taking Action a and then restricting the search results to the specific \xe2\x80\x9cAsset Class\xe2\x80\x9d Action c is equivalent to conducting a keyword search using the suggested \xe2\x80\x9cKeyword\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore Action d is the general case Figure 13 is a screenshot of the search results with keyword \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Tech\xe2\x80\x9d Notably search results can be further restricted and refined As shown in Region A of Figure 13 the user can choose which asset class s/he would like the search results to be confined to Asset classes with more matching results are shown on top while asset classes with few matching results are collapsed by default Similarly as shown in Region B of Figure 13 the user can refine the search results with a list of filters These filters are adaptive to the search results so as to provide the most sensible and useful tool for the user to navigate the asset listings In the initial version of our marketplace \xe2\x80\x9cList View\xe2\x80\x9d is the only supported viewing mode for search results As shown in Region C of Figure 13 and as well as in Figure 14 each matching asset will be displayed as a list entry with several key pieces of information that help the user decide which assets are worth exploring further Among these are (a) a thumbnail that helps quick visual identification (b) the status of the asset (c) key facts (d) highlights of the asset and the terms of investment and (e) suggested keywords Among these the status of an asset takes one of three values as shown in Region D of Figure 13 an asset can be \xe2\x80\x9cIn trading\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cInauction\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPre auction\xe2\x80\x9d Correspondingly the key facts presented adapt to the status of the asset as shown in Region E of Figure 13 Figure 14 An asset entry among search results Once the user clicks on a specific asset either on the search page or elsewhere s/he is taken to the asset page It is where the user can view detailed information of each listed asset Figure 15 is a screenshot of the general layout of the asset page On the asset page the most critical pieces of information are presented on top while further details can be found deeper into the page The first group of key information includes the classification of the asset as well as suggested keywords as showed in Region F of Figure 15 The user can browse the asset listings using these asset classes and keywords The second group of key information includes and extends the key information in the search results as shown in Region G of Figure 15 On the right side as shown in Region H of Figure 15 an \xe2\x80\x9cAction Panel\xe2\x80\x9d adapts to the status of the asset it allows the user to conduct a set of actions Below related assets and details of the current asset are presented Figure 15 The asset page Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 37 \x0cFigure 16 Action panels Notably the Action Panel can take one of three possible forms As illustrated in Figure 16 they recapitulate key pieces of information and when actions can be taken allow the user to bid or trade on the asset directly THREE EXAMPLES TO INSPIRE Before concluding this white paper we present three short examples that cover the three main asset classes on Stellar Classic While they are not meant to be exhaustive we hope they can inspire the readers with the breadth of potentials for us to transform financing and investment As high level examples we omit the discussion of fees paid and consequently the use of the Stellar Classic token Cases of token usage are included in the <The Stellar Classic Token> section All examples depict fictional events Art Gallery \xe2\x80\x94 Exotic Asset Lumino is a private art gallery in Northern Italy It has a collection of contemporary paintings and sculptures from artists that are gradually gaining international recognition Lumino\xe2\x80\x99s new curator has the ambition to expand its collection and to organize more high profile temporary exhibitions Its trustees being investors on Stellar Classic themselves introduce us to the management Having researched the various options Lumino\xe2\x80\x99s management consider auctioning part of their collection as exotic assets The trustees agree that this could be an innovative approach to building Lumino After due process Lumino decides to put four of their most prized paintings up for auction Lumino will continue managing and maintaining these paintings unless all token owners unanimously decide otherwise Proceeds from exhibitions will be awarded to token owners Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 38 \x0cEventually Lumino raises \xe2\x82\xac12 million Three of the paintings are sold to multiple investors some of which own less than 0 1% Meanwhile one painting garners the attention of a wealthy art collector he manages to walk away from the auction with the painting for \xe2\x82\xac5 million Within the month the art collector receives the painting at his home Lumino though losing an important piece in their collection raises more than it would have if it had sold the painting alone With these funds it purchases new art works from up and coming artists that will likely appreciate in value Further the high profile exhibitions elevate Lumino\xe2\x80\x99s international standing which in turn secures its financial future Fine Wine \xe2\x80\x94 Product Futures Gaudon is a winery in the Burgundy region in France with over two centuries of history Its wines are the favorites of renowned chefs and wine collectors alike around the world Gaudon\xe2\x80\x99s financial health is excellent Nevertheless as the owners learn that a vineyard adjacent to theirs may be up for sale whether to purchase it themselves and where to source the funds become questions on their minds In Burgundy vineyards that carry the \xe2\x80\x9cgrand cru\xe2\x80\x9d designation enjoy immense prestige This designation is strictly controlled and essential for Gaudon\xe2\x80\x99s quality and reputation The vineyard that may be for sale carries this designation and it has not changed ownership in over a century Gaudon\xe2\x80\x99s owners really want to seize this oncein a lifetime opportunity After some research they find the product presale option on Stellar Classic to be ideal Currently their supply falls well short of demand With the possible addition of the new vineyard they can recuperate the cost within a decade simply from the increased output Even if for one reason or another they fail to purchase it preselling the wines reduce their exposure to uncertainties in the coming years In the comfort of this knowledge the owners of Gaudon proceed to auction off half of their productions from two to eight years into the future Unexpectedly some investors highly knowledgeable in wines recognize this opportunity their involvement pushes up the price in the auction well above the current market price This becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and Gaudon\xe2\x80\x99s market price catches up in a few months\xe2\x80\x99 time Gaudon purchases the new vineyard their owners are grateful for the innovative highly efficient financing opportunity Agricultural Technology \xe2\x80\x94 Shares Biota is an agricultural tech company founded by a group of Mexican scientists Its main product is a nonpoisonous biodegradable soil supplement that effectively repels several types of vermin yet is not absorbed by plants thus offering a safe alternative to insecticides Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 39 \x0cHaving enjoyed commercial success locally Biota is looking into expanding its market internationally An IPO in Mexico would be a conventional choice However Biota\xe2\x80\x99s founders observe that investors in the Mexican stock market are overwhelmingly local in contrast raising on Stellar Classic would allow them to connect and engage investors in markets that they are hoping to break into Further thanks to its nature of a marketplace Stellar Classic would also allow Biota to connect with farmers in these markets their end consumers who browse the asset catalogues Innovators at heart they decide to give Stellar Classic a try Upon receiving their application we determine that Biota would make a valuable addition to our market and for our investors Still Biota founders are cautious They eventually settle on a raise against 15% of common stock which translate to 150 000 tokens with \xe2\x82\xac80 / share as the reserve price They also supply us with all materials to be made public in the auction to help investors decide on their investment including reports from an independent accounting firm outlining the financial outlook of Biota We go ahead and arrange the auction as usual Thanks to the growth potential that Biota has demonstrated and the exhaustive growth plan that it has proffered the auction ends with a share price of \xe2\x82\xac112 Using the Biota token Biota continually organizes investor polls and communicates its financial and strategic decisions Investors also receive dividends monthly Some farmers in Biota\xe2\x80\x99s target markets hear of this and become intrigued An increasing number of them start following Biota on Stellar Classic and some of them become investors This process keeps the Biota token liquid moreover it helps Biota build its brand in their new markets Stellar Classics Token White Paper | 40 \x0cOUR ROADMAP
