Initial Coin Offering (\xc2\xabICO\xc2\xbb) as presented by the DANEEL ASSISTANT company is an unregulated operation of fundraising There are many risks involved for customers especially the potential loss of the entirety of the currency exchanged for tokens emitted by DANEEL ASSISTANT Only persons warned of these risks are eligible to participate in the ICO Furthermore consumers (under the European directive n\xc2\xb02011/83/UE) the American people (under Regulation S\xe2\x80\x9d du Securities Act 1933 of American law ) citizens from Canada Cuba Iran Irak Syria Yemen North Korea Singapore and China are excluded from the ICO WWW DANEEL IO 4 \x0cWHITEPAPER A NOTE FROM DANEEL\xe2\x80\x99S FOUNDER First of all thank you for your interest in Daneel I hope that this document will enlighten you about our vision and our project Daneel is born from the passion of its creators for Blockchain and cryptocurrency in a changing world one in which the two technologies have a real role to play Our role is to democratize cryptocurrency in order to make it more accessible to mass market investors by proposing a thoughtful and innovative solution for them We are aware of the bad publicity linked to the notion of an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) over previous months mainly due to a lack of reliability in certain projects That\xe2\x80\x99s why even though the legislative framework is still developing we were determined to respect all basic responsibilities in legislation security and information We hope that you will therefore see this as guarantee of reliability and that you will believe in us and in Daneel We welcome your comments and suggestions at the email address joseph@daneel io Enjoy your reading and see you soon Joseph Bedminster Founder of Daneel Assistant Company WWW DANEEL IO 5 \x0cWHITEPAPER INTRODUCTION TO BLOCKCHAIN AND TO CRYPTOCURRENCY Blockchain a revolution in the making A real innovative tool which is about to profoundly transform our societies as well as the relationships between individuals organizations and states Blockchain represents a chain of \xe2\x80\x9cblocks\xe2\x80\x9d (digital containers) where information of all sorts is stored transactions contracts title deeds works of art\xe2\x80\xa6 This set of blocks form a database similar to the pages of a great accounts book known as a \xe2\x80\x9cregister\xe2\x80\x9d which is itself hosted by a group of network users Unlike the centralized system that currently governs our societies Blockchain primarily allows users to get away from a centralized body or a third party At the heart of this system special users called \xe2\x80\x9cminers\xe2\x80\x9d have the role of ensuring the validity of transactions by providing the entire network with the computing power of their computers Once the algorithm has completed its validation exercise all users of Blockchain can simply verify that the exercise is correct then when a large majority of Blockchain users have validated the computing operation the block is added to the chain and the transactions that it contains are considered valid Blockchain therefore includes the following advantageous characteristics \xe2\x80\xa2 Security The decentralized framework and the blocks\xe2\x80\x99 codes guarantee the absolute security of the information \xe2\x80\xa2 Disintermediation The concept of \xe2\x80\x9cconsensus\xe2\x80\x9d replaces any of centralized validation \xe2\x80\xa2 Autonomy The creation of cryptocurrency covers the costs of the infrastructure involved WWW DANEEL IO 6 \x0cWHITEPAPER By this revolutionary principle Blockchain is on the brink of causing a profound upheaval to all sectors of the economy and many related projects have already begun What is cryptocurrency Each Blockchain is associated with a cryptocurrency (also called a token) The most well known is the Bitcoin a currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 Today there are several hundred different digital currencies They all share the common trait of being a virtual means of exchange not based in any single state as opposed to the Dollar or the Euro They circulate via peer topeer networks based on cryptographic algorithms and are not necessarily intended as a payment system between users The number of units in circulation and the maximum money supply are defined in advance and visible to all Until proven otherwise cryptocurrency cannot be counterfeited or stolen It is possible today to define several separate families of cryptocurrency which are adapted to the objectives of the communities who use them \xc2\xa7 \xe2\x80\x9cInfrastructure\xe2\x80\x9d currency the type of currency likely to bring about the most profound changes whose ambition goes far beyond being a simple means of payment and which has the objective of offering a real alternative to the existing financial system Examples Ethereum NXT Ripple WWW DANEEL IO 7 \x0cWHITEPAPER \xc2\xa7 \xe2\x80\x9cSocial\xe2\x80\x9d currency currency created to allow the easy exchange of small financial amounts between web users (\xe2\x80\x9csocial tipping\xe2\x80\x9d) on existing social networks in particular \xc2\xa7 Alternative currency broadly inspired by Bitcoin these currencies attempt via technical innovation to function either more easily more securely or more rapidly for example by reducing transaction verification times o Examples Litecoin Digibyte \xc2\xa7 Anonymous currency currency created solely to serve as a purely anonymous means of payment protecting both the user\xe2\x80\x99s identity as well as their transactions o Examples Monero Bytecoin\xe2\x80\xa6 Exchanging cryptocurrency a speculative investment Cryptocurrencies are primarily an investment of potential profitably These alternative digital currencies represent in effect a new kind of investment intrinsically linked with our modern digital economy While extremely volatile they can demonstrate impressive financial performances Bitcoin exceeded a rate of 6 000 USD in October 2017 despite being traded at a rate of 434 USD in January 2016 Indeed it\xe2\x80\x99s because of cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s speculative nature that it attracts investors who generally appreciate the risky characteristics of this kind of market Speculation is rampant in the universe of cryptocurrency not only in regards to rate variation against the dollar but also regarding the financial operations that cryptocurrencies finance WWW DANEEL IO 8 \x0cWHITEPAPER Many investors are also in search of an asset to provide diversification to their portfolio and thus invest a small proportion of their assets with a view towards a long term gain Cryptocurrency can effectually provide for the needs of investors seeking to diversify their risks by turning toward alternative investments Accessing reactive and reliable sources of information a strategic challenge for the cryptocurrency investor A major concern for every investor having access to a comprehensive reliable and rapid source of information is a fundamental part of the decision making process in cryptocurrency investing With the development of the digital world and the increasing \xe2\x80\x9cdatafication\xe2\x80\x9d of our society information is becoming more and more immediately accessible to every individual through exchange platforms social media specialized print media television programs groups of influencers word of mouth and more Not a day goes by without being flooded with information In the face of such an inundation of data investors will inevitably encounter a number of difficulties WWW DANEEL IO 9 \x0cWHITEPAPER Cross referencing sources and analysing content to access reliable information Rumours and conflicting or manipulated information can significantly influence the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency for numerous investors In fact for many years digital and interactive means have bit by bit taken over all classic forms of communication media and non media and the Internet has come to be completely integrated in corporate marketing campaigns Furthermore the development of social networks favouring interaction between web users in an often anonymous manner has led each individual to post more and more often unavoidably leading to an increase in \xc2\xabmisinformation\xc2\xbb The Internet has thus become social movable and participative\xe2\x80\xa6 and today one tweet from an influential individual may have more of an impact on cryptocurrency rates than the actions of institutions themselves So to what extent can information concerning cryptocurrency be biased How can reliability be ensured so that the plethora of online information a user encounters does not jeopardize every one of their investments Capturing the right information at the right time amongst all available data As an investor the search for reliable information often resembles a complex quest how can we identify the limited number of good resources How can we sort them out How can we interpret this information in order to make informed decisions WWW DANEEL IO 10 \x0cWHITEPAPER In addition while certain investors may benefit from a lack of information others feel \xc2\xaboverwhelmed\xc2\xbb by the flow of available data and will inevitably find themselves exposed to an overabundance of information This phenomenon of overexposure will result in an alteration in decision making and a decline in investment performance Information encountered about investments needs to be sufficient without becoming overwhelming as well as easy and practical to use Capturing the emotions of the market The sheer amount of information available renders each investor more vulnerable to emotion when investing \xc2\xab Fear of Missing Out \xc2\xbb (FOMO) \xc2\xab Panic sell \xc2\xbb \xc2\xab Fear Uncertainty and Doubt \xc2\xbb (FUD) are several examples of the phenomena that can negatively influence the ability of investors to manage their emotions while making decisions This poor emotional management then leads to ill thought out short term actions including sudden changes in trading and investment strategies and the following of unfounded trends\xe2\x80\xa6 often at the expense of invested capital Benefiting from an appropriate level of knowledge and comprehension around cryptocurrency Understanding the details of Blockchain and cryptocurrency learning to trade mastering the fundamentals\xe2\x80\xa6 these are some of the many topics that each investor should know and understand But where can this information be found WWW DANEEL IO 11 \x0cWHITEPAPER The various tutorials available on the Internet come with a relatively high price tag and are often not sufficiently adapted to an individual\xe2\x80\x99s personal level The difficulty in managing multiple cryptocurrency portfolios Investors in cryptocurrency generally invest through exchange platforms chosen based on \xe2\x80\xa2 The number of cryptocurrencies listed \xe2\x80\xa2 The volume of exchanges present \xe2\x80\xa2 The fees charged by the platform \xe2\x80\xa2 The level of security and reliability \xe2\x80\xa2 The design and ergonomics Therefore it often happens that an investor is obliged to use several platforms to buy and sell the currencies they are interested in Managing these different platforms often involves multiple restrictions for the investor difficulty in following investment performances using different currencies slowness of services two step connections to platforms managing multiple sets of login details risking error during transfers between platforms\xe2\x80\xa6 as many situations within this sector require a high level of responsiveness this set up may prove dire for the investor WWW DANEEL IO 12 \x0cWHITEPAPER Our objective To design the first intelligent personal assistant who can accompany you in the daily management of cryptocurrency WWW DANEEL IO 13 \x0cWHITEPAPER Limits of existing personal assistant services Assistants (or \xe2\x80\x9cbots\xe2\x80\x9d) currently available on the market have many notable functional and technological limitations The present solutions are effectively confined to supplying information (the rate of a cryptocurrency information on the launch of an ICO newspaper articles\xe2\x80\xa6) through different channels of communication like Facebook and its \xe2\x80\x9cMessenger\xe2\x80\x9d application through \xe2\x80\x9cSlack\xe2\x80\x9d or even through \xe2\x80\x9cTelegram\xe2\x80\x9d Their use is also rarely user friendly as they often necessitate using predefined commands to carry out simple requests based around the recognition of set key words (\xc2\xab What is the price of BTC \xc2\xbb) These solutions respond only to a basic need using primitive artificial intelligence systems that are not able to \xc2\xa7 Understand and interpret natural human language \xc2\xa7 Analyse and select the most reliable information available \xc2\xa7 Interact in a relevant way in order to communicate the right trend at the right time WWW DANEEL IO 14 \x0cWHITEPAPER Our solution As we are fully aware of the limitations of these previous solutions we\xe2\x80\x99d like to suggest an assistant of a new kind a personal assistant based on Watson one of the most efficient artificial intelligences in the market who will be responsible for providing daily assistance in the world of cryptocurrency Through this you will have ready access to an intelligent counsellor able to \xc2\xa7 Understand and interact with you \xc2\xa7 Keep you informed in real time with quality information that he gathered and analysed himself \xc2\xa7 Identify and capture the different emotions of the market \xc2\xa7 Alert you as soon as one of your investments is in jeopardy \xc2\xa7 Facilitate easy portfolio follow up and management as well as ease of sales and purchases \xc2\xa7 Provide daily advice on your investments and on market trends \xc2\xa7 Provide personally tailored indicators This is the objective we have set for ourselves and you can help us to develop it What type of investor is Daneel suited for Daneel is not intended to address professional investors particularly those already involved in trading rooms Indeed these investors often rely on specialized and costly technologies often developed and jealously guarded by banks On the contrary we want to democratize access to artificial intelligence for investors by offering our technology to non professionals WWW DANEEL IO 15 \x0cWHITEPAPER To do this we have identified three mass market investor profiles beginner intermediate and advanced users WWW DANEEL IO 16 \x0cWHITEPAPER TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS The main technological stakes In order for Daneel to meet all the objectives that we have set we will have to address several factors on a daily basis Make full use of the power of \xc2\xab Natural Language Understanding \xc2\xbb Daneel will need to be able to understand your queries every time you turn to him regardless of spelling or sentence structure We will have to be confident of the ability of the system to analyse and understand the meaning of human language to perceive emotions and to correctly perform the relevant actions Guarantee the reliability of the information analysed and proposed by Daneel How can we in a world with a huge amount of sources of information (online newspapers forums social networks expert networks exchange platforms\xe2\x80\xa6) determine which sources are reliable so that information used is sure to be trustworthy and free from manipulation We currently make use of the superior skills of the Blockchain sector of specialized journalists and of specialized counsellors to bring together different informational WWW DANEEL IO 17 \x0cWHITEPAPER references The goal is to categorize these and then to determine reliability as well as which the method to employ for each source To gather together the mass of information within a sector is the first step but to analyse it is another one entirely To provide the requisite intelligence to the service it will be necessary to perfect the algorithm developed during the prototype design in order to consider all flows of information and give only the most suitable and reliable information to the user Offer personalized advice adapted to the needs of each nonprofessional investor profile As a personal assistant we want to make Daneel as personalised as possible for each user We would like to make each experience unique and aim to place Daneel in a position to provide the best possible advice to the user Our primary objective is user satisfaction That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have created the profiles of \xc2\xabnovice user\xc2\xbb \xc2\xabintermediate user\xc2\xbb and of \xc2\xabexperienced user\xc2\xbb Every user will therefore be able to take advantage of all the features they require while receiving an experience tailored to their level and to their expectations regarding information and control Ensure the security of all data How can we ensure the safety of your information How can we limit the risk of hacking attempts by outside third parties Important safety measures should be established between the user and the Daneel ecosystem The mobile application as well as the web platform will have to address important safety constraints and will therefore be frequently audited by external services and partners As for the architecture it must be hosted and secured by the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading specialists in the cloud and IT security WWW DANEEL IO 18 \x0cWHITEPAPER Our teams will endeavour to monitor the functioning of all services as well as questions asked and answers delivered in order to ensure the reliability of exchanges with the API of our ecosystem and those of our partners Relying on best practice in terms of ergonomics and design We attach great importance to offering the best user experience throughout the use of the Daneel service To do this we\xe2\x80\x99d like to refer to the best practices used in ergonomics and design during the development of each both the web and mobile interfaces and commit to an approach centred completely on the user WWW DANEEL IO 19 \x0cWHITEPAPER Presentation of Daneel\xe2\x80\x99s features STAY INFORMED Gather aggregate and analyse information The concept of curating is at the heart of Daneel To begin Daneel searches browses collects and analyses different sources of information available from various online channels news feeds general media specialized media and social networks Once the information is collected he sorts and categorizes all relevant data in order to only offer information deemed to be highly reliable You will then see in real time a summary of all necessary information concerning \xc2\xa7 The current rates of all your specified cryptocurrencies \xc2\xa7 Cryptocurrency news sorted by theme (technological legal partnerships\xe2\x80\xa6) \xc2\xa7 Different \xc2\xab Initial Coin Offering \xc2\xbb operations available Analyse the Emotions of the Market In addition to analysing and summarizing information we wish to allow Daneel to analyse the emotions of the market using a \xc2\xab Social Emotion Indicator \xc2\xbb function Our artificial intelligence collects messages posted on social networks then analyses them and conveys to the user the predominant online sentiments surrounding the cryptocurrency of their choice In this way you can more easily detect \xc2\xabpump\xc2\xbb or growing doubt surrounding a cryptocurrency and be up to date for every decision you make WWW DANEEL IO 20 \x0cWHITEPAPER In addition you can also benefit from indicators which identify which currencies are the most cited in news sources and on social networks as well as those most searched on Google Define a Cryptocurrency Confidence Score Our artificial intelligence will use a specially developed algorithm to calculate a \xc2\xab Confidence score \xc2\xbb by analysing currency rates recent events and the perceived emotions of users on social networks This score given out of 10 will reflect the reliability of a currency at a given moment It will give investors a good idea of the risk involved in an investment WWW DANEEL IO 21 \x0cWHITEPAPER Access to the detailed analytical report of cryptocurrency Need a comprehensive report on a currency Histories statistical data graphics company organisation important personnel recent events Find all this information in one document generated every day thanks to our artificial intelligence INTERACT Interact with Daneel thanks to our conversational service What could be an easier way of obtaining information than simply asking for it To get Daneel\xe2\x80\x99s analyses you only need to express a request WWW DANEEL IO 22 \x0cWHITEPAPER Artificial intelligence searches for the information best suited to your research and the results are then easily communicated to you Daneel may also offer quick choice actions in response to certain demands in order to help you save time Based on the \xe2\x80\x9cMachine Learning\xe2\x80\x9d principle the system will learn continuously the more users that pose questions the more it will be able to refine its answers and results that is the power of IBM\xe2\x80\x99s Watson artificial intelligence Never heard of Watson\xe2\x80\x99s power \xc2\xab Watson is an IBM designed computer system that applies advanced technologies for natural language processing information retrieval knowledge representation automated reasoning and automatic learning to the field of open ended question answering \xc2\xbb MANAGE YOUR PORTFOLIO Manage your

Indeed they will allow the user to \xe2\x80\xa2 Subscribe to a monthly service enabling the use of all Daneel features \xe2\x80\xa2 Interact with the platform and its users WWW DANEEL IO 32 \x0cWHITEPAPER Process of subscribing to the system Daneel\xe2\x80\x99s application and services will be accessible only to users registered on the platform Two types of subscription will be available Several subscription options may become available including monthly quarterly and annual subscriptions WWW DANEEL IO 33 \x0cWHITEPAPER Price of subscriptions and Payment We wish to offer a subscription with a fixed price that won\xe2\x80\x99t change with the DAN token price In other terms the price of the subscription will always be the same regardless of the rate of DAN on the exchange platforms As a reminder DAN tokens can be aquired \xe2\x80\xa2 By investing during the Initial Coin Offering phase \xe2\x80\xa2 By buying tokens on the exchange platforms that will trade DAN \xc2\xab Erosion \xc2\xbb mechanism Every time a user will pay for a subscription a principle of \xe2\x80\x9cerosion\xe2\x80\x9d will be applied to the token and 6% of the total number of DAN will be burned Ex John subscribes for a monthly subscription and pays 100 DAN Daneel put back 94 DAN on the market 6 DAN are burned WWW DANEEL IO 34 \x0cWHITEPAPER SALES PROCESS FOR DAN TOKENS Tokens made availible by

investors an intelligent assistant destined for the world of cryptocurrency Presentation of DAN tokens Daneel (DAN) tokens will only be used to subscribe to the intelligent assistant service proposed by \xc2\xab Daneel Assistant Company \xc2\xbb The total supply of DANEEL tokens is limited to 100 000 000 tokens Update After ICO some tokens will be burnt the total supply will evolve see more at https //medium com/@daneel_project/important announcement burning and distribution of unsold dan tokens286bd0061520 DAN token is not a security nor a financial asset It will not generate any revenue by itself They will be exchanged on different exchange platforms as soon as they are available Duration and progression of the sales process The sales process of DAN tokens will be carried out in two steps over December 2017 and January 2018 WWW DANEEL IO 35 \x0cWHITEPAPER \xe2\x80\xa2 A presale phase (or pre ICO) from 04 December 09h00 UTC to 08 December 2017 20h00 UTC \xe2\x80\xa2 A sale phase from January 29th 2018 09h00 UTC to March 5th 2018 20h00 UTC Initial distribution of the tokens For the 100 000 000 tokens created the distribution will be as following \xc2\xa7 60% of the tokens that is 60 000 000 will be put up for sale during the duration of Daneel commercial operation (pre \xe2\x80\x93ICO ICO) The tokens put for sale will be separated into two lots \xc2\xa7 A first lot of 1 000 000 of tokens sold during a presale that is 1% in total \xc2\xa7 A second lot of 59 000 000 of tokens sold during a sale open to the public that is 59 % in total WWW DANEEL IO 36 \x0cWHITEPAPER After the ICO we will burn 60% of all the unsold tokens and redistribute 40% of them proportionally to all our investors Unsold tokens What are the advantages of this distribution model 1 As you might already know the burning process allows a diminution of the total supply on the market and potentially contribute to an appreciation of the token price 2 This new distribution model allows our community to continue dominating the market with 56% of the Tokens holders 3 This new distribution model guarantee the liquidity on the market and the scalability of the project as our token will be the only way to subscribe and use Daneel\xe2\x80\x99s service 7 500 000 \xc2\xa7 7 5% of tokens that is will be preserved in reserve by the company These tokens could be sold in the future by lots in the case of the company needing supplementary funds to cover expenditure linked to service development Tokens will be held in Multisignature wallet Their sale as well as the underlying objective will be announced in advance on the Company\ s official website \xc2\xa7 20% of tokens that is 20 000 000 will be distributed to stakeholders (global team counsellors community) that have contributed actively to the success of the operation These tokens will be stored in a Multisignature wallet If a member of the team wants to sell its tokens the transactions will require the signatures of multiple team members before the funds can be transferred This process will allow the team to control the impacts on the token price WWW DANEEL IO 37 \x0cWHITEPAPER \xc2\xa7 5% of tokens that is 5 000 000 will be distributed to external investors of the enterprise The tokens reserved for external investors will be distributed between the different structures and investors that have supported and financed the development of the Daneel project \xc2\xa7 5% of tokens that is 5 000 000 will be distributed within the framework of the rewards program The tokens allocated to the rewards programs will be distributed to community members that have participated in the distribution communication advertisment or translation of the project on the networks \xc2\xa7 2 5% of tokens that is 2 500 000 will be distributed within the framework of the Product Social Rewards WWW DANEEL IO 38 \x0cWHITEPAPER Price and condition of acquisition of DAN tokens During the period of the DAN tokens sale tokens will
