Market and to bring an increased level of transparency and accountability to all markets In traditional businesses when companies receive investment and startup capital they are subject to an increased level of transparency and accountability Traditional businesses remain transparent and accountable to their investors and supporters by releasing quarterly statements working hand in hand with investors maintaining clear communication of road maps and timelines taking advice and input from investors and other applied tactics Each traditional company works di\xef\xac\x80erently but a common denominator that they all have is quarterly statements that inform their investors and supporters of their current \xef\xac\x81nancial standings This accountability and transparency is completely missing from the cryptocurrency space Nearly all cryptocurrency companies fail to produce quarterly statements and rely on their marketing team\xe2\x80\x99s tactics to convey the companies current standing to both their investors and the public This creates a transparency problem in the cryptocurrency space and makes it very di\xef\xac\x83cult to properly evaluate a cryptocurrency company The current method of XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 5 \x0cevaluating a cryptocurrency company is very subjective and leaves much room for interpretation The current method involves \xe2\x80\xa2 Examining the Team team members and advisors history \xe2\x80\xa2 Examining the technology offered by the company and predicting the impact that technology will have on the technology sector \xe2\x80\xa2 Evaluating the partnerships of the cryptocurrency company to determine how connected they are in the overall market \xe2\x80\xa2 Looking at the current market cap of the cryptocurrency and personal discernment to determine if that company is under/over valued compared to its market cap \xe2\x80\xa2 Examining the overall network traffic and number of transactions that occur on that cryptocurrency blockchain Each of these points are subjective and does not provide any concrete information pertaining to the financial health of a cryptocurrency company Xriba has developed a protocol accounting applications and various toolsets to address the ambiguity in evaluating cryptocurrency companies from a \xef\xac\x81nancial perspective Providing cryptocurrency companies and traditional companies alike a framework for remaining transparent and accountable to their investors supporters and the open market XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 6 \x0cXriba has developed an open accounting protocol called the \xe2\x80\x9cXriba Protocol\xe2\x80\x9d to record \xef\xac\x81nancial transaction records on a public decentralized ledger This is revolutionary for the accounting industry and creates a decentralized method for saving archiving and querying \xef\xac\x81nancial transaction records The Xriba Protocol includes an open API that allows any third party company to build their own accounting applications or tools on top of To support Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s vision of accountability and transparency in the cryptocurrency markets Xriba has become a founding member of TokenCheck Foundation TokenCheck is a decentralized foundation and brings many \xef\xac\x81nancial features that exist in the traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial markets to the cryptocurrency sector such as seed investment fund tiers team member and partner veri\xef\xac\x81cation and technological legal and compliance auditing TokenCheck has developed crowdsale smart contracts with a feature called \xe2\x80\x98Fund released milestones\xe2\x80\x99 into the smart contracts The fund release milestone smart contract feature will lock crowdsale funds up in milestones that are pre de\xef\xac\x81ned by each cryptocurrency company When a company completes a milestone the company will go through an auditing process to ensure the milestone is completed Once TokenCheck determines that the milestone is completed and delivered as the company outlined in their milestone roadmap a portion of the crowdsale funds will be released to the company This provides the company a runway to complete the next milestone while not releasing the entire sum of the crowdsale raise to the company in a single tier This process mimics traditional investment seed XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 7 \x0cfunding by releasing funds to the company in milestone theirs It also protects crowdsale contributors and investors alike by preventing companies from conducting \xe2\x80\x98money grabs\xe2\x80\x99 and failing to deliver on promised milestone deadline On top of the Xriba protocol Xriba has developed two state of the art bookkeeping applications called Mastrobook and Cryptobook Mastrobook caters to traditional businesses while Cryptobook is simply Mastrobook with additional features that cater to cryptocurrency businesses The Xriba applications use AI and OCR technology to enhance data entry speeds and decrease data entry by 72% Both applications include a web based dashboard in which users investors and company supporters can view company \xef\xac\x81nancial records examine expenditures and view the company\xe2\x80\x99s overall \xef\xac\x81nancial standing In the case of Cryptobook users will also have the ability to view the progression of the company in regards to the completion of milestones release of funds and details relating to milestone audits This gives Cryptobook users and inside look on the status and \xef\xac\x81nancial health of the cryptocurrency company both a technological and \xef\xac\x81nancial standpoint Xriba also has created XribaPay which automatically reconcile payments within Mastrobook and Cryptobook XribaPay is the \xef\xac\x81rst payment platform that allow companies to conduct \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions in both cryptocurrency and \xef\xac\x81at currency Xriba is a next generation accounting protocol that provides transparency accountability and bookkeeping services to cryptocurrency and traditional businesses XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 8 \x0cToken details XRA tokens power the usage of the Xriba Protocol and

70 10 \x0c2 Business Purpose The cryptocurrency and ICO boom have been a paradise for ICO start ups While traditional fundraising via venture capitalists is time intensive and at times bureaucratic the ICO paradigm allows large amounts of funds t o b e r a i s e d quickly with little transparency or accountability required by the ICO start up a phenomenon identified by many cryptocurrency professionals including Vitalik Buterin 1 leaders of crypto syndicates and many others The current ICO model allows ICO start ups to access all funds immediately after the fundraising process independent of any milestones reached or progress demonstrated Meanwhile the traditional venture capitalist model releases funds in tranches After each funding round progress is audited use of funds is analyzed and the product is reviewed When the milestone audit is successfully passed the next tranche of funds is released This loop continues over multiple funding rounds and keeps the team motivated and accountable for the funds they receive Contrast this with the current state of the cryptocurrency sector and its lack of transparency in how ICO funds are spent One could argue that raising funds from the public comes with great responsibility with regards t o transparency and accountability XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 11 \x0cAt Xriba we believe that bringing much needed transparency and accountability to the cryptocurrency space will help to professionalize and strengthen the sector We believe that the current ICO and funding model needs to mature to protect contributors keep ICO companies accountable and motivated long term Xriba has identi\xef\xac\x81ed several pillars of transparency and accountability 1 The milestone based release of funds The startup will no longer have immediate access to 100% of the raised funds Instead funds will be released based on milestones The startup proposes a milestone based release of funds based on the required budget to achieve each major milestone This fund release schedule is detailed in the startup\xe2\x80\x99s whitepaper and reviewed by the potential contributor during their due diligence process Xriba will provide milestone based smart contract templates and technical assistance for the startup to set this up correctly The smart contract is then audited to ensure its validity and immutability 2 Financial and technical audits When the startup announces to have reached a major milestone a \xef\xac\x81nancial and a technical audit are performed by an independent auditor The \xef\xac\x81nancial audit checks the e\xef\xac\x80ective use of funds and the technical audit checks the development progress based on the prede\xef\xac\x81ned milestones A positive audit score leads to the release of the next tranche of ICO funds A negative score triggers a \xe2\x80\x9cmilestone rede\xef\xac\x81nition\xe2\x80\x9d process during which the startup can request to change the schedule for funds to be released this request is then reviewed by the independent auditor In extreme cases when milestones were repeatedly missed or no signi\xef\xac\x81cant progress could be demonstrated the remaining funds are distributed back to the ICO contributors The refund process is a fail safe in case the startup was not realistic about its roadmap and milestones All \xef\xac\x81nancial and technical audits are published to provide full transparency XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 12 \x0c3 The Token Checker dashboard A dashboard is made available to the public by Xriba The Token Checker dashboard allows for \xe2\x80\xa2 Monitoring of all transactions spendings and potential revenues of the startup \xe2\x80\xa2 Monitoring of the startup\xe2\x80\x99s milestone history including all audit scores and detailed \xef\xac\x81nancial and technical audit reports for all past milestone Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s Token Checker dashboard will provide the public with much needed objective metrics to evaluate a startup\xe2\x80\x99s technical progress and \xef\xac\x81nancial integrity KYC of funding wallets AI based tagging of transactions as well as OCR technology for invoice/receipt scanning are applied for maximum transparency while minimizing the startup\xe2\x80\x99s time spent for bookkeeping 4 The TokenCheck Foundation Xriba is the founding member of the non pro\xef\xac\x81t TokenCheck Foundation and will deploy considerable resources to its creation TokenCheck is a group of organizations dedicated and able to bring accountability and transparency to the cryptocurrency sector TokenCheck will provide a wide range of services and products such as standardized due diligence checks on the team partners and advisors or run technical and \xef\xac\x81nancial milestone audits Startups that are willing to be transparent and accountable for the publicly raised funds can decide to become a Partner of TokenCheck at any point in time Fees for the services provided are fair and transparent Furthermore TokenCheck will publically reach out to startups to \xef\xac\x81nd out if they are willing to be transparent and accountable for the publicly raised funds Each startup\xe2\x80\x99s decision yes or no is published on the TokenCheck Foundation website XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 13 \x0cThe second generation of ICOs based on the four pillars will be more transparent have more engaged teams and will have more objective metrics about the startups\xe2\x80\x99 progress This will lead to more confidence more sustainable growth and a strengthening of the overall sector Xriba will lead by example by being the first Partner of the TokenCheck Foundation XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 14 \x0c3 Problems Addressed 3 1 Fund Release Process The traditional funding process involves transparency and accountability at every turn Typically when venture capitalist funds or angel investors invest in a company funds are released over time as the start up reaches milestones In addition traditional companies often work together with their seed investors becoming completely transparent about expenses and expenditures that they incur along the way The investors may not have a say in what the company spends their \xef\xac\x81nances on but they are aware of the expenditure If a traditional company misses a milestone then their funding is pulled or withheld until they hit the milestone or a new milestone agreement is made and the company is back on track One could argue that raising funds from the public comes with the responsibility of being transparent with and accountable for these raised funds However the cryptocurrency space is completely lacking this milestone based funding process The current model of ICO start ups is to seek out funding from friends and close circles (private presale) then seek out a signi\xef\xac\x81cant portion of their funding from the public in an ICO (public pre sale and public ICO) This process is positive in many ways for example it entails much less bureaucracy and faster access to funds However an aspect that has proven to be a weakness of the current ICO model is that ICO start ups have access to 100% of the funds raised immediately after ICO completion At no point does a start up require full access to 10 million 30 million or even 50 million US dollars XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 15 \x0cHaving access to large funds can lead to improper spending increased burn rates lack of motivation and progress as well as a plethora of other problems Xriba has developed a milestone based fund release system via Ethereum smart contracts that keep companies accountable for their planned milestones When ICO start ups use Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s milestone based smart contracts they can propose a fund release schedule in the white paper based on their milestone timeline and projected funds required to achieve said milestones In this way a company can strategically plan out how much funding they would need to reach each milestone The public reviews this schedule and writes it into a smart contract which is then audited by an independent auditor When the start up successfully reaches a milestone more funds are released to fuel the company to reach the next milestone Start ups which utilize this milestone based smart contract will have the best intentions for both the start up and the ICO contributors 3 2 Transparency We de\xef\xac\x81ne transparency as the right of the public to receive information about the use of ICO funds and the progress of the project provided in a way that is open to all for veri\xef\xac\x81cation In traditional business companies work together with their seed investors to ensure that they are not incurring any unnecessary expenditure The traditional model has the seed investors very much involved with the company and aware of its inner workings This process should be mirrored when funds are raised from the public Currently expenditure and the \xef\xac\x81nancial standing of ICO start ups are unknown to the public and ICO contributors Methods of evaluating cryptocurrency start ups are based on the team advisors technology and XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 16 \x0cplanned roadmaps are largely speculative and lack the concrete information needed to assess a company\ s progress and success Xriba provides the public with the Token Checker dashboard allowing ICO contributors and interested parties to properly evaluate and assess the start up\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81nancial standing Traditional and cryptocurrency companies will use Xriba to record revenue and expenditure for the public to assess Of course there are privacy control features available to protect sensitive company data Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s AI based Token Checker allows for full transparency of the ICO start up expenses and \xef\xac\x81nancial standing XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 17 \x0c3 3 Accountability Accountability is the obligation of an individual or organization to account for its activities accept responsibility and disclose the results transparently It also includes responsibility for capital or other entrusted property Arguably being accountable for funds collected from the public is a moral responsibility for ICO start ups This entails \xe2\x80\xa2 Accounting for business activities in a speci\xef\xac\x81c time frame i e between two de\xef\xac\x81ned project milestones \xe2\x80\xa2 Accounting for the use of the funds \xe2\x80\xa2 Allowing independent audits to access data on the progress made \xe2\x80\xa2 Allowing independent audits to assess the use of funds Xriba has developed products to bring accountability from the traditional business world to the cryptocurrency sector with the help of smart contracts \xe2\x80\xa2 By establishing milestone based ICO funds release token sale companies are obliged to regularly demonstrate e\xef\xac\x83cient use of funds and real world progress \xe2\x80\xa2 By utilizing Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s milestone based smart contracts start ups are less inclined to alter milestones and make ambitious promises that cannot be ful\xef\xac\x81lled in the timeframe given by the company \xe2\x80\xa2 In extreme cases in which milestones are repeatedly missed or signi\xef\xac\x81cant progress could not be demonstrated the remaining ICO funds can be distributed back to the ICO contributors XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 18 \x0c3 4 Costs Efficiency and Speed In business and cryptocurrency a lot of time is wasted on \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions and accounting Using banking services accessing online banking entering bene\xef\xac\x81ciaries data balancing and managing invoice payments salaries and expenses Time dedicated to the administrative aspects of business represents an unnecessary cost for the company that can today be greatly reduced by applying relevant technology such as OCR AI and blockchain Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s accounting solution is already used by over 10 000 clients seamlessly integrating with corporate IT systems combining all accountancy needs Furthermore Xriba allows businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments To truly globalize blockchain and cryptocurrency traditional businesses must be able to easily accept cryptocurrency in exchange for their product or service But current accounting software does not allow this level of \xef\xac\x82exibility especially when it comes to reporting which has blocked most businesses from accepting cryptocurrency Xriba now provides a purpose built corporate cryptocurrency wallet in which accounts can be balanced and crypto transactions can be made in values equal to \xef\xac\x81at currencies There are multiple bene\xef\xac\x81ts for businesses accepting cryptocurrency transactions between companies can now happen within minutes rather than days international business payments can be done at a fraction of the cost and speed and of course consumers can pay for products and services in cryptocurrency thereby opening up the payment stream of the future XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 19 \x0c4 The Solution In this chapter the four pillars of accountability and transparency will be described Furthermore a simple process will be outlined to establish accountability and transparency in a sustainable way 3 1 The Four Pillars of Transparency and Accountability (T&A) Pillar 1 Milestone based funds release 1 To foster accountability funds collected during ICO are distributed to the company in tranches rather than in full and linked to milestone achievement 2 A schedule detailing milestones and the amount of funding to be released will be proposed by the company raising the funds and detailed in the white paper 3 The fund release schedule is reviewed by the community 4 The fund release schedule is written into the ICO smart contract Xriba will provide smart contract templates and assistance for the start up to set up their milestone based fund release smart contract technically 5 Templates and technical assistance will be provided 6 The milestone based fund release smart contract will be audited before the ICO ensure its validity and immutability 7 After the ICO when the company indicates that a milestone has been reached a technical and \xef\xac\x81nancial audit is performed before the next tranche of funding is released XRIBUM LTD www xriba com 20 | 70 \x0cPillar 2 Financial and technical audit reports 1 There are many complaints about the lack of objective metrics to evaluate performance and progress of companies in the blockchain sector 2 Independent audit reports will provide an objective source of information about companies and their progress 3 A \xef\xac\x81nancial and technical audit will be performed by an independent auditor when a company indicates that a prede\xef\xac\x81ned milestone has been reached 4 Both audits will be scored on a scale of 0 to 100 5 Achieving a score of 80 and above will unlock the next tranche of ICO funds according to the fund release schedule 6 When both audits have been successfully passed the next tranche of ICO funding is released 7 A score under 80 does not release the next tranche of funds and triggers the milestone rede\xef\xac\x81nition process during which the start up can request a change to the time frame in which funds are released 8 In extreme cases when milestones have repeatedly been missed or no signi\xef\xac\x81cant progress could be demonstrated funds are distributed back to ICO contributors 9 All \xef\xac\x81nancial and technical audit results will be published to provide full transparency to the public Pillar 3 The Token Checker Dashboard 1 There is a lack of transparency about ICO start ups in the cryptocurrency space 2 The public needs objective metrics about the technical progress and \xef\xac\x81nancial standing of ICO start ups as well as their progress and audit history 3 Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s Token Checker Dashboard is a solution to provide the community with much needed real time transparency for the companies\xe2\x80\x99 \xef\xac\x81nancial standing and technical progress It records milestone history including all audit scores and detailed \xef\xac\x81nancial and technical audit reports XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 21 \x0c4 Several technologies are applied \xe2\x80\xa2 Blockchain Recording company transactions spending and potential revenues on the public ledger \xe2\x80\xa2 Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence Automatically tags corporate transactions based on machine learning algorithms \xe2\x80\xa2 Mechanical Turk Supports and optimizes the automated AI tagging process by providing human feedback \xe2\x80\xa2 OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Automatically detects the content of invoices receipts etc \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralized Wallet A corporate cryptocurrency wallet which can be accessed via a smartphone \xe2\x80\xa2 KYC \xe2\x80\xa2 All while minimizing the start up\xe2\x80\x99s accounting cost The Token Checker Dashboard shows the startup\xe2\x80\x99s milestones and progress as well as all audit scores and past audit reports XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 22 \x0cPillar 4 The TokenCheck Foundation 1 Along with many others Xriba has identi\xef\xac\x81ed a lack of transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency market and has acted by becoming a founding member of the TokenCheck Foundation and will deploy considerable resources for its creation 2 The purpose of the TokenCheck Foundation is to provide products and services to establish transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency space 3 The TokenCheck Foundation is a collection of organizations dedicated and quali\xef\xac\x81ed to bring transparency and accountability to the cryptocurrency space 4 The TokenCheck Foundation will work together with cryptocurrency companies and provide independent third party \xef\xac\x81nancial milestone audits (technical and \xef\xac\x81nancial) smart contract templates technical and strategic support about milestone strategy team and partner background checks as well various other services for ICO start ups 5 Xriba dedicates its resources and uses its technology to provide the TokenCheck Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s main products and services with the aim of bringing transparency and accountability protect cryptocurrency users and ultimately strengthen the blockchain space by reaching out to startups to ask whether they are willing to be transparent with and accountable for publicly raised funds Any start up can join the TokenCheck Foundation at any point For example Xriba will power \xef\xac\x81nancial transparency for clients of the TokenCheck Foundation and will provide smart contract templates for milestone based ICO funds release 6 Each start up\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether yes or no is published on the TokenCheck Foundation website and fees for the services provided are fair and transparent XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 23 \x0c3 2 The Transparency & Accountability Process The Transparency & Accountability Process is a straightforward series of steps The di\xef\xac\x80erent steps require either the start up Xriba or the TokenCheck Foundation to perform a prede\xef\xac\x81ned task The graphic below outlines the mandatory steps for all TokenCheck Foundation clients to guarantee minimum levels of transparency and accountability Additional TokenCheck Foundation services such as insuring ICO funds and life insurance for the ICO leadership team as well as various other services are optional The Transparency & Accountability Process XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 24 \x0cSigning the Transparency Agreement The company signs the TokenCheck Foundation Transparency & Accountability agreement and therefore agrees to carry out all steps of the Transparency & Accountability Process Legal & Compliance Auditing The TokenCheck Foundation will double check legal opinions provided by the start up or provide legal opinions to ensure that \xe2\x80\xa2 The Company is going to be compliant with the rules of the country in which it is going to operate \xe2\x80\xa2 That the tokens that it is going to issue are compliant with authority regulations The team Advisor & Partner Verification Each team member business partner and all o\xef\xac\x83cial advisors will be individually veri\xef\xac\x81ed by the TokenCheck Foundation upon joining The TokenCheck Foundation will reach out and verify everyone using KYC protocols and open communication The results of the veri\xef\xac\x81cation process will be made public for the community to see Fund Release Plan Before the ICO begins each company working with the TokenCheck Foundation will con\xef\xac\x81gure the company milestones and funds to be released upon completion of each milestone (fund release schedule) This is done in the same way that a company con\xef\xac\x81gures token allocation or ICO allocation that is displayed on many company\xe2\x80\x99s ICO pages and white papers XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 25 \x0cThe start up will evaluate what percentage of ICO funds are required to complete each milestone Once the fund allocation per milestone is decided by the start up either the start up alone or the start up along with assistance from the TokenCheck Foundation will implement the milestone and fund parameters into the ICO smart contract (milestone based fund release smart contract) Milestone based fund release smart contract Writing secure smart contracts is an obstacle for many cryptocurrency companies They struggle locating developers who can write them then after the smart contract is written there is the hurdle of locating a reputable third party to audit the smart contract code The TokenCheck Foundation will provide several smart contract templates that are pre approved and will lay the groundwork for a company to structure their ICO These smart contract templates will have the fundrelease milestone and refund mechanisms built into them so that start ups can easily con\xef\xac\x81gure their milestones to release the appropriate amount of funds required for each milestone This ensures that the milestone achievement has been completed and that the funds required for the next stage of development will be released Fund Release Smart Contract Auditing To protect ICO participants and the company alike each ICO smart contract will be subject to stringent audit and review procedures to ensure the safety and security of the smart contract The TokenCheck Foundation will audit these smart contracts to ensure that there are no \xe2\x80\x98backdoors\xe2\x80\x99 that the fund milestone release mechanism is appropriately implemented and that the refund mechanism is in place to protect the ICO contributors The smart contract audit will be performed by the TokenCheck Foundation XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 26 \x0cICO The start up then performs an ICO based on the audited milestone based fund release smart contract Development After the ICO the startup begins or continues the development process Transparency Setup To ensure transparency there is a necessary set up process with the following guidelines 1 Only directors and delegates are permitted to spend ICO funds 2 Individuals that are allowed to spend ICO funds need to KYC 3 The KYC data is linked to speci\xef\xac\x81c ICO wallets and debit cards that the individuals have access to 4 All expenses from ICO funds need to be supported by a document (receipt invoice etc ) One time Transparency Setup steps 1 The company uploads the required KYC documents to the Xriba app certi\xef\xac\x81cate of incorporation memorandum of association registration of members registration of directors (documents vary by country) 2 Additionally all directors and delegates that have the right to make payments from the start up ICO wallet(s) will have to perform a KYC process 3 KYC veri\xef\xac\x81cation will be performed by the TokenCheck Foundation 4 The company will then connect the corporate wallets to KYC\xe2\x80\x99d directors and delegates in the Xriba app Again only directors or delegates have the right to make payments from the business wallet XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 27 \x0c5 When payments are done from one of the ICO wallets the user is asked by the Xriba app to provide/upload a document that justi\xef\xac\x81es the payment (invoice receipt contract etc ) 6 OCR and AI based auto tagging will be applied to the provided documentation to make this process simple and quick 7 In the same way the company will also have a debit card for each KYC\xe2\x80\x99d director or delegate When payment is made from a debit card the user will be asked to upload a \xef\xac\x81le that justi\xef\xac\x81es the payment 8 The receipt can be easily uploaded by taking a picture in the Xriba smartphone app 9 The company can reconcile payments with documents that justify the expenses until the next milestone audit 10 The Xriba app shows all payments that need to be reconciled This view is also available to ICO contributors 11 For the company to pass the \xef\xac\x81nancial audit at each milestone all payments must be reconciled with a supporting document Milestone Audit 1 When a milestone is completed the company will contact the TokenCheck Foundation and request a review of the next milestone funds to be released 2 The TokenCheck Foundation will have a committee composed of three members (one legal one \xef\xac\x81nancial one technical) and will conduct an audit on the milestone to ensure that the promised technology and other requirements are complete 3 The TokenCheck Foundation will give the company a score on a scale of 0 100 based on how much of the milestone was ful\xef\xac\x81lled 4 If the company scores below 80 then the funds will not be released until the company can complete a score of 80 or higher 5 After each review a detailed audit report will be published This will provide both the start up and the general public with independent information about the audit results XRIBUM LTD www xriba com 28 | 70 \x0cMilestone Redefinition 1 If a milestone is missed the Company can contact The TokenCheck Foundation to change the milestone program and request a di\xef\xac\x80erent time frame for funds to be released (Milestone Rede\xef\xac\x81nition) 2 The TokenCheck Foundation will conduct an audit of the roadmap and progress achieved For start ups it is normal and sometimes expected to change plans as experience and learning increases Rede\xef\xac\x81ning milestones can be a normal part of a start ups progress 3 If all signs show that the start up is well meaning and dedicated to creating value a Milestone Rede\xef\xac\x81nition is accepted 4 After each rede\xef\xac\x81nition a detailed list of reasons why the milestone rede\xef\xac\x81nition was approved or not will be published This will provide both the start up and the ICO contributors with information as to why the milestones were rede\xef\xac\x81ned Technical Audit The start up actively informs the TokenCheck Foundation when a milestone is reached 1 Once a company reaches a milestone on the roadmap the technological achievements of that milestone will be evaluated For example a company states that by the start of a given month they will have completed a beta wallet test net and a dashboard with several prede\xef\xac\x81ned features will be evaluated on these aspects 2 If the technical audit \xef\xac\x81nds that the technology is indeed what the company promised to achieve then the next tranche of ICO funding is released for the achievement of the next milestone This ensures that start ups remain transparent and that the technology released is indeed what the start up promised to release 3 By performing technology audits at each milestone we can prevent start ups from marketing a vision with unrealistic timelines and projections XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 29 \x0cThe technology audit will keep companies accountable for the milestones they published during the ICO Financial Audit When a milestone is reached a \xef\xac\x81nancial audit of the \xef\xac\x81nancial standing of the start up is performed 1 Xriba will provide apps and dashboards to allow companies to easily record their company expenditures income and \xef\xac\x81nancial holdings the same way traditional businesses would use software such as QuickBooks\xe2\x93\x87 to log the start up\xe2\x80\x99s bookkeeping 2 This software will log all company transactions on the blockchain connecting each payment with an accounts document (invoice receipt etc ) creating an auditable and veri\xef\xac\x81able \xef\xac\x81nancial record of the start up that can be viewed and evaluated in the same way a traditional company will release quarterly \xef\xac\x81nancial statements outlining their company\ s \xef\xac\x81nancial standing 3 This process ensures that funds raised from the public are spent responsibly Funds Release 1 The fund release schedule is proposed by the ICO start up 2 The start up announces that it has reached a prede\xef\xac\x81ned milestone 3 A \xef\xac\x81nancial and technical audit is performed both are scored on a scale of 0 100 4 If the company scores below 80 for either audit then the funds will not be released until the start up can either complete the technical milestones or justify its \xef\xac\x81nancial spending with supporting documents 5 A score of 80 and higher releases the funds for the next milestone 6 For the funds to be released there must be three signatures on the Smart Contract transaction The \xef\xac\x81rst signer is the \xef\xac\x81nancial auditor the XRIBUM LTD www xriba com 30 | 70 \x0csecond signer is the technical auditor and the third signer is the ICO startup Milestone Dispute 1 If the start up requests the next milestone funding release but the milestone is not reached or was reached but not approved for any reason the company will have an opportunity to dispute the decision 2 The start up will have an open hearing with the TokenCheck Foundation and can state their case as to why the milestone was not reached or why they believe that the milestone achievements should be approved 3 The dispute hearings are in place to protect the start up holding the ICO so that circumstances surrounding missed milestones can be openly discussed Underestimating development e\xef\xac\x80orts and strategic changes in direction are part of the development process of a startup 4 The TokenCheck Foundation will work with the start up to restructure the milestone funding schedule and/or release the appropriate funds as well as grant the start up more time to complete the milestone 5 The Company will have 3 opportunities to ask for a milestone rede\xef\xac\x81nition If the third rede\xef\xac\x81nition is disallowed the fail safe procedure of the smart contract will activate the and the remaining ICO funds will be distributed back to ICO contributors XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 31 \x0c5 The TokenCheck Foundation This chapter will outline the purpose products and services as well as the membership and fee structure of the TokenCheck Foundation 5 1 Purpose The purpose of the TokenCheck Foundation is to bring the same accountability and transparency that is present in traditional business to the cryptocurrency space The TokenCheck Foundation will work together with cryptocurrency start ups and provide independent third party auditing as well as many other services to provide an environment in which they can safely reach their planned milestones At the same time the TokenCheck Foundation protects ICO contributors via the milestonebased ICO model 5 2 Products and Services When a company decides to hold an ICO and joins the TokenCheck Foundation the \xef\xac\x81rst task of the TokenCheck Foundation will be to verify XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 32 \x0cthat all the team members partners and advisors are legitimate and are involved in the capacity that the company portrays The TokenCheck Foundation will aid companies in structuring ICO smart contracts milestone fund release con\xef\xac\x81guration and smart contract reviews to ensure that companies hold not only the best interest of the start up but also of the contributors from who they are raising funds TokenCheck Foundation will o\xef\xac\x80er 1 Team Member Partner and Advisor Veri\xef\xac\x81cation 2 Company Legal and Compliance Auditing 3 Smart Contract Templates 4 Smart Contract Technical Assistance 5

organizations that are dedicated bringing products services and/or manpower and are XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 33 \x0cquali\xef\xac\x81ed to bring transparency and accountability to the cryptocurrency space Types of companies that may become members include but are not limited to \xe2\x80\xa2 Financial auditing companies \xe2\x80\xa2 Law \xef\xac\x81rms \xe2\x80\xa2 KYC companies \xe2\x80\xa2 Smart Contract development and auditing companies \xe2\x80\xa2 Technical auditing companies \xe2\x80\xa2 Insurance companies \xe2\x80\xa2 Marketing \xef\xac\x81rms \xe2\x80\xa2 Crypto funds \xe2\x80\xa2 Venture Capitalists A company can apply to become a Corporate Member via the TokenCheck Foundation website Being a Corporate Member allows an organization to provide products and services that help crypto start ups to be more transparent and accountable Corporate members are required to purchase and hold 50 000 XRA in the organization\xe2\x80\x99s wallet as a Membership Holding If the organization wishes to leave the TokenCheck Foundation the Corporate Member will return the Membership Holding and receive the corresponding value in ETH Partners Partners are ICO start ups that wish to be transparent and accountable about their ICO funds These are start ups that hold the best interests of ICO contributors and strive for transparency in their \xef\xac\x81nancial standings technological advancements team members partners advisors etc The TokenCheck Foundation will aid Partners in the conduction of ICO and help clients remain transparent and accountable throughout the achievement of milestones XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 34 \x0cIndividual Members Individual Members are individuals (contributors and/or members of the public) that wish to stay informed about Partner\xe2\x80\x99s progress and transparency Individual Members will have access to features and information that is not available to the general public This information includes but is not limited to \xe2\x80\xa2 Detailed milestone reviews of Partners \xe2\x80\xa2 Push noti\xef\xac\x81cations of milestone review publications \xe2\x80\xa2 Access to dispute details of Partners \xe2\x80\xa2 Access to view and explore the \xef\xac\x81nancial standings of Partner The TokenCheck Foundation will implement push noti\xef\xac\x81cations in email format SMS format and other formats to give \xef\xac\x81rst notice to its Members that a milestone review or rede\xef\xac\x81nition has been published This is in place to give TokenCheck Foundation members notice as soon as a review is published so they can act accordingly with regards the content published in the milestone review The TokenCheck Foundation understands that the reviews will be made public however the advantage of membership is \xef\xac\x81rst notice regarding published Milestone Reviews To become an Individual Member the individual can register on the TokenCheck Foundation platform This process involves the individual contributing a membership deposit of roughly USD 25 00 This deposit is converted to an index of the TokenCheck Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s Corporate Member tokens A user can sell the token holdings at any time to recoup the $25 00 membership fee if the user wishes to discontinue the membership If an individual no longer holds the required number of Corporate Members tokens then the individual\xe2\x80\x99s membership will be revoked The individual can repurchase the tokens in a single click using the TokenCheck Foundation platform thereby reinstating their membership XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 35 \x0c5 4 Fees When a start up becomes a TokenCheck Foundation Partner the company will go through a vetting process during which the TokenCheck Foundation will review the company\xe2\x80\x99s corporate set up team partners advisors and milestone structure Based on the information collected a fee will be proposed that will be in line with the number of services and the complexity of the projected milestone process For example a start up with three team members two advisors one partner and three milestones will require less consultation and auditing time compared to a company that has \xef\xac\x81fteen team members eight advisors four partners and ten milestones XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 36 \x0c6 Xriba Xriba is the new standard for financial integrity promoting continuity and accountability by utilizing blockchain technology Xriba is a universal protocol that allows transaction rules and all payments to be registered all written within the blockchain The service offered to the end user will be a multi featured dashboard that includes itemized company financial records auditing Xriba integrates bookkeeping payments and a corporate wallet for both traditional and blockchain companies For cryptocurrency startups it will include a step by step status regarding milestone progress provide access to view audit details and company ratings at each milestone and perform analyses on company\xe2\x80\x99s usage of funds and more Xriba provides a decentralized accounting protocol in which companies can record their accounting activity Companies can also build custom applications on the accounting protocol or use Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s ready made accounting applications built into the Xriba Protocol 6 1 Motivation The project stems from the apparent lack of transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency sector Gianluca Massini Rosati the CEO has experience in the business tax consulting sector an entrepreneur in Fintech energy real estate mentoring with a strong emphasis in his belief of \xef\xac\x81nancial transparency across all sectors Gianluca is often seen on Italian television and is viewed as the number one tax expert in Italy by the XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 37 \x0cItalian media His business group spans \xef\xac\x81ve countries employing over 150 people in more than 20 companies bringing his 10 000 strong client base to the Xriba Protocol Gianluca is dedicated to using his knowledge and expertise to strengthen the cryptocurrency sector help protect ICO contributors and support ICO start ups in being more transparent and accountable in their key early development 6 2 Features OCR Technology OCR (Optical Character Recognition)= accounts automation Thanks to optical scanning software automatically reading and processing invoices and documents the time used for payments will be slashed by 72% every year With the OCR system Xriba will automatically be able to detect and read invoices storing and archiving them by expiry date by learning over time A business owner can simply scan invoices receipts and other \xef\xac\x81nancial documents to have the documents automatically entered into the bookkeeping software saving the user hours of time performing data entry tasks The optical reader is based on OCR and IDR technology The document is put through a preliminary procedure to improve the document quality therefore increasing the likelihood of it identifying and recognizing characters In this initial processing phase it carries out the following actions 1 Separates consecutive pages 2 Automatically detects page orientation 3 Corrects misaligned images 4 Realigns text 5 Corrects trapezoid distortion 6 Corrects image resolution XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 38 \x0c7 Detects page borders 8 Whitens the page background 9 Removes blurring 10 Heightens color contrast in the document The next step is to correctly identify individual characters therefore correctly identifying words To give an example The Xriba software can identify \xe2\x80\x98ACME Inc\xe2\x80\x99 but is not able to understand that \xe2\x80\x98ACME Inc\xe2\x80\x99 is metadata belonging to the \xe2\x80\x98vendor\xe2\x80\x99 (for example) to do this you need IDR (Intelligent Document Recognition) Then the concept of Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence begins Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence is a series of algorithms helping the software correctly identify the metadata needed for the type of document (whether a purchase supplier vendor data invoice document total etc ) IDR involves multiple engines as well as a Machine Learning system 1 Layout Analysis Engine 2 Logic Engine 3 Semantic Engine 4 Statistic Engine The \xef\xac\x81rst of these three is also the primary engine to be used in OCR systems helping to identify and extract metadata from forms The way it works is simple it is a system of rules that \xe2\x80\x98tells\xe2\x80\x99 batch to extract the characters it recognizes from \xe2\x80\x98XX\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98YY\xe2\x80\x99 coordinates However this system is adapted only to standard forms The second engine helps to identify Metadata requested through the LOGIC rules Invoices are the most straightforward case the document total should be the sum of the total income plus tax With both the above and logical rules the SYS can improve the probability of having correctly identi\xef\xac\x81ed the metadata XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 39 \x0cA further series of engines are then applied the Semantic Engine is interlinked with a Natural Language Processing system which works to correctly identify and understand the written language with the help of the SYS to unequivocally de\xef\xac\x81ne an object that can represent a written word The SYS recognizes the document type \xe2\x80\x98supplier invoice\xe2\x80\x99 or the words \xe2\x80\x98purchase invoice\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98debit note\xe2\x80\x99 though of course this is not its only function Finally by each word or group of words a Statistics Engine identi\xef\xac\x81es the probability that this is representative of the metadata that needs to be identi\xef\xac\x81ed and taking that into consideration o\xef\xac\x80ers the user the data that with the greatest probability corresponds to the Metadata that was requested in the batch The document total is a concrete example of how an AI system can correctly use these tools to identify Metadata an \xe2\x80\x98anchoring\xe2\x80\x99 system is usually used in which it identi\xef\xac\x81es a keyword within the document (typically the description of the Metadata sought) and requests that the system search in its immediate vicinity for a value that contains those speci\xef\xac\x81ed properties Therefore the SYS could be instructed that the document total metadata is a numeric value characterized by a separator for thousands \xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x80\x99 and decimals \xe2\x80\x98 \xe2\x80\x99 (Logic Engine) which typically is found at the foot of the document (Layout Engine) in the immediate vicinity of \xe2\x80\x98total\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98document total\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98total to pay\xe2\x80\x99 etc (Semantic Engine) and should correspond to the sum of the metadata \xe2\x80\x98total tax\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98total taxable income\xe2\x80\x99 (Logic Engine) Based on these properties the AI system identi\xef\xac\x81es with what probability the data under analysis mirrors the requested metadata and contrasts it with possibilities from the other analyses presenting the user with data that has the greatest probability of being the requested metadata This is a simpli\xef\xac\x81ed example to explain how IDR works XRIBUM LTD www xriba com 40 | 70 \x0cResearch can be broken down into 3 types \xef\xac\x81rstly in structured research the document type and the metadata that should be contained within the document is clear to the system In semi structured research the type of document is obvious but the metadata may or may not be there With non structured research the document type is not listed and nor is any metadata held This is where the Machine Learning System steps in which by employing algorithms creates rules autonomously (one of those above for example) for that speci\xef\xac\x81c metadata (Semantic Logic Layout) In this case a person must identify the metadata to the SYS Often in a real life case the rules are linked to the supplier so \xef\xac\x81rst it identi\xef\xac\x81es the supplier then according to this information applies rules to identify other metadata The Optical Reading System allows Mastrobook to reduce human in\xef\xac\x82uence in data by using devices with over 70% taking from 3 minutes to 35 seconds on average to record a mechanical Turk incident The Mastrobook System has been conceived to carry out accounts validation with the highest level of automation possible with technology currently available on the market Considering this when discussing accounts there is a need to bear in mind that it is a process that cannot always be standardized that involves thousands of di\xef\xac\x80erent records and a wide a range of rules For this reason Mastrobook is designed to include various types of users in the process to guarantee quality of service while gradually reducing the need for human intervention Therefore 1 A User who is not quali\xef\xac\x81ed can work within the Mastrobook validating and integrating metadata identi\xef\xac\x81ed by the Optical Reader 2 A quali\xef\xac\x81ed accountant validates and integrates the information generated by the Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence system 3 Finally an accountant valuates KPIs provided by Mastrobook and based on this provides a tailor made consultation service to the client XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 41 \x0cAI Technology The focus is to help to lower the total operational risk of human error with regards document misinterpretation applying Text Analysis (Semantic Engine) after the Image Document Recognition phase Convolutional Neural Networks are very powerful non linear machine learning models that could easily reach tens of millions of parameters which are hard to train and use in real world scenarios They set new standards for accuracy in classi\xef\xac\x81cation tasks but cannot be put forward as the best general method for classi\xef\xac\x81cation especially considering that their training time is very long (5 6 days) and that they could easily over\xef\xac\x81t the data set Most recent methods in the Layout Engine include use spatial transformers together with CNNs to mitigate the lack of automatic generalization from the CNN of the a\xef\xac\x83ne transformation of the input image (e g rotation shear scaling etc ) which is a common problem in document images Two fast robust feature extractors are being developed and various classi\xef\xac\x81ers were used with the aim of tackling this problem using di\xef\xac\x80erent approaches Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence is harnessed for use in four areas of Xriba backend 1 Automatically identi\xef\xac\x81es the pertinent data from accounting docs 2 Generates information on \xef\xac\x81nancial/economic occurrences from the record of accounts 3 Client support 4 Analyses \xef\xac\x81nancial/economic data for various purposes The \xef\xac\x81rst point has already been discussed in depth in the second regarding the algorithms a record will be provided from the accounts of \xef\xac\x81nancial/economic occurrences Data identi\xef\xac\x81ed by the OCR will also be explored in detail XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 42 \x0cAccording to the type of document the following will automatically be applied \xe2\x80\xa2 Cataloguing costs and earnings in the accounts identi\xef\xac\x81ed according to the accounting and \xef\xac\x81scal regulations in force \xe2\x80\xa2 Opening credit or debit notes from the client or supplier \xe2\x80\xa2 The ability to deduct and detract these items \xe2\x80\xa2 Adjustments to accruals \xe2\x80\xa2 Linking account entries with the closure of these in the case of incoming funds or payments \xe2\x80\xa2 Categorizing VAT according to the regulations in force \xe2\x80\xa2 Etc The third aspect of the AI system is that it will automatically identify user issues which arise and will seek resolutions without Customer Care having to step in A Machine Learning system is also in place which provides resolutions based on previous experiences supplied by Customer Care The fourth and \xef\xac\x81nal application is the most interesting and the most complex It concerns structuring algorithms which study the various patterns or habits the company may have (costs invoices time scales for payments and income preference of products purchased etc ) the algorithms can calculate \xe2\x80\xa2 Predictive analyses \xe2\x80\xa2 Solvency and credit rating indicators \xe2\x80\xa2 Net income stability solidity turnover etc \xe2\x80\xa2 Useful indicators for the company to optimize procurement and the optimum markets/sectors in which to grow the business These are only a few examples of practical applications of AI within the Mastrobook XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 43 \x0cMechanical Turk The AI system is supported by a Xriba team validating the processing and extraction of the data from the scanned documents This will automate the whole bookkeeping process and will help maintain its integrity At the same time the AI algorithms become more sophisticated thanks to the continuous machine learning process o\xef\xac\x80ered by AI By having the work of the AI and OCR technology continuously audited and checked by human intelligence it ensures that the data extracted from the arti\xef\xac\x81cial intelligence and OCR technology is accurate and that no errors can slip through the cracks If the Xriba mechanical Turk team detects an error the team corrects it and updates the AI with the correction so that the AI will not make that error in the future This further enhances the AI\xe2\x80\x99s learning process and ensures the quality of information that is processed by the AI technology 6 3 Xriba Applications Xriba Protocol The Xriba Protocol is an open decentralized platform built on Ethereum that allows any company to record \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions and to build \xef\xac\x81nancial tools such as the Mastrobook or Crypto book applications on top of The protocol allows a third party application to query record and audit any companies\xe2\x80\x99 \xef\xac\x81nancial standings within the Protocol utilizing a decentralized ledger The Xriba Protocol is the decentralized answer to the fragmented accounting system in which a company\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81nancial records may be in several di\xef\xac\x80erent databases owned by several di\xef\xac\x80erent bookkeeping companies at the same time The Xriba Protocol provides open access allowing any company to record their \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions on a decentralized ledger The Xriba Protocol also includes state of the art bookkeeping technology such as AI to XRIBUM LTD www xriba com |

company Current Account The Xriba applications host a classic bank account which the companies can utilize to operate The automatic functions of the app will be associated with it It is possible to credit the Fiat currency deposit account XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 48 \x0cin Euro Dollar Pound and other major currencies Fiat will be convertible into the main cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Ether and Master Xriba (XRA) themselves (the tokens are used to access the service) All the automatic functions of the app for managing the corporate accounts will be associated with the current account This will be the only account that the business owner can associate with other members of his or her sta\xef\xac\x80 Smartphone Decentralized Wallet Another of the main innovations that will be introduced to the market via the Xriba applications is the concept of a local vault in one\xe2\x80\x99s smartphone Each time a new company is added to the app network the system will create a central deposit account managed by Xriba the current account is a classic centralized account managed by the company that provides the service the company vault can only be entered using the password known to the entrepreneur A decentralized wallet can also be accessed via the business owner\xe2\x80\x99s smartphone which will be called the \xe2\x80\x98company vault \xe2\x80\x99 By having it located on the account owner\xe2\x80\x99s smartphone this prevents any centralized control of company funds For example many users are familiar with cryptocurrency exchanges The classic centralized cryptocurrency exchange is centralized and has control over the wallet\xe2\x80\x99s private key and thus the user\xe2\x80\x99s funds If the exchange gets hacked the funds on the exchange can be spent freely without the owner\xe2\x80\x99s consent With the account owners private key located in a decentralized location only the account owner will be able to process cryptocurrency payments This will help prevent against hacking unauthorized use and expenditure of company funds The dual nature of the account provides the utmost \xef\xac\x82exibility to the business owner in managing their money in Fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies This gives him or her the power to transfer values held in an account directly via their wallet in a secure manner XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 49 \x0cCryptobook features Xriba has identi\xef\xac\x81ed a large discrepancy between the traditional \xef\xac\x81nancial markets and the cryptocurrency market This discrepancy is transparency and accountability In the traditional markets companies are forced to be transparent with their venture capitalists and other \xef\xac\x81nancial supporters This forced transparency breeds professionalism and diligence Traditional companies are subject to milestone released funds \xef\xac\x81nancial examination and collaboration from their investors and \xef\xac\x81nancial supporters and accountability to deliver on their investors and \xef\xac\x81nancial supporters Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s Cryptobook will o\xef\xac\x80er the same AI and time saving features that Mastrobook o\xef\xac\x80ers and will include unique features that are exclusive to the cryptocurrency sector such as \xe2\x80\xa2 Wallet Ownership veri\xef\xac\x81ed by Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s identity partners \xe2\x80\xa2 Private transaction feature to

able to browse and view company expenditures If a user logs onto the XRIBUM LTD www xriba com 50 | 70 \x0cCryptobook and does not possess 150 XRA or more in value held in XRA in their Ethereum wallet the user will be redirected to a purchase portal where they will have the ability to purchase XRA tokens Once a user has more than 150 XRA the user will not be charged to view and browse general cryptocurrency company\xe2\x80\x99s public transactions Private Transactions Cryptocurrency start ups will have the ability to conceal transactional data from the public on a transaction by transaction basis This gives the company the ability to hide data from the public for which there might be privacy concerns There will be a $5 000 service charge applied to any concealed transaction Transaction concealment will enable start ups to conceal the transactional data from the public and only reveal the transactional metadata to auditors or those that have reached out to the start up from the Xriba crypto product dashboard and have been speci\xef\xac\x81cally granted permission to view the transaction This will allow the start up to retain transparency while protecting itself from the possibility of jeopardizing information with privacy concerns All fees will be paid in XRA tokens to Xriba 6 4 Accessing the Xriba Protocol Services To access the Xriba Protocol and utilize the services o\xef\xac\x80ered including browsing companies \xef\xac\x81nancial standings users will have to hold XRA tokens The XRA tokens may be available on the open market or will otherwise be available for purchase by credit or debit card directly on the platform XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 51 \x0c6 5 Sources of Revenue Xriba has multiple streams of revenue that will ensure success and longevity of the protocol These streams of revenue include Platform Services Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s XRA tokens are the currency of choice for utilizing the Xriba Protocol and Xriba applications Services rendered additional application features and fees that occur from within the application and protocol will be paid in XRA tokens Purchasing tokens from within Xriba applications Users who are using the applications and do not hold any XRA tokens will be able to purchase XRA tokens within the same applications Users who purchase XRA tokens from the application will pay a 20% premium on the market price per XRA token This is a convenience charge that will not only make it easier for the consumer to acquire XRA tokens but will also serve as a revenue stream for Xriba When a user purchases XRA tokens from within Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s applications Xriba will sell the corresponding amount of XRA tokens from the company holdings of XRA or will purchase them from cryptocurrency exchanges Use of the Xriba Protocol by third party applications The Xriba Protocol is developed to encourage third party application development Currently Xriba has developed three applications (Mastrobook Cryptobook and XribaPay) on the Xriba Protocol Moving XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 52 \x0cforward as more companies move to be more transparent and more tools arise around auditing and monitoring the Xriba Protocol there will be more applications developed that will interact with it To interact with the protocol a fee will be assessed and paid in XRA tokens similar to the way in which fees are assessed to open API\xe2\x80\x99s that developers build on TokenCheck Foundation Support Xriba is one of the core members of the TokenCheck Foundation The TokenCheck Foundation will have Corporate Members from the legal \xef\xac\x81nancial insurance and technical sectors Xriba technology powers many of the features and functions surrounding the \xef\xac\x81nancial actions around the TokenCheck Foundation As more users utilize the Xriba Protocol and software from the TokenCheck Foundation more income in the form of XRA will come to Xriba 6 6 Business Plan Xriba is not a start up Xriba is a project based on an established business with an eight \xef\xac\x81gure turnover Also Xriba can count on partnership with Soluzione Tasse one of the top 5 Italian accountancy \xef\xac\x81rms Furthermore Gianluca Massini Rosati CEO of Xriba has 150 000 business entrepreneur followers on his Facebook page \xe2\x80\x9cEscapologia Fiscale\xe2\x80\x9d These entrepreneurs are business owners and in are need of a bookkeeping platform to record their books Mastrobook and Xriba will help them save over 70% of their accounting time and costs compared to traditional software Mastrobook is already in use today and will be publicly launched in early June 2018 Therefore the project is set to start with thousands of potential clients and substantial growth capacity Below is the projected client base and sales

to keep track of expenses balance books and generate quarterly statements For an interested investor or individual to perform due diligence on a company beyond the quarterly statement the individual or investor would need to query the bookkeeping company directly Once they contact the bookkeeping company they are met with various gatekeepers and privacy concerns that they must overcome if they wish to view the company\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures Ultimately they would also require the company\xe2\x80\x99s blessing to view an itemized transaction record of company expenses This architecture is not transparent and requires the individual to rely on the trust of the bookkeeping company\xe2\x80\x99s quarterly statements to verify the company\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81nancial standing In the B2B sector if Company A wanted to examine Company B Company A must contact Company B\xe2\x80\x99s bookkeeping services once Company A receives Company\xe2\x80\x99s B blessing to allow them to view the \xef\xac\x81nancial records Company A is presented with the task of analyzing and evaluating Company B\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures which may be in an entirely di\xef\xac\x80erent format to their own Company A is also forced to rely on the accuracy and trustworthiness of Company B\xe2\x80\x99s bookkeepers This process is centralized and changes from Company to Company There is no uniformity or consistency to how companies save and store their expenditures it varies between bookkeeping services With the XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 55 \x0cdevelopment of blockchain technology it\xe2\x80\x99s time that the accounting world takes advantage of decentralized ledger technology Blockchain technology enables companies to securely store and track business expenses on a decentralized ledger that is accessible and auditable by all parties By utilizing the Xriba protocol any company or individual across the world can query any company\ s \xef\xac\x81nances and explore various expenses revenue and more in a uniform and trustworthy fashion Bookkeeping companies can build applications on top of the Xriba protocol and contribute to the growing number of companies aggregated expenses and \xef\xac\x81nancial standings on the blockchain No longer will company records be stored among various databases fragmented from company to company Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s protocol prevents numbers from being \xe2\x80\x98smudged\xe2\x80\x99 or altered in quarterly statements and enables companies/individuals to e\xef\xac\x83ciently query a company\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x81nancial standing without relying on the trust or cooperation of a third party bookkeeping company 7 2 Why Xriba is using the Ethereum Blockchain All the blockchains present unique perks and pitfalls Xriba selected the Ethereum blockchain for several reasons likely to \xe2\x80\xa2 Strong developer and user community Ethereum is not disappear overnight and has one of the largest developer communities which increases development time and pro\xef\xac\x81ciency \xe2\x80\xa2 Detailed smart contracts that are highly developed and \xef\xac\x82exible compared to other blockchain solutions XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 56 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Scalability (Ethereum will implement sharding and layer 2 scaling that will enhance the Ethereum blockchains scalability processes) \xe2\x80\xa2 Mature ecosystem Another viable solution would have been the Bitcoin blockchain utilizing RSK Smart Contracts However Ethereum has been around since 2016 and is more mature which equates to fewer bugs and hiccups along the way XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 57 \x0c7 3 Xriba interactions with the Blockchain Xriba has created an e\xef\xac\x83cient architecture for handling \xef\xac\x81nancial transactions and storing them on the blockchain Xriba utilizes Proof of Existence to store \xef\xac\x81nancial records and information on the blockchain without bloating the blockchain or using unnecessary storage space Xriba has built an API that allows companies developers and users to interact with the Xriba protocol The API uses a stringent JSON object structure which ensures uniformity across companies \xef\xac\x81nancial records For a transaction to be recorded on the Xriba protocol the transaction must ping one of Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s API endpoints containing \xe2\x80\xa2 Document type \xe2\x80\xa2 Name of expense \xe2\x80\xa2 Amount of expense \xe2\x80\xa2 Name of incoming payment \xe2\x80\xa2 Amount of incoming payment \xe2\x80\xa2 Payee \xe2\x80\xa2 Payer \xe2\x80\xa2 Document in byte format \xe2\x80\xa2 Payment due date From here the API passes the document and metadata to Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s AI and OCR technology The AI technology extracts the relevant data from the \xef\xac\x81nancial document in byte format and this information is saved onto the Xriba database Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s API then uses Proof of Existence to convert this \xef\xac\x81nancial record into a hash format The Xriba API then logs this hashed transaction record onto the Ethereum blockchain By using Proof ofExistence this ensures that the data cannot be modi\xef\xac\x81ed without a mismatch in the Proof of Existence hash If a violation occurs in the Proof XRIBUM LTD www xriba com 58 | 70 \x0cof Existence hash then it is immediately known that the data has been tampered with By utilizing Proof of Existence in conjunction with blockchain technology it is impossible to tamper with \xef\xac\x81nancial data once it has been submitted to the Xriba Protocol When data needs to be read from the Xriba platform this process simply happens in reverse A GET request would hit one of Xriba\xe2\x80\x99s API endpoints requesting a particular transaction that corresponds to an Ethereum transaction ID The Xriba protocol then retrieves those documents hashes the document using Proof of Existence and compares the newly hashed document to the saved hash in the Ethereum transaction ID to ensure the data is accurate and has not been tampered with Then after veri\xef\xac\x81cation is complete the metadata and document associated with the transaction are returned to the user XRIBUM LTD www xriba com | 70 59 \x0c8 Roadmap
