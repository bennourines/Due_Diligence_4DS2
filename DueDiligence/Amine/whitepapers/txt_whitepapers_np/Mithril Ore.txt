Utility Token Use Case White Paper Token Abstract Mithril Ore is a limited in quantity tokenized digital asset with a utilization case based on the anticipated Ethereum proof of stake known as \xe2\x80\x98Casper\xe2\x80\x99 With its value backed by Ether there will only ever be 500 000 Mithril Ore tokens in circulation As an Ether backed token its utility as an advanced mining/staking token is novel in that it is a limited quantity token providing future mining/staking capabilities with the Ethereum Casper Upgrade and Proof of Stake With Mithril Ore token there are no promises of what may come the product and utility already exist The advanced mining/staking utility of Mithril Ore will allow the token to mine/stake Ethereum just by holding it over the passage of time due in part to the process of collective staking The reward for staking will be Ethereum (tentatively 5% per year) based on the current information regarding Casper 13/06/2018 \xe2\x80\x93 Version 3 1 \x0cMithril

13 13/06/2018 \xe2\x80\x93 Version 3 2 \x0cMithril Ore Corporation \xe2\x80\x93 Utility Token Use Case White Paper Token Utililty \xe2\x80\x93 Use Case It is common practice for digital tokens to introduce new tokens into the market through multiple mechanisms Some tokens use the process of mining \xe2\x80\x93 which uses real world resources to solve complex mathematical problems in order to encode \xe2\x80\x98blocks \xe2\x80\x99 There are many \xe2\x80\x98mining tokens\xe2\x80\x99 for which people collectively participate in the mining process Another process by which tokens can be generated is the greener process of staking For Ethereum this will be known as proof of stake (POS) in which computers are utilized and connected to a core network and tokens are locked (unusable) in order to participate in this advanced mining option The process of staking is ideal in that it does not waste massive amounts of real world resources (power energy) in order to introduce new tokens to the market The process of staking makes your digital currency less liquid in that it cannot be used while staked In other words tokens cannot be used for trading or purchasing goods and services while tokens are staking Utilization of tokens and staking are mutually exclusive The process of staking also limits computer usage speed processing and computer lifespan by requiring constant connection to the core network and using constant processing powers Staking can be moot if a chain has forked and the core wallet has not been upgraded especially if a user is running the \xe2\x80\x98old fork \xe2\x80\x99 Commonly a user must pay constant attention to running the most up to date version of the core wallet Lastly staking requires download of huge amounts of data because core wallets require possession of a token\xe2\x80\x99s entire blockchain (although \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98sharding\xe2\x80\x99 may help with the aspect of downloading the entire blockchain) Mithril Ore Token aims to merge the \xe2\x80\x98best of both worlds \xe2\x80\x99 While the Ethereum backing the token is staked the token holder is free to use the Mithril Ore token for purposes of trading redeeming or exchanging for goods or services all the while the staked Ethereum does the mining work reaping the benefits of the mining utility which results in additional Ethereum to the token basis The token not only is a store of value of the staked Ethereum behind it but through the advanced mining process of staking increases the quantity of the Ethereum backing Tokens known as \xe2\x80\x98MORE\xe2\x80\x99 are associated with the Ethereum they stake The Ethereum will be perpetually staked allowing continual advanced mining while the token holder has a usable tradable transferable assignable MORE token Although simple in premise this token provides a valuable niche in the market for the occasional or hobby investor who may not have the time energy know how or amount of Ether required for staking

Ethereum/Babbage equivalency The staking fee shall be charged at initial purchase of MORE tokens Each individual \xe2\x80\x98MORE\xe2\x80\x99 token is backed by the allocated Ethereum providing a

All Ethereum shall be stored in cold storage held by a neutral third party custodian Said custodian will be of credible reputation audited and secured By purchasing the Mithril Ore token the token

tokens \ The \xe2\x80\x98Blacksmith Option\xe2\x80\x99 essentially wields Mithril Ore tokens into more potent Mithril Items that would serve to concentrate volume and further increase the amount of staked Ethereum and place Mithril Ore tokens back into marketplace The \xe2\x80\x98Blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99 option could also be considered a share consolidation akin to changing out 5 US pennies (Ore) for a US nickel (item) with the same relative value just concentrated or consolidated For example In the future for a limited time and in very small amount we will make \xe2\x80\x98Mithril Arrow\xe2\x80\x99 available which is the equivalent of two Mithril Ore There will be a very limited number of Mithril Arrows generated Two Mithril Ore may be exchanged for one Mithril Arrow Therefore Mithril Arrow will be backed by the equivalent of two Mithril Ore of Ethereum no intrinsic value is lost but potentially intrinsic value is gained because a limited edition token with unique privileges was generated The Mithril Arrow and other Blacksmith Option items will also receive privileged or reciprocal voting rights relating to their concentrated Mithril items Tokens exchanged for items would be put back on the market in interval time to add to the staked Ethereum resulting in added staking returns to the token holder Item tokens will be generated in exceedingly more limited amounts with each iteration and strictly limited to low quantities in production especially in comparison to the small and finite number of Mithril Ore Tokens 13/06/2018 \xe2\x80\x93 Version 3 7
