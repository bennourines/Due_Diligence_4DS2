enabling users to exchange value securely quickly and without the expense MICRO is developing its own ERC20 Decentralised Exchange (DEX) which allows users across the globe to trade cryptocurrencies Enabling them to own their private keys in order to have full control over their digital assets MICRO Exchange users will enjoy a secure environment for trading cryptocurrencies as well as a high level of privacy Without having to reveal any personal information MICRO Exchange will never ask its users to submit any forms of verification such as Passport Driving License or Bank Statements Thus trading on MICRO Exchange will be completely private MICRO Exchange will mainly have MICRO Pairs in addition to Ether Moreover trading fees are reduced if paid with MICRO as well as the token listing fees Finally MICRO Exchange is operating right in the Asian market which is dominating the cryptocurrency industry with 38% of users globally compared to 27% in Europe and 17% in North America 3 \x0cINTRODUCTION MicroMines (MICRO) is a new project being worked on by an ambitious team in the heart of AsiaPacific region that is looking to deliver the next cutting edge decentralised exchange (DEX) to millions of users without the complexity Freedom is a key in exchanging digital assets which should be accessible by all cryptocurrency users without limitations For that MICRO is going to launch its MICROEX early next year in Q1 followed by a full launch to the decentralised platform in Q2 Micro had successfully raised funds through Private Sale on 27 October 2018 which is followed by a Public sale on 01 November 2018 MICRO is an ERC 20 token based on Etherem Blockchain with a number of great features that include Profit Sharing model in which MICRO investors will be rewarded with 50% of the profit generated by MICROEX MICRO team believes that investors contribute to the growth of the project in the long term and staking tokens to earn rewards is expected to lock up a great amount of tokens where the increase in demand is met with limited supply then the token should become more valuable MICROEX is a truly decentralsed exchange that will never ask users to comply with any KYC and AML policies allowing millions of users wishing to exchange digital assets an alternative option to the centralised exchanges in which they do require their users to verify themselves to comply with these policies This document explains the MICROEX including its advantages over the centralised exchanges its features and ecosystem the Asian pacific market token information and allocations team structure the roadmap exchanges and all useful links 4 \x0cMICROEX MicroMines is developing the next generation Decentralised Exchange (DEX) which is scheduled for BETA launch in Q2 2019 The team aims to fully launch the platform later in Q3 2019 MICROEX will offer a number of great features to the end user such as enabling the user to have a full control over their digital assets (owning the wallet private keys) anonymity (no identity verification is required in order to deposit withdraw as well as trade cryptocurrencies) and a high level of security using the latest technologies for Peer to Peer (P2P) trading systems Centralised cryptocurrency exchanges on the other hand have to comply with Know YourCustomer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) policies therefore they ask their users to be verified using official government identification documents (ID) such as passport and driving license as well as selfies and many other forms of verifications such as bank statements and utility bills to verify the user s home address This is a major obstacle for many users interested in trading cryptocurrencies as they are not so confident that these sensitive information will be stored securely when the rise of data breaches is taken into account Unlike with centralised exchanges that often disable cryptocurrency trading as well as deposits and withdrawals MICROEX offers users up to 100% running time so that they do not miss a moment trading depositing and withdrawing cryptocurrencies Moreover while centralised exchanges maintain a full control of users\xe2\x80\x99 accounts including their digital assets It is very common to suspend accounts without any reason which as a result users lose their digital assets Furthermore centralised exchanges lack in security measures as they are running on known servers which increase their vulnerability to hackers MICROEX will be operating through a variety of nodes leaving no doors open to hackers getting their hands on users\xe2\x80\x99 digital assets Furthermore users will enjoy a high level of privacy as they will not be sharing their data with MICROEX as they do with centralised exchanges 5 \x0cMICROEX FEATURES MICROEX allows users to trade ERC 20 tokens only That gives them access to over 1 000 tokens that can be integrated directly onto MICROEX without the complexity of integrating custom blockchains With a high level of security protecting users\xe2\x80\x99 data as well as their digital assets MICROEX will have a user friendly interface that suits both beginners and experienced traders Moreover MICROEX trading fee will be as low as 0 15% per transaction Meaning that users will be trading without the high expense that centralised exchanges often charge especially when users withdraw their digital assets to their wallets For instance Binance charges 0 1% trading fee plus withdrawal fee (0 0005 BTC 0 01 ETH 0 01 LTC) And Poloniex charges (0 25% take fee & 0 15% maker fee) With MICROEX withdrawing ETH or other ERC 20 tokens will incur a network transaction fee only MICROEX features 1 Full Control 2 High Level of Security 3 Complete Privacy 4 Low Trading Fees 5 Improved Interface Design (enhanced usability) 6 One Click Ladder Trading Interface 7 Decentralised Account Balances 8 Reliable Running Time 6 \x0cMICROEX PLATFORM MICROEX is a truly decentralised exchange (DEX) that brings the freedom of exchanging digital assets without complexity MICROEX believes that exchanging cryptocurrencies should be free and available to everyone without limitations That should be secure private and without the expense of high commission fees associated with trading and withdrawing digital assets A study shows that 73% of exchanges take custody of users\xe2\x80\x99 digital assets by keeping the private keys Moreover large exchangers do not spend much on securing their systems 72% of large exchanges allocate less than 10% of their budget on security However MICROEX users should have their private keys to their digital assets in case they lose access to the platform they are able to use the private key to access them The platform will have the top security measures to ensure that user digital assets are safe and not vulnerable to hackers MICROEX will have a userfriendly interface that enables traders from all levels to exchange their digital asses with Limit Order and Market Order including Asks and Bids users will be able to interact with all these options effectively MICROEX will launch two key pairs 1) Micro and 2) ETH That being said users will be able to trade various ERC 20 tokens against MICRO token as well as ETH The interface will display the markets available the balance of the user including the option to create a new wallet or unlock the one they are using to start trading Users can also bookmark their favourite tokens to easily navigate between the markets that they are mostly interested in In addition to a candlestick chart for tracking the token price a functional trollbox will connect users on the platform to exchange information and discuss the latest trends in cryptocurrency Both Market Trade History as well as The User Trade History will be visible to give the user essential information about each market 7 \x0cFigure 1 MICROEX Platform 8 \x0cASIA PACIFIC MARKET When it comes to cryptocurrencies everyone is aware of the
