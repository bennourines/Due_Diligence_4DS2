The CryptoCurrency market cap has grown from $18 Bn on 15th January 2017 to more than $110 Bn on 14th June 2017 On an average every $1 invested in the cryptocurrency token has resulted in a gain of over $5 a stunning 500% return in a 5 months period The blockchain industry is still in its nascent stage and is expected to grow more in future The goal of this paper is to examine the problems investing in the blockchain space for an individual investor and to introduce a solution to minimise the risk and maximise the returns using innovative technology TGTCoin is built to change the

issued and value per coin gives us the value of the market cap of a cryptocurrency Market cap is a great tool understand the size and future potential of the coin relative to other coins \x0cA number of cryptocurrency tokens are designed in a way that their supply grows at a certain rate over a period of time A number of tokens have a locked in supply to control the supply and inflate the prices of the tokens misleading many retail investors For a number of tokens a handful of people control the prices and manipulate the market 5 1 Market Opportunity During the past 2 years Bitcoin has outperformed return on DOW Jones Industrial Average by more than 700% Since July 2013 market cap of crypto currencies has increased from $1 5 Bn to $114 Bn as of 12th June 2017 An astounding 7500%
