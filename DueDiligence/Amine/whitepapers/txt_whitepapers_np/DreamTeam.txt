Partners Contacts Sources 2 \x0cAbstract The desire to compete is in our nature Striving to be faster better stronger at everything from faster cars to sports achievements to\xe2\x80\xa6 becoming the best player on a gaming server Presently gaming is the largest entertainment market on the planet It is a $100Bn industry covering \xe2\x85\x93 of the world population i e 2 3Bn people as of 2017 Competitive gaming a thin line between gaming and sports has emerged in which players pit their skills against one another online It already has over 1 4 Bn users concentrated around the top 10 most competitive titles like Counter Strike League of Legends Dota 2 and Overwatch etc Esports as it is today has emerged from competitive gaming that is when players compete against each other in computer games professionally Esports is one of the fastest growing digital markets with a 33% annual growth rate Its opportunities are endless esports will have over 1Bn enthusiasts & viewers by 2023 which is \xe2\x85\x93 of all gamers and will become the #1 sport of the future But with all this potential the esport industry\xe2\x80\x99s growth is still currently hampered by the insecurity and fraud of transactions no single point of entry and limited market knowledge and business tools This is where DreamTeam comes into play as the first all in one infrastructure platform for competitive gaming and a payment gateway for esports We are acting as the secured payment gateway ensuring mutual trust and delivery by creating the basis for a solid economy of esports And by offering an all in one network interconnecting all parts of the esports ecosystem under one roof our goal is to make esports accessible to everyone willing to join and compete As an all in one platform we are unlocking the possibility for hundreds of millions of gamers millions of teams dozens of thousands of sponsors advertisers and tournaments to securely connect with each other and become a part of the global esports ecosystem where we have a unique opportunity to unlock a $50Bn economy in a matter of a few years 3 \x0cMarket Overview Gaming market Just some 20 years ago the gaming industry was taking its first steps as a developing market with a yearly revenue of under $200M Back in the 90\xe2\x80\x99s we played everlasting hits like Super Mario Legend of Zelda DOOM Duke Nukem and Half Life all immensely entertaining despite their limited single player mode But playing against your computer could never compare to the level of engagement and challenges when faced by real opponents So as the evolution of the internet and technology progressed the era of multiplayer gaming began and the gaming market rapidly expanded Today it already encompasses 2 3 Bn people and continues to grow Each year it will continue growing covering more and more of the yet claimed audiences In perspective the gaming market revenue was $101Bn in 2016 $109Bn in 2017 and is projected to slowly grow year over year and reach $129Bn in 2020 with a CAGR of around 6% The gaming audience growth is showing similar signs of steady but slow growth with a CAGR of 5% and 2 2Bn viewers in 2016 2 3Bn in 2017 and a projected 2 7Bn in 2020 if the growth rates remain the same 4 \x0cCompetitive gaming as a major part of the gaming industry The core of competitive gaming and a large part of the gaming market is in competition between players or teams in the online multiplayer games Remember that 1 5 Bn users are registered in the top 10 competitive titles on PC alone and the revenue of such games equals to about 45% of the entire PC gaming market revenue around $11Bn Eight out of ten titles are team based games like Counter Strike League of Legends DotA 2 World of Tanks and Overwatch all played 5 on 5 or 6 on 6 5 \x0cAs in traditional sports team based games are by far the most popular for their intense visuals and interest for the viewers And with its growing popularity esports is spanning not only across the PC market but on consoles and mobile markets as well Indeed consoles have a variety of competitive titles such as Call of Duty Star Wars Battlefront II and Battlefield that have a huge fan base For example Call of Duty sold over 250M game copies which equates to roughly $15Bn Another important part of the ecosystem is mobile esports e g Clash of Clans has over 100M daily active users who enjoy playing on the go Vainglory is one more competitive mobile video game that left its Beta in 2015 with over 1 5M active users And the majority of players in both games are teens and young adults The company behind Clash of Clans Supercell generated $2 3 billion in revenue and profited $964 million last year Just think about it the $5 5 billion dollar gaming company is worth more than LinkedIn AirBnB and Twitter combined We should also consider the potential of the VR & AR gaming market which is rapidly developing and is expected to reach its full potential in 4 5 years In 2014 The VR/AR market was only worth $100M and in 2017 it had already surpassed $1Bn That\xe2\x80\x99s a ten fold growth in just 3 years with a potential to hit $20Bn revenue in 2020 provided that a few \xe2\x80\x9ckiller apps\xe2\x80\x9d are created Esports fans are a major buying force of VR/AR hardware and games Actually according to Newzoo research 52% of esports enthusiasts are planning to buy something connected to VR in the next 6 months And 63% of all VR buyers are at least casual esports viewers The number of people aged 16 35 who play esports is pretty much equal to those who play traditional sports like ice hockey and baseball 6 \x0cThe younger population is keen to embrace the digital age and VR/AR technological advances only support the growing trend It may soon be like in the movie Tron Legacy where the full physical and intellectual capacities become combined and lead to a new world with virtual stadiums and augmented reality for viewers The dedication and number of fans striving to become amateur or pro players are outstanding indeed Nearly half of the 300M core players are engaged in competitive activities such as ranked matches (matches with a special ranking system) or some mini/amateur tournaments and want to know more about the reality of professional gaming players teams and tournaments In the top competitive titles the numbers are even higher according to the open source stats site Steamspy com there are 100+M registered users in DOTA2 with ~13M unique active monthly players with over 40% of them playing 40+ hours a month The same with Counter Strike Global Offensive \xe2\x80\x93 35% of its ~9M unique monthly players play 40+ hours a month This is a pressing issue for amateur players that has yet to be resolved as 4 out of 5 League of Legends players for example want to compete professionally yet have no clear way of doing so 7 \x0cEsports market revenue and audience Esports is the realm of competitive gaming meaning that people are making a living competing in video games It is one of the highest potential markets on the planet within the hardest to reach audience aged 16 36 The current esports market has a revenue of $700M with an active audience of nearly 200M making it an average revenue of $3 5 per user who are willing not only to watch but to actively participate and make a living with esports Furthermore the compound annual growth rate is a staggering 33% At the same time this market is limited to the top 1000 players and about 100 teams who together hold the biggest share of money in esports namely the $300M sponsorships and media rights sales pie $120M in advertising revenue $100M of prize money and $40M in player compensations and salaries 8 \x0cThe esports market revenue was $0 5Bn in 2016 $0 7Bn in 2017 $1Bn in 2018 and is projected to grow to $1 5Bn in 2020 with a 33% CAGR The esports audience is also growing fast with a 324M audience in 2016 390M in 2017 and could reach 590M in 2020 with a 17% CAGR From the historical perspective modern esports first emerged in 1997 and remained in the so called \xe2\x80\x9cDark Ages\xe2\x80\x9d up until 2003 At that time it was an underground movement with prize pools usually amounting to a case of beer The total revenue of esports at that time was just around $5M In the years 2004 2010 what one might call the \xe2\x80\x9cRenaissance\xe2\x80\x9d of esports happened That\xe2\x80\x99s when esports became a widespread movement alas an unstructured one with the entire market worth around $50M In 2011 2016 esports rose to fame and became a Global Phenomenon with $500M in revenue At that time esports began to seriously challenge and at times even exceed traditional sports in terms of popularity Prize pools were reaching $20M in some instances We are now on the verge of a breakthrough as traditional sports have reached their peak all the while more and more young adults and teens are actively pursuing competitive gaming as their key pastime Many believe that esports titles will soon be officially included as part of the Olympics with their overall revenue exceeding $5Bn And the esports Olympic dream is growing ever closer In February 2018 Intel brought amazing gaming experiences to PyeongChang ahead of the Olympic Winter Games 2018 the Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) Season XII The event hosted the esports tournament in \xe2\x80\x9cStarCraft\xc2\xae II\xe2\x80\x9d which was open to any player at any level via global online qualifiers It is noteworthy that the event was held with the support of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) The future looks positive as the Olympic Channel has started engaging with the young audience through esports With a budget of $450 million it was created by the International Olympic Committee to ensure the year round interest in the Olympic movement and attract younger viewership According to the channel\xe2\x80\x99s Executive Director Yiannis Exarchos the rise in popularity of competitive gaming cannot be ignored And talks about allowing esports to be a part of the Olympics are ensuing 9 \x0cComparison of esports market with sports market In terms of the players teams tournaments and gaming structures esports is very similar to traditional sports But why invest in esports over the traditional sports market Current landscape While the traditional sports market is by far one of the largest markets with a 2 8Bn audience and $150Bn in revenue its very slow growth seems to have hit a ceiling The sports market is highly regulated and its growth rate is not like it used to be 10 20 years ago as we are immersing further and further into the virtual gaming world And esports has all the prerequisites to become the biggest sport on the planet 10 \x0cEsports is the #1 sport of the future The pressing question is how many youngsters actually play traditional sports such as football tennis or hockey on a regular basis Some of them probably do If you ask around you will be amazed by the fact that 8 out of 10 youngsters actively play video games Of those 7 out of 8 are playing competitive titles creating a massive audience eager to find a way to begin the road to professional esports glory and monetize their play This growing trend is going to turn esports into the most popular sport on our planet We already have over 1 7Bn people that play online competitive video games on PC Mobile VR and Consoles And being successful in competitive gaming is all the rage getting a seat as a team at a large stadium and winning a tournament is what players long for most Indeed esports is so popular that in the years 2016 2017 a total of 70M people watched the LoL World Finals 32M watched the DoTA 2 Internationals and 33M the CS GO ESL event in Cologne This means that the combined viewership of these three tournaments was 135M In comparison the 2016 2017 NBA Finals only had a viewership of around 25M The total prize money pool exceeded $100M and one of the top esports players Kuro \xe2\x80\x9cKuroky\xe2\x80\x9d Takhasomi received over $2 5M in 2017 excluding his hefty salary and bonus payouts 11 \x0cOn top of that esports has a number of unique opportunities that everyone is trying to exploit like creating a brand new league which is virtually impossible to do these days in the highly regulated traditional sports industry Developers for instance are rushing to create closed championships and leagues like the NHL & NBA Riot Games the owner of League of Legends has created a closed ecosystem that mimics such traditional sports leagues there are 6 regional leagues (Korea China EU NA Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macao SEA) and the top 2 placing teams in each region get a spot in the World Championship which is very similar to the Championship League in football The 2017 Season World\xe2\x80\x99s prize pool was over $4 5M And the overall amount of prize money awarded in various LoL competitions exceeded $12M in 2017 All of the media rights and tournaments have to be licensed and the profit goes to Riot Games much similar to traditional sports TV broadcasting rights As in traditional sports the league will have a stable roster of franchises and teams will share revenue from media deals The buy in price to join the League of Legends league in North America is $10 13 million per team depending on the team\xe2\x80\x99s track record And the process is highly selective from around 100 applications willing to shell out millions The league owner Riot Games created a very narrowed down shortlist For example in 2017 they decided that the league would not expand and instead remain at just 10 teams VALVE owner of CS GO and Dota 2 in turn chose to create an open ecosystem where any team can take part in open tournaments with the top teams progressing to the closed regional qualifiers In Dota 2 for example winners of those qualifiers can partake in over 10 Minors with a $300K prize pool and later in 10 Majors with a $1M prize pool in each tournament Based on the results of each tournament teams get qualification points and a short list is created for the main event with as much as $24M in prizes up for grabs As for CS GO there are 8 Minors and 2 Majors as well as over 20 smaller tournaments worldwide Apart from the official VALVE sponsored tournaments esports players can partake in thousands of tournaments that do not offer qualification points or serious prize money 12 \x0cAs the CS GO tournaments are becoming more popular ELEAGUE was created and officially launched in 2016 which is now the premium esports tournament and content brand formed in partnership between Turner and IMG A leader in the delivery of live event experiences ELEAGUE content is regularly showcased on TBS and widely distributed across digital platforms including Twitch YouTube and ELEAGUE com Over its first two years ELEAGUE has produced and staged three season long competitions featuring Counter Strike Global Offensive along with the first ever Overwatch\xc2\xae Open Another notable mention goes to the Overwatch League created by Blizzard It is divided into two regions Pacific and Atlantic In each region there are 6 participating teams that represent cities Seoul London Shanghai etc The league is franchised and the price for a spot varies from 5 to 20 million US dollars In 2017 within the framework of the Overwatch League a prize fund of $3 5M will be drawn and the season will be divided into several stages Subsequently all teams of the Overwatch League will acquire their own arenas in their hometowns where they will conduct \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d matches Contrary to the above mentioned video games Blizzard created the Overwatch Open League an open division in which players with a high player rating can participate Winners of these competitions in their region will get a chance to compete in the Overwatch Contenders tournament series in 2018 It is from this league new talents will be recruited for the Overwatch League Thus for the first time in esports history a \xe2\x80\x9chealthy open\xe2\x80\x9d ecosystem has emerged in which players replace each other as they would in traditional sports 13 \x0cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting that the Olympic Council of Asia will be adding esports events to the 2018 and 2022 Asian Games in Jakarta Indonesia and Hangzhou China No wonder that substantial investments are pouring into esports For example Tencent the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest game developer and the owner of Riot Games and Super Cell has revealed its five year investment plan into esports $14 6Bn to create and complete within new leagues tournaments and associations Additional financing for esports of nearly $1Bn came from the hands of Amazon which acquired Twitch a live videogame streaming site Twitch is a major force on the web as it accounts for nearly 2% of all traffic in the U S with over 15 billion minutes of content with users spending on average an unparalleled 100 minutes a day on the site In turn ESPN that had previously covered esports via live streaming television and print coverage launched a new online resource with in depth news and research dedicated to the world of competitive gaming Such games as League of Legends Dota 2 and Counter Strike Global Offensive will be covered on par with traditional sports mastodons like the NFL NBA and MLB And that\xe2\x80\x99s yet another step towards the mainstream acceptance of professional video gaming 14 \x0cNowadays game developers are using esports as their #1 marketing tool \xe2\x80\x93 aside from making games they\xe2\x80\x99re creating a whole ecosystem to provide high quality entertainment not just for players and teams but also game viewers and fans who fill huge stadiums and venues to watch major gaming events with million dollar prize funds At the same time traditional sports teams and sponsors are chipping in because esports is the best way to reach young audiences which are often unreachable through standard media outlets (TV radio etc ) They are actively investing in esports opening esports divisions and signing professional players Clubs like Paris Saint Germain Philadelphia 76ers Miami Heat Schalke 04 Spartak Roma Valencia and Manchester City have already joined esports One of the most prominent esports deals by a traditional sports team is the Dallas Cowboys acquisition of Complexity Gaming The Dallas Cowboys are worth $4 2 billion which makes them the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable sports franchise The purchase of Complexity that fields teams in 26 different competitive esports and has won 130 titles since its founding in 2003 is another step to create a universal competitive brand spanning across industries Another team is the New York Yankees the second highest valued sports franchise in the world and not too far behind with an investment in Vision Esports The opportunities are endless esports will have over 1Bn enthusiasts and viewers by 2023 which is nearly \xe2\x85\x93 of all gamers But even now esports enthusiasts are a major gaming force with above average household incomes And yet despite all of these facts its market pool is still extremely low esports ARPU is just $3 5 compared to $54 ARPU of traditional sports There are many other issues that need to be addressed in the esports industry to make it truly competitive with traditional sports So let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at the key esports problems and the solutions DreamTeam offers to overcome them and make esports a globally attractive venture with limitless monetization options 15 \x0cProblem & Solution The esports industry is constantly growing but has a low APRU especially compared to traditional sports It has huge potential for monetization that is presently hampered by three key problems that are discussed below 1 Insecurity and fraud Problem Not receiving compensation for your success isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair by any standard But that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in esports where teams tournaments and sponsors are guilty of multiple accounts of non payments and fraud When players risk their hard work for nothing in return esports as a business suffers Sponsors are also facing the same issues as they lose money when a team does not deliver Even a signed contract does not guarantee that a team won\xe2\x80\x99t collapse drop its best players and squander media coverage This has so far amounted to millions of dollars in losses to sponsors and advertisers For example NaVi one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading and most popular esports teams on the planet have joined top level tournaments and ended up winning a share of the prize money but still in many instances never received the payout As of now over $700K is owed to NaVi in sponsorship deals and tournament winnings And this is happening all over Europe Asia and the US The NaVi team has won or placed among the top teams yet has been left empty handed as the prize money was never paid out Solution DreamTeam addresses this problem by providing a fast and secure payment system just like PayPal And with the esports industry being digital it is a perfect place to apply the blockchain and smart contracts technology This way we can ensure the payout of all prize money players\xe2\x80\x99 salaries and transfers sponsorship and advertising deals For example a sponsor signing a deal with a team sets specific KPIs in a smart contract such as the number of attended tournaments with the company\xe2\x80\x99s logo mentions in the team\xe2\x80\x99s social media channels etc All of these parameters were impossible to automatically record and check before But with DreamTeam you can easily track players\xe2\x80\x99 and teams\xe2\x80\x99 performance through APIs monitor when with whom and with what kind of branding they completed as well as the popularity of the team In a smart contract we can put down all the requirements and guarantee that teams players and sponsors are satisfied with the outcome Furthermore the money is only released when all of the requirements set in the smart contract are met 16 \x0cThe same is true for tournaments where teams sign a smart contract with tournaments organizers DreamTeam can track match IDs and provide prize money payouts immediately after the tournament ends We will also offer advanced threefactor authentication to ensure zero fraud by double checking stats of top esports sites such as Hltv org to verify our data DreamTeam also uses the Oracle network to secure smart contracts and guarantee the fairness of results 2 No business tools Problem Securing the esports market is great But esports enthusiasts want to make a living with esports and require advanced business tools to maintain a steady income Presently people can\xe2\x80\x99t build and develop their esports businesses as there is no go to place for such tools There is no clear cut way to succeed in esports For example gamers are faced with many challenges when creating an esports club or team people recruitment creating a bank account doing all the legal paperwork and dealing with a variety of third party services Millions of gamers want to spend money to develop their teams hire coaches psychologists and other supporting personnel but don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it all manually You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to spend at least a few months dealing with various companies and $3000 just to start Then add $400 a month to support the basic functioning of your team Therefore there are only around 100 pro teams globally that have gone all the way and can earn top dollar in esports And this is just a small part of the esports ecosystem Besides teams there are tournaments players and coaches that have no access to such tools to make it all work Right now most people can\xe2\x80\x99t make a living with esports Solution With the set of advanced business tools DreamTeam can help monetize the esports industry and open up the esports market to millions These tools can turn the esports stagnation into prosperity and help dozens of thousands of esports fans make a living in gaming For teams we are offering recruitment functionality with options to search and analyze players their ranking game stats and tournaments played We are also providing management tools \xe2\x80\x93 practice games tournaments and performance tracking as well as analytics tools to develop teams Moreover tournaments organizers can track the performance of the teams and players they want to invite They can create and showcase team listings The same goes for coaches allowing them to check their team\xe2\x80\x99s progress adapt their strategy and train their team to esports success We will also create media tools to show growth of your media fan base And based on these data players and teams can get a report to provide it to potential sponsors and showcase their skills and media popularity 17 \x0c3 Can\xe2\x80\x99t monetize/can\xe2\x80\x99t advertise Problem When sponsors and advertisers want to enter the esports industry they have to do complex manual labor to search for the teams and tournaments that meet their requirements For example Kingston/HyperX (a Fortune 100 company) employs over 50 people who search for and deal with esports sponsorship and advertising agreements As you can imagine such investments run into the millions but that\xe2\x80\x99s not attainable for your average Joe that wants to sponsor a local team and advertise their business during a local tournament And for the up and coming teams and amateur tournaments the inability to secure such a sponsor or advertiser is a key stumbling block in their development While having the ability to secure contracts payments and boost the esports participants\xe2\x80\x99 numbers teams still don\xe2\x80\x99t have a single point of entry to find sponsors and vice versa This gap is the final barrier of esports monetization as there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a single platform to find teams tournaments sponsors or advertisers and arrange meetings with them There is no database and no uniform system to connect sponsors and advertisers with the esports teams Solution A great example of how things are done is Airbnb \xe2\x80\x93 the gateway for rentals where both the landlords and renters are interconnected on one single platform And this is what the DreamTeam marketplace wants to do for esports namely to unite teams and sponsors tournaments and advertisers and become the business gateway for all esports DreamTeam will let sponsors with different needs find teams with diverse backgrounds either small regional or large international ones And make sure that all of this can be done with a click of a button Similar to Google AdWords the search can be done by geolocation number of subscribers and other precise requirements in one place For example a local advertiser will be able to search for a successful regional team with a track record of wins in amateur tournaments and offer them compensation for showcasing the company\xe2\x80\x99s branding on their team uniform By offering such functionality DreamTeam will secure smooth interactions and business flow within esports and automate all of the sponsorship and advertising deals 18 \x0cProduct & Strategy DreamTeam is an infrastructure platform and payment gateway for esports and gaming The network\xe2\x80\x99s primary goal is to become a universal platform for the millions of esports enthusiasts gamers teams sponsors advertisers as well as tournament organizers and more By uniting multiple businesses in one place and giving them advanced but easy to use tools we are unlocking a $50Bn ecosystem Development strategy We have devised a 3 stage development strategy to showcase the DreamTeam platform timeline and its prospects Stage 1 (Oct 2017 Jul 2018) The main focus of Stage 1 is offering esports player and teams recruitment and management tools for the most popular PC titles CS GO LOL DoTA 2 PUBG and Overwatch as well as reaching 2M registered users In this period of time DreamTeam also focuses on offering basic monetization elements launch of the Blockchain test network with Smart Contracts support It lets all platform users create a Test Wallet and check out how smart contracts work The essence of smart contracts is in allowing players to receive salaries from their teams After the initial test DreamTeam will launch a version with real value DreamTeam Tokens in Q2 2018 to conduct realvalue operations We will also offer other monetization options such as Premium Accounts with loads of unique features to provide the platform\xe2\x80\x99s most active users 19 \x0cwith a way of making their efforts easier and more effective In depth look Recruitment functionality The foundation of the DreamTeam platform is the toolset that offers an exhaustive array of services finding players and teams recruitment of managers coaches analysts scouts agents and even personal psychologists to support the team\xe2\x80\x99s dayto day operations All of this was previously unavailable on a single platform and with DreamTeam the esports teams will have even greater recruitment flexibility compared to traditional sports For example from the very start of DreamTeam a newly registered player has to indicate his skill level game role and location This allows teams who want to recruit players an easy way to find local players among thousands of others by inputting the desired parameters to get a short list of suitable players In the later stages of DreamTeam platform development there will also be other ways to boost recruitment for both teams and players by using premium accounts that offer advanced filters unlimited games and individual game profiles and more Players interested in pursuing a pro gaming career will be able to verify their rank to showcase their skills to top teams and have a better chance of getting noticed Last but not least DreamTeam will offer one time services that allow players to raise their profiles to the top of the search list and ensure faster recruitment Stage 2 (Jul 2018 Jun 2019) During Stage 2 DreamTeam will pay particular attention to supporting pro teams and tournaments who are well established leaders in the esports industry By June 2019 DreamTeam will offer comprehensive modules for management analytics coaching media and marketing for pro teams DreamTeam will also add search tools for coaches analysts managers and top 15 games tournament lists as well as include promo tournaments and more advanced monetization options via smart contracts payment of tournament prize money to eliminate fraud and non payment as well as create a transfer market that will make it easier to search and sign top talents This will drive us to reach over 5M registered users on our platform In depth look Team management Managing an esports team to success is a vital part of the DreamTeam platform Currently there are no comprehensive tools that allow team owners to easily 20 \x0cmanage a team and team staff is also limited in their ability to automate their duties With DreamTeam all esports processes are now at team owner\xe2\x80\x99s fingertips as you can plan your team composition have a calendar that includes all of your tournaments and other team activities such as practice games the ability to register for tournaments in advance in just one click and ensure that all staff and players duly perform their tasks Tournament and league modules This is yet another vital functionality to be implemented within the DreamTeam platform that allows players and teams to effectively find tournaments/leagues they can compete in For example an amateur team can search for a local CS GO tournament and join it by signing a smart contract Such smart contracts capabilities let teams secure a place in the tournament and receive tournament prize money payouts according to their placement This money will then be automatically distributed among team members With millions of new teams being created on DreamTeam such payouts will reach dozens of millions of dollars and let amateur novice and pro teams make a living competing in esports tournaments Other benefits that support monetization of tournaments are player transfers This means that DreamTeam offers a transparent transfer market where teams can sign and sell players Analytics tools DreamTeam analytics tools will offer capabilities to track personal and team gaming stats in detail that was previously unheard of By that we mean that you can research and monitor in game performances such as players\xe2\x80\x99 positioning on the map headshot ratio kill rate and other parameters Even such tiny things like the timing of the grenade throw can influence the game outcome By simply plugging in the timeline of the corresponding game you will be provided with all required info to make informed choices on how to improve your gaming performance Coaching With the help of the DreamTeam platform the team coach can improve the training process while analyzing large swathes of data and perform their tasks more effectively By automating many points in the coach\xe2\x80\x99s work DreamTeam opens up more time for coaches to work one on one with players and teams For example a team coach can analyze team performance on a new map get all the data and provide valuable feedback to every player based not on general observations but precise data points provided by the DreamTeam platform 21 \x0cMedia tools Presently all esports media presence tracking has to be done by hand And showcasing your social media popularity and fan base its growth and reach requires tedious data collecting With precise DreamTeam media tools such processes become automated Teams or players will be able to easily collect create and provide detailed media reports that can be submitted to sponsors in a matter of minutes Such reports will represent their media track record and potential and any other information they deem appropriate to share and represent their personal brand Stage 3 (Jul 2019 Jul 2020) The 3rd and final Stage has its focus on sponsors and advertisers that will have access to over 15M active users and 2M teams With a worldwide reach we will be able to offer our users all of the imaginable monetization options analytics and research tools and have direct contact with dozens of thousands of advertisers sponsors and content platforms both local and global More smart contracts will be offered signing sponsorships media rights sales and advertising contracts The DreamTeam Tokens\xe2\x80\x99 application in smart contracts will also help boost the ecosystem and their industry wide application will help promote the security and transparency of all esports financial activities that in turn will help boost the ARPU of esports to over $16 per user This will result in the creation of dozens of thousands more local tournaments with easy access to them by interested sponsors and esports fans alike In depth look Sponsorship and advertising tools DreamTeam will offer sponsors advertisers teams and tournaments an advanced tool that provides precise targeting of their marketing effort just like in Facebook Ads or Google Adwords On one hand the esports enthusiasts that were able to form a team with the help of DreamTeam now gain access to the wide sponsorship and advertising market While on the other hand small local and medium sized businesses will get access to these esports teams and tournaments that they could not previously reach This way they will be able to promote their businesses search for the pro and amateur esports teams and make their business known to the esport audience Data Science and AI DreamTeam has the capacity to offer the next level of analytics through our huge pool of data gathered from our users and external sources personal team and tournaments stats open sources APIs latest news as well as outside sources such as 22 \x0cHltv org and other outlets All of this data will be automatically processed to provide high quality global esports researches that can be used for example to forecast player ranks based on prior game play and progress automatically match or suggest players for teams and vice versa Moreover AI will give advice on improving player performance by analyzing the tactics used in millions of game matches happening on the platform and connected to it This information would be impossible to process in any other conventional way only through advanced AI machine learning and data science instruments Traction DreamTeam launched its Beta version of the platform in late October 2017 and by the end of 2018 we expect at least 4M user registrations spread out across CS GO LoL PUBG and other titles supported by our platform The vast majority of users come from the US Europe and CIS regions Regarding the DreamTeam ICO Phase #1 reached its hard cap of $6M in December 2017 And Phase #2 of the DreamTeam Token Sale that will take place in April May 2018 is expected to gather an additional $39M to reach our overall goal of $45M in investments 23 \x0cToken Functionality The DreamTeam Token is the only intra platform DreamTeam currency Every transaction on the platform will require the use of DreamTeam Tokens The Token application is fully supported by the blockchain technology and can be used for payment of all smart contracts obligations as well as paid platform features and other features Smart contracts* Payment of players\xe2\x80\x99 compensations All types of salaries (team to player team to coach player to personal coach etc ) All players and teams will have access to a DreamTeam Wallet with Tokens Utilizing smart contracts will enable every platform user to sign contracts and receive compensation for their gaming Player transfers Secure and transparent transfer market that allows teams to securely sign and sell players by signing a smart contract This will create a player transfer market on par with traditional sports and boost the market value of top esport players Sponsorship and media rights sales Clear cut entry into the esports market that will allow not only the top sponsors and media moguls but also small local and medium sized sponsors and media representatives to sign contracts with a variety of esports teams The same goes for amateur and pro teams and players that get sponsorship opportunities and are able to sell media rights that are validated and paid via DreamTeam Tokens Advertising agreements Simple to sign contracts and set in stone obligations for both sides will boost the advertising options and let local advertisers gain coverage among the esports audience as well as allow teams to get more funding to support their esports activities Tournament prize payouts Payouts to teams and players will reach several billion dollars and let amateur novice and pro teams alike make a living competing in esports tournaments Teams will be able to sign contracts with tournaments and receive prize money payouts that will be automatically distributed among their members Examples of smart contract The blockchain technology enables teams to set their KPI\xe2\x80\x99s for the team manager and team coach who in turn can set personal KPIs for each player Then after a period of time (e g after a month) everyone is auto checked by smart contracts and * DreamTeam charges a fee for each smart contract execution 24 \x0cdepending on the results all participants of the process receive their salary and bonuses This is equally efficient and applicable when we look at tournament prize money payouts with sums reaching $100M+ per year A typical scenario would be that of a team participating in a tournament and after getting a winning place the prize money will be automatically transferred to their account via smart contracts according to the set rules Consecutively all players will receive their share of the prize money In the long run this will help the development of small tournaments and secure payments for all teams from novice to professional So it becomes possible to create a one of a kind platform with a payment gateway for players teams tournaments and sponsors as DreamTeam smart contracts provide limitless opportunities for their application in all esports spheres Paid platform features Premium accounts for players Various powerful options to enhance user experience such as unlimited games and profiles leaderboard top 1000 10 monthly power messages ability to apply to full teams and more Premium accounts for teams Various powerful options to enhance user experience such as 8 10 team slots ability to assign team roles advanced player filters unlimited number of applicants and more Researches Big data analytics and researches available for purchase by companies (this includes various consumer analytics and researches) Verified rank Officially validated rank that will showcase player skills to ensure the best team signing options One time services Services like \xe2\x80\x9cRaise your profile to the top of search results\xe2\x80\x9d Along with the smart contracts various monetization options will be gradually introduced to the platform Premium Accounts and One Time Services (management analytics tools etc ) Rank Verification and Big Data Analytics will be added in the second half of 2018 Later at the end of Q4 2018 we will launch additional monetization services including an expanded set of one time payments (personal coaches agencies etc ) In 2019 all monetization will be implemented with big data analytics researches crowdfunding and other one time services (marketing media tools etc ) All of these services can only be paid for with the DreamTeam Token Example of a platform feature When a player purchases a premium account his account profile becomes listed at the top of the search feed and is highlighted for teams that are looking for a player with similar skills and gaming experience This player will also get advanced analytics 25 \x0cof his account to gain in depth insights and improve his gaming Another benefit is that the player\xe2\x80\x99s compound experience will be tracked and shown as a badge on his profile This will allow teams searching for a player with extensive experience to recognise this player as such Moreover player\xe2\x80\x99s applications to teams will be shown at the top and upon being shortlisted for the team he will receive a corresponding notification 26 \x0cBlockchain Smart contracts as a key to esports success The blockchain technology is applied on the DreamTeam platform via smart contracts that ensure contract execution and payouts according to the preset conditions Smart contracts protect all arrangements from retroactive changes By using them on DreamTeam we can guarantee payments of promised sums to the players or teams and fulfillment of all undertaken obligations to the tournament organizers and sponsors Smart contracts can already be checked out by all of the DreamTeam users as we\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented the DreamTeam Test Network Thereby both players and teams can sign contracts and set conditions for their cooperation After the Phase #2 Token Sale the Test Network will be replaced with the real value smart contracts network that will have the above capabilities to sign contracts Later in 2018 sponsorships and media rights sales agreements and tournament prize money payouts will be added as well DreamTeam is in a sweet spot namely the esports industry is the perfect place to integrate the blockchain technology the right way For example tracking game results and corresponding fulfillment of the conditions of a smart contract DreamTeam created a three factor verification system firstly we take the API from the corresponding game and correlate it with the match ID team ID and so on secondly we further confirm the results of the match through the Oracle Networks finally we confirm the results via top specialized esports resources for example for CS GO matches we check hltv org All of the above tools enable us to create a unique digital sphere for the esports industry that can ensure the securenes and correct implementation of blockchain The blockchain technology and application of smart contracts in the esports industry will open up new perspectives and unite the entire ecosystem under one roof With the support of DreamTeam Tokens and application of smart contracts the industry will get the necessary boost to let every esports fan monetize their skills or promote their businesses As we are dealing with the digital sports application of advanced but easy to use technology is necessary to ensure long term growth and overall success Without the application of blockchain and smart contracts technologies the current esports industry will stagnate in its growth and will remain limited to teams and companies with extensive resources to support their esports activities The blockchain technology is the key to unlocking the esports perspectives and help it grow from a worldwide phenomenon into a fully fledged entertainment industry on par with sports with its own set of regulations and security of transactions that are available across the board 27 \x0cBlockchain infrastructure The DreamTeam blockchain infrastructure is based on the Ethereum ERC 20 smart contracts with Open Zeppelin framework (using Solidity language) It works as follows The platform\xe2\x80\x99s web front end interface communicates user\xe2\x80\x99s requests to our services which in turn send the appropriate query into our Blockchain system From there the Blockchain will publish the requested ERC 20 smart contract via the Ethereum network or issue the respective payments and refunds through the JSONRPC mechanism We also implemented an additional mechanism to control who can oversee and approve/authorize the payments within the network i e only the team owner only the tournament organizer etc In Q2 2018 when monetization is introduced all tokens might be exchanged at a 1 1 ratio for a more convenient platform Eos/Tezos/Waves or a new protocol developed by DreamTeam to solve the issues with the network speed and potential scalability 28 \x0cTechnological Stack DreamTeam Web Platform is designed to be a SPA (Single Page Application) that\xe2\x80\x99s highly scalable to handle a load of millions of users with the following technology stack Front End Javascript (Vue js) HTML5 CSS3 and Nodejs Vue js was chosen for being a lightweight and flexible Javascript framework that allows for creation of reusable components APIs Restful APIs are created to work with the front end We have created APIs as microservices to handle a variety of tasks including Achievement Authentication that does not currently use oAuth2 However we will add oAuth2 as we open our services to external users as well Currently we are continuing to add new Services such as Steam Updater LOL Updater Notification and Blockchain Services We will also be adding further Services for CS GO League of Legends and Search utilizing Amazon Elastic Search in the near future As a part of our deployments we will only extend microservices to the pre set target regions instead of deploying all of the services in all regions This reduces some of the complexities on the DevOps side and let\xe2\x80\x99s the DreamTeam be more timeeffective Back End PHP7 with Symfony 4 Symfony is one of the best PHP frameworks that is enterprise ready Database PostgreSQL 9 5 PostgreSQL is an enterprise grade highly scalable optimized database that creates well running query plans making it very responsive We also use NOSQL Databases such as MongoDB in different parts of the system where it makes sense for us to use it instead of relying on relational database for every functionality All of the technological stack runs on AWS Infrastructure with Docker containers Kubernetes orchestration and a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous deployment) infrastructure is in place We have done performance testing using the Gatling tool and we are constantly optimizing our code our queries and our infrastructure to handle the expected loads of the systems for years to come 29 \x0cCompetitor Analysis DreamTeam strongly believes that an absence of an all in one platform with a comprehensive list of tools and utilities to kick start an esports career is a critical problem for more than 1Bn players worldwide We are faced with a multi million gamer audience that is stuck in development There is no simple and effective solution that can solve their problems when creating a team and gathering players of similar skill level And the solutions that are present require spending thousands of dollars and weeks of time DreamTeam functions the same way as the leading companies that unite their respective ecosystems around them LinkedIn and IMDB being great examples We do not develop games on our own but serve to gather the entirety of esports in one place unlike any other esports platform out there We are letting users search and find players create teams manage teams through a variety of tools as well as find and sign sponsorships & media right sales get their prize money payouts and compensation for gaming as well as earn more through other numerous monetization options It is virtually impossible to compare DreamTeam in standard terms to any other platform as currently nothing comes close in terms of offering all of the above features to esports fans Nevertheless we have conducted a thorough analysis of possible DreamTeam competitors both from crypto and esports markets 30 \x0cUser Acquisition Cost and Strategy There are two main directions in the DreamTeam marketing strategy as to drawing esports enthusiast to the platform Creation of a global cooperation with top esports teams and tournament sponsorships as well as partnerships with famous esports brands Cost effective targeted user acquisition During the first three years we plan on partnering up with the world\xe2\x80\x99s major esports entities like Fnatic SK Gaming NaVi ESL StarLadder HLTV and many others to offer a comprehensive and all encompassing experience to players around the globe And since our launch in October we\xe2\x80\x99ve already signed agreements with such giants as ESL the world\xe2\x80\x99s #1 esports company and biggest tournament organizer and Starladder one of the biggest tournament organizers and a platform for amateur and semi professional gamers Also by signing agreements with the best esports teams DreamTeam can reach more esports fans and build up its user base Natus Vincere (NaVi) one of the most popular and successful esports teams on the planet was the first pro team to partner up with DreamTeam with SK Gaming being the second one And right now we are negotiating a global sponsorship agreement with Fnatic Our goal is to create a strong community based on the DreamTeam platform and raise DreamTeam brand awareness among our shared core audiences With this goal in mind we have already sponsored IEM Oakland 2017 and StarSeries i League CS GO Season 4 among others As for the DreamTeam user acquisition we are aiming to make it very cost effective not only through cooperation with top esports brands but also by using high precision 31 \x0ctargeted ads We are pinpointing the CS GO audience to start with by using CPC promo campaigns engaging with top YouTubers who have millions of viewers pushing DreamTeam branding on specialized CS GO sites and applying target banners and video commercials All of this lets us promote DreamTeam and remain cost effective while acquiring a large user base with a goal to reach 4M users by the end of 2018 In the first months after the launch of DreamTeam we were mostly focused on developing the platform itself which is a key focus as we want to offer the best experience for players as quickly as possible According to SimilarWeb open data source this strategy has paid off as there were nearly 1M visits per month in the first quarter of the DreamTeam platform being live with the majority of players being from North America and Europe our core regions Since the DreamTeam Beta launch this strategy has proved to be highly effective as in 3 months over 250K esports enthusiasts have signed up for DreamTeam with a 36% average weekly growth In the future we will broaden our key regions expanding to South America SEA and CIS 32 \x0cEconomics The economics model of DreamTeam can be subdivided into two parts the freemium business model and the transaction fee based business model Their comprehensive application will support the DreamTeam monetization in short and long term perspective Freemium business model Premium accounts conversion rate 5 8% Additional monetization conversion rate >3% Average ARPU per paying user $16 MRR at expected 4M users $1M+ 33 \x0cTransaction fee based business model Transaction fees 5% Transactional revenue in 4 years $150M+ Transaction types players\xe2\x80\x99 salary and bonuses sponsorship payments prize money payouts player transfer market fees and media rights sales Both models are based on the obligatory application of the DreamTeam currency DreamTeam Tokens and smart contracts The freemium business model is the key monetization of the DreamTeam platform and it stems from users signing up for the premium player and team profiles that provide extensive functionality With a transparent and fair pricing model (just for example 49 9 DTT for premium player profile and 199 9 DTT for premium team profile) we expect a 4 5% sign up rate with 4M+ users being active on the platform with an MRR of $1M This business model also includes additional monetization options with a conversion rate of around 3% among these options will be One Time Services (management analytics tools etc ) Rank Verification and Big Data Analytics 34 \x0cThe transaction fee based business model is intended for the vast majority of players that are interested in pursuing a competitive esports career and this requires setting up or joining a team and getting paid for playing video games on a team as well as sharing tournament winnings at the basic level At the more advanced level teams and players will share sponsorship payments engage in the player transfer market and sales of their media rights All of these transactions require the application of smart contracts and bring in a steady flow of commission/fee based revenue (2 5% per transaction) for DreamTeam The estimated NET revenue (meaning gross revenue will be 20 50 times higher) in 4 years time according to this model is $150M+ per annum There will be other fee based monetization options including an expanded set of one time payments (personal coaches agencies etc ) projected to launch in Q4 2018 In 2019 all monetization will be implemented with big data analytics researches crowdfunding and other one time services (marketing media tools etc ) All of these services can only be paid for with the DreamTeam Token 35 \x0cToken Sale Every transaction on the DreamTeam platform will require the use of DreamTeam Tokens The token application is fully supported by the blockchain technology and can be used for payment of all smart contract obligations as well as paid platform features and other features Their issuance is limited to the DreamTeam Token Sale Phase #1 and #2 with no more Tokens ever being issued The only way to acquire the tokens at this time is to do so during the sales within a limited timeframe Additional Token Sale information Tokens can be used within the DreamTeam platform by third party services and platforms at their own risk and lawful discretion For token sales DreamTeam token uses Ethereum ERC20 token standard In 2018 all tokens might be exchanged at a 1 1 ratio for a more convenient platform Eos/ Tezos/Waves or our own
