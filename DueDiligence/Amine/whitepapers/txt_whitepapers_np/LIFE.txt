additional blockchains (albeit subsets of the original) bearish investment and speculative trade has taken place between a relatively small group of investors (some of these being the original founding community) This has led to speculators moving into the cryptocurrency sphere The technical nature of the language used and the perceived complexity of cryptocurrency has intentionally or otherwise excluded most of the general population from the cryptocurrency community Recent articles both on and offline and the movement by mainstream hedge funds and institutional investors and their professional advisors into the cryptocurrency sphere have increased the interest of the general population in this area Wide spread adoption of blockchain based business and technology will bring the technology and all its benefits to the everyday users Mainstream adoption benefits not only the newcomers to the crypto sphere but also the existing cryptocurrency economy and its current users Social responsibility and sharing the exposure and benefits New terms are coined by members of the political community all the time however with regards to social change but we are yet to witness anything of substance LIFE will give everyone the opportunity to change their life for the better If an individual can collect 1 LIFE token they are then part of the crypto sphere This then gives that individual an opportunity to gain by further immersing themselves in this brave new world LIFE is blockchain based social and financial liberation 7 \x0cLIFEtoken Overview LIFE is an ERC20 compliant token on the Ethereum Blockchain Ethereum offers incredible growth for LIFE and will enable the token to continue to grow without hinderance Supply The total supply of LIFE is 100 billion tokens Whilst this appears to be a significantly higher number compared to the majority of other coin and token issuances LIFE has many facets Smart Bank and blockchain driven user democracy We aim to build a true people\xe2\x80\x99s bank where the the holder is in control of the token Every holder of LIFE can take part in the vote to issue more tokens Whilst people may question why this is not smart contract driven it is simply down to user interaction In addition to the \xe2\x80\x98token\xe2\x80\x99 LIFE will evolve into a true people\xe2\x80\x99s bank providing instant FIAT to crypto and crypto to FIAT LIFE bank will not offer loans or overdrafts but will simply allow users to hold their currency and earn interest We have a diverse mix of adopters including a Landlord a Medical Research company a FIAT Exchange and a financial education website We have agreed to work closely with these companies as we view them as market leaders in their areas \xe2\x80\x93 and they will assist with our vision of bringing cryptocurrency to everyday people 8 \x0cDistribution of LIFE To ensure the longevity of our LIFE project the founders believe that transparency is paramount We will give LIFE stakeholders

into the mainstream we need to make the processes of using both FIAT and Cryptocurrency indistinguishable from each other To assist with this the LIFEcard will be a contactless debit card that carries out crypto FIAT transactions on making the process of spending LIFE and other supported ERC20 compatible currencies indistinguishable from the use of FIAT currency Our cards are due for circulation Q1 2018 The LIFEcard can also be used to reward customers and staff By loading tokens onto the LIFE card employers and businesses can reward good performance customer loyalty or similar with LIFE These can then be spent directly off the card held or traded as normal cryptocurrency In addition to this the card will support both Bitcoin and Ethereum tripling its utility and optioning to the market

allocation dispersed accordingly Through an online voting form holders of LIFE will be able to propose and then vote on registered charities to receive a donation of LIFE This will be a community guided approach the only stipulation being that the charities must be apolitical and humanitarian in nature Please see page 14 for charities that will be supported We will support community projects improving global well being education and welfare There are many standalone projects across the world some set up as charities others as not for profit social enterprises We will identify and support
