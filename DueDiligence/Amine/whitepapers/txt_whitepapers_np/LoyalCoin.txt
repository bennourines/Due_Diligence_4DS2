Management 24 Advisory Board 2 \x0cAPPSOLUTELY THE COMPANY USHERING IN THE NEW LOYALTY ECONOMY Appsolutely formed in 2013 in the Philippines has launched digital platforms and mobile apps that have enabled companies of all sizes including some with top global brands to rapidly expand market share and accelerate growth by providing richer more satisfying customer experiences through loyalty and rewards programs Building on our expertise in loyalty and rewards programs we are launching a new unified customer loyalty ecosystem that uses blockchain technology as the backbone and the LoyalCoin digital asset as the medium of exchange With these innovations we are eliminating the customer loyalty programs\xe2\x80\x99 limitations we currently encounter such as public confusion about the different mechanics of each loyalty program difficulties in points exchange lack of user engagement and more Removing these problems will accelerate the formation of a more cohesive cooperative and competitive customer loyalty industry The launch of LoyalCoin will involve commitments from entities who will have the digital asset and use it for consumption operational and/or other purposes Participants in this new ecosystem will drive the new loyalty economy with their activities and financial support for the scaling of our platform For instance in the consumption driven emerging economies in Asia the spread of a unified proactive customer loyalty system can usher in more customer retention for companies who will then boost their top and bottom lines Mass adoption and economic activity from this dynamic loyalty environment will be the engine that can add value to each LoyalCoin Simply put by replacing the limited reward points in the current customer loyalty setup with a blockchain backed dynamic currency that supports increased participation between customer and brand we can unlock the full potential of rewards programs and increased value for participants in this revamped loyalty ecosystem In the succeeding parts of this whitepaper we will illustrate the roles that our company the technology and the digital asset will play in this new ecosystem as well 3 \x0cas the value proposition of LoyalCoin as an important part of building the new loyalty economy we envision TRACK RECORD Our proprietary technology for white label digital loyalty apps allowed us to launch the country\xe2\x80\x99s first mobile based customer loyalty system in 2014 a crucial development given that the nation is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most savvy and active when it comes to mobile services particularly apps and social media 1 This technology has opened opportunities for business collaborations with companies in multiple industries as well as international recognition We became the trusted loyalty system provider for our home country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest brands Our work in the digital loyalty space has won us the Best Technology Investment Award 2 in 2015 at the Technology Investment Conference organized by Software Park Thailand THE OMNICHANNEL FUTURE Companies worldwide have set out to aim for an omnichannel rewards strategy that shows consistency in service branding and customer experience regardless of where brands and consumers meet An omnichannel reward program is a lofty goal one that involves a huge amount of collaboration among brands and the channels by which they connect Difficulty increases as more channels are added and companies enter into agreements to arrange rewards and promotions Given our extensive experience in addressing brands\xe2\x80\x99 needs for reaching out to customers we are uniquely positioned to understand develop and implement a widereaching platform that allows for a universal loyalty points system which is a fundamental concept for the LoyalCoin tokens we will be issuing Digital in 2017 Global Overview We Are Social January 2017 https //wearesocial com/sg/blog/2017/01/digital in 2017global overview 1 Software Park Thailand May 2015 https //www facebook com/softwareparkthailand/photos/pcb 502880733196497/10155663840280534/ type=3&theater 2 4 \x0cSOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO Appsolutely provides an Internet based bridge that connects brands and merchants to their customers and audiences Our offerings have a unifying theme \xe2\x80\x94 better customer service The main service we provide and the focus of our push into blockchain is digital loyalty Through our customizable digital rewards programs companies were able to offer incentives such as coupons freebies promos as well as points and token based digital assets that encourage customer loyalty and continued business From there we expanded the use of digital loyalty to innovations that allow for the interaction with digital loyalty programs offline the synchronization of online and offline activities related to rewards and the creation of employee rewards programs In addition in our drive to cater to clients\xe2\x80\x99 desire for omnichannel solutions we launched the following services Digital Marketing We offer tailor made Internet based optimized ad campaign strategies CRM data and consumer behavior reports This service ensures the consistency of a brand\xe2\x80\x99s messaging E commerce One goal of our loyalty programs is to increase Internet based consumption Over the past years we have integrated online ordering systems electronic gift cards and digital wallet offerings into website and app driven loyalty programs creating a one stop platform for connecting brands to customers 5 \x0cLogistics With the online ordering system in place we go the extra mile to ensure that orders are delivered promptly and that brands\xe2\x80\x99 services are consistent Our addition of a logistics arm allows us to serve an end to end solution that handles every step of engagement from promotions and incentives to orders and deliveries Web and App Development Given that the loyalty programs we create are based on mobile apps and websites we parlayed our capabilities into serving clients\xe2\x80\x99 other platform creation needs taking advantage of the insights we have about the best practices for creating mobile apps and websites We evolved from digital loyalty specialist to omnichannel solutions provider Unfortunately rewards points in general have yet to make that evolutionary leap Rewards points the medium of exchange of any loyalty program has been limited due to the complications that come with arranging eligible deals for those rewards Hence the logical next step in our growth is to take those points into the future and unleash their full potential And we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it through our blockchain powered platform for an omnichannel loyalty economy MARKET OPPORTUNITY Appsolutely is in a unique position to spearhead the omnichannel loyalty economy Our loyalty system is the only one in Southeast Asia that is fully integrated with major point of sale providers This market position will be difficult to replicate as this level of integration went through a long and complicated process In addition our company\xe2\x80\x99s mobile loyalty apps allow clients to acquire consumer information and launch marketing campaigns while saving millions in market survey card production printing publication and direct advertising costs making us an ideal choice for loyalty programs Using these advantages we plan to expand aggressively as more clients in food pharmacy remittance petroleum fashion and specialty retail businesses benefit from the competitive advantages of having our solutions We also note that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of room for growth in digital loyalty and e commerce our two areas of expertise aside from the possibilities opened by blockchain Based 6 \x0con a survey conducted by auditing firm KPMG3 although 42% of companies in the Philippines report that their customers prefer to shop online about 73% of them have not been able to innovate their business model accordingly They indicated that they would increase their investments in better data analytics and technologies With similar conditions in developing and even developing countries we are here to fill that void 3 KPMG R G Manabat & Co The Philippine Consumer Market Report 2017 Investment Guide by KPMG in the Philippines 7 \x0cCLIENTS Appsolutely\xe2\x80\x99s current clientele includes some of the largest corporations in the Philippines as well as franchises of international brands Through these brands we serve about 2 million customers who are part of loyalty programs we developed These corporations are market leaders in diverse customer facing industries such as fuels (Petron) clothing (Bench) and convenience stores (FamilyMart) In addition we have launched customer loyalty programs for international brands\xe2\x80\x99 branches in the country most of which are in the restaurant and fashion businesses 8 \x0cLOYALPLATFORM THE FUTURE OF THE LOYALTY ECONOMY CURRENT LOYALTY ENVIRONMENT More companies and customers around the world are embracing the advantages of customer loyalty programs In the US for instance loyalty program enrollment increased from 2 65 billion in 2012 to 3 32 billion in 20154 according to Big 4 accounting firm Deloitte The average American belongs to more than ten loyalty programs Meanwhile retail loyalty programs are a hit in Asia where seven in ten customers with Internet access are part of one or more loyalty programs global survey company Nielsen noted5 Despite the growth in loyalty program participation numerous pain points have prevented these programs from realizing their full potential Deloitte noted that as of 2016 only half of loyalty program participants are active and one fifth of those active participants never redeemed their rewards Noted problems include low redemption rates high operational costs account inactivity and other logistical concerns as hindrances to improving customer loyalty Loyalty programs need to address these inconveniences and cater to consumer preference Nielsen noted that the most valued rewards in loyalty programs are monetary in nature so these programs have to emphasize their more redemptive features moving forward Global loyalty program participants also value flexibility in earning rewards regardless of channel and choice of rewards to retrieve In summary the current loyalty economy has coordination problems with unrealized rewards and customers are desiring more flexibility and monetary benefits In The Loyalty Economy of the future customers need to get what they want and pain points must be removed Deloitte Making Blockchain Real for Customer Loyalty Rewards Programs 2016 https //www2 deloitte com/us/en/pages/ \xef\xac\x81nancial services/articles/making

to spearhead the next generation of customer loyalty or The Loyalty Economy This ecosystem which will include a new virtual currency a digital wallet a series of white label apps and a coalition of supporting merchants is set to change the current uninspired and value deficient rewards points system to a value focused digital based rewards system that will stand head and shoulders above traditional rewards programs Through the LoyalPlatform customers are more engaged with companies\xe2\x80\x99 loyalty programs while acquiring better rewards for their consumption Meanwhile in this new world order of more valuable tradable rewards tokens companies that run customer loyalty programs can extract more value from the rewards they give out A new frontier of competition is created with companies raising the bar in customer service and loyalty programs LOYALCOIN The central piece of the omnichannel customer loyalty platform that we\xe2\x80\x99re building is the LoyalCoin the medium of exchange that now replaces the traditional rewards point The LoyalCoin token will serve as a utility token that will be the medium of exchange in the rewards ecosystem where customers earn LoyalCoin when spending at participating merchants LoyalCoin is returned to merchants when customers redeem available rewards When customers earn LoyalCoin they are empowered to use it in more ways than traditional customer loyalty programs offer In both conventional and blockchainbased rewards systems customers can acquire rewards and incentives using their points However in this new ecosystem the points from one merchant can be used to acquire rewards from any merchant within the ecosystem even if it s a separate merchant In addition to redeeming rewards LoyalCoin can be exchanged for rewards from other merchants as well as future functions that blockchain technology will allow 10 \x0cLOYALWALLET AND WHITE LABEL APPS Much of the economic activity that the LoyalCoin generates takes place in the LoyalWallet app which facilitates the purchase of goods and services redemption activities import and export of tokens and currency conversion We will also offer merchants the option to get customized white label apps that enable them to hook into the LoyalPlatform with their own look and feel and transact with LoyalCoin in the usual earning and burning fashion As tokens live on both the blockchain and internally within the the LoyalPlatform our apps will maintain features that incorporate the best of both worlds At any given time the LoyalWallet and the white label apps will enable functions such as the issuance of loyalty points as LoyalCoin the redemption of rewards through LoyalCoin and the transmission of tokens to friends and family LOYALCOALITION We are also building a coalition of companies and merchants that support the omnichannel ideal of customer loyalty These forward looking enterprises will support the issuance of LoyalCoin replacing their conventional points systems These companies will also enable the use of LoyalCoin earned from a coalition participant on other merchants in the coalition This arrangement allows for a wider scope of usage for LoyalCoin a more rewarding customer experience and an incentive for customers to stay loyal with the brands that are part of The Loyalty Economy the components of which are shown on Diagram 1 11 \x0cDiagram 1 In a nutshell these are the features of our LoyalPlatform to be further discussed below and in the future Universal Rewards Payment Gateway Digital Asset Exchange 12 Peer to Peer Transfer \x0cTECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW BLOCKCHAIN BASED SCALABLE AND SECURE The following discussion outlines the technology that enables the overall LoyalPlatform and our vision of The Loyalty Economy LOYALCOIN TOKEN TECHNOLOGY LoyalCoin exists as digital assets or mosaics on the NEM blockchain Coin holders will be able to check their LoyalCoin balance and transfer LoyalCoin to other addresses including exchanges All LoyalCoin is pre mined with a fixed market capitalization of 9 billion coins This number represents the sum of all coins circulating within the ecosystem This utility token will be divisible to 6 decimal places Internal LoyalCoin facilitates payment for activities such as reward payouts redemptions and more MERCHANT DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT Appsolutely currently administers customer rewards programs for several retailers and more than 2 000 merchant locations in the Philippines These retailers integrate our traditional points based rewards program through their point of sale systems They use white label apps that we have developed and continue to provide development and hosting services for We expect all of these merchants to upgrade from their traditional points system to LoyalCoin We intend to perform this upgrade and to provide ongoing support and administration for these brands Appsolutely will provide full service support to merchants and their retail locations by offering ongoing software development hosting training and consulting on how to effectively use our technology within their retail locations It is not required to be a customer of Appsolutely in order to offer the LoyalCoin as a reward Appsolutely will create a RESTful API to allow merchants that are not our customers to also participate in the LoyalCoalition Here\xe2\x80\x99s an illustration that shows how the participants in the LoyalCoin usage process are connected with each other 13 \x0cDiagram 2 RESTfulAPI It is not necessary to be a customer of Appsolutely to offer LoyalCoin as a reward Merchants that are not customers will have access to a public API that will enable them to participate in the LoyalCoalition and receive payments using the LoyalWallet These companies can maintain their own apps and integrate with our system through the API to receive payments and provide redemption Their customers can use the LoyalWallet to make payments for their goods or services they can also build their own custom solutions to transact cash or LoyalCoin 14 \x0cPAYMENTS WALKTHROUGH There will be a one scan process for payments at participating retailers A QR code will be printed on paper or displayed on a tablet device Customers need only to open their LoyalWallet app and scan the QR code to pay the bill They may pay in LoyalCoin or other currencies both fiat and virtual depending on a user\xe2\x80\x99s preference and other prevailing factors Diagram 3 Rewards redemption occurs when a merchant takes payment in LoyalCoin All participating merchants will be required to accept LoyalCoin payment for some or all of their products or services All of the payments and rewards earned or spent are recorded in our database Administering our own payments enables us to track LoyalCoin movement between customers and merchants and to display a user\xe2\x80\x99s LoyalCoin balance within the white 15 \x0clabel or LoyalWallet app LoyalCoin within either of these apps can also be sent to a user\xe2\x80\x99s XEM compatible digital wallet Appsolutely will add this functionality into participating white label apps and the LoyalWallet ON CHAIN AND OFF CHAIN DESIGN The NEM network is characterized by fast transaction times and low fees Nevertheless we propose a hybrid internal/external storage model to mitigate the transaction costs incurred by the large number of small transactions involved in a retail rewards system Transactions internal to the LoyalCoin system such as token rewards and redemption balance checks and so on can be transacted in real time on a private permissioned database Customer accounts are reconciled offline with the NEM public network to enable withdrawals and transfers with the outside world The technical details of this system are the subject of a separate technical white paper Balances that remain in the LoyalCoin system become available to power the vibrant LoyalCoin marketplace of e payments points conversion and rewards redemption All transactions on the LoyalPlatform including those that involve the credit and debit of LoyalCoin balances take place instantly as the LoyalCoin coalition apps runs on our private network The instant settlement of earnings and total LoyalCoin balance provide a satisfying user experience and encouragement for users to continue with loyalty shopping and rewards redemption whilst seeing their LoyalCoin balance updated in real time Depending on their situation some users will prefer to maintain their LoyalCoin internally and others on the NEM blockchain 16 \x0cLOYALCOIN (LYL) LOYALTY YOU\xe2\x80\x99LL LOVE The LoyalCoin (LYL) token is the utility token that will be used on the omnichannel loyalty platform we are building LYL will serve as both denomination for the rewards ecosystem and avenue for exchange into other virtual and fiat currencies When customers earn LYL from their rewards programs they are empowered to use the tokens on more options than the traditional customer loyalty program can offer As with the usual program customers can retrieve rewards and incentives using their points But in this ecosystem we\xe2\x80\x99re building the points from one merchant can be used to redeem rewards from any merchant a customer prefers HOW LYL ADDS VALUE LYL Is attached to a customer rewards ecosystem that makes a case for significant usage by the general public Even at the current state where Appsolutely has many merchant partners and serves more than 2 million users through the loyalty programs we operate there is a good chance of mass adoption for the token We\xe2\x80\x99re also putting economic value into loyalty points that otherwise would have gone stagnant and expired The value unlocked by these previously unused points will be a source of surplus economic activity which results in more transactions In addition the LoyalPlatform will drive revenues for Appsolutely in two ways We earn revenues from per transaction fees involving the use of LYL as payment and its exchange into other rewards points Appsolutely will also earn from subscription fees connected with the LoyalCoalition the white label apps we create and the use of APIs connected to the platform The revenues that we earn from the LoyalPlatform will be further used on the scalability and widespread adoption of LYL as well as arrangements that sustain the platform and its attractiveness to both companies and consumers 17 \x0cROADMAP October 2017 Introduction of LoyalCoin November 2017 Start of Work on LoyalWallet March
