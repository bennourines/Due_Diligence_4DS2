platform We want to start a new chapter with you and for you We want a revolution This whitepaper has been published on 7 of September of 2018 We strongly recommend you to follow updates and new informations on MindexCoin website and other official media channels 4 \x0cExecutive summary MINDEXCOIN will be a revolutionary payment platform that enables buyers to use their favorite cryptocurrency in order to pay sellers (private or merchants) The MINDEXCOIN platform aims to provide the consumer protection that buyers take for granted in traditional online purchases acting as a mediator resolving conflicts and enabling the possibility of refunds to mitigate fraud while shielding the merchant fromcrypto market volatility We want to build upon the best features of cryptocurrencies to enable fast transactions lower feesand low cross border transaction friction enabling merchants to sell to a growingworldwide audience of crypto holders In summation we aim to build a payment API for marketplace integration that will become the crypto contender to PayPal and ours All afore mentioned features we intend to integrate would make for an incredible product in its own right the first of its kind in the world of cryptopayments and onethat could be funded by venture capital investment alone We decided to go a step beyond creating an innovative idea and product by offering the chance for anyone in the world to become a supporter leveraging the power of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and issue our own MINDEXCOIN token (MIC) alongside the MINDEXCOIN platform In essence the token will act as a contribution from our supporters as a transactional token that buyers can use in the MINDEXCOIN Platform itself along side other major coins and as a financial mechanism linking the MIC value to the MINDEXCOIN platform value our strategic value coupling mechanism 5 \x0cThis is an ambitious endeavor intended to build a comprehensive software platform from the ground up while bringing tangible value to our supporters in the form oftoken appreciation and to the community of buyers and sellers driving its futuregrowth in the form of platform transactions We believe cryptocurrencies areevolving to become much more than speculation and are here to stay in the mindsand wallets of consumers Key Summary Pre ICO Start Date ICO Start Date Rounds Executive

blockchain technology built an ecosystem depending on openness censorship resistance transparent and immutable transactions It is all about decentralized science We also believe that cryptocurrencies are the key role to a new online financial market that is facilitating transactions and making secure payments with widely acceptance and no barriers Current payment platforms are lacking agility and practicality in addition to high transactions cost Meanwhile blockchain digital tokens encryption and ICOs are being a new bridge between benefits and investors ICOs are a way to leverage and fund a new project a new team team with inspiring minds and unique platform platform with real purpose and real value to make incorruptible payments and transactions followed by a revenue from fair fees 7 \x0cProblem Although blockchain technology provides advanced features and advantages digital payments are increasing significantly after digital currencies and it is still one area largely untapped Likewise there is an increase of new and different cryptocurrencies being launched weekly Despite the exceptional features of crypto payments such as barrier free low fees speed and safety cryptocurrency still has yet to be implemented as money transfer service and global payment method With so many different payment options and different coins being thrown all the time on the media lots of people are trying to discover the new and trying to pursue the best method Lots of people have being looking for a way to make cryptocurrency more usual and present day to day and lots of people are tracing \xe2\x80\x98signals\xe2\x80\x99 to trade it at exchanges by their own Just a few of them really worked and just a few of them are successful Waste of time waste of work and waste of money And believe us we have lost too 8 \x0cSolution Trying to solve one case at a time and studying another different cases of cryptocurrency we got our final goal To help people People like you and people like us Our aim is to build the next chapter of cryptocurrency the next level We decided to come up with a universal payment method digital and decentralized payment method A method to simplify
