application collaboration on creative contents With a \xe2\x80\x8breinvented Like button and our unique \xe2\x80\x8bLikeRank algorithm we trace content footprint and reward content creators by P \xe2\x80\x8b roof of Creativity\xe2\x80\x8b mechanism Realigning rewards and creativity In the Internet rewards and creativity have been decoupled for long This is especially true for independent content creators and freelancers In the early days of the Internet indies made money by selling their works online All technical aspects of the Internet are now dramatically improved yet the revenue model is not In fact it is worse Content creators are not getting incomes but \xe2\x80\x8bLikes\xe2\x80\x8b While some can take freelance projects and advertising jobs such model is rather indirect LikeCoin protocol is thus designed to monetise creative contents directly so that creators can focus on creating great contents rather than selling or looking for business models As technology evolves everyone with a smartphone is a content creator of some sort In particular some photos taken by smartphones may have quality and resolution as high as single lens reflex cameras The crowds of freelance content creators and citizen journalists are huge and the market demand is extremely high Once rewards and creativity are realigned an explosive potential will be unlocked 2 \x0cElements in the LikeCoin Ecosystem An ecosystem of collaborated content creation involves various elements and stakeholders Their roles in the LikeCoin ecosystem are defined with the following example where

Attribution Protocol LikeCoin creates unique fingerprints for creative contents and traces footprints of all derivative works along with content creator and service provider of them Further than that LikeCoin incentivises attribution and cross application collaboration with Proof of Creativity mechanism LikeCoin technical stacks Decentralised creative content library The cornerstone of LikeCoin protocol is a global decentralised and resilient creative content library on\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bIPFS1 A LikeCoin service provider plays one or more roles among original creator content adopter and content distributor Original creators curate creative contents and record the data on blockchain for other content creators to use The content creator and the service provider both get LikeCoin as an incentive when a content is \xe2\x80\x8bLiked \xe2\x80\x8bor \xe2\x80\x8bSuper liked (see \xe2\x80\x8bLikeCoin Mining Protocol\xe2\x80\x8b) Two major original creators funded by LikeCoin Foundation

contract An example of content adopter is \xe2\x80\x8boice\xe2\x80\x8b an asset remixing storytelling editor also funded by LikeCoin Foundation A content distributor on the other hand displays or plays the creative contents in the LikeCoin ecosystem Some examples include \xe2\x80\x8bFamisu\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bLifehack org\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bThe Initium and \xe2\x80\x8bThe Stand News\xe2\x80\x8b etc Each original creator and content adopter runs her own \xe2\x80\x8bIPFS node and is responsible for \xe2\x80\x8bpinning all the files she curates from content creators so they are not removed Since Juan Benet IPFS White Paper https //ipfs io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs draft3 pdf 1 5 \x0cworldwide \xe2\x80\x8bIPFS nodes help one another distribute the contents such decentralised creative content library also serves as a content distribution network speeding up access from locations unreachable by Internet backbone Service providers do not have to be concerned about from which IPFS node users will retrieve the content In the library each creative content is addressable by a cryptographic hash rather than a URL Any changes in the application layer such as domain name IP and directory structure induce no change to the content address since the hash depends only on the content itself The content address is thus decoupled from the application where it was created on and where it is used making it consistent and future proof This prevents creative contents from being locked up by specific applications such as Facebook and Instagram Such cryptographic hash is called \xe2\x80\x8bcontent fingerprint \xe2\x80\x8bin the LikeCoin protocol As an example let\xe2\x80\x99s say content creator \xe2\x80\x8bAlice has painted

IPLD objects are stored 7 \x0con IPFS they are represented by 1 to 1 hashes as well Such feature is used to build content footprint \xe2\x80\x8bof every creative content to be discussed in the next

\xe2\x80\x8bare both stored in IPFS as \xe2\x80\x8bcontent metadata objects\xe2\x80\x8b which further refers to the corresponding \xe2\x80\x8bcontent creator objects and \xe2\x80\x8bservice provider

footprint of a new creative content can only reference existing content fingerprints so that the content footprint relations form a directed acyclic graph similar to a citation graph This structure allows easy analysis of inheritance tree of a particular creative content It also prevents the existence of any reference loop in the profit sharing process Now \xe2\x80\x8bDavid\xe2\x80\x8b a content

B \xe2\x80\x8bcan also be traced as the level 2 content source of I\xe2\x80\x8b mage D\xe2\x80\x8b While there are various blockchain projects such as po et2 and KODAKCoin3 which use technology similar to content fingerprint to keep track of photo copyright LikeCoin traces the derivative works of a content with this unique \xe2\x80\x8bcontent footprint\xe2\x80\x8b technology Content fingerprint is static and tells who owns the content while content footprint is dynamic and traces how contents flow from a content creator to another from a service provider to another Content fingerprint is about ownership while content footprint is about collaboration We do think protecting content creators copyright is a noble task but the mission of LikeCoin is instead to help maximise creativity with reasonable rewards under a permissive license such as Creative Commons \xe2\x80\x8bContent footprint forms the fundamental of the LikeCoin mining mechanism to be discussed in the next

ago Larry Page and his classmates at Stanford published the now famous paper \xe2\x80\x9cThe PageRank Citation Ranking Bringing Order to the Web\xe2\x80\x9d4 which became the fundamental technology of Google search Inspired by citation of research paper PageRank was revolutionary As the title of the paper says it brings order to the web Prior than PageRank web searches almost always resulted in web pages which did include the keyword yet irrelevant However PageRank can only cover web pages but not creative contents such as images footage and music We know the \xe2\x80\x8bimportance \xe2\x80\x8bof a web page which often includes various creative contents but not the \xe2\x80\x8bimportance of a particular creative content LikeRank is designed to address that Based on content footprint tracing in the LikeCoin protocol \xe2\x80\x8bLikeRank measures the importance or \xe2\x80\x8bcreativity \xe2\x80\x8bas we define it in this context of a creative content In general the more derivative works a creative content generates the more \xe2\x80\x8bcreative the creative content is and thus the higher LikeRank of the content LikeRank is the quantifier of the creativity of contents LikeRank proof of concept \xe2\x80\x8bPage Lawrence and Brin Sergey and Motwani Rajeev and Winograd Terry (1999) \xe2\x80\x8bThe PageRank Citation Ranking Bringing Order to the Web 4 12 \x0cAs one may easily see such definition of \xe2\x80\x8bcreativity \xe2\x80\x8bis to encourage sharing and favour contents with more permissive open license terms For example other conditions being equal contents licensed under cc0 enjoys a higher LikeRank than those licensed in CC BY NC ND In contrast a more restrictive license such as all rights reserved copyright lowers LikeRank Also with a permissive license more derivative works will be generated which helps boost LikeRank LikeRank is also used to incentivise proper attribution through LikeCoin protocol A properly attributed creative content enjoys a LikeRank bonus while a derivative work without following the attribution protocol will not receive LikeCoin since the derivative work does not have content fingerprint and outside of the LikeCoin ecosystem all together That is to say LikeCoin is to promote permissive license while at the same time tailor make a business model for it Contradictory to the traditional wisdom the more open is the license term of a content the more likely it is for the content to earn LikeCoin because of the higher LikeRank and also the increased number of derivative works Like Button reinvented While PageRank is 20 years old Like button is 10 The Like button was launched on Oct 30 2007 by Friendfeed which was acquired by Facebook Like button was revolutionary but over the years it deteriorates Getting thousands of Likes hardly means anything anymore And from the very beginning till now it has never meant any income for content creators no matter how many Likes a content receives the content creator gets nothing LikeCoin is to change that LikeCoin\xe2\x80\x99s Like button is designed to combine two user experiences into one By tapping/clicking the Like button for 1 to 5 times or long press/hover then drag to 1 5 a user shows his/her appreciation and helps the content creator to \xe2\x80\x8bmine LikeCoin from Creators Pool If the user really appreciates s/he may go directly to \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Like\xe2\x80\x9d to pay the content creator certain amount of LikeCoin from his/her own wallet We combine the two user experience not only for simplicity but also to cultivate user behavior over time Most Internet users are used to showing appreciation to contents at no cost only a small fraction of them pay content creators out of their own pockets We believe creative contents have intrinsic value and content consumers are receiving 13 \x0cvalue To supplement the advertising model we make possible a new ecosystem where content consumers pay content creators directly according to their level of appreciation Proof of Creativity While blockchain miners usually understand mining as solving a mathematical problem it does not have to be the case Say for example proof of stake (PoS) mechanism does not involve hash power and thus has little impact on environment With a focus on rewarding content creators LikeCoin measures the importance of creative contents i e \xe2\x80\x8bcreativity\xe2\x80\x8b and allows content creators to \xe2\x80\x8bmine LikeCoin with their creative contents We call the mechanism p \xe2\x80\x8b roof of creativity\xe2\x80\x8b or \xe2\x80\x8bPoC\xe2\x80\x8b PoC defines creativity in two dimensions 1 The higher the LikeRank of a creative content is the more creative it is 2 The more Likes a creative content receives the more creative it is A creators pool of 1bil which accounts for 50% of total number of LikeCoin tokens in the long run is reserved as the \xe2\x80\x8bmining pool\xe2\x80\x8b At each day \xe2\x80\x8bt \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bx LikeCoin will be minted from creators pool for distribution to content creators according to the formula x = x = N 1+e\xe2\x88\x92 t\xe2\x88\x92730 120 N \xe2\x88\x92 1+e when t = 0 to 1460 0 4(1461\xe2\x88\x92t)+730 120 when t > 1460 N = 391132 253127 14 \x0cThe minting formula is designed based on the following principles and assumptions 1 Majority (90%+) of the creators pool should take 10 years to mint We believe consumers receive value by high quality creative contents and encourage them to pay voluntarily But attitude cultivation is a long process so we allocate 10 years for consumers to convert Ultimately we target to have tipping model coexist with advertising model 2 The minting should smooth out after 10 year period with a very long tail in our formulae 28 years This gives the community time to adopt 3 The minting should have a slow start It allows time for content creators and service providers to join the LikeCoin ecosystem and avoid early birds to be overly beneficial 4 After one year however it is assumed that number of creative contents increases quickly 5 The factor \xe2\x80\x8bdifficulty \xe2\x80\x8bwill be set every day so that the total number of LikeCoin distributed to content creators equals the total number of LikeCoin minted Take day 365 as an example x= 391132 253127 = 17 827 LikeCoin are minted At the t\xe2\x88\x92730 1+e\xe2\x88\x92 120 same day 10 000 creative contents have received a total of 1 000 000 Likes across all the service providers At end of day 365 GMT LikeCoin will be distributed to the 10 000 creative contents according to the number of Likes they received as well as their LikeRank When a derivative work receives Like the original content(s) receive a cut of
