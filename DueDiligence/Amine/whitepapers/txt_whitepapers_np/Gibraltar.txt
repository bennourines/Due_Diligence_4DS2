Limited Page 5 \x0cIntroduction GBX Limited a subsidiary of GSX Limited the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (\xe2\x80\x9cGSX\xe2\x80\x9d) is launching an initial token sale (\xe2\x80\x9cToken Sale\xe2\x80\x9d) for the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (\xe2\x80\x9cGBX\xe2\x80\x9d) utility token the Rock Token (\xe2\x80\x9cRKT\xe2\x80\x9d) GBX \xe2\x80\x93 the first of its kind The GBX aims to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s first licensed and regulated token sale platform and digital asset exchange operated by a European Union (\xe2\x80\x9cEU\xe2\x80\x9d) regulated stock exchange Using a sponsor and rules based system the GBX will apply to be licensed by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cGFSC\xe2\x80\x9d) under the Financial Services (Distributed Ledger Technology Providers) Regulations 2017 (\xe2\x80\x9cDLT Regulations\xe2\x80\x9d) which came into operation on 1 January 2018 in Gibraltar More specifically GBX is expected to be (a) a global listing and token sales springboard for utility tokens that have satisfied a strict due diligence process and admission process set out in the \xe2\x80\x9cGBX Rules\xe2\x80\x9d and (b) a high quality digital asset exchange including a marketplace where issuers of utility tokens traders and investors can participate with confidence and trust in a platform where the tokens listed have been subjected to an institutional grade approval process Commitment to digital assets The GSX intends to develop a fully tokenised stock exchange system that will aim to provide a pathway from listing and trading initial token sales through to accessing funding via the traditional bond market or equity issuance route This should give issuers an opportunity to issue tokenised securities to a wider capital base Why Rock Token matters Rock Token is the proposed \xe2\x80\x9ccurrency of choice\xe2\x80\x9d for GBX and its supporting financial services and fintech ecosystem In designing the utility aspects of the Rock Token GBX considered several questions \xe2\x80\xa2 What is the core brand and value proposition of the GBX platform itself \xe2\x80\xa2 Who are the intended users of the platform and how are they likely to perceive RKT\xe2\x80\x99s value \xe2\x80\xa2 How can the token be used to incentivise ideal behaviour discourage misbehaviour and improve the overall user experience \xe2\x80\xa2 What is the roadmap of the project and how can Rock Token support that This whitepaper explains how the Rock Token serves the GBX platform in three primary ways \xe2\x97\x8f Create an engaged community reflecting the shared buy in in the overall vision \xe2\x97\x8f Deliver premium opportunities for users committed to a safe forward thinking industry \xe2\x97\x8f Incentivise community members to uphold GBX values Rock Token helps the GBX brand to be anchored in trust and integrity See Part G for further details GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 6 \x0cAbout this document This whitepaper details the GBX strategy our vision for the broader ecosystem key aspects of the issuance of the RKT and how RKT is expected to be applied throughout GBX The \xe2\x80\x9cKey Facts Schedule\xe2\x80\x9d also provides a summary of the key information about GBX Limited GBX RKT and the Token Sale Any sale of Rock Tokens is subject to separate terms and is not available in all jurisdictions and to all purchasers All projects carry variables and contingencies For the avoidance of doubt the licensing of GBX and certain other initiatives as proposed in this whitepaper are subject to regulatory approval You must read all relevant documents and obtain the advice you need before making any decision to purchase Rock Tokens RKT is not for everyone GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 7 \x0cPart A \xe2\x80\x93 Industry and Project Overview 1 Industry overview World Economic Forum \xe2\x80\x93 June 2017 \xe2\x80\x9cLike the first generation of the internet this second generation promises to disrupt business models and transform industries Blockchain (also called distributed ledger) the technology enabling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is pulling us into a new era of openness 1 decentralization and global inclusion \xe2\x80\x9d We are fortunate to live in a disruptive time Since the invention of Bitcoin in 2008 the ideals of decentralisation public consensus and creating new trust models between parties conducting transactions has been embraced Principles of consensus efficiency and mutual trust are treasured by the community as demonstrated by the rapid adoption of blockchain technology cryptocurrencies and other digital assets by both businesses and individuals in numerous jurisdictions globally Token sales have captured imaginations giving rise to a wide range of innovative new projects and generating unexpectedly large amounts of funds To date over USD $3 4 billion has been raised via token sales (source Coindesk) The flexibility and speed to market of token sales has created a fundamental change in fund raising however it comes with several associated risks Governments and regulators around the world have struggled to find a solution for dealing with fund raising via token issuance without inhibiting business or the development of new technology At a high level we can categorise three types of digital assets as follows (a) medium of exchange digital assets these are digital coins and other digital assets such as Bitcoin in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units and verify their transfer They operate independently of a central bank or other issuer (b) utility tokens these are digital assets that are intended to facilitate access to services or units of services that can be purchased with those assets These tokens can be compared to API keys used to access the service and (c) tokenised securities these are digital assets that represent a regulated \xe2\x80\x9csecurity\xe2\x80\x9d product in a particular jurisdiction Regulations and structures vary widely but generally this can capture products that are (or reflect interests in) shares debentures managed investment schemes and structured products Digital assets can also serve as digital representations of tangible assets There are also various other possible types of digital assets and more will undoubtedly emerge 2 Gibraltar \xe2\x80\x93 DLT Regulatory Framework In January 2016 HM Government of Gibraltar published for consultation a document titled \xe2\x80\x9cVirtual Currency Outline Regulatory Framework\xe2\x80\x9d for the consideration of regulating distributed ledger technology (\xe2\x80\x9cDLT\xe2\x80\x9d) firms After considering the feedback received further detailed work continued on this project The consultation process indicated a strong preference from firms for the GFSC to be the regulator for such activities 1 1 http //www fsc gi/news/cryptocurrency working group distributed ledger technology dlt the way forward 231 GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 8 \x0cOn 9 May 2017 the GFSC in conjunction with HM Government of Gibraltar published a consultation paper entitled \xe2\x80\x9cProposals for a DLT Regulatory Framework\xe2\x80\x9d 2 The paper included the \xe2\x80\x9cthree pillars\xe2\x80\x9d of the desired regulatory outcomes and the \xe2\x80\x9cnine DLT principles\xe2\x80\x9d The consultation paper explored an approach to (a) provide regulatory certainty for DLT firms based in and

growth in technology and fintech skills in the jurisdiction (e) provide sufficient flexibility to enable the effective regulation of novel business activities products processes and business models (f) enhance consumer confidence in dealing with properly regulated firms using novel technology and (g) encourage DLT firms to be established in Gibraltar because there is an appropriate regime for regulating their activities On 12 October 2017 HM Government of Gibraltar published the DLT Regulations 3 The DLT Regulations came into operation on 1 January 2018 When establishing the regulatory framework HM Government of Gibraltar recognised that it should be flexible to adapt to new cases and new uses of DLT and that it needed to be able to be applied to a wide variation of DLT firms and as such the DLT Regulations are principles based as opposed to being prescriptive The \xe2\x80\x9cnine DLT principles\xe2\x80\x9d require that a DLT firm must 2 3 (a) conduct its business with honesty and integrity (b) pay due regard to the interests and needs of each and all its customers and must communicate with its customers in a way which is fair clear and not misleading (c) maintain adequate financial and non financial resources (d) manage and control its business effectively and conduct its business with due skill care and diligence including having proper regard to risks to its business and customers (e) have effective arrangements in place for the protection of client assets and money when it is responsible for them (f) have effective corporate governance arrangements (g) ensure that all systems and security access protocols are maintained to appropriate high standards (h) have systems in place to prevent detect and disclose financial crime risks such as money laundering and

a unique institutional position GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 12 \x0cPart B \xe2\x80\x93 The GBX Market This Part B sets out GBX\xe2\x80\x99s aims in respect of the GBX Market which consists of the token sale platform and digital asset exchange for utility tokens fully integrated within a single user sign on and consolidated in a single website and platform 8 Token sale platform for utility tokens To achieve its goals GBX will 8 1 (a) create a platform that can list utility tokens (b) create a rules based system (c) establish a network of firms to guide and advise token issuers through the listing process (\xe2\x80\x9cSponsors\xe2\x80\x9d) (d) establish a network of ancillary services (in house and external) and (e) establish a network of users Create a token sale platform GBX proposes to build a high quality token listing platform By operating at a high standard and with token listing best practices we are confident of attracting the best quality token listings to GBX which should in turn attract the best quality of token buyers (both accredited and individual buyers) We expect this will result in an ecosystem of quality token buyers and token issuers with extensive global participation Key components of the GBX token sale platform include (a) operation the GBX token sale platform will function via a website with a database back end which means users access the platform through an external application (b) token admission tokens will be admitted to the GBX token sale platform only after successfully completing GBX\xe2\x80\x99s compliance process (c) token sale payment types at the initial stages of the GBX token sale platform token issuers will be able to receive Ether and/or Rock Tokens in consideration for their token listing (d) tracking performance token issuers will be able monitor the progress of their token issuance via GBX\xe2\x80\x99s Website and subsequently monitor the trading of their tokens via GBX\xe2\x80\x99s digital asset exchange (e) buyer deposits and withdrawals token buyers will be able to deposit and withdraw fiat currencies and tokens to and from their wallets (f) AML/KYC compliance token buyers will be required to undergo AML/KYC compliance procedures in order to open an account with GBX Upon approval token issuers can then sell their tokens to AML/KYC compliant purchasers This arrangement should resolve common AML/KYC issues relating to public sales of tokens and allows for GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 13 \x0cregulatory oversight over the token sale process by GBX acting within the framework of Gibraltar\xe2\x80\x99s DLT Regulations (g) token buyer segmentation token buyers will be segmented into various categories based on jurisdiction professional or individual and token buying experience which token issuers can then use to target buyer segments according to their various legal/jurisdictional needs and (h) security security automation will be a core element of GBX\xe2\x80\x99s systems to support its security infrastructure (see Section 9(g)) 8 2 Establish clear requirements and a trusted listing process (a) Admission and listing requirements GBX will establish admission and listing requirements that will set out the process for the listing and admission of tokens to market as well as ongoing obligations for listing These codes will draw from community initiatives \xe2\x80\x9cfirst in class\xe2\x80\x9d principles and GSX best practices More specifically GBX will issue requirements relating to (i) the tokens themselves including their admission listing trading and continuing obligations (ii) Sponsors such as eligibility and obligations and (iii) the operation of the GBX Market There will also be overarching requirements for all GBX Market participants (b) Trusted listing process The expected process for listing tokens is summarised below (i) Appoint a Sponsor all token issuers seeking

completed the approved token can be traded on the secondary market of the GBX Market in accordance with the GBX Rules (vii) Issuance the tokens are issued Existing tokens listed and trading on other exchanges can also apply to be approved and admitted by GBX to its digital asset exchange but will have to comply with the GBX Rules in order to be admitted to trading Illustrative diagram \xe2\x80\x93 new and existing tokens The following diagram demonstrates the proposed listing process for new and existing tokens 8 3 Establish a network of Sponsors GBX will play an important role in the global blockchain community and Sponsors will form an integral part of such a role Sponsors have a duty to uphold the quality reputation and integrity of the GBX Market They will play a crucial role in maintaining quality in the market and in particular are responsible for critically assessing the appropriateness of an Applicant for admission Sponsors will be required to ensure the Applicant meets the GBX eligibility criteria is suitable for admission and to assess the likelihood of an Applicant affecting the integrity and reputation of GBX A vital component of such determination is the due diligence process that Sponsors will be required to undertake GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 15 \x0cGBX proposes to require Sponsors to (a) conduct due diligence adopt a consistent set of key due diligence parameters in accordance with the GBX requirements Sponsors will be required to conduct due diligence on the Applicant\xe2\x80\x99s senior management and controllers (including directors shareholders and beneficial owners) as well as consider in detail aspects of the Applicant\xe2\x80\x99s legal financial and commercial proposition and the viability of the Project as a whole The use of accredited third party due diligence providers to provide detailed commercial compliance reports may in certain cases be required (b) advise Applicants and liaise with GBX be responsible for advising Applicants on their obligations and guiding them through the admission process Sponsors are also responsible for dealing with GBX on all matters relating to the application listing and continuing obligations of tokens admitted to the official list and (c) fit and proper have appropriate financial and personnel resources for the role that they are to perform They must be fit and proper have appropriate organisational arrangements and will be required to undertake to GBX to accept and discharge those responsibilities at all times to the satisfaction of GBX Drawing from \xe2\x80\x9cfirst in class\xe2\x80\x9d principles and GSX best practices GBX envisages establishing a trusted network of Sponsors who will play a crucial role in maintaining the quality of the GBX Market GBX will set eligibility criteria and a code of conduct with the aim of attracting world class proven experts in the token sale sector Innovative fee and staking mechanisms will help ensure Sponsors have a shared ethos to grow GBX with responsibility and accountability The specific mechanisms envisaged are as follows (See Part G for more details) (i) Fee payment \xe2\x80\x93 Fees paid by an Applicant to a Sponsor should include at least 20% of the total fees payable to the Sponsor for non disbursement fees paid in the Applicant\xe2\x80\x99s tokens The Sponsor will be obliged to hold these tokens for a minimum of 6 months when vesting (or \xe2\x80\x9clock up\xe2\x80\x9d) restrictions will be lifted (ii) Staking \xe2\x80\x93 In addition each Sponsor will stake a fixed amount of Rock Tokens (to be held in GBX escrow) for 12 months equivalent to 0 5% of the total tokens issued through each token sale that they are sponsoring and which are admitted to trading on GBX The full details of the Sponsor rules and application requirements will be released in the separate \xe2\x80\x9cSponsor Rules\xe2\x80\x9d once finalised Presently there is interest from more than 20 well qualified organisations to be Sponsors More are expected to be added over time 8 4 Establish the GBX Ecosystem The GBX Ecosystem is expected to be a network of ancillary services both in house and external to support the GBX token sale platform from payment facilities to company formation and duediligence services This is described further in Part D GBX aims to work only with the highest

\xe2\x80\x93 The GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange This Part C sets out GBX\xe2\x80\x99s vision in respect of the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange 10 Overview GBX and GSX clearly distinguish between utility tokens (which includes medium of exchange tokens) and tokenised securities GBX is the planned regulated marketplace for utility tokens with GSX planned to be the regulated marketplace for tokenised securities 11 About GSX The following chart provides an overview of the key aspects of GSX and its proposed overall product scope and structure GSX is licensed and regulated by the GFSC under licence number FSC123B (issued on 11 November 2014) GSX operates two markets (a) GSX Main Market an EU regulated market recognised by ESMA and by the United Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s tax authority (HMRC) under S1005 (1)(b) Income Tax Act 2007 for funds and debt securities and (b) GSX Global Market a self regulated market which is a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) as defined under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004/39/EC (MiFID) for funds and debt securities As a relatively new exchange GSX has had the opportunity to develop fresh practices and build new infrastructure rather than being hampered by legacy systems GSX aims to take this one step further by becoming one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s first tokenised securities exchange providing a new level of market efficiency access liquidity and transparency in the capital markets By GSX implementing a blockchain solution GSX plans to build a secure and controlled environment for the issuance trading and holding of tokenised securities for market participants who have passed AML/KYC compliance GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 20 \x0c12 About the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange 12 1 Key features The GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange is planned to function as a transparent auditable ledger such that participants will be registered holders of the tokenised securities at every stage of the trading process This is by virtue of utilising the record keeping functionality of DLT for the benefit of the exchange issuers the participants and regulators alike The GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange is expected to provide access to the capital markets for a wide variety of issuers and participants including (a) traditional and non traditional counterparts including global conglomerates institutional licensees operating companies family businesses investment vehicles family offices and ETFs and (b) participants who can trade within the GSX marketplace and build investment portfolios with confidence and without the layers of intermediaries barriers to entry and cost associated with traditional markets This has the potential to give participants access to a spectrum of investments capital and/or income generating assets that might not otherwise be possible in the same manner and to the same degree under a traditional stock exchange model With the adoption of the blockchain based trading system the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange will dramatically boost efficiencies whilst reducing costs by integrating the entire spectrum of exchange services including but not limited to listing execution clearing settlement AML/KYC controls and processes security digital identity management and custody 12 2 Timing and progress We aim to be able to list tokenised securities by Q3 2018 while employing a blockchainbased trading system for such tokenised securities by Q4 2018 We are already in the design phase of a blockchain based trading system that will be able to offer all the benefits and effectiveness of the DLT while ensuring such securities remain registered and compliant under current EU Securities regulations during secondary trading 12 3 Opportunities for GBX listed token issuers GSX aims to open up new markets and create new opportunities for collaboration It will also serve as the next destination point for tokens listed on the GBX digital asset exchange As the token issuers of the GBX token listings grow in their business they may apply to list a security token on the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange and get further access to capital raising opportunities Issuers that are listed on the GBX digital asset exchange will receive fast track access with faster processing times to list security tokens on the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange giving more options to raise capital They will also have access to a more diverse investor base as they grow including possible dual listing opportunities on other stock exchanges

proposed Rock Token and the Token Sale 21 Overview The functioning of GBX GSX and the GBX Ecosystem are proposed to be supported by GBX\xe2\x80\x99s utility token the Rock Token The Rock Token is an ERC 20 compliant token to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain and used and accepted throughout the GBX GSX and the GBX Ecosystem The ERC 20 token standard prescribes the functions that a token on the Ethereum blockchain should incorporate to enable the issuance distribution and control of tokens in a standardised manner It is a set of guidelines that a token issue contract should adhere to in order to be compatible with most wallet software The Rock Token contract will adhere to the ERC 20 token standard by declaring six standardised function names and two standardised event handles This standardisation makes it easy for decentralised application developers to utilise Rock Token in the future and ensure maximum exposure and adoption 22 Utility token The Rock Token is considered to be a \xe2\x80\x9cutility token\xe2\x80\x9d and is intended to be used for (a) settling of the GBX application fee ( Application Fee ) listing fees (\xe2\x80\x9cListing Fees\xe2\x80\x9d) and Sponsor fees (\xe2\x80\x9cSponsor Fees\xe2\x80\x9d) on GBX (b) staking by Sponsors on GBX (c) settling trading fees (\xe2\x80\x9cTrading Fees\xe2\x80\x9d) on the GBX Market (d) medium to pay fees in the GBX

well as the mechanism of the staking model and token utility will be further detailed in the separate GBX Rules Given the expected coherence of interests among Rock Token holders it is our view that GBX can be properly thought of as a community with the following intended initial model 22 1 22 2 Member use \xe2\x80\xa2 Member classification a person may apply to open an account with GBX subject to compliance with applicable AML/KYC and other procedures and any restrictions imposed by GBX All approved GBX account holders (wallets) will be classed as \xe2\x80\x9cMembers\xe2\x80\x9d

be paid for using RKT \xe2\x80\xa2 Trading Fees Members will have the option of holding a minimum amount (such amount to be determined in due course) of RKT and utilising it to pay their Trading Fees which may result in a lower overall transactional cost Issuer use \xe2\x80\xa2 Issuer classification a person may become a GBX issuer by listing a token on the GBX digital asset exchange subject to compliance with the GBX Rules \xe2\x80\xa2 Listing payments an issuer must settle the Application Fee and Listing Fee in RKT The Listing Fee is expected to comprise o the GBX listing fee (85% of the total face value of the Listing Fees) and o the staked RKT (15% of the total face value of the Listing Fees) Staked RKT is proposed to be held in escrow and returned after 24 months if the issuer has complied with its obligations However if it fails to do so GBX will not return the RKT and it may be used for other purposes GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper \xc2\xa9 GBX Limited Page 32 \x0cThe Appendix sets out the expected initial Application Fee and Listing Fee 22 3 23 \xe2\x80\xa2 Minimum token sale proceeds in RKT an issuer that lists on the GBX digital asset exchange must raise at least 10% of the value of tokens in RKT If the actual sale proceeds collected from the sale are in other forms of payment then the issuer will have to purchase the shortfall of RKT to top it up to 10% \xe2\x80\xa2 Issuer staking of RKT an issuer will stake by permitting GBX to hold in escrow half of the Rock Tokens required to be raised as described above for a period of 12 months The issuer staked RKT will be repayable in four equal proportions paid quarterly the first quarter being 3 months after the admission to trading of the tokens The amounts staked will be held by GBX as part of a claims
