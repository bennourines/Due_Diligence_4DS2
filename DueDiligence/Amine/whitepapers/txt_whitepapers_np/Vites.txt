White paper V1 1 \x0c3 Introduction to the Vites Ecosystem Vites Ecosystem is a modern age freelance marketplace created with the aim to resolve issues faced by traditional freelance industry and

cryptocurrency 6 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c6 Background The global freelance economy has been growing by leaps and bounds in the recent years enabling the world to be a global marketplace where employers and resources both get an equal chance of success Employers avail the opportunity to tap the right pool of human resource from anywhere in the world while the freelancers have the liberty to get hired with the help of technology driven tools irrespective of their location Organizations tap into the competitive global market and select a competent resource from many fields including marketing and communication design business consulting or programming and software development The biggest advantage for employers is in terms of the cost effectiveness of remote working and the affordability of resource options from a foreign market Freelancers cost businesses less to retain than hiring a full time employee and in most cases freelancers do not get benefits such as insurance and paid leave They can be hired on a job by job basis and let go without the risk of being hit with a wrongful termination lawsuit And because freelancers are usually hired for a very specific task they are already specialists in their fields and do not require training to complete the job In the section below we discuss the current industry overview forecast for coming years and the current competition 7 Industry overview Payoneer\xe2\x80\x94a leading payment processor for freelancers all across the world\xe2\x80\x94 set out to capture the state of affairs for freelancers worldwide in

Economic Forum 9 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c8 Future forecast of the freelance marketplace Source Upwork com Source Upwork com Source Upwork com 10 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c9 Vites competitors and their profit distribution models The current centralized freelance platforms have a simple pay structure The platform takes a cut of all payments Some charge a flat rate on all transactions while others charge variable rates depending on the type of work Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick breakdown of the fees of the major platforms \xe2\x80\xa2 Upwork 20% up to $500 10% up to $10 000 5% over $10 000 per client \xe2\x80\xa2 Codeable 15% \xe2\x80\xa2 Fiverr 20% from seller ($1 for a $5 gig) 5% from a buyer \xe2\x80\xa2 Freelancer com 13% (3% to employers 10% to freelancers) \xe2\x80\xa2 TopTal Undisclosed High hourly rates of $65\xe2\x80\x93200 These fees can quickly add up For a small $500 freelance project on Upwork the fees will already be at $100 before the PayPal fees are added For large $100 000 project on Codeable the fee would be $15 000 for just a single gig The payment options are pretty similar for all the platforms with most accepting credit cards PayPal or bank transfers and paying freelancers via PayPal Payoneer and bank transfers None of the major platforms accept or payout in cryptocurrency yet There are some smaller startups that accept cryptocurrency payments such as XBTFreelancer a 100% Bitcoin based freelancer platform But these projects haven\xe2\x80\x99t really taken off with only a few projects posted a day in all categories 11 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c10 Challenges While the demand for freelance work is growing worldwide so is the competition Setting and negotiating rates can often be challenging Despite their popularity these freelance marketplaces have struggled to solve a number of ongoing problems Making prompt and efficient payments to millions of freelancers in hundreds of different countries is proving to be a real challenge Ensuring the quality of work delivered to clients is another major headache as is helping new freelancers get started on a platform Having a middleman to execute this duty comes at prices 10 1 Massive fee charged by middleman Traditional platforms such as Fiverr and Upwork etc charge a seller 20% of their earning while the buyer has to pay 5% extra as commission which means around one quarter of the order activity is taken as commission Also while withdrawing the earned money a seller has to pay 2 4% extra fee depending on the payment processor 10 2 Slow Payment Processing In most freelance platforms the payment process is extremely inefficient You need to wait for at least two weeks in order to be enabled to withdraw your money if you are a seller on Fiverr Similarly on Upwork even when you have waited ed for a fortnight to be able to release your payment if you are withdrawing your money to a local bank ba account or another payment processor you have to pay an extra fee which again lowers your total earning 12 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c10 3 Outdated Dispute Resolution It has been reported in a various instance where sellers (service providers) were deprived of their earning only because the buyer had placed an unjust dispute Chargebacks after months of successful delivery of a service activity buyer taking a service and threatening to leave unjust reviews and poor dispute resolution is a major problem faced by freelancers 10 4 Poor review and rating Model In traditional platforms while there is a strict penalty (lower ratings gig placement and ranking) for a seller the buyer gets away even if he/she tries to manipulate the rating system and blackmail/ pres surize a service provider for extra service (something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come under the original Scope of work) Moreover as these platforms are in charge of the rules in how the rating calculated and how they are displayed in case of a bad and unjust review for a seller can be devastating 10 5 Unjust Suspension of user accounts Unjust suspension of account because of manipulated buyer complaints IP address matching and faulty algorithms detecting normal chat as an attempt of outside communication The rating is the key element for the freelancers as this is what the employer does the evaluation when making the employment and that needs years of time to cultivate upon the platform These rating data is owned by the platform and can\xe2\x80\x99t be shared among other platforms 10 6 Lacking voice and video calling feature Majority of the platforms today lacks voice and video calling feature because of which a buyer and seller has to rely on the chat This may cause serious problems and misunderstanding 13 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c11 Vites Solutions Vites Ecosystem will incorporate freelance based services to its platform and allow its users to avail quality services directly at their home or office\xe2\x80\x94without the need of hiring an employee physically or biding a contract through third party The platform will protect interests of its users through deployment of the transactional activities on *blockchain and trustless *smart contracts It will provide a user friendly marketplace where buyers interested looking for a respective service can hire freelancers from any part of the world at minimal costs Accordingly freelancers will have the opportunity to add their profession and special skills they possess and can use their abilities to help create an income 11 1 Minimal Fee As in traditional platform a freelancer has to pay 20% as commission fee and another 2 4% as payment processor fee vs order activities happening at Vites Freelance marketplace are charged at 9% only for the seller Our platform will start with payment in Vites only At a later stage when other coins are added as payment partners the percentages change We will then charge 12% fees for whatever currency and 6% fees if they offer the assignments with Vites It is noted unlike traditional platforms where a buyer also has to pay up to 5% fee for placing an order Vites Platform for buyer is absolute ly free 14 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c11 2 Instant Payment Processing Sixteen percent of freelancers want faster payments from their freelance work This makes sense as getting paid online can be a major headache With Upwork you need to wait for a client to approve a payment then wait a further five days just for the funds to be available in your account then you have to wait again for the payment to be processed into your bank account It can easily take weeks for a freelancer to receive the money Similarly on Fiverr you have to wait at least 14 days after the payment has been cleared by the buyer Using our Vites Platform we have ensured we will release earnings after fee deductions in approx 7 days As soon as an order has been completed and cleared (by the *smart contracts) payment will be processed We intend to look at the possibilities for instant payment at a later stage 11 3 *Smart Contract powered dispute resolution In our pursuit of utilizing blockchain technology to its fullest potential all order activities between buyer and sellers would be protected by Smart Contracts\xe2\x80\x94modern cryptographic contracts where unlike traditional contracts use cryptography for security and provide trustless settlement of payment in a peer to peer manner Thus for normal order activities payment settlement would be automated through the smart contracts However when cases are referred by Smart Contracts to be mediated manually we would create an Arbitration process where a dispute would first get arbitraded by a Vites representative and the freelancer or seller would have further option to file for arbitration through Dispute Resolution Committee which will consist of representatives from Vites mana gerial team Vites Advisory Board and Highly ranked experienced freelancers from Vites Platform 11 4 No more charge backs Normally in freelance services marketplace chargebacks are done directly by buyer/client banks due to credit card stealing or some time these buyers do it with dishonest intent to get free work Vites platform through *blockchain and *smart contracts ensure all transactions are done in a trustless manner without relying on centralized banks or third party institutions As a result no freelancer would be deprived of their hard earned money due to malign intentions of dishonest buyers Furthermore as mentioned earlier the quality of the service would be ensured by usage of *smart contracts 11 5 Trusted review and rating model Unlike traditional freelance platforms which are prone to rating manipulation a *snapshot of all order activities on Vites Platform would be recorded permanently on an immutable *blockchain This will give visibility of the new buyer of what service has the freelancer been hired in past what was the total duration net amount for the order activity and final rating and review Similarly all such features would be available for a freelancer to look into Buyer Profile making sure they know their past record and are satisfied of not being hired by scammers or someone who just want to hire them and get away with it\xe2\x80\x94not giving them the amount the freelancer earned 15 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c11 6 Transparent arbitration Instead of permanently suspending a freelancer for breaching Vites Terms of Service there will be a warning count system that will be privately added to a freelancer or a buyer profile (not visible for public) The maximum warning count is 3 while at every warning count the user will get a penalty depending on severity of the breach they have committed Moreover all order activities would be monitored by *smart contracts and it would be ensured no unjust suspension of account is done ever However in case a person has committed a serious breach of Terms of Service even after 3 breaches his/her account would be restricted and the user would be allowed to withdraw their earnings For every count being given to a user he/she would be presented with the proof and if he/she further wants to dispute they would be allowed to file a dispute which the Arbitration Committee would review 11 7 Voice video and conference calling In order to remove the doubts and ambiguities among a seller and buyer for a respective gig they would be allowed to communicate via Voice Video or Conference Calling feature once an order has been placed on a respective seller\xe2\x80\x99s gig This feature would allow thorough communication between buyers and sellers and as result provide opportunities for sellers to better comprehend their clients requirements and as a result deliver better services This option can be used at an additional fee * Everything marked with a star can be seen as \xe2\x80\x98blockchain features\xe2\x80\x99 and is optional The possibilities of implementing these blockchain features are further being explored 16 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c12 Key features Vites Platform 12 1 *Peer to peer service hiring Vites Platform provides a job marketplace built on blockchain allows customers to find quality services from across the globe Instead of hiring through third parties who take a big share for providing the right talent a buyer can directly hire a professional freelancer in a peer to peer manner 12 2 *Blockchain Profile Freelancers can create profiles just like Linkedin but unlike Linkedin it will be purely based on user performance and activities across the Vites Platform All user data would be recorded on blockchain permanently and anyone aiming to transact with the user would be able to check this blockchain based profile which will add trust and enhance the possibility of potential collaboration 12 3 Smart Explorer Vites Platform will allow users to intelligently look for their required services using its Smart Explorer Search Feature A buyer aiming to hire a freelancer for a respective order activity would need to enter his/her query alongside preferences such as Budget Deadline Expertise of the Freelancers and geographical locations etc This way the buyer would be presented with smart results that correspond to his preferences and would make the hiring process efficient and effective 17 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c12 4 Smart Reviews In order to ensure authenticity of the reviews they will be linked to the smart contracts where a buyer and a seller would be allowed only to add Review/Rating once a real order activity has been executed Unlike traditional freelancing platforms where only rating and a review is shown reviews on Vites Platform would show duration of the service total amount reserved for the order activity and nature of the work so that manipulation of paid reviews can be eliminated 12 5 A platform for the Unbanked Abig percentage of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population today especially those living in under developed and emerging economies lack access to banking which means they can\xe2\x80\x99t use freelancing platforms Vites will resolve this through acceptance of leading cryptocurrencies and enabling wallets to be used for placing orders in the Vites Platform 12 6 *Blockchain Deployed Reviews A snapshot of all order activities and reviews is recorded on blockchain which is a distributed transparent and immutable ledger ensuring the data is accessible to everyone forever without any one having the authority to manipulate it 12 7 *Smart Contracts \xe2\x80\x94 An escrow you can trust Vites will create smart contracts for users in its platform which would serve as a working agreement between the two parties thus eliminating the prerequisite of trust and allows everyone to operate with confidence Many freelancers find clients online which means they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any direct personal relationship with one another Without a degree of trust freelancers fret about payment viability and job posters worry about the quality of the final product By allowing Vites smart contracts freelancers can set predetermined benchmarks for a project and those checkpoints can be assigned a payment In this way freelancers don\xe2\x80\x99t have worry about being compensated for work performed and job posters have a level of quality control over the final product 12 8 Cryptocurrency as a payment method Instead of relying on traditional currencies where a buyer has to pay the debit card company a commission for placing an order pay governmental taxes for foreign currency transactions Vites Platform allows payment in cryptocurrencies A buyer aiming to hire a service would need to send their funds to a Smart Contract which would serve as an Escrow and would release freelancer his earning once the order has been executed successfully * Everything marked with a star can be seen as \xe2\x80\x98blockchain features\xe2\x80\x99 and is optional The possibilities of implementing these blockchain features are further being explored 18 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c13 *Vites Smart Contracts technical overview Smart contracts protocol of Vites facilitates secure payments and fair decisions Rather than opting for traditional escrow Vites smart contracts will be configured to release a certain amount of funds to a freelancer when they have completed a certain task Similarly it ensures clearing and settlement happens in a trustless manner and instantly Working of Vites Smart Contracts Vites smart contracts will offer a way to verify and order transactions in a distributed ledger a record of consensus validated and held within a network of separate nodes Entries can be altered but not deleted from the blockchain All transactions will have an auditable trail and a traceable digital fingerprint To demonstrate the concept let\xe2\x80\x99s try to implement a simple payroll contract which executes itself without any 3rd party institutions Suppose we want to create a very basic payment contract which works on time based one to one model with the following key requirements 1 The employee needs to know if the employer has enough capital to fund the contract agreements 2 The employer needs to know if the employee is capable of delivering the vision of the project 3 Both the roles should have chances to evaluate if they are in a good fit within a trial period If something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work well a contract makes they eligible choose to terminate the contract so as to avoid potential losses in either monetary or time 19 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0cFlows of contract rules \xe2\x80\xa2 The employer can create a smart contract on Vites Platform where a user friendly interface would be provided to make the configurations \xe2\x80\xa2 Once employer deposited funds into the smart contract it will proceed to the handshake stage where there is a URL of the freelancer Profile and gig containing the address of this contract to share to the employee to review this contract \xe2\x80\xa2 With the shared URL Profile employee can review the periods of the contracts and the available funds deposited \xe2\x80\xa2 Once confirmed(signed) the contract the contract starts with the trial period in which payment requests are disabled From now on the deposited fund can only be transferred to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s account address or held in the Vites Smart Contracts \xe2\x80\xa2 Once trial period passed the employee can request payment whenever needed and get paid immediately based on the current time and the length of the contract period \xe2\x80\xa2 In case of a dispute the employee and employer can arbitrate If they still don\xe2\x80\x99t reach to a potential conclusion Smart Contracts release this amount to the Vites Wallet from where the Arbitration Committee decides based on the merit of the order activity \xe2\x80\xa2 Alternatively after the trial period employer can authorize the contract completed to transfer the total payment to the contractor before the contract end time This is meant to incentivize the contractor to deliver the quality work faster \xe2\x80\xa2 The contract will mark ended when all the fund

features are further being explored 20 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c14 Getting started with Vites Platform Vites Platform allows three type of accounts \xe2\x80\xa2 Seller i e Freelancer Seller is the user providing services and needs to create a seller profile \xe2\x80\xa2 Buyer A buyer is the user who wants to avail service of some freelance service provider \xe2\x80\xa2 Company A corporate account allows team members to manage projects where sub accounts would have the authority to communicate while the main account would be able to transact only A typical signup process is needed to be eligible to start using the platform However for an order activity higher than USD 100 both freelancer and buyer need to perform a Know Your Customer (KYC) process where they would upload their identity documents Once the KYC has been executed there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any restriction and users would be able use the platform seamlessly Gig Creation In order to be able to get work online a seller may need to create a simple gig or advertisement for the services he wants to offer A user will have the option to create up to 10 Gigs at a time and offer any service of their liking It is important to note here though Vites won\xe2\x80\x99t allow or encourage any such service that relates to human right violation child pornography or adult content and any gig attempt of this nature would be removed from the platform and the user would be given a warning 21 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0cSearching for Talent A buyer needing a respective service can choose from a huge array of gigs available at different categories mentioned on the platform or directly insert the key words in Smart Search Bar The search bar will present a list of relative gigs from which a buyer can directly place an order or re quest for chat and negotiate a custom order with the freelancer Communicate and Place Order Once the user has found a gig of his liking he would be able to chat and further discuss the project with the freelancer If the buyer is satisfied and the seller gig is active for order placement the buyer can make the payment and place an order For Freelancer\t\t 22 For Buyers Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c15 Vites coin Vites Coin is a deployed modern age cryptocurrency using sophisticated NIST5 algorithm and achieves consensus through Proof of Stake consensus model It will serve as the native cryptocurrency of the Vites Freelance marketplace and enable order placement through atomic swap conversion of leading cryptocurrencies in the Vites Platform It eliminates the role of intermediary from payment process by providing a peer to peer payment service that uses cryptographic medium of exchange designed for market participants who wish to settle their financial claims via alternative means of payment The Vites Coin is open source this means the code of the coin can be accessed by anyone at any time and suggestions for improvement can be made by the community The decision to make the coin open source was made to encourage advancement and innovation without hindrance as well as community involvement 15 1 Algoritm Nist5 The Nist5 hashing algorithm is a fairly new algorithm seeing more and more mainstream adoption through cryptocurrencies such as Electra and Bulwark The Nist5 algorithm is a technology combining several finalists from the NIST hashing competitions over the years It consists of \xe2\x80\xa2 Blake \xe2\x80\xa2 Grostl \xe2\x80\xa2 JH \xe2\x80\xa2 Keccak \xe2\x80\xa2 Skein 15 2 Proof of Stake Functionality Consensus in traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum is achieved through a mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW) by requiring generated blocks to contain a proof that the node which generated the block solved a computational hard task This process of achieving consensus plays a vital role in security and authenticity of the transactions and avoid double spending and fraud However in recent few years it has recorded some significant issues such as massive amount of electricity consumption by the mining machines expensive computing machinery and the risk of 51% attack Furthermore as the computing power required to carry out the cryptographic calculations only ever increases as the difficulty increases thus consuming greater amounts of electricity In order to keep the system running and achieve consensus mechanism Vites uses an alternative consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS) where consensus is achieved through minting or delegation instead of mining This is the backbone of the Vites financial ecosystem as it provides the decentralized capability of validating transactional activities It facilitates trust in user\xe2\x80\x99s peer to peer activities i e Vites products and services across the globe and third party products across many different domains Validation of transactions is done in an energy efficient manner through showing a proof of owning coins Anyone holding a particular stake of Vites Coin can use the Proof of Stake system as by connecting their wallet with our blockchain and earn lucrative rewards given on the website in detail 23 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0cVites Coin Incentivized Staking \xe2\x80\xa2 You download a wallet from our website \xe2\x80\xa2 Staking ROI is between 10 20 % per year this is not a fixed ROI as the staking needs to be done correctly Here are the steps \xe2\x80\xa2Leave your balance in your wallet for min 8 hours \xe2\x80\xa2After 8 hours wallet will start staking Using your total coins you will have the staking weight \xe2\x80\xa2The higher the weight the faster the rewards \xe2\x80\xa2Every balance having coins and is staking will split in two after staking giving you more chances to find a block \xe2\x80\xa2If you move the balance (use the coins) your coins will not be mature anymore and they will need another 8 hours to get mature 15 3 Specifications Time until all coins are mined At current PoS rate 1 5 2 years But within or after the first year we are re adjusting the PoS rate to a significant lower ROI And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to explore the benefits of adding masternodes All the changes within or after the first year will be for the health of the project Staking rewards are 10% annual If you stake your coins more frequently you can even gain up to 20% annually with the gained compounding interest 24 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c25 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c15 4 Utility of Vites Coin/additional features These days most cryptocurrencies serve solely as speculative assets out of which most essentially just focus on being Bitcoin but faster cheaper anonymous or to feature some kind of other gimmick This leads to a significant lack of real world utility which could and most definitely should come from the use of blockchain technology Cryptocurrencies can only be adopted as a proper currency if they are usable in many different ways and are easy for newer and less tech savvy users to obtain and utilize The Vites project has a strong focus on providing actual utility and low barriers for new adopters Vites Coin will push its adoption primarily through Vites Freelance platform Vites Gateway for Ecommerce and associated merchants and provide a digital economy where you can earn or spend the Vites Coins Below given is some of the methods where Vites Coin would serve as medium of payment 1 Vites Freelance Platform For hiring freelance services 2 Peer to peer marketplace Vites P2P Marketplace will serve as an online utility providing platform for the VITES Holders allowing buyers and sellers in a seamless risk free environ ment Vites Marketplace will be a C2C e commerce platform offering global merchandise In addition Vites Marketplace will also have functionalities similar to OLX or eBay and provide global merchandise to buyers and sellers worldwide Vites Marketplace not only connects B2C i e Buyer to customers but also allow buyer to buyer functionality by enabling them to sell or purchase quickly at a very low fee 3 VitesEX Vites also plans to develop a fully functional Exchange for the platform which will allow peer to peer exchange of virtual currencies with Vites 4 Vites Pay A Payment Gateway Vites Pay would allow Vites holders to make direct pay ments for their day to day spending needs such as shopping at stores booking hotels transportation based services and buying air tickets etc Vites Pay also allows Vites Holders to send their Vites to friends family or anyone use it as a remittance without massive fee or deductions One of the ways Vites Pay will be applied is by releasing a plugin for Woocommerce and Shopify Many people in crypto who are \xe2\x80\x9cweb developer\xe2\x80\x9d can then boost the worldwide adoption 5 Burning program Of the Vites with which transaction costs are paid on the platform a part of the circulation will be removed from time to time This will be realized through a coin burn 6 Dividends program Vites is looking to create a model where Vites will pay a (big) part of the profits per month/quarterly to the holders of the coin 26 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c16 Vites community building strategies 16 1 Word of mouth marketing This means when you are apprised by someone you trust directly Having already being in the market for years we know when users are staking or holding VITES Coin they are committed to the cause As it says there is no marketing better than the word of mouth we are at a huge advantage because of our already developed network and this will help us grow in the longer run 16 2 Strategic alliances and merchant agreements Vites will also partner with key merchandisers around the world from time to time as it is beneficial for both the parties and helps in enhancing acceptability of the coin 16 3 Attracting merchants One of the most important aspects for a cryptocurrency is marketing it so well users and holders have a place to spend it We know our target group and have the best strategies in place to convince even those who are not aware of the crypto We already have made concrete steps in this regard and our community driven services are inspired by this vision We aim to get the VITES Coin accepted as a payment solution in online shops to get their attention We aim to be bringing merchants the customers and increasing their sales while reducing their payment fees The rest is a matter of persistence and we make it as easy as possible to get them started 27 Vites White paper V1 1 \x0c16 4 Referral Programs In addition to the large scale paid marketing pushes a rewarding referral program has been implemented giving bonuses to those who refer new users to the exchange Not only are existing users rewarded for a referral but the new users are also given a sign up bonus for being referred by a current user 16 5 Press Releases Press releases are a tried and true method of getting your message out there We have professional content and copy writers in the team for writing press releases and add those to leading crypto news sites such as cointelegraph com 16 6 Social Media Management and Communities We know an essential
