b Introduction & Features 2017 12 13 15 44 45 Introduction & Features There are many ways to consider a new Ethereum based protocol the value it creates for a user the value it creates for a developer and the value it creates for the community At Blockmason we are dedicated not only to building useful functional applications and protocols that solve real world problems but also to developing platforms that inspire adoption of the Ethereum network and expand global access to cryptocurrency That is why we are so excited to announce the development of our newest product The Credit Protocol (CP) Until now it was only possible to move money on the blockchain in the form of cash Bitcoin democratized the transfer and storage of money and Ethereum democratized the creation and storage of monetary contracts With the Credit Protocol Blockmason has taken the next logical step in the decentralized economy democratizing the creation of credit Debt and credit are already extremely powerful financial tools and now they will be strengthened by the security and flexibility of the blockchain In fact because an individual need not own ether in order to draw debt in ether it is entirely possible to imagine a future in which debts and credits recorded on the Credit Protocol could exceed the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined dramatically increasing the scale of the digital economy It is entirely possible to imagine a future in which debts and credits recorded on the Credit Protocol could exceed the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined dramatically increasing the scale of the digital economy However there is no better proof of a team\xe2\x80\x99s vision and execution than its product At Blockmason we have never set much store by empty promises or flashy Whitepapers Yes we are extremely proud of the work our team has put forth to create this document but we are even more proud of our developers who have already deployed a fully functional version of our newest application Friend In Debt (rebranded to \xe2\x80\x98Lndr\xe2\x80\x99) demonstrating the functionality of the 1 \x0cFigure 1 Credit exceed amount of actual assets Credit Protocol This awesome simple DApp is available right now Go ahead check it out at lndr io we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait Oh you\xe2\x80\x99re back Well before you read about our new protocol how about one last thing When purchasing product use tokens it is important to not simply look at the product as is but also consider the company\xe2\x80\x99s ability to provide exemplary customer support for that product That is why we will continue to update and improve CP in advance of and throughout the duration of the token Unlike other sales based on hope and potential our work stands alone to demonstrate our company\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to ongoing development product maintenance and creativity as we expand the possibilities of blockchain technology Our passion for our product and desire to improve the Ethereum ecosystem is not dependent on funding and we aim to prove that we love building useful functional lifechanging DApps\xe2\x80\x94no matter what The Credit Protocol At its most basic level the Credit Protocol is a system for recording debts and credit between entities on the Ethereum blockchain One entity sends a debt or 2 \x0ccredit request to another and that user then confirms the debt or credit which is recorded and stored within the Credit Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract This simple interaction between entities via the Credit Protocol enables a deceptively powerful and complex array of possible transactions when coupled with a Use Case Authority Contract (UCAC) built atop the protocol Each UCAC has its own set of rules about what types of debts it will record when it will record them and from whom it will accept them For example a UCAC may permit transactions from only certain certified users allowing organizations to build private debt recording contracts These contracts could be used for anything from tracking accounts receivable to developing private organizational currency as is used on many college campuses In many ways this system is similar to a highway Each debt or credit is akin to a car\xe2\x80\x94there are different makes models features and colors but they all serve a fundamentally similar purpose Once a car is allowed onto the highway this debt and all its particularities is recorded But of course you may desire some regulation to keep all that traffic running smoothly and going to the right place Enterprising developers can construct their own tollbooths or UCACs at the entrance to the highway Each tollbooth has complete control over what types of cars it allows on to its particular stretch of highway\xe2\x80\x94sports cars or semi trucks or huge vans filled with puppies\xe2\x80\x94and when those cars may access the highway Of course operating a tollbooth requires resources Users of the CP will have opportunity to purchase a Credit Protocol Token (BCPT) which funds the movement of cars through the tollbooth and onto the highway Users may charge a fee to allow cars to travel the highway or they may let the cars pass for free The amount of cars allowed through a tollbooth depends on two factors how many BCPTs are funding the tollbooth\xe2\x80\x99s operation and how many transactions are permitted per BCPT Blockmason will adjust the number of transactions permitted per one BCPT based on network traffic meaning that transaction costs are dynamic and adjustable based on the needs of the network Through these BCPTs a UCAC effectively buys debt recording capacity from the network BCPTs are in essence a license to use the CP network much as software is licensed to users This license is granted in perpetuity to the holder of a BCPT for as long as he or she owns that token The owner of a BCPT may choose to \xe2\x80\x9csublicense\xe2\x80\x9d their allotted transactions to another user whether for free or for compensation while retaining their token and the rights granted therein Use Case Authority Contracts Use Case Authority Contracts act as a pathway for inputting and settling debts Because UCACs are user created the particular rules that govern recording debt through a UCAC may be optimized to best fit the need of the organization 3 \x0cFigure 2 Toll Booth Analogy 4 \x0cor user employing the Credit Protocol Parameters for which a UCAC may be programmed include currency type the size and frequency of allowable transactions which users may create debt or be extended credit limits of debt accrued and much more The possible iterations of effective valuable UCACs is restricted only by the imagination of the designer so long as its result is a debt transaction compatible with the Credit Protocol Each UCAC requires the operator to \xe2\x80\x9cstake\xe2\x80\x9d a minimum of one BCPT to write debt or credit through that UCAC to the Credit Protocol system Each BCPT possessed by the operator permits the UCAC to process a specified number of transactions per day a number determined by a variable set by Blockmason within the CP smart contract Therefore staking more BCPTs allows for greater transaction throughput within the UCAC Depending on the intended debting system a user or developer may need to own multiple BCPTs to optimally guarantee the UCAC throughput capacity While users may own fractional tokens these partial tokens cannot be used to generate transactions The transactions generated by a single BCPT expire 24 hours after generation at which point the BCPT will generate a new set of available transactions Bounty Program for UCACs While we have spent significant time and energy conceptualizing useful UCACs that take advantage of the Credit Protocol to solve real world problems we know that we cannot envision every application of the CP alone Because there are infinite variations of Use Case Authority Contracts as well as varying demand for the creation of such contracts the Credit Protocol token sale set aside a portion of the BCPT sales revenue to fund a Bounty Program that incentivizes developers to write high demand UCACs that can show the way for developers to build apps Free UCAC Depository At Blockmason we are dedicated to providing outstanding customer support for the Credit Protocol and its users A vital step toward that goal is building a supportive community that believes in the Credit Protocol and further developing its unique ecosystem In that spirit we will create and maintain a depository of free UCACs for developers to leverage in building their own DApps on top of the Credit Protocol This depository will include all winners of our Bounty Program as well as generic templates of successful UCACs that may be customized for specific applications This depository will not only encourage the growth of a strong CP community but it will also promote the adoption of the CP protocol by prospective users who can browse a list of successful UCACs already being implemented throughout the world 5 \x0cEnforcing Debt Repayment While the CP provides a valuable multipurpose tool for recording debts and credit it is important to note that individual users must still agree upon how best to enforce repayment of those debts This enforcement may take many forms and could involve both on chain and off chain solutions including binding legal contracts collateral in the form of physical / digital assets or social mechanisms such as blockchain credit reporting or business reviews Ultimately users should not lend to entities in whom they doubt the ability to repay their debt nor should users lend more money than they are comfortable losing Through the customization and personalization of UCACs however it is possible to design debt contracts that perfectly match the needs and individual users and businesses rendering the question of debt enforcement moot While we outline several possible use cases of the Credit Protocol below it is worth considering two common debting scenarios 1 Jesse owes his friend Tim a beer 2 Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s business Jesse Corp issued his customer Tim a gift card In scenario one social pressure is sufficient to enforce repayment of the debt once it has been recorded on the Credit Protocol through the UCAC\xe2\x80\x94no one wants to be Jesse\xe2\x80\x99s friend if he won\xe2\x80\x99t get you back for that sweet refreshing cold as the Rockies brew In scenario two economic pressure is sufficient to enforce repayment of the debt once it has been recorded\xe2\x80\x94no one will shop at Jesse Corp if the business won\xe2\x80\x99t honor its gift cards In both cases the specific UCACs that control the types of debt being recorded have built in mechanisms for debt enforcement In general this type of enforcement is particularly effective for debting scenarios in which a large company or institution owes a smaller beneficiary for prepaid goods or services Because legal and social mechanisms already exist for enforcing debt repayment the true power of the Credit Protocol rests in its ability to reliably record debts through double confirmation These eliminates the need for the ceremony or bureaucracy currently for parties to trust a debt Recording debts on the blockchain allows individuals and entities to tap into existing mechanisms for debt transactions without the red tape of banks lawyers and other trust institutions [CP] Credit Protocol [UCAC] Use Case Authority Contract *[DApp] Decentralized Application 6 \x0cCredit Protocol Usage Examples The simplest way to imagine the Credit Protocol is as a mechanism for the creation tracking and settlement of IOUs At a basic level IOUs are no different than currency The earliest forms of cash were little more than standardized IOUs for some amount of precious metal such as gold or silver or a commodity like stored grain Therefore by allowing individual users to create and manipulate customized IOUs CP effectively democratizes the digital issuance of currency Therefore by allowing individual users to create and manipulate customized IOUs CP effectively democratizes the digital issuance of currency Off the blockchain there already exist a massive range of use cases for IOUs\xe2\x80\x94 they exist between vendors and buyers in the form of accounts receivable retailers and consumers in the form of gift cards or airlines and flyers in the form of miles Sometimes these IOUs are denominated in a fiat currency issued by a government other times the IOUs exist only as an arbitrary currency designed by its issuer Either type of IOU has value so long as the two parties trust that one party may redeem the currency for something else of agreed upon worth CP is the foundational tool that enables this massive range of use cases available to and developable by anyone owning our product use tokens 1 We envision a vast and diverse array of applications to be built atop Blockmason\xe2\x80\x99s Credit Protocol with tremendously varied functionality Below we examine just a few usage examples for the Credit Protocol\xe2\x80\x94the first targets for our Bounty Program (see explanation below)\xe2\x80\x94as well as our first exciting CP based application Friend in Debt (rebranded to \xe2\x80\x98Lndr\xe2\x80\x99) We invite everyone interested in the Credit Protocol to check out our code at our github repository University Meal Vouchers Imagine a school wants to implement a meal plan for its students First the school purchases sufficient CP tokens to cover the amount of transactions they expect to occur within the system The UCAC is designed to only allow transactions between the school and students preventing students from trading tokens between each other on any sort of underground market The Meal Voucher system uses its allotted free CP transfers (proportional to the number of CP tokens purchased by the school) to allow students to settle debts without cost on the CP network Students then pay for a meal plan let\xe2\x80\x99s say $300 a month 1 PLEASE NOTE Some applications built upon CP may be subject to regulation in some jurisdictions Developers building upon CP are responsible for determining which apps are subject to regulation and for complying as appropriate 7 \x0cStudents pay the school in cash or digital currency and the school sends the student 60 meal tokens Each time the students visit the cafeteria they tap their phone to machine that records their purchase spending one meal token to buy their food The school\xe2\x80\x99s UCAC allows only these types of transactions to be settled between specific on campus food venues and students of the school Figure 3 School voucher checkout system Microfinancing A microloan system may be developed in the same manner as the meal voucher system described above The creator of the Use Case Authority Contract in this case the lender could write a contract that limits the amount of individual debts per borrower requires multiple borrowers for one loan (e g for individuals from the same community or village) makes the pool of borrowers jointly liable and includes a built in interest and payback schedule Microfinancing of this type is an extremely powerful tool especially for communities without access to traditional banking It enables liquid movement 8 \x0cof debt and complex economic development previously unavailable to areas of the world outside the reach of large financial institutions These developments could include small business development loans low interest payday loans or crowdsourced repayment of community debts such as rebuilding a business after a fire or paying medical expenses after an accident Retail Gift Cards Another obvious use of the Credit Protocol is an application to manage retail gift cards Consumers may purchase store credits and send them to a friend creating a debt between the retailer and the recipient of those credits When the recipient uses his or her credits to redeem a product or service it settles that debt Alternatively a user could purchase from a retailer a redeemable code that allows access to funds already written into the Use Case Authority Contract This digital ecosystem of debt and credit movement between retailers and consumers allows for the simple creation of entities like Visa Cash Cards or all purpose credits that can be deposited in a specific gift card account Because gift card usage is generally very similar between vendors one can imagine a single unified application for managing any number of gift cards allowing users to gift their friends credits which could then be assigned to specific stores of their choosing Consumer Loans While securing a consumer loan currently requires wading through significant red tape and bureaucratic infrastructure the Credit Protocol could vastly simplify the process of acquiring such a loan Because blockchain ledgers are both public and secure users could employ DApps to track their debts exactly facilitate debt repayment through third party organizations and be absolutely certain that payment has been received avoiding any of the numerous scams or problems plaguing those operating in the debting world Such a system could also make use of the underlying debt data stored in the Credit Protocol to evaluate individual borrower\xe2\x80\x99s credit and debt repayment history A UCAC could further verify a borrower\xe2\x80\x99s claims against information associated with that user\xe2\x80\x99s Eth address to determine their legitimacy Get a suspicious phone call claiming you\xe2\x80\x99re behind on your car payments Hang up and check the blockchain to confirm your payment instantly 9 \x0cAirline Miles / Vendor Loyalty / Credit Card Points Airline miles and vendor loyalty points are yet another form of debt that exists between the airline or vendor and their customers Airlines issues miles in the form of their own currency (e g IOUs) as a reward for fliers based on their patronage Users then settle the debt by claiming a product or service based on the point system established by the airline or vendor This vendor loyalty system highlights a particularly interesting property of the Credit Protocol debts need not be recorded as fiat currency such as USD or cryptocurrency such as ETH Users may write UCACs to accept arbitrary values and currencies so long as 1 they map redemption values to redemption methods 2 the customer base values the newly generated currency such as airline miles or credit card points Figure 4 air miles received 10 \x0cFriend In Debt (rebranded to \xe2\x80\x98Lndr\xe2\x80\x99) Here we\xe2\x80\x99ve saved the best for last Lndr is our first full fledged (and functional ) implementation of the Credit Protocol a social tool for users to track and issue debts amongst friends family members and individuals in their community Its potential applications and use cases are vast and powerful and we look forward to presenting Lndr in further detail later in this Whitepaper Or to jump straight into the economic revolution explore Lndr here lndr io [IOU] I owe you A document acknowledging a debt [CP] Credit Protocol *[UCAC] Use Case Authority Contract Why CP Security Debting is an inevitable evolution in the blockchain ecosystem and will grow only more prominent as individuals begin using Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies to finance the development of large scale infrastructure While individual solutions to handling digital debt will have inevitable insecurities the Credit Protocol will be battle tested and reliable By employing the Credit Protocol companies and individuals eliminate the need for backend engineers All that is necessary is to design a Use Case Authority Contract and a front end interface with no need to worry about the security of your debts credits or assets By employing the Credit Protocol companies and individuals eliminate the need for backend engineers All that is necessary is to design a Use Case Authority Contract and a front end interface with no need to worry about the security of your debts credits or assets Ease As the Credit Protocol develops its user base the ease of creating contracts for CP will further increase as the community develops solutions to common problems and plans for common projects Soon there will exist template UCACs to address everyday financial issues faced by organizations large and small In fact we imagine an ecosystem similar to that of Web Page templates in which a prospective user may search through potentially millions of different UCAC options both free and paid 11 \x0cScale While Bitcoin has created an entirely new economic ecosystem through its system of digital credits the potential of crypto economies is limited if they do not expand beyond the movement of currency One of the most powerful factors in economic growth is debt and credit The development of virtually all large scale projects and infrastructure\xe2\x80\x94bridges factories homes technological innovations\xe2\x80\x94are powered by debt In fact the federal government of the United States the largest economy of the world would collapse overnight without the power to borrow and lend money The ability to issue debt is a necessity for any significant growth in the digital economy The ability to issue debt is a necessity for any significant growth in the digital economy Additionally it is worth noting that because recording one ETH of debt does not require owning one ETH the total amount of debts and credits recorded on the Credit Protocol could soon exceed the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined By opening CP to developers we intend to maximize the speed of development penetration and usage of this democratized instrument for money creation Support Working with new software is often a daunting task For many software support can mean the difference between days of struggle and immediate solutions It can mean the difference between a failed venture and fully functional profitable application built atop the Credit Protocol Through the Credit Protocol\xe2\x80\x99s website Blockmason intends to continue adding vital support resources for our customers and token holders These resources will include detailed documents explaining how to maximize productivity when using the CP how to adapt the CP for various use cases and many examples and templates of successful projects We will also provide API documents model UCACs and comprehensive front end interfaces that seamlessly integrate with UCACs In short Blockmason will provide resources to guide customers from a nascent idea to a fully realized UCAC and front end interface built atop the CP Finally at Blockmason we are no entomophobics\xe2\x80\x94we do not fear bugs we destroy them We take bug reports seriously and will enable a dedicated bug reporting system for the Credit Protocol allowing us to solve technical issues in a timely and efficient manner 12 \x0cUrgency The movement of debt and credit on the blockchain is vital to the growth of our ecosystem and Blockmason has developed a protocol that works right now Don\xe2\x80\x99t wait around for a half baked solution promised years down the line We have already deployed a working version of CP and we invite all prospective users to explore the code [CP] Credit Protocol [UCAC] Use Case Authority Contract *[DApp] Decentralized Application CP Technical Figure 5 Credit protocol illustration Credit Protocol Data Smart Contract The Credit Protocol Data smart contract is the core contract which stores data about all relationships between entities as well as their debts and credits It holds two main data structs Relationships and Debts Relationships tracks relationships between two entities To form a debt between two entities those two entities must be demarcated as \xe2\x80\x9cconnected \xe2\x80\x9d Relationships 13 \x0calso tracks pending relationships as users are required to confirm relation requests Debts keeps track of debts between one user and another It executes tasks like tracking debts holding pending debts and recording in which currency particular debts are denominated Credit Protocol Smart Contract The Credit Protocol smart contract reads and manipulates the Credit Protocol data contract This contracts functions include reading user\xe2\x80\x99s debts pending debts sending debts confirming debts reading friends lists adding friends removing friends etc The Credit Protocol smart contract is the only address authorized to manipulate information stored in the Credit Protocol data smart contract Users may only interface with the Credit Protocol smart contract via the Flux Capacitor contract (described below) Flux Capacitor Smart Contract The Flux Capacitor contract is the contract with which users interact The user never actually interacts directly with the UCACs Flux Capacitor functions mimic the core CP contract functions with the exception that each function also takes the address of a UCAC The Flux Capacitor functions check the calls from the user against the UCAC at the UCAC address to make sure parameter values specified by the user are valid for that specific UCAC The Flux Capacitor contract also checks the Staking contract to record the amount of tokens a CP Token holder is staking and for which contracts those tokens are declared The Flux Capacitor contract also notes total remaining capacity for transactions allowed within a given time period for that user\xe2\x80\x99s staked tokens The contract then updates the CP Token staker\xe2\x80\x99s transaction capacity and calls the corresponding function in the CP Data smart contract It is easiest to think of the Flux Capacitor as an enforcer It administrates the parameters of a UCAC and limits transaction capacity according to the amount of CP Tokens a user has staked for a given UCAC Use Case Authority Contracts UCAC\xe2\x80\x99s contain the exact same function calls as those listed in the Flux Capacitor contract Each function only returns a boolean of true or false The Flux Capacitor contract calls on the UCAC with the exact function name as denoted in the Flux Capacitor to check if the transaction is valid 14 \x0cAs an example the Flux Capacitor function newDebt would call a UCAC\xe2\x80\x99s newDebt function with the exact same parameters bytes32 myId bytes32 friendId bytes32 currencyCode int amount bytes32 _desc and the UCAC would return true or false to verify if this was a valid transaction Therefore if a UCAC allows EUR but not USD and a user attempts to pass USD through the Flux Capacitor contract it would return false A false return would cause the call to newDebt in the Flux Capacitator to fail A UCAC\xe2\x80\x99s reason for returning true or false answers are limitless Their only requirement is that they maintain the same function names and parameters inputs as the functions in Flux Capacitor If they do not have the same function names and parameters then calls to those Flux Capacitor functions will throw Multiple Users and Bidding Multiple users can stake CP tokens for the same UCAC if allowed If a DApp is sufficiently popular hundreds or thousands of users may stake CP tokens to help support its transactions A UCAC may also be written to allow CP token holders to compete for transactions through that UCAC For example two users may stake their tokens for the same UCAC offering their allotted transactions to users of the UCAC at two different prices The DApp can then evaluate which bid is least expensive and offer the price to the user before sending the CP transaction through that pathway Staking Smart Contract The Staking contract stores information about how many tokens a user stakes to a specific UCAC powering the transactions of a UCAC When a user attempts to execute a function for a UCAC the Flux Capacitor then queries the Staking contract for information about how many tokens the user has staked to power the transactions of that UCAC The Staking contract also watches for changes in a user\xe2\x80\x99s CP tokens to guarantee that the user is not trying to cheat the system to acquire free transactions Tech Considerations Storage Costs Storing data on the Ethereum blockchain is expensive In order to make CP low cost for users Blockmason\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing maintenance and support include updating and optimizing our product to reduce costs Cost minimization is an ongoing process that involves the use of systems like IPFS and other off chain storage 15 \x0csolutions We carefully select variable types to minimize storage costs and also consciously examine the benefits of storing specific data on or off the blockchain Expandability While we are already excited about the current version of CP we are committed to providing robust maintenance and support including fixes and expanded functionality in periodic version upgrades as with any quality software based service One powerful feature of building applications atop the Ethereum blockchain is its public ledger storage Because the CP smart contract is accessible to anyone on the Ethereum network future developers may easily build applications atop the existing CP infrastructure This transparency allows for the creation of dynamic new debt payment models using the existing CP data and functionality including platforms for micro loans consumer loans and business to business credit lines [CP] Credit Protocol [UCAC] Use Case Authority Contract *[DApp] Decentralized Application Cost & Economics When Blockmason designed the Credit Protocol we envisioned a revolutionary protocol with global reach available to users free of charge However computing data storage and transaction execution all have a cost on the Ethereum blockchain This cost is commonly referred to as gas Therefore because CP runs on the Ethereum blockchain using the protocol inevitably incurs transaction costs Additionally compared to traditional applications using standard web hosting storage prices are relatively high While we believe that Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s global domination is inevitable we also know that the average user need not necessarily understand Ethereum and its operation Successful scalable DApps will likely appear to users just as normal web based applications with many layers between users and the Ethereum network The average user need not necessarily understand Ethereum and its operation Successful scalable DApps will likely appear to users just as normal web based applications with many layers between users and the Ethereum network Plasma and Off Chain Transactions Right now the entire blockchain community is grappling with the problem of balancing cost and network speed against security and longevity Fortunately it seems a number of improvements may be within our grasp In particular 16 \x0cthe recent announcement of Plasma2 demonstrates the Ethereum Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to increasing network speed and decreasing transaction cost paving the way for widespread adoption of consumer focused decentralized applications Additionally the Raiden Network similar to Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s proposed Lightning Network has the promise to reduce transaction costs up to 7 times and process up to 1 million transactions per second It does this by moving some transactions off the blockchain onto a peer to peer network while still interacting with the Ethereum Network to retain security and longevity In the event that a Raiden Network like or Plasma like solution fails to be implemented for smart contracts Blockmason will execute its own off chain settlement feature and make it available to all users Employing an off chain solution allows CP to make fewer updates to the Ethereum blockchain and thus reduce associated costs Most importantly we believe that CP will be a significant factor in driving users to the Ethereum network The protocol\xe2\x80\x99s power and its low barrier to entry will draw customers from a new customer base unfamiliar with cryptocurrency The current version of CP has been designed with this in mind By processing user\xe2\x80\x99s signed transactions instead of having them directly run functions on CP other entities such as a centralized server sitting between a user and the Ethereum network are able to push transactions to CP and cover the transaction fees making it so users can use CP without their even needing to know about concepts like ether and gas CP will be a significant factor in driving users to the Ethereum network The protocol\xe2\x80\x99s power and its low barrier to entry will draw customers from a new customer base unfamiliar with cryptocurrency UCACs Transaction Costs and Monopolies CP token holders receive the ability to conduct a defined number of transactions per day based on the number of tokens they hold (which can be fractional) While holders may choose to employ their tokens in CP DApps they personally use in order to enable their own transactions token holders may also pursue various developer pathways as well For example holders could stake a DApp that they control ensuring their users have an existing pathway to process a defined number of transactions either for a fee set by the holder or free of charge Token holders also might choose to stake their funds in other CP DApps to provide further transaction capacity for the DApp\xe2\x80\x99s users whether for free or for compensation For example a UCAC may include a bidding system to encourage CP Token holders to provide pathways for their users While these bidding systems could be written in a variety of ways entirely up to the UCAC creator one solution would be an open ETH marketplace in which the lowest cost transaction pathway would \xe2\x80\x9cwin\xe2\x80\x9d and be \xe2\x80\x9csold\xe2\x80\x9d to the user of the DApp 2 https //www plasma io/ 17 \x0cSuch a market need not necessarily evaluate pathways based on associated fees Instead software may choose pathways based on other factors such as the reputation of users which could be determined by institutions completely unrelated to the Credit Protocol For example an environmental agency could certify on the blockchain that a CP token stakeholder has taken an action that had a positive or negative effect on the environment The DApp could then choose to process or not process transactions through that user\xe2\x80\x99s pathways based on this reputation Once identity characteristics are evaluated on the blockchain such scenarios in which contracts evaluate a user\xe2\x80\x99s viability for interaction are near infinite Lastly because UCACs may restrict which users stake their CP Tokens to a particular contract it is possible for CP Token holders to create virtual monopolies for that contract To illustrate a company may build a DApp that employs the Credit Protocol but only allow their own organization to stake CP Tokens to that DApp Therefore the company could charge any price they want for transactions within that DApp without worrying about price competition from other CP stakeholders These are merely some of the possible actions and strategies that CP token holders can pursue as they use the tokens Transaction Capacity Setting Each CP Token will allow its owner to process a specified amount of transactions per day The amount of transactions allowed per CP Token is set by Blockmason Factors we consider when setting this number is how many transactions the Ethereum network can handle and the current usage of BCPT on the network Blockmason will only ever adjust transaction capacity upward to increase the total number of transactions allowed per BCPT it can never decrease it This guarantees that available transaction capacity will grow with increasing network usage while preventing purchasers from losing the total number of transactions allotted to them by their initial token purchase It is akin to the miners voting to increase the gas limit of mined blocks on the Ethereum network to allow additional capacity [BCPT] Blockmason Credit Protocol Token [CP] Credit Protocol [UCAC] Use Case

interacts on a daily basis with individuals we trust far more than banks credit card companies or payday loan hucksters Lndr makes it easy to financially engage with friends and coworkers whether that is by tracking small social debts accrued through daily life or by managing larger loans negotiated between known parties Before Lndr monitoring such social debt required significant mental overhead often rendering the endeavor futile and leading to squabbles about payment history within friendships Existing apps that claim to alleviate such problems such as Venmo Wechat/Alipay and various cryptocurrency wallets only work for on the spot settlement\xe2\x80\x94a surprisingly limited functionality when contextualized against the various complex debts and payments that can occur in a large social network These platforms feature no way to settle debts at a later date pay debts in increments or automatically calculate and accrue interest nor do they feature any functionality related to tracking and settling debts over long periods of time Lndr will allow users to create track and settle debts in all major cryptocurrencies on top of standard Ethereum wallet functionality dramatically expanding the pool of possible users and use cases In doing so Lndr effectively creates a platform for decentralized money issuance on the blockchain only executed via a user friendly wallet like interface that encourages widespread adoption Lndr effectively creates a platform for decentralized money issuance on the blockchain only executed via a user friendly wallet like interface that

Foundation protocol via the Credit Protocol Lndr addresses the most significant technical barrier to utilizing the Lndr app by unifying the various wallet addresses of users under one ID Integration with Foundation enables users to easily login to multiple accounts wallets and platforms without the burdensome and insecure sending of private keys Foundation also allows for simple switching between multiple addresses whenever users choose to settle debts through Ethereum payments Better Security Lndr offers an improvement to existing payment applications not only through user interface and functionality but also through greater security Venmo in particular has been subject to publicized exploits by scammers and problems with user accounts On July 19th 2017 the Verge published a story of a Venmo scammer who stole US$25 000 in expensive camera gear in Los Angeles The Verge Venmo Scam Fake Payment Merchant Clause Fraud Contrary to what some may believe transactions on Venmo are not instantaneous and payments may be canceled or rescinded even after money has been marked as delivered to another Venmo user\xe2\x80\x99s account While Venmo offers various protections for users sending payments Venmo offers little protection for users receiving funds including those who were paid using stolen credit or debit cards as in the above article According to the account Venmo first froze the victims accounts denying them access to their existing balance Then Venmo informed the victims that because they had broken Venmo\xe2\x80\x99s user policy by exchanging goods for money they were not entitled to any recompense Contrary to what some may believe transactions on Venmo are not instantaneous and payments may be canceled or rescinded even after money has been marked as delivered to another Venmo user\xe2\x80\x99s account Paypal the company that owns Venmo has been known to block users\xe2\x80\x99 funds in their accounts and arbitrarily kicking users off the platform Venmo has generated further headlines by locking users out of accounts for joke descriptions of their payments Angelina Travels Venmo Account Frozen With Lndr no user will have to worry about their account being locked for purposes of humor or otherwise Because Lndr uses Ethereum to settle payments and those payments are protected by the security of the blockchain the uncaring bureaucratic mess of large institutions bear no threat to the user\xe2\x80\x94no matter how funny that user is Lndr customers will always have access to their funds be able 21 \x0cto settle debts with the Ethereum they own and be able to draw from agreed upon credit lines mitigating any risk that comes from non cash transactions With Lndr payments are protected by the security of the blockchain the uncaring

already fully functional While this iteration offers only a stripped down demo of the application\xe2\x80\x99s future capabilities Lndr beta demonstrates Blockmason\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to developing our DApp with vigor and efficiency We refuse to blindly roll out a token sale asking for ether on the strength of a Whitepaper and a promise We have a product we believe in and over the course of the token sale we will continue to release important updates that expand Lndr\xe2\x80\x99s functionality Right now Lndr maintains a friend list and allows for the addition confirmation and clearance of debts All transactions are processed on the Ropsten testnet allowing users with access to testnet Ethereum to interact with the app completely free The beta version runs in Chrome and requires Metamask lndr io Future Versions Everyday Blockmason works hard to improve Lndr and we plan on releasing several new versions in the coming year expanding its already awesome functionality See below a list of proposed features that we hope to add in the near future \xe2\x80\xa2 The creation of payback schedules to allow users to manage loan repayment in an easy and secure fashion

\xe2\x80\x98Lndr\xe2\x80\x99) Market Opportunity Democratizing the Role of a Lender Lndr is an extremely powerful tool not only for individual borrowers but for lenders as well As previously discussed Lndr gives each user the power to act as a lender to their friends in a jurisdiction agnostic format allowing the unbanked not only to establish credit lines but to individually issue credit to his or her associates\xe2\x80\x94effectively acting as a self run bank Because Lndr removes the high fees and overhead associated with traditional banking lenders and borrowers can avoid the restrictive costs and oft changing regulations that are prohibitive of natural free flowing transactions that occur within a social network Banking the Unbanked In wealthier economies banks are such an entrenched institution that many are surprised to learn vast swaths of the world operate with limited or no access to banking or credit In Southeast Asia Africa the Middle East and Latin America such financial disadvantages burden regional economies restrict fiscal growth and obstruct individual actors from exercising power over their financial transactions Despite relatively little access to large financial institutions many in these regions possess application capable mobile phones enabled with both data and wifi Such individuals present an obvious market opportunity for Lndr as they have a clear incentive to manage their finances in a secure digital fashion from their phone\xe2\x80\x94further demonstrated by the rise of \xe2\x80\x98mobile phone minute currency\xe2\x80\x99 in eastern Africa a system far inferior to Lndr in terms of scale and efficiency Even in countries with widespread access to banking many institutions do not offer the same easy ACH transfers available in the United States Venmo which requires access to a bank account has gained popularity in parts of the U S but cannot be used anywhere outside of the U S Similarly while Wechat Pay and Alipay have grown near ubiquitous in China non Chinese usage of these systems is almost nonexistent Existing financial transaction systems across the world generally require users to pay fees for transfers The few mobile apps that aim to improve financial liquidity require bank accounts and have limited market reach implying a huge demand for a cryptocurrency based financial transaction application like Lndr While Lndr is much more than a cryptocurrency wallet even popular crypto wallets are often too complicated to promote adoption by the average non technical user Lndr boasts a user friendly interface and simple account creation to sign up new users with enthusiasm and ease 24 \x0cFigure 7 no banks no problem Getting Crypto into Your Mom\xe2\x80\x99s Hands One of the powerful and understated features of Lndr is its ability to put crypto into the hands of average users While always improving and becoming easier buying cryptocurrency is still a difficult and complicated task for many With Lndr you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to have any Ethereum to start using it This means that anyone can immediately start storing their debts on the Ethereum blockchain for free Yes that\xe2\x80\x99s right suddenly the average app user can be using cryptocurrency and the blockchain without all the complications that have existed up until now One of the awesome features of Lndr is that you can be debted by your friend for dinner and then pay them back with the cryptocurrency of your choice So let\xe2\x80\x99s think about that Your friend parent or whoever who has never used cryptocurrency in their life and only knows about Bitcoin from the news can suddenly be paid back for dinner by you in crypto Now they\xe2\x80\x99re in they\xe2\x80\x99re watching the price of Ethereum rise and fall and before long they\xe2\x80\x99re texting you hodl memes This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only benefit to the cryptocurrency universe By putting crypto into everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands demand for crypto rises Usage of crypto as a means of payment rises Awareness rises By releasing an app that does crypto but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require crypto we stealthily put crypto into everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands without

Smart Contracts The Credit Protocol smart contracts form the base contracts on which Lndr runs Lndr is more or less an unrestricted UCAC running on top of the CP Ergo all of the above descriptions of the mechanisms behind the CP apply to Lndr Lndr Use Case Authority Contract The Lndr UCAC is simply a UCAC without any rules This means that it is open to the general public and has no limits on the amounts of debt that can pass through it Lndr will start off by paying for those Eth transactions within a cap that will be specified at a future date Until then Lndr users can be sure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for any Eth transactions Any updates and changes to the process of handling Eth transactions will be timely communicated to the Lndr users Front End The front end for Lndr is written using Purescript Purescript is a strongly statically typed language with expressive types Purescript compiles to javascript Purescript is very similar to Haskell We like Purescript because of its advanced type system lets us prototype and iterate much faster These qualities ensure writing code in Purescript is ultimately easier more fun and significantly less prone to bugs The front end allows for users to easily interact with smart contract functionality without requiring the technical expertise of being able to use raw smart contract functions It also serves to display data in an easy to view user friendly manner For more information on Lndr visit the Lndr site [CP] Credit Protocol [UCAC] Use Case Authority Contract [DApp] Decentralized Application Lndr Lndr Token Sale The

comfortable sharing Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it Expensive to Send Transactions on the Blockchain When reserved for sending only Ethereum currency transaction costs on the Ethereum network are extremely low especially when compared to other options such as Bitcoin bank transfers or credit cards On the other hand storing data about debts lenders and borrowers and currency information is significantly more expensive One of our immediate goals is to lower this cost In our ideal version of CP users need not ever consider transaction costs Even better if users don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know the intricacies of Ethereum and gas pricing The system will be as low cost as possible in order to allow for easy adoption by non technical users We will employ either a Raiden Network like or our own in house off

Ethereum Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s major goals is to is to massively increase network speed and scalability In the future it is not unlikely that Ethereum will easily handle tens of thousands or even

immediate value while offering a concrete path to widespread user adoption and significant benefits for token purchasers It has an obvious market and clear use cases with little to no barrier to entry for potential developers and their user base It fills a glaring hole in the Ethereum ecosystem and provides a platform for future developers to implement their own revolutionary ideas The Credit Protocol is simultaneously bold and secure audacious and deliberate and most importantly it works right now Even more exciting the Credit Protocol and Lndr represent an objective step forward toward our vision of a world run on Ethereum Debt is a vital factor in the growth of any economy and without moving debt to the blockchain the cryptocurrency ecosystem has no choice but to stagnate The Credit Protocol enables the next phase of Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s development one in which the creation of large scale projects and infrastructure becomes inseparable from the blockchain Implementations of the CP can democratize currency creation by recording mediums of exchange units of account store of value and standards of deferred payment In fact because an individual need not own ether in order to draw debt in ether it is entirely possible to imagine a future in which debts and credits recorded on the Credit Protocol could exceed the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined dramatically increasing the scale of the digital economy Similarly Lndr is an application built for the present and designed for the future It promises a global network of decentralized transactions that empower individuals left behind by the bureaucratic profiteering mess of large institutions like banks and Paypal It trusts in the ability of the individual and the force of the multitude empowering single actors to seize their financial destinies while encouraging economic development in communities ranging from families in Minnesota to villages in Mauritania We at Blockmason believe in the future of Ethereum but Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s future needs the Credit Protocol\xe2\x80\x94a platform that will draw in users across the globe previously uninitiated in Ethereum and realize the potential of Ethereum not just to support a popular cryptocurrency but to engender an entire ecosystem of apps And when Ethereum wins we all win 38 \x0c[CP] Credit Protocol

blockchain was not a simple decision for the Blockmason team There are number of issues that Ethereum needs to fix before mainstream adoption can take place By putting the Credit Protocol on to the Ethereum blockchain the development team had a lot to think about Bootstrapping When starting any new development project there are always trade offs you make with what language you use You have to consider what\xe2\x80\x99s the fastest to build on what can handle your initial needs what will scale well what your team can 39 \x0cuse easily and any number of other decisions One of the amazing features that Ethereum provides to developers is that developers who build smart contracts on Ethereum don\xe2\x80\x99t need to roll their own blockchain While it may sound obvious this is a very big deal Not having to roll your own blockchain saves significant developer time and makes it possible to have a project up and running in months rather than years The Network Effect One of the amazing and so far little talked about features of Ethereum is the network effect What is Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s network effect Well so far not much of anything The future though for Ethereum looks incredibly bright There are a large amount of projects currently under construction on Ethereum and as these projects start to go live we start to have lots of data publicly available This is really good news for something like the Credit Protocol This data can be used to determine if someone is worth lending out to This data can be used to with higher levels of certainty verify that someone is real There are numerous other things that might be written about an Ethereum address on the blockchain like where someone works or even simply what their Ethereum balance is All these are important criteria for determining if you want to loan money to someone Another important consideration for using Ethereum is the developer network effect As more developers begin building things on Ethereum tools improve massively Not only that but things like off chain solutions start to become a reality If you were to roll your own chain you might have the benefit of this if it was an Ethereum based chain but other chains including bitcoin just aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting the developer attention Ethereum is The Ethereum Conundrum Because each debt/credit transaction recorded within the Credit Protocol still writes data to the Ethereum blockchain executing transactions requires the payment of Ethereum to act as gas While this may seem like a substantial roadblock for applications hoping to integrate the Credit Protocol we at Blockmason believe in a future in which Ethereum and other digital currency is as common as cash today The Ethereum network sits on the verge of massive reductions in transaction cost as the network adds off chain processing and other improvements meaning that users will soon pay mere fractions of a penny to interact with such decentralized applications 3 The recent announcement of Plasma by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon further justifies our faith that Ethereum will soon be capable of swiftly handling large amounts of microtransactions 4 It also proves that the 3 https //github com/raiden network/raiden/wiki/FAQ 4 https //www plasma io/ 40 \x0cEthereum Foundation is committed to Ethereum not only as a currency but as a platform for consumer decentralized apps In addition Blockmason has already begun researching our own proprietary off chain solution to be implemented at the earliest possible date Adapting to off chain processing developed by others or adopting our own version if it better suits the needs of the Credit Protocol is part of our ongoing dedication to the maintenance and support of the CP As interacting with blockchain applications becomes more commonplace users will not even notice spending a few dollars a month on Ethereum transactions Furthermore Blockmason is developing strategies for embedding Ethereum wallets within applications in order to pay for the transaction fees of new users drawing potential customers from a new pool of clients not already familiar with cryptocurrency For example an application could automatically generate an Ethereum wallet for new users and the company running that application could give a small amount of money to fund a user\xe2\x80\x99s initial transactions as part of their user acquisition cost In this way such applications implementing the CP can push blockchain technology mainstream by lowering the technical barrier to entry Another option to this that is currently implemented into Lndr is the signing of transactions by users with their Ethereum keys Users sign transactions and then the company can push those transactions to the blockchain [CP] Credit Protocol
