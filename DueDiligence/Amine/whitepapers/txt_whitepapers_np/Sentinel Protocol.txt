Sentinel Protocol 
 
 Security Intelligence Platform for Blockchain 
 
 
 Abstract 
 
 
 The 
 rapid 
 development 
 of 
 computer 
 technology 
 in 
 the 
 21st 
 century 
 has 
 led 
 to 
 the 
 manifestation 
 of 
 sophisticated 
 and 
 intelligent 
 threats 
 that 
 hinder 
 further 
 innovation 
 While 
 the 
 essence 
 of 
 cryptocurrency 
 is 
 decentralization 
 this 
 has 
 also 
 become 
 its 
 greatest 
 weakness 
 As 
 the 
 decentralized 
 cryptocurrency 
 system 
 lacks 
 a 
 threat 
 defense 
 system 
 the 
 burden 
 for 
 security 
 has 
 thus 
 far 
 been 
 placed 
 squarely 
 upon 
 the 
 shoulders 
 of 
 individuals 
 and 
 corporations 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 overcomes 
 the 
 disadvantage 
 of 
 decentralization 
 by 
 turning 
 it 
 into 
 an 
 advantage 
 for 
 security 
 By 
 utilizing 
 a 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 system 
 created 
 through 
 harnessing 
 the 
 power 
 of 
 decentralization 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 combines 
 cryptographic 
 functions 
 and 
 intelligence based 
 threat 
 analysis 
 algorithms 
 to 
 create 
 a 
 secure 
 innovative 
 ecosystem

 Chapter 1 
 
 Introduction 
 
 Decentralization 
 which 
 is 
 at 
 the 
 heart 
 of 
 cryptocurrency 
 technology 
 and 
 works 
 as 
 its 
 ideology 
 involves 
 both 
 innovation 
 as 
 well 
 as 
 innate 
 anxiety 
 The 
 cause 
 of 
 both 
 is 
 autonomy 
 Autonomy 
 based 
 on 
 anonymity 
 can 
 only 
 be 
 achieved 
 with 
 great 
 responsibility 
 imposed 
 on 
 the 
 system 
 When 
 faced 
 with 
 reality 
 the 
 side 
 effects 
 based 
 on 
 said 
 autonomy 
 are 
 the 
 most 
 evident 
 in 
 countless 
 cybercrime 
 cases 
 In 
 addition 
 a 
 fundamental 
 defense 
 system 
 to 
 protect 
 against 
 such 
 cybercrime 
 has 
 not 
 yet 
 been 
 built 
 
 
 There 
 are 
 three 
 main 
 security 
 issues 
 facing 
 the 
 average 
 cryptocurrency 
 user 
 The 
 first 
 problem 
 is 
 that 
 ordinary 
 users 
 are 
 exposed 
 to 
 hacks 
 far 
 too 
 easily 
 The 
 second 
 problem 
 is 
 that 
 while 
 attackers 
 can 
 often 
 identify 
 us 
 we 
 cannot 
 easily 
 identify 
 them 
 Lastly 
 the 
 damage 
 such 
 attackers 
 inflict 
 upon 
 us 
 is 
 our 
 responsibility 
 How 
 can 
 we 
 solve 
 these 
 fundamental 
 problems 
 In 
 the 
 end 
 the 
 responsibility 
 lies 
 with 
 us 
 all 
 However 
 everyone 
 acting 
 individually 
 will 
 not 
 be 
 able 
 to 
 provide 
 a 
 solution 
 to 
 the 
 issue 
 of 
 cryptocurrency 
 security 
 Instead 
 we 
 must 
 utilize 
 our 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 to 
 act 
 together 
 in 
 our 
 mutual 
 self interest 
 through 
 a 
 decentralized 
 cyber 
 security 
 ecosystem 
 Our 
 decentralized 
 AI 
 system 
 detects 
 unknown 
 patterns 
 of 
 the 
 attacker(s) 
 disseminates 
 the 
 information 
 throughout 
 the 
 ecosystem 
 and 
 protects 
 all 
 members 
 through 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 while 
 maintaining 
 the 
 fundamental 
 autonomy 
 of 
 decentralization 
 
 
 
 Chapter 2 
 
 Statement of Problem 
 
 Generally 
 the 
 difference 
 in 
 defense 
 level 
 against 
 security 
 threats 
 between 
 individual 
 users 
 and 
 business 
 users 
 is 
 a 
 simple 
 one 
 How 
 much 
 budget 
 do 
 you 
 have 
 to 
 invest 
 in 
 technology 
 and 
 human 
 resources 
 For 
 added 
 objectivity 
 examine 
 at 
 the 
 IT 
 Security 
 Spending 
 Trends 
 [1] 
 published 
 by 
 the 
 SANS 
 Institute 
 In 
 2016 
 financial 
 institutions 
 typically 
 spent 
 the 
 most 
 on 
 IT 
 security 
 averaging 
 from 
 10 12% 
 of 
 their 
 annual 
 budgets 
 of 
 $500 000 $1Mil 
 Government 
 agencies 
 came 
 in 
 at 
 second 
 place 
 spending 
 between 
 7 9% 
 of 
 their 
 annual 
 budgets 
 ranging 
 from 
 $1Mil $10Mil 
 Other 
 industries 
 such 
 as 
 education 
 and 
 healthcare 
 spent 
 less 
 but 
 are 
 still 
 increasing 
 their 
 annual 
 IT 
 security 
 spending 
 at 
 a 
 steady 
 rate 
 A 
 report 
 from 
 Cybersecurity 
 Ventures[2] 
 predicted 
 that 
 the 
 cybersecurity 
 market 
 size 
 will 
 grow 
 by 
 $1 
 trillion 
 (US) 
 from 
 2017 
 to 
 2021 
 as 
 the 
 constantly 
 increasing 
 number 
 of 
 cybercrimes 
 have 
 already 
 exceeded 
 the 
 critical 
 level 
 
 
 Take 
 a 
 look 
 at 
 the 
 means 
 to 
 which 
 end users 
 must 
 go 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 defend 
 themselves 
 while 
 corporate 
 users 
 are 
 protected 
 by 
 numerous 
 security 
 solutions 
 and 
 professionals 
 Unfortunately 
 at 
 best 
 you 
 cannot 
 get 
 away 
 with 
 using 
 poor 
 quality 
 security 
 software 
 inferior 
 hardware 
 or 
 a 
 having 
 a 
 personal 
 lack 
 of 
 expertise 
 As 
 blockchain 
 technology 
 has 
 evolved 
 various 
 scams 
 and 
 cybercrimes 
 have 
 also 
 developed 
 One 
 of 
 the 
 most 
 well known 
 fields 
 of 
 cybercrime 
 is 
 ransomware 
 a 
 new 
 type 
 of 
 cybercrime 
 that 
 takes 
 the 
 user s 
 data 
 hostage 
 and 
 demands 
 monetarycompensation 
 via 
 bitcoin 
 in 
 exchange 
 for 
 the 
 release 
 of 
 the 
 users 
 data 
 It 
 is 
 expected 
 that 
 the 
 ransomware 
 market 
 will 
 expand 
 to 
 $17 36 
 billion 
 by 
 2021 
 Perhaps 
 here 
 bitcoin 
 is 
 undergoing 
 an 
 ironic 
 situation 
 where 
 its 
 monetary 
 value 
 is 
 most 
 significantly 
 used 
 through 
 cybercrime 
 as 
 currency 
 of 
 choice 
 for 
 cyber 
 criminals 
 
 
 The 
 DAO 
 case 
 of 
 2016 
 was 
 the 
 first 
 major 
 security 
 vulnerability 
 incident 
 of 
 the 
 blockchain 
 age 
 which 
 exposed 
 about 
 15% 
 of 
 the 
 total 
 Ethereum 
 to 
 hackers 
 due 
 to 
 attacks 
 on 
 code 
 vulnerabilities 
 As 
 a 
 result 
 tens 
 of 
 thousands 
 of 
 investors 
 suffered 
 financial 
 loss 
 The 
 only 
 means 
 of 
 solving 
 this 
 problem 
 was 
 the 
 implementation 
 of 
 the 
 hard 
 fork[3] 
 which 
 violated 
 the 
 philosophical 
 beliefs 
 of 
 blockchain 
 immutability 
 At 
 the 
 root 
 of 
 this 
 recent 
 catastrophe 
 rests 
 the 
 unflinching 
 difficulty 
 of 
 decentralization 
 combined 
 with 
 the 
 strong 
 autonomy 
 that 
 has 
 gone 
 hand 
 in 
 hand 
 with 
 individual 
 responsibility 
 for 
 so 
 long 
 
 
 
 Chapter 3 
 
 Security of Decentralization 
 
 Nowadays 
 everyone 
 has 
 at 
 least 
 one 
 email 
 address 
 It 
 is 
 impossible 
 to 
 imagine 
 a 
 business 
 card 
 without 
 an 
 email 
 However 
 this 
 common 
 necessity 
 of 
 our 
 modern 
 lives 
 also 
 presents 
 a 
 vulnerability 
 Consider 
 the 
 phishing 
 email 
 in 
 which 
 malicious 
 macros 
 are 
 inserted 
 into 
 attached 
 document 
 files 
 such 
 * doc 
 * xls 
 * ppt 
 etc 
 which 
 then 
 infect 
 the 
 user 
 when 
 he 
 or 
 she 
 opens 
 the 
 infected 
 document 
 file 
 or 
 clicks 
 on 
 attached 
 links 
 In 
 July 
 2017 
 a 
 major 
 Korean 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchange 
 Bithumb 
 was 
 hacked 
 and 
 the 
 confidential 
 information 
 of 
 31 000 
 customers 
 and 
 companies 
 was 
 stolen 
 just 
 by 
 the 
 opening 
 of 
 one 
 infected 
 file 
 The 
 perpetrator 
 of 
 this 
 phishing 
 attack 
 has 
 yet 
 to 
 be 
 identified 
 
 
 Phishing 
 is 
 not 
 limited 
 to 
 email 
 In 
 the 
 case 
 of 
 telephone 
 phishing 
 there 
 are 
 a 
 variety 
 of 
 fraudulent 
 methods 
 that 
 have 
 tricked 
 many 
 individuals 
 into 
 giving 
 up 
 their 
 personal 
 information 
 over 
 the 
 telephone 
 to 
 a 
 criminal 
 pretending 
 to 
 be 
 the 
 operator 
 of 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchange 
 For 
 example 
 a 
 hacker 
 may 
 pretend 
 to 
 be 
 an 
 administrator 
 claiming 
 that 
 the 
 users 
 account 
 has 
 been 
 hacked 
 In 
 this 
 case 
 the 
 hacker 
 will 
 claim 
 that 
 as 
 the 
 administrator 
 he 
 needs 
 the 
 users 
 personal 
 information 
 to 
 reset 
 the 
 password 
 of 
 the 
 account 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 stop 
 the 
 hacking 
 Through 
 manipulation 
 and 
 exploitation 
 of 
 the 
 psychological 
 weaknesses 
 of 
 the 
 user 
 the 
 hacker 
 gains 
 access 
 to 
 the 
 account 
 
 
 Another 
 type 
 of 
 bitcoin 
 related 
 hacking 
 can 
 occur 
 during 
 the 
 Initial 
 Coin 
 Offering 
 (ICO) 
 by 
 creating 
 a 
 fake 
 ICO 
 fundraising 
 site 
 and 
 giving 
 false 
 information 
 by 
 hacking 
 the 
 fundraising 
 address 
 and 
 replacing 
 it 
 with 
 the 
 address 
 of 
 the 
 hacker 
 
 
 The 
 key 
 to 
 these 
 various 
 hacks 
 is 
 that 
 they 
 occur 
 because 
 victims 
 are 
 easy 
 to 
 target 
 due 
 to 
 the 
 open 
 nature 
 of 
 the 
 internet 
 The 
 ideology 
 of 
 decentralization 
 is 
 central 
 to 
 both 
 cryptocurrencyand 
 the 
 internet 
 but 
 it 
 is 
 impossible 
 to 
 say 
 that 
 blockchain 
 implements 
 perfect 
 autonomy 
 Autonomy 
 in 
 openness 
 is 
 subject 
 to 
 individual 
 responsibility 
 Decentralization 
 is 
 not 
 a 
 magical 
 solution 
 to 
 all 
 problems 
 and 
 we 
 do 
 not 
 live 
 in 
 a 
 fantasy 
 world 
 in 
 which 
 the 
 only 
 actors 
 on 
 the 
 internet 
 act 
 with 
 the 
 best 
 of 
 intentions 
 We 
 need 
 to 
 face 
 reality 
 Bad 
 actors 
 are 
 taking 
 aim 
 at 
 thisplace 
 and 
 the 
 ideology 
 of 
 decentralization 
 must 
 develop 
 a 
 philosophy 
 of 
 security 
 
 
 
 Chapter 4 
 
 Reputation System on Blockchain 
 
 At 
 the 
 root 
 of 
 bitcoin 
 lies 
 the 
 blockchain[4] 
 a 
 complete 
 peer to peer 
 system 
 that 
 does 
 not 
 require 
 the 
 control 
 of 
 a 
 central 
 agency 
 but 
 which 
 is 
 completed 
 using 
 a 
 consensus 
 algorithm 
 through 
 which 
 the 
 remittance 
 of 
 electronic 
 money 
 is 
 completed 
 within 
 a 
 network 
 without 
 mutual 
 trust 
 In 
 the 
 process 
 of 
 settlement 
 there 
 is 
 the 
 rule 
 of 
 the 
 distributor 
 that 
 all 
 records 
 are 
 shared 
 however 
 commercialization 
 of 
 realistic 
 financial 
 products 
 is 
 difficult 
 in 
 terms 
 of 
 information 
 disclosure 
 of 
 sensitive 
 personal 
 property 
 apart 
 from 
 the 
 technical 
 aspects 
 On 
 the 
 other 
 hand 
 without 
 a 
 guarantee 
 of 
 real 
 identity 
 we 
 cannot 
 take 
 part 
 in 
 a 
 variety 
 of 
 financial 
 services 
 and 
 as 
 time 
 goes 
 by 
 the 
 rules 
 and 
 regulations 
 become 
 even 
 stronger 
 One 
 alternative 
 is 
 the 
 consortium 
 blockchain 
 although 
 it 
 still 
 does 
 not 
 make 
 the 
 most 
 of 
 the 
 benefits 
 of 
 public 
 decentralization 
 
 
 The 
 fundamental 
 question 
 of 
 what 
 the 
 best 
 solution 
 to 
 inherit 
 the 
 advantages 
 of 
 public 
 decentralization 
 is 
 this 
 If 
 the 
 information 
 is 
 fully 
 disclosed 
 and 
 accumulated 
 does 
 it 
 become 
 more 
 valuable 
 or 
 less 
 valuable 
 
 
 If 
 a 
 blockchain based 
 reputation 
 system 
 and 
 information 
 related 
 to 
 cybercrimes 
 that 
 are 
 currently 
 occurring 
 are 
 all 
 shared 
 within 
 a 
 blockchain 
 distributed 
 policy 
 then 
 the 
 decentralized 
 nature 
 of 
 the 
 blockchain 
 will 
 protect 
 the 
 majority 
 system 
 The 
 biggest 
 problem 
 in 
 operating 
 within 
 existing 
 reputation 
 systems 
 is 
 manipulation 
 and 
 destruction 
 of 
 information 
 When 
 an 
 individual 
 or 
 group 
 with 
 malicious 
 intent 
 manipulates 
 the 
 reputation 
 of 
 an 
 organization 
 or 
 system 
 or 
 hacks 
 a 
 blockchain based 
 system 
 to 
 manipulate 
 its 
 recorded 
 reputation 
 the 
 latter 
 case 
 is 
 the 
 part 
 that 
 is 
 naturally 
 resolved 
 by 
 the 
 advantage 
 of 
 the 
 data 
 integrity 
 of 
 the 
 blockchain 
 However 
 in 
 a 
 reputationsystem 
 scoring 
 the 
 quality 
 of 
 information 
 rather 
 than 
 a 
 transaction 
 an 
 attack 
 such 
 as 
 a 
 Sybil 
 attack 
 cannot 
 be 
 easily 
 defeated 
 by 
 the 
 basic 
 characteristics 
 of 
 the 
 blockchain 
 because 
 of 
 the 
 subjective 
 nature 
 of 
 the 
 pre manipulated 
 information 
 which 
 allows 
 it 
 to 
 be 
 recorded 
 despite 
 the 
 transaction 
 reputation 
 This 
 part 
 however 
 makes 
 it 
 possible 
 to 
 solve 
 through 
 the 
 power 
 of 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 
 
 
 Chapter 5 
 
 Collective Intelligence 
 
 While 
 the 
 reputation 
 of 
 information 
 related 
 to 
 cybercrimes 
 has 
 been 
 combined 
 with 
 the 
 blockchain 
 it 
 has 
 the 
 advantage 
 of 
 being 
 able 
 to 
 prevent 
 and 
 protect 
 many 
 imitative 
 crimes 
 due 
 to 
 the 
 shared 
 economic 
 principles 
 of 
 the 
 data 
 but 
 more 
 importantly 
 the 
 cybercrime 
 investigation 
 frameworkcanbecompleted For 
 example 
 there 
 is 
 a 
 prejudice 
 that 
 cybercriminals 
 targeting 
 cryptocurrency 
 cannot 
 grasp 
 users 
 information 
 due 
 to 
 their 
 autonomy 
 But 
 this 
 is 
 incorrect 
 
 
 Essentially 
 the 
 blockchain 
 is 
 a 
 system 
 that 
 shares 
 information 
 transparently 
 All 
 transactions 
 are 
 recorded 
 in 
 a 
 distributed 
 ledger 
 and 
 can 
 be 
 verified 
 without 
 special 
 permission 
 This 
 means 
 that 
 it 
 is 
 possible 
 to 
 trace 
 these 
 transactions 
 In 
 fact 
 the 
 flow 
 of 
 cryptocurrency 
 transactions 
 that 
 has 
 been 
 hijacked 
 by 
 cybercrime 
 is 
 easily 
 traceable 
 Ironically 
 however 
 the 
 most 
 common 
 way 
 to 
 avoid 
 that 
 trail 
 is 
 via 
 money 
 laundering 
 using 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchanges 
 and 
 coin 
 shift 
 systems 
 If 
 you 
 do 
 not 
 exchange 
 money 
 you 
 lose 
 the 
 cash 
 value 
 of 
 the 
 coin 
 A 
 virtuous 
 cycle 
 occurs 
 because 
 there 
 is 
 an 
 exchange 
 The 
 same 
 applies 
 to 
 autonomous 
 transaction 
 coins 
 such 
 as 
 Dash 
 Zcash 
 and 
 Monero 
 that 
 hide 
 transaction 
 information 
 as 
 eventually 
 they 
 need 
 an 
 exchange 
 to 
 cash 
 out 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 enhance 
 traceability 
 through 
 the 
 Interactive 
 Cooperative 
 Framework 
 associated 
 with 
 transaction 
 analysis 
 projects 
 such 
 as 
 BlockSci [6] 
 
 
 It 
 is 
 not 
 impossible 
 to 
 cooperate 
 with 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchanges 
 in 
 relation 
 to 
 cybercrime 
 They 
 are 
 also 
 striving 
 to 
 protect 
 users 
 in 
 strict 
 regulations 
 therefore 
 most 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchanges 
 require 
 that 
 they 
 meet 
 the 
 provision 
 that 
 they 
 cannot 
 cooperate 
 without 
 the 
 consent 
 of 
 the 
 police 
 or 
 government 
 investigative 
 agencies 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 meet 
 the 
 basic 
 obligation 
 to 
 protect 
 the 
 confidentiality 
 of 
 the 
 users 
 However 
 cryptocurrency 
 regulation 
 is 
 different 
 between 
 countries 
 around 
 the 
 world 
 and 
 it 
 is 
 almost 
 impossible 
 to 
 receive 
 help 
 from 
 experts 
 who 
 have 
 expertise 
 in 
 cryptocurrency 
 in 
 local 
 investigative 
 agencies 
 Even 
 worse 
 most 
 countries 
 do 
 not 
 treat 
 cybercrimes 
 that 
 are 
 related 
 to 
 cryptocurrency 
 as 
 a 
 real 
 financial 
 crime 
 In 
 the 
 end 
 it 
 is 
 a 
 reality 
 that 
 only 
 good 
 people 
 who 
 are 
 not 
 protected 
 by 
 the 
 legal 
 system 
 will 
 suffer 
 financial 
 loss 
 
 
 It 
 is 
 the 
 blockchain 
 itself 
 that 
 contains 
 information 
 regarding 
 all 
 the 
 existing 
 occurring 
 and 
 suspicious 
 cybercrimes 
 in 
 an 
 immutable 
 database 
 that 
 can 
 fill 
 this 
 enormous 
 hole 
 in 
 the 
 current 
 legal 
 system 
 that 
 serves 
 an 
 obstacle 
 to 
 a 
 decentralized 
 investigation 
 system 
 All 
 information 
 can 
 be 
 made 
 instantly 
 transparent 
 to 
 the 
 individuals 
 exchanges 
 projects 
 security 
 firms 
 governments 
 etc 
 and 
 most 
 importantly 
 it 
 can 
 be 
 tracked 
 within 
 one 
 system 
 by 
 all 
 people 
 around 
 the 
 world 
 A 
 reputation 
 system 
 that 
 is 
 managed 
 by 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 also 
 means 
 simplicity 
 This 
 means 
 that 
 exchanges 
 can 
 refer 
 to 
 this 
 system 
 and 
 take 
 the 
 proactive 
 action 
 of 
 trusting 
 the 
 system s 
 reputation 
 without 
 the 
 requirement 
 for 
 complex 
 legal 
 evidence 
 which 
 previously 
 has 
 given 
 users 
 a 
 sense 
 of 
 helplessness 
 This 
 can 
 prevent 
 and 
 control 
 the 
 many 
 cybercrimes 
 that 
 occur 
 within 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 industries 
 People 
 or 
 institutions 
 that 
 have 
 been 
 thoroughly 
 verified 
 qualified 
 and 
 certified 
 by 
 a 
 majority 
 of 
 experts 
 will 
 be 
 authorized 
 to 
 update 
 the

 Chapter 6 
 
 Artificial Intelligence 
 
 The 
 mechanism 
 of 
 artificial 
 intelligence 
 is 
 simply 
 to 
 model 
 a 
 large 
 quantity 
 of 
 good 
 quality 
 data 
 using 
 an 
 optimized 
 algorithm 
 Attackers 
 often 
 employ 
 intelligent 
 use 
 of 
 an 
 unexpected 
 number 
 of 
 attacks 
 to 
 exploit 
 system 
 vulnerabilities 
 over 
 long 
 periods 
 of 
 time 
 when 
 targeting 
 an 
 individual 
 group 
 government 
 business 
 or 
 organization 
 Thereafter 
 a 
 command 
 and 
 control 
 communication 
 channel 
 is 
 established 
 with 
 the 
 hackers 
 external 
 command 
 tower 
 It 
 is 
 not 
 so 
 easyto 
 grasp 
 the 
 behavior 
 of 
 an 
 attacker 
 who 
 has 
 already 
 successfully 
 entered 
 an 
 internal 
 network 
 Most 
 existing 
 security 
 technologies 
 do 
 not 
 have 
 a 
 way 
 to 
 doubt 
 the 
 behavior 
 of 
 a 
 seemingly 
 legitimate 
 entity 
 in 
 making 
 an 
 exact 
 binary 
 representation 
 of 
 an 
 attack 
 as 
 a 
 signature 
 For 
 this 
 reason 
 many 
 attacks 
 are 
 perceived 
 as 
 normal 
 users 
 daily 
 patterns 
 
 
 Let 
 us 
 consider 
 for 
 a 
 moment 
 the 
 grasshopper 
 and 
 the 
 hairworm 
 Hairworms 
 infect 
 grasshoppers 
 and 
 other 
 insects 
 which 
 reside 
 on 
 dry 
 land 
 even 
 though 
 hairworms 
 must 
 reproduce 
 in 
 a 
 wetland 
 environment 
 An 
 infected 
 grasshopper 
 looks 
 and 
 initially 
 acts 
 no 
 different 
 than 
 any 
 other 
 grasshopper 
 However 
 after 
 the 
 hairworm 
 is 
 ready 
 to 
 reproduce 
 the 
 grasshoppers 
 behavior 
 begins 
 to 
 change 
 Through 
 secretion 
 of 
 chemicals 
 the 
 hairworm 
 takes 
 control 
 of 
 the 
 grasshoppers 
 mind 
 causing 
 it 
 to 
 seek 
 out 
 water 
 and 
 
 in 
 effect 
 
 commit 
 suicide 
 by 
 drowning 
 Thus 
 the 
 hairworm 
 can 
 emerge 
 and 
 begin 
 the 
 next 
 stage 
 of 
 its 
 life 
 cycle 
 
 
 The 
 key 
 to 
 machine 
 learning 
 security 
 technology 
 is 
 to 
 keep 
 track 
 of 
 changes 
 in 
 behaviors 
 not 
 changes 
 in 
 the 
 appearance 
 Think 
 about 
 the 
 grasshopper 
 While 
 the 
 hairworm 
 controls 
 the 
 grasshopper s 
 brain 
 the 
 grasshopper 
 will 
 behave 
 outside 
 of 
 the 
 normal 
 range 
 of 
 its 
 typical 
 activities 
 including 
 aberrant 
 behavior 
 such 
 as 
 seeking 
 out 
 wetlands 
 even 
 though 
 externally 
 it 
 appears 
 normal 
 and 
 healthy 
 This 
 unusual 
 behavior 
 can 
 enable 
 entomologists 
 to 
 detect 
 infected 
 grasshoppers 
 by 
 observation 
 alone 
 Similarly 
 if 
 we 
 compare 
 the 
 correlation 
 of 
 changes 
 in 
 minor 
 behaviors 
 rather 
 than 
 the 
 changes 
 in 
 appearance 
 even 
 if 
 nothing 
 specific 
 has 
 gone 
 wrong 
 this 
 canallow 
 us 
 to 
 recognize 
 the 
 empirical 
 risks 
 in 
 advance 
 and 
 provide 
 a 
 high 
 probability 
 of 
 disaster 
 prevention 
 
 
 There 
 are 
 two 
 ways 
 that 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 can 
 use 
 the 
 blockchain 
 and 
 artificial 
 intelligence 
 together 
 The 
 first 
 is 
 the 
 machine 
 learning based 
 blockchain 
 security 
 client 
 wallet 
 that 
 collects 
 a 
 users 
 or 
 nodes 
 information 
 and 
 creates 
 model 
 behaviors 
 of 
 all 
 the 
 aspects 
 such 
 as 
 normal 
 activities 
 of 
 your 
 computer 
 usage 
 patterns 
 including 
 transaction 
 patterns 
 When 
 suspicious 
 behavior 
 occurs 
 the 
 security 
 wallet 
 recognizes 
 the 
 probability 
 of 
 threat 
 and 
 blocks 
 the 
 execution 
 of 
 the 
 process 
 Detailed 
 information 
 is 
 reported 
 to 
 the 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 group 
 and 
 shared 
 with 
 the 
 reputation 
 system 
 All 
 information 
 is 
 shared 
 through 
 the 
 API 
 to 
 everyone 
 who 
 would 
 like 
 to 
 use 
 it 
 and 
 it 
 is 
 extended 
 to 
 the 
 most 
 accurate 
 and 
 secure 
 global 
 intelligence 
 system 
 in 
 the 
 world 
 
 
 The 
 second 
 is 
 to 
 construct 
 a 
 Fraud 
 Detection 
 System 
 (FDS) 
 using 
 data 
 from 
 the 
 blockchain 
 Essentially 
 Sentinel 
 Protocols 
 anomaly 
 detection 
 is 
 associated 
 with 
 a 
 consensus 
 system 
 The 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 group 
 or 
 individuals 
 who 
 are 
 certified 
 by 
 a 
 majority 
 of 
 experts 
 (or 
 initially 
 by 
 the 
 Uppsala 
 Foundation 
 during 
 the 
 early 
 stages 
 of 
 SIPB) 
 acts 
 as 
 an 
 International 
 Cybercrime 
 Police 
 
 
 
 Force 
 known 
 as 
 The 
 Sentinels 
 They 
 are 
 responsible 
 for 
 research 
 and 
 analysis 
 and 
 have 
 special 
 authority 
 to 
 update 
 their 
 reputation 
 system 
 They 
 receive 
 rewards 
 through 
 Sentinel 
 Protocols 
 shared 
 economy 
 system 
 To 
 prevent 
 insider 
 threats 
 the 
 Fraud 
 Detection 
 System 
 (FDS) 
 is 
 installed 
 to 
 monitor 
 and 
 detect 
 abnormal 
 behavior 
 for 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 as 
 well 
 as 
 ordinary 
 users 
 abnormal 
 transactions

 Security Features 
 
 Security 
 Intelligence 
 Platform 
 for 
 Blockchain 
 (SIPB 
 or 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol) 
 has 
 the 
 following 
 unique 
 security 
 features 
 
 
 
 Threat 
 reputation 
 database 
 (TRDB) 
 
 Machine 
 learning 
 (ML) 
 engine 
 integrated 
 security 
 wallet 
 (S Wallet) 
 
 Distributed 
 malware 
 analysis 
 sandbox 
 (D Sandbox) 
 Threat 
 reputation 
 database 
 (TRDB) 
 
 
 Threat 
 reputation 
 database 
 (TRDB) 
 can 
 tackle 
 two 
 problems 
 lied 
 in 
 existing 
 cybersecurity 
 industry 
 The 
 first 
 problem 
 is 
 centralized 
 database 
 of 
 the 
 security 
 firms 
 Keeping 
 threat 
 information 
 on 
 one 
 centralized 
 place 
 makes 
 it 
 vulnerable 
 to 
 information 
 manipulation 
 and 
 abuse 
 The 
 database 
 becomes 
 an 
 obvious 
 target 
 of 
 Sybil 
 attack 
 or 
 server 
 hacking 
 and 
 service 
 interruption 
 This 
 is 
 a 
 fundamental 
 problem 
 of 
 the 
 centralized 
 client server 
 model 
 of 
 the 
 Internet 
 In 
 October 
 2017 
 for 
 example 
 Russian 
 state 
 hackers 
 stole 
 NSA 
 materials 
 using 
 the 
 well known 
 antivirus 
 company 
 Kasperskys 
 antivirus 
 software 
 Basically 
 hackers 
 used 
 the 
 security 
 tools 
 to 
 find 
 vulnerabilities 
 of 
 the 
 target 
 The 
 decentralized 
 nature 
 of 
 blockchain 
 can 
 mitigate 
 such 
 issue 
 as 
 its 
 immutability 
 makes 
 it 
 difficult 
 to 
 tamper 
 with 
 the 
 data 
 This 
 increases 
 the 
 security 
 stability 
 of 
 the 
 server 
 that 
 provides 
 the 
 data 
 
 
 Another 
 problem 
 is 
 the 
 lack 
 of 
 shared 
 knowledge 
 among 
 security 
 vendors 
 The 
 greater 
 the 
 collected 
 risk 
 information 
 the 
 higher 
 the 
 chance 
 of 
 preventing 
 cyber 
 crimes 
 However 
 each 
 security 
 vendor 
 compiles 
 threat 
 information 
 on 
 its 
 own 
 as 
 if 
 it 
 is 
 the 
 winner 
 takes 
 it 
 all 
 game 
 since 
 theres 
 no 
 incentive 
 for 
 vendors 
 to 
 collaborate 
 and 
 create 
 one 
 comprehensive 
 database 
 Anton 
 Chuvakin 
 research 
 VP 
 at 
 Gartner 
 once 
 said 
 that 
 It 
 is 
 truly 
 maddening 
 to 
 see 
 examples 
 of 
 bad 
 guys 
 sharing 
 data 
 tricks 
 methods 
 and 
 good 
 guys 
 having 
 no 
 effective 
 way 
 of 
 doing 
 it 
 It 
 is 
 the 
 ordinary 
 people 
 who 
 pays 
 this 
 huge 
 inefficiency 
 Good 
 will 
 alone 
 doesnt 
 scale 
 so 
 TRDB 
 uses 
 incentive 
 scheme 
 which 
 is 
 explained 
 in 
 chapter 
 11 
 Security 
 experts 
 and 
 vendors 
 are 
 encouraged 
 to 
 contribute 
 to 
 building 
 the 
 threat 
 database 
 under 
 the 
 consensus 
 mechanism 
 and 
 feedback 
 from 
 participants 
 or 
 Delegated 
 Proof 
 of 
 Stake 
 (DPOS) 
 Through 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 TRDB 
 can 
 most 
 efficiently 
 and 
 effectively 
 collect 
 hackers 
 wallet 
 address 
 malicious 
 URI 
 phishing 
 address 
 malware 
 hashes 
 just 
 to 
 name 
 a 
 few 
 
 
 TRDB 
 is 
 only 
 updated 
 by 
 security 
 experts 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 eliminate 
 the 
 systematic 
 errors 
 such 
 as 
 false 
 positives 
 General 
 users 
 can 
 also 
 participate 
 however 
 using 
 two 
 methods 
 auto 
 reporting 
 and 
 manual 
 reporting 
 If 
 users 
 allow 
 auto 
 reporting 
 unknown 
 threats 
 that 
 are 
 automatically 
 detected 
 from 
 the 
 machine 
 learning based 
 security 
 wallet 
 go 
 into 
 the 
 database 
 Through 
 manual 
 reporting 
 user 
 can 
 report 
 risk 
 information 
 which 
 will 
 be 
 validated 
 by 
 the 
 community 
 afterwards 
 TRDB 
 will 
 be 
 provided 
 as 
 an 
 API 
 so 
 any 
 individual 
 or 
 organization 
 (e g 
 cryptocurrency 
 wallet 
 projects 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchanges 
 and 
 security 
 vendors) 
 can 
 make 
 use 
 of 
 the 
 information 
 
 
 
 Machine 
 learning 
 engine 
 integrated 
 security 
 wallet 
 (S Wallet) 
 
 
 S Wallet 
 has 
 the 
 functionality 
 of 
 antivirus 
 software 
 However 
 the 
 fundamental 
 difference 
 is 
 that 
 antivirus 
 software 
 is 
 best 
 able 
 to 
 respond 
 to 
 new 
 threats 
 only 
 by 
 receiving 
 the 
 latest 
 updates 
 via 
 a 
 centralized 
 server 
 for 
 all 
 new 
 known 
 signatures 
 This 
 approach 
 is 
 difficult 
 to 
 respond 
 to 
 unknown 
 threats 
 such 
 as 
 zero day 
 attacks 
 On 
 the 
 other 
 hand 
 S wallet 
 analyzes 
 the 
 threat 
 tendency 
 and 
 history 
 to 
 proactively 
 respond 
 to 
 unknown 
 threats 
 or 
 zero day 
 attacks 
 Thus 
 S 
 Wallet 
 does 
 not 
 need 
 signature 
 updates 
 This 
 unsupervised 
 learning 
 approach 
 is 
 especially 
 effective 
 against 
 threats 
 like 
 ransomware [7] 
 While 
 S wallet 
 leverages 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 from 
 connected 
 TRDB 
 it 
 provides 
 basic 
 blocking 
 services 
 for 
 the 
 following 
 information 
 
 
 
 Cryptocurrency

 URL/URI

 Data

 Fraud 
 Detection 
 System 
 It 
 is 
 important 
 to 
 understand 
 that 
 the 
 machine 
 learning 
 technology 
 enables 
 the 
 Fraud 
 Detection 
 System 
 (FDS) 
 on 
 all 
 distributed 
 ledgers 
 and 
 identifies 
 transactions 
 that 
 are 
 reported 
 for 
 misuse 
 or 
 stolen 
 thereby 
 preventing 
 the 
 secondary 
 damage 
 
 
 Distributed 
 malware 
 analysis 
 sandbox 
 (D Sandbox) 
 
 
 Sandbox 
 is 
 a 
 security 
 mechanism 
 to 
 run 
 untested 
 or 
 unverified 
 programs 
 and 
 code 
 on 
 a 
 separate 
 virtual 
 machine 
 without 
 risking 
 the 
 application 
 or 
 host 
 D Sandbox 
 is 
 where 
 potentialthreat 
 is 
 submitted 
 via 
 a 
 ticket 
 system 
 and 
 analyzed 
 through 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 
 
 D Sandbox 
 has 
 two 
 outstanding 
 advantages 
 First 
 it 
 is 
 significantly 
 cost 
 effective 
 It 
 guarantees 
 infinite 
 scaling 
 through 
 distributed 
 systems 
 A 
 security 
 appliance 
 with 
 regular 
 sandbox 
 has 
 been 
 bounded 
 by 
 the 
 capability 
 of 
 running 
 virtual 
 machines 
 Even 
 the 
 high cost 
 security 
 appliances 
 were 
 very 
 limited 
 in 
 analyzing 
 malware 
 this 
 way 
 Also 
 the 
 regular 
 sandbox 
 system 
 was 
 highly 
 unstable 
 as 
 it 
 could 
 not 
 guarantee 
 high 
 capability 
 such 
 as 
 high 
 throughput 
 high 
 bandwidth 
 higher 
 usage 
 than 
 expected 
 This 
 often 
 led 
 to 
 system 
 performance 
 degradation 
 and 
 malfunctioning 
 which 
 not 
 only 
 harmed 
 the 
 user 
 experience 
 but 
 also 
 resulted 
 malware 
 infection 
 in 
 the 
 end 
 
 
 Second 
 advantage 
 is 
 that 
 while 
 D Sandbox 
 can 
 solve 
 the 
 waste 
 of 
 computing 
 power 
 in 
 Proof 
 of 
 Work 
 (PoW) 
 it 
 can 
 also 
 build 
 a 
 better 
 security 
 ecosystem 
 Indeed 
 the 
 computing 
 power 
 to 
 generate 
 the 
 hash 
 value 
 is 
 a 
 waste 
 The 
 nodes 
 participating 
 in 
 Sentinel 
 Protocols 
 network 
 can 
 use 
 their 
 computing 
 power 
 to 
 analyze 
 malware 
 additionally 
 After 
 all 
 the 
 advantage 
 of 
 a 
 decentralized 
 system 
 is 
 that 
 idle 
 resources 
 can 
 be 
 utilized 
 where 
 they 
 are 
 needed 
 Individual 
 users 
 will 
 be 
 of 
 help 
 by 
 provisioning 
 the 
 sandbox 
 through 
 a 
 virtual 
 machine 
 boosting 
 the 
 overall 
 security 
 ecosystem 
 
 
 
 Chapter 8 
 
 Sentinel Protocol Ecosystem 
 
 The 
 following 
 describes 
 use cases 
 in 
 the 
 ecosystem 
 of 
 the 
 Security 
 Intelligence 
 Platform 
 for 
 Blockchain 
 (SIPB 
 or 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol) 
 
 
 Interactive 
 Cooperation 
 Framework 
 (ICF 
 or 
 Sentinel 
 Portal) 
 
 
 One 
 of 
 the 
 biggest 
 obstacles 
 to 
 business 
 continuity 
 in 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 industry 
 is 
 security 
 Customer 
 hacking 
 incidents 
 and 
 their 
 related 
 costs 
 have 
 tremendously 
 increased 
 recently 
 but 
 appropriate 
 security 
 measures 
 have 
 not 
 taken 
 place 
 yet 
 It 
 is 
 difficult 
 to 
 cover 
 all 
 security 
 elements 
 if 
 the 
 industry 
 is 
 growing 
 so 
 rapidly 
 but 
 it 
 should 
 not 
 be 
 the 
 excuse 
 Some 
 crypto 
 exchange 
 platforms 
 lack 
 security 
 expertise 
 from 
 the 
 initial 
 system 
 design 
 to 
 the 
 full 
 operation 
 Customer 
 service 
 specialists 
 cannot 
 be 
 the 
 cybersecurity 
 specialists 
 but 
 they 
 are 
 certainly 
 doing 
 thedouble duty 
 as 
 of 
 now 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 overcomes 
 this 
 problem 
 by 
 providing 
 an 
 essential 
 framework 
 that 
 runs 
 by 
 trusted 
 cryptocurrency 
 security 
 experts 
 and 
 their 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 Just 
 by 
 joining 
 the 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 community 
 crypto 
 users 
 can 
 easily 
 obtain 
 knowledge 
 and 
 assistance 
 on 
 all 
 security 
 issues 
 They 
 can 
 also 
 deploy 
 security 
 solutions 
 provided 
 by 
 the 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 Inefficiency 
 costs 
 will 
 be 
 reduced 
 to 
 businesses 
 and 
 individuals 
 alike 
 This 
 framework 
 will 
 enhance 
 the 
 overall 
 security 
 of 
 the 
 crypto 
 world 
 and 
 flourishes 
 on 
 the 
 fundamental 
 principle 
 of 
 decentralization 
 
 
 A 
 beta 
 release 
 will

 Anti theft 
 system 
 
 
 While 
 more 
 real 
 world 
 applications 
 for 
 cryptocurrency 
 are 
 built 
 every 
 day 
 there 
 is 
 no 
 system 
 to 
 validate 
 the 
 integrity 
 of 
 the 
 crypto 
 assets 
 This 
 means 
 even 
 the 
 stolen 
 crypto 
 assets 
 can 
 be 
 abused 
 as 
 a 
 payment 
 for 
 commercial 
 services 
 as 
 long 
 as 
 the 
 hacker 
 splits 
 them 
 through 
 tumbling 
 and 
 mixing 
 Just 
 like 
 in 
 the 
 real 
 world 
 where 
 card 
 companies 
 block 
 the 
 use 
 of 
 stolen 
 credit/debit 
 card 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 will 
 track 
 all 
 the 
 stolen 
 cryptocurrencies 
 and 
 share 
 this 
 information 
 to 
 any 
 crypto 
 service 
 provider 
 Then 
 stolen 
 crypto 
 assets 
 cannot 
 be 
 used 
 or 
 converted 
 to 
 fiat 
 money 
 This 
 protection 
 scheme 
 will 
 keep 
 cryptocurrency 
 under 
 regulatory 
 constraints 
 
 
 Malformed 
 transaction 
 prevention 
 
 
 Addresses 
 registered 
 as 
 scams 
 and 
 all 
 derived 
 addresses 
 will 
 be 
 shared 
 within 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 community 
 in 
 real 
 time 
 thanks 
 to 
 the 
 nature 
 of 
 blockchain 
 As 
 long 
 as 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 is 
 applied 
 further 
 spread 
 of 
 damage 
 can 
 be 
 prevented 
 One 
 of 
 the 
 applicable 
 uses 
 is 
 during 
 ICOs 
 where 
 thousands 
 of 
 people 
 are 
 involved 
 for 
 a 
 short 
 period 
 of 
 time 
 and 
 address 
 could 
 be 
 tampered 
 Even 
 if 
 hacker 
 changes 
 the 
 address 
 all 
 users 
 are 
 automatically 
 notified 
 for 
 the 
 original 
 abnormal 
 address 
 and 
 newly 
 changed 
 addresses 
 This 
 can 
 totally 
 change 
 the 
 security 
 industry 
 paradigm 
 since 
 
 
 
 there 
 was 
 no 
 solidified 
 platform 
 that 
 could 
 act 
 like 
 this 
 before 
 There 
 was 
 no 
 systematic 
 method 
 to 
 prevent 
 thousands 
 of 
 individual 
 users 
 to 
 get 
 notified 
 of 
 an 
 attack 
 and 
 prevent 
 the 
 damage 
 spread 
 all 
 at 
 the 
 same 
 time 
 
 
 Unknown 
 Threat 
 Prevention 
 (User 
 Scenario) 
 
 
 Hacker 
 Malloy 
 uploads 
 a 
 software 
 into 
 a 
 well known 
 cryptocurrency 
 online 
 community 
 He 
 made 
 this 
 software 
 to 
 be 
 undetectable 
 by 
 reputable 
 threat checking 
 website 
 such 
 as 
 VirusTotal 
 or 
 anti virus 
 programs 
 Dozens 
 of 
 community 
 users 
 including 
 Alice 
 downloads 
 this 
 seemingly 
 mining 
 software 
 (Unfortunately 
 most 
 users 
 do 
 not 
 know 
 how 
 to 
 check 
 the 
 integrity 
 of 
 an 
 original 
 file 
 via 
 md5 
 sha 
 etc ) 
 Once 
 Malloy 
 notices 
 that 
 his 
 miner 
 (backdoor) 
 is 
 downloaded 
 he 
 replaces 
 it 
 with 
 the 
 clean 
 normal 
 file 
 By 
 then 
 the 
 first 
 mining 
 software 
 (backdoor) 
 user 
 has 
 already 
 been 
 compromised 
 and 
 all 
 information 
 is 
 collected 
 by 
 Malloy both 
 the 
 passphrase 
 of 
 the 
 private 
 key 
 of 
 the 
 wallet 
 and 
 the 
 credential 
 of 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchange 
 have 
 been 
 stolen 
 However 
 it 
 is 
 difficult 
 to 
 ascertain 
 how 
 the

 was 
 compromised 
 as 
 Alice 
 
 a

 does 
 not 
 have 
 any 
 of 
 the 
 necessary 
 investigative 
 skills 
 or

 to 
 investigate 
 this 
 cybercrime 
 
 
 Meanwhile 
 the 
 same 
 online 
 community 
 user 
 Bob 
 uses 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol s 
 security 
 wallet 
 Bob 
 also 
 downloads 
 the 
 corrupted 
 mining 
 software 
 However 
 the 
 machine 
 learning 
 engine 
 within 
 S Wallet 
 detects 
 that 
 the

 is 
 highly 
 suspicious 
 The 
 engine 
 blocks 
 the

 even 
 if 
 the

 hasnt 
 been 
 labeled 
 as

 attack 
 and 
 it 
 hadnt 
 been

 by 
 any

 software 
 thus 
 far 
 As 
 soon 
 as 
 the

 execution 
 is

 corresponding

 is 
 automatically 
 submitted 
 to

 Then 
 The

 of 
 trusted 
 security 
 experts 
 analyzes 
 the 
 root

 of

 This

 and 
 also 
 reported 
 to 
 the

 of

 the

 identified 
 as

 Meanwhile 
 Malloy

 Hacker 
 Malloy 
 has 
 a 
 wallet 
 of 
 seized 
 coins 
 which 
 he 
 hacked 
 from 
 many 
 people 
 Prior 
 to 
 cashing 
 he 
 distributes 
 coins 
 on 
 a 
 number 
 of 
 sub addresses 
 to 
 avoid

 This 
 is 
 possible 
 due 
 to 
 the 
 nature 
 of 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 wallet 
 Alice 
 is 
 one 
 of 
 Malloys 
 victims 
 As 
 soon 
 as 
 Alice 
 finds 
 out 
 her 
 coins 
 are 
 stolen 
 she 
 reports 
 it 
 to 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 The

 confirms 
 the

 Sentinel

 This 
 will 
 be 
 shared 
 to 
 all 
 crypto

 If 
 Malloy

 the

 receives 
 a

 it 
 will 
 cut 
 off 
 any 
 chance 
 for 
 hacker 
 Malloy 
 to 
 make 
 use 
 of 
 the 
 seized 
 coins 
 It 
 wont 
 be 
 easy 
 for 
 Alice 
 to 
 have 
 the

 back 
 since 
 current 
 judicial 
 systems 
 across

 her 
 much 
 if 
 she 
 lives 
 in 
 Europe 
 while 
 the

 is

 Alice 
 starts 
 to 
 actively 
 promote 
 her 
 case 
 and 
 the 
 advantage 
 of 
 using

 in 
 the 
 hope 
 of

 Consensus 
 
 The 
 basic 
 mechanism 
 of 
 Proof 
 of 
 Work 
 (PoW) 
 gives 
 the 
 right 
 to 
 block 
 generation 
 and 
 its 
 corresponding 
 benefits 
 when 
 the 
 results 
 reach 
 an 
 approximation 
 of 
 the 
 given 
 target 
 difficulty 
 through 
 mining 
 The 
 process 
 of 
 finding 
 the 
 results 
 requires 
 extensive 
 computational 
 work 
 that 
 involve 
 trial 
 and 
 error 
 so 
 it 
 is 
 difficult 
 for 
 all 
 but 
 a 
 few 
 to 
 achieve 
 it 
 Therefore 
 the 
 person 
 who 
 has 
 gone 
 through 
 these 
 difficult 
 processes 
 may 
 become 
 a 
 delegate 
 to 
 represent 
 the 
 majority 
 The 
 problem 
 is 
 that 
 the 
 massive 
 waste 
 of 
 electricity 
 in 
 the 
 process 
 of 
 finding 
 this 
 delegate 
 is 
 inefficient 
 As 
 a 
 result 
 people 
 have 
 come 
 across 
 other 
 methods 
 of 
 improving 
 consensus 
 Subsequently 
 an 
 ideal 
 algorithm 
 was 
 created 
 which 
 is 
 Proof 
 of 
 Stake 
 (PoS) 
 that 
 increases 
 the 
 probability 
 of 
 delegation 
 by 
 amount 
 of 
 stake 
 hold 
 However 
 the 
 limitations 
 of 
 the 
 system 
 delegated 
 by 
 the 
 two 
 algorithms 
 are 
 not 
 100% 
 free 
 from 
 the 
 51% 
 attack 
 as 
 the 
 delegator 
 cannot 
 distinguish 
 between 
 good 
 intentions 
 and 
 malicious 
 intentions 
 of 
 majority 
 
 
 The 
 consensus 
 of 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 essentially 
 uses 
 the 
 idea 
 of 
 the 
 Delegated 
 Proof 
 of 
 Stake 
 (DPoS)[8] 
 introduced 
 from 
 BitShares 
 invented 
 by 
 Daniel 
 Larimer 
 The 
 Sentinels 
 delegated 
 by 
 the 
 Uppsala 
 Foundation 
 are 
 a 
 group 
 of 
 proven 
 institutions 
 or 
 individuals 
 with 
 the 
 necessary 
 qualifications 
 such 
 as 
 the 
 security 
 team 
 at 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 exchanges 
 global 
 cyber 
 security 
 research 
 firms 
 or 
 group 
 of 
 white 
 hackers 
 or 
 individual 
 white 
 hackers 
 all 
 of 
 them 
 are 
 experts 
 who 
 have 
 proven 
 their 
 status 
 and 
 experience 
 In 
 reality 
 the 
 risk 
 is 
 dramatically 
 reduced 
 and 
 thus 
 consensus 
 is 
 optimized 
 However 
 the 
 gap 
 between 
 the 
 social 
 engineering 
 viewpoint 
 and 
 the 
 algorithm 
 is 
 undeniable 
 as 
 mentioned 
 above 
 In 
 order 
 to 
 solve 
 this 
 problem 
 the 
 score 
 of 
 reputation 
 is 
 separated 
 by 
 another 
 share 
 Sentinel 
 Point 
 (SP) 
 where 
 UPP 
 is 
 the 
 circulation 
 currency 
 Sentinel 
 Points 
 can 
 only 
 be 
 obtained 
 by 
 acting 
 as 
 a 
 member 
 of 
 The 
 Sentinels 
 For 
 example 
 it 
 analyzes 
 the 
 cases 
 registered 
 with 
 AP 
 and 
 MP 
 records 
 the 
 relevant 
 information 
 in 
 the 
 Threat 
 database 
 and 
 then 
 based 
 on 
 the 
 data 
 many 
 ecosystems 
 of 
 various 
 industries 
 receive 
 help 
 Another 
 way 
 is 
 that 
 based 
 on 
 their 
 performance 
 people 
 can 
 actually 
 vote 
 on 
 their 
 reputation 
 The 
 system 
 that 
 is 
 delegated 
 by 
 obtaining 
 a 
 reputation 
 score 
 defined 
 as 
 the 
 Proof 
 of 
 Protection 
 (PoP) 
 in 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 If 
 a 
 dishonest 
 Sentinel 
 Protocols 
 actions 
 intend 
 harm 
 such 
 as 
 a 
 Sybil 
 attack 
 or 
 forking 
 a 
 chain 
 he 
 will 
 lose 
 his 
 reputation 
 score 
 as 
 a 
 punishment 
 As 
 with 
 the 
 slasher 
 of 
 Ethereum[9] 
 this 
 eliminates 
 the 
 nothing 
 at 
 stake 
 issue 
 as 
 representatives 
 are 
 threatened 
 with 
 loss 
 of 
 both 
 reputation 
 and 
 qualification 
 
 
 The 
 advantage 
 of 
 the 
 reputation 
 system 
 especially 
 this 
 structure 
 is 
 that 
 it 
 is 
 almost 
 impossible 
 to 
 become 
 a 
 bad 
 actor 
 as 
 individuals 
 are 
 representatives 
 of 
 trust 
 in 
 their 
 professional 
 field 
 Technically 
 in 
 this 
 trust 
 structure 
 a 
 large 
 number 
 of 
 delegated 
 Sentinels 
 are 
 unnecessary 
 that 
 would 
 only 
 serve 
 to 
 increase 
 randomness 
 for 
 securing 
 consensus 
 and 
 add 
 unnecessary 
 delay 
 Therefore 
 the 
 consensus 
 structure 
 of 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 has 
 small 
 group 
 only 
 of 
 only 
 seven 
 Sentinels 
 charged 
 with 
 validation 
 of 
 transactions 
 generating 
 blocks 
 and 
 updating 
 the 
 Threat 
 database 
 According 
 to 
 the 
 reputation 
 ranking 
 a 
 total 
 ten 
 Sentinels 
 are 
 chosen 
 with 
 seven 
 designated 
 as 
 Active 
 while 
 three 
 are 
 designated 
 as 
 Standby 
 The 
 three 
 Sentinels 
 will 
 remain 
 in

 unless 
 needed 
 to 
 reduce

 and

 Incentive System 
 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 aims 
 to 
 create 
 a 
 self sustaining 
 cyber 
 security 
 ecosystem 
 in 
 a 
 moderate 
 timeframe 
 without 
 requiring 
 centralized 
 guidance 
 or 
 organization 
 An 
 effective 
 cyber 
 security 
 ecosystem 
 requires 
 an 
 exchangeable 
 cryptocurrency 
 as 
 a 
 direct 
 means 
 to 
 compensate 
 for 
 the 
 usage 
 of 
 goods 
 or 
 services 
 also 
 it 
 requires 
 an 
 independent 
 value 
 which 
 represents 
 an 
 individuals 
 subjective 
 contribution 
 to 
 improve 
 the 
 cybersecurity 
 ecosystem 
 Thus 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 has 
 a 
 circulating 
 cryptocurrency 
 named 
 UPP 
 (Uppsala) 
 for

 Conclusion 
 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 is 
 the 
 most 
 effective 
 platform 
 to 
 help 
 the 
 current 
 cybersecurity 
 ecosystem 
 especially 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 security 
 industry 
 which 
 suffers 
 from 
 inherent 
 lack 
 of 
 oversight 
 The 
 preemptive 
 response 
 to 
 the 
 new 
 attack 
 vectors 
 has 
 been 
 proven 
 to 
 be 
 effective 
 through 
 machine 
 learning 
 However 
 the 
 ambiguity 
 of 
 the 
 threat 
 based 
 on 
 probability 
 is 
 still 
 a 
 challenge 
 Utilizing 
 the 
 collective 
 intelligence 
 of 
 the 
 blockchain 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol s 
 Security 
 Intelligence 
 Platform 
 for 
 Blockchain 
 provides 
 the 
 most 
 efficient 
 and 
 rational 
 solution 
 to 
 solve 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 security 
 problem 
 In 
 addition 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 security 
 industry 
 which 
 was 
 felt 
 to 
 have 
 high 
 entry 
 barriers 
 could 
 soon 
 become 
 a 
 vehicle 
 for 
 many 
 security 
 vendors 
 to 
 enter 
 and 
 thus 
 have 
 a 
 greater 
 positive 
 effect 
 of 
 this 
 convergence 
 is 
 for 
 many 
 people 
 who 
 are 
 not 
 currently 
 protected 
 by 
 the 
 legalsystem 
 in 
 collaboration 
 with 
 the 
 cryptocurrency 
 industry 
 such 
 as 
 exchanges 
 payments 
 and 
 wallet 
 companies 
 Sentinel 
 Protocol 
 opens 
 up 
 opportunities 
 for 
 individuals 
 with 
 the 
 right 
 skills 
 to 
 take 
 part 
 in 
 this 
 new 
 platform 
 for 
 decentralized 
 security 
 on 
 the 
 blockchain
