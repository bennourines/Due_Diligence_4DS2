Pain Points and Demands The decentralized and self governing next generation blockchain technology represented by EOS has become increasingly eye catching and triggered many discussion from different aspects As of the beginning of 2017 blockchain / digital assets have attracted 20 million users across the globe compared with merely 2 million 4 years ago We are confident that by 2020 this figure will reach or exceed 200 million and skyrocketed to 1 billion around 2025 But despite of such big amount of digital asset holder majority of the usage scenario is still focusing on investing that the currencies are being kept and exchanged on the major cryptocurrency exchanges There are still very handful of consumption behavior on going such as retail e commerce trading etc using the digital assets \xe2\x80\x9cMoney\xe2\x80\x9d being used Investment Fiat Money Cryptocurrency SoPay Trust fund Cryptocurrency/OTC SOP token Stock/bond market Exchange SoPayApp Forex Token ICO Insurance Properties Arts Consumption Retail stores N/A Online stores SoAPI SoPay App Digital credits (online game tokens points) Mobile payment Trading Credit notes RippleNet SoX Partnering Cross border transfer (cross border transfer) with Ripple 01 \x0cThe SoPay team is committed to developing an efficient private and user friendly cryptocurrency payment solution Even under resource constrained circumstances such as on mobile phone SoPay is still accessible by users who are incapable to store their private key and ensure that the digital asset is always under their control instead of being transferred to the third party payment provider 1 1 Cryptocurrency Confined to a Very Few Professionals General public often step back at the sight of cryptocurrency This should be ascribed to inadequate use cases available too complicated public/private key certification potential risks in huge wealth loss due to unexpected loss of key and stereotype To overcome this the SoPay team has worked out a cryptocurrency payment solution based on blockchain technology that is as simple and secure as Alipay This makes it possible for the public (including consumers and merchants) to spend invest and partake in cryptocurrency in a quick and safe way 1 2 Content Providers \xe2\x80\x93 Require Rapid Development But Lack of Users Online content providers (CP) such as game publishers invested rapidly in R&D trying to implement the blockchain technology into their product and service Most of the projects are reinventing the wheel as they are redundant with the blockchain infrastructure they eventually realize that its a failure and no significant benefits bringing in new users 02 \x0cHowever SoPay acts differently Its payment integration team and the content providers have been working on several projects for years giving birth to the SoAPI The SoAPI provide streamlined and abstract layer design architecture Any Online CPs who have experience working with generic payment API will be able to integrate their apps with SoAPI within a week with no need to develop complex dAPP 1 3 Environmental Impact \xe2\x80\x93 Massive Energy Consumption in Mining Proof of Work (PoW) used in earlier days has turned out to be outdated inefficient and costly Ethereum is working hard to shift from PoW to Casper (PoS) while EOS goes resolutely to DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) SO public chain adopting DPoB an improved consensus structure based on EOS DPoS By doing so payment transaction can be affirmed within a twinkles by the hybrid of MobileNode in mobile phone and only a fraction of FullNode calculating power Without doubt it works as safe as credit cards 1 4 Community fairness \xe2\x80\x93 The Centralized Mining Pools Dominated Most of The Transactions As centralized mining pools began to dominate the chain there are almost impossible for individual to be able to share the wealth within the community SoPay working on various approaches so that our SOP token holders and active contributors receive fair amount of equality and freedom Few of those approaches are including becoming witness while creating blocks through mobile phone token holder (including merchants and consumers) to vote among community incentive transparency etc 03 \x0c2 2 1 What is SoPay SoPay A Cryptocurrency Payment Solution Like Alipay SoPay is designed to offer easier and better user experience to enable cryptocurrency for consumer use cases By downloading and installing the SoPay APP enter 4 digit PIN code users can send/receive payment to/from others via phone number or user ID Each and every transaction is completed within seconds Payment received can be spent immediately Because the SoPay APP is build on the decentralized architecture neither of the merchant service provider or third party is able to collect users\xe2\x80\x99 information (for instance account balance transaction history loan/payment address etc ) In any case of reinstalling OS or switching phone as long as users is able to receive 4 digit PIN code via the registered phone number they will be able reclaim the secure access to their assets and payment is available in all APPs and networks The SoPay solution includes SoAPI SoChain SoLightning Networks SoX and SoPay APP 2 2 Is SoPay Decentralized or Not The answer is somewhat Yes and No SoChain the underplaying technology for SoPay is decentralized This is to ensure the all digital assets handling through SoPay are fully owned by the SoPay users As for SoPay based services such as online CPs (merchants of offline business and 04 E business) are centralized it is only the digital asset that being transferred that is based on SoChain will be decentralized on public chain \x0c3 System Architecture and Technology

Free of charge for consumers SoPay Payment Process Payment Success Merchants receive fiat/digital currency Whole process complete within seconds 07 \x0c3 2 SoAPI Simplify the Cryptocurrency Payment Process Like Alipay SoPay provides merchants and CPs with SoAPI and SDK hiding all the complexity and extra development works needed So that to empower the merchants and CPs to support the cryptocurrency payment very quickly without heavy technology investment leaving them to keep focus on their strength Furthermore to help driving new users group (the digital asset holders) to our merchant partners 1) Conventional Offline Merchants Merchants get fiat money (with real time digital fiat conversion rate) immediately when consumers scan QR Code with SoPay similarly to Alipay experience 2) Online CPs Online CPs (e g games and entertainment) a) Integration SoAPI into the application takes about 6 days if the CP have experience working with Alipay\xe2\x80\x99s payment SDK b) RESTful API is compatible with various application including H5 APP Web\xe2\x80\xa6 c) Virtual digital assets can be trade on SoMall in future 3) E Commerce a) Listing and open e commerce store on SoMall b) Sell with either fiat or digital currency as option in addition to Visa or PayPal 3 3 SoChain \xe2\x80\x93 An Optimized EOS based Public Chain Key Features 1) Millions of TPS on SoChain that is optimized based on EOS 2) Enhanced DPoB (Delegated Proof of Belief) consensus mechanism 08 \x0c3) Support other digital assets besides cryptocurrency transaction such as membership points digital credits SoPay can help merchants or CPs to tokenize their existing membership and liquidize them SoChain is designed to provide SoPay users to have full ownership affirmation of their digital assets yet able to do quicker easier and safe transaction while privacy to be protected Technically SoChain have improved based on the world leading EOS and its DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) a third generation consensus mechanism to produces the new DPoB (Delegated Proof of Belief) mechanism In future the SoPay team will open source the optimized codes on to Github for the community The following chapters will have more detail about DPoB SoPay is dedicated to handle transactions in the order of much larger scale than than Ethereum SoChain adopts the next generation consensus mechanism DPoB (Delegated Proof of Belief) It is capable to handle transactions up to 50 000 \xe2\x80\x93 1 million/second under stretch test conditions Plus SoChain will implement the parallel processing technology to further drive to millions transactions per second Thanks to DPoB SoChain is able to provide complete set of essential features like setting up account establish virtual assets asset transfer ownership affirmation pledge transaction and witness and achieve decentralized autonomy DPoB (Delegated Proof of Belief) consensus is the core innovation beneath the SoPay public blockchain Details and framework architecture will not be further disclosed until right timing in future We are committed to the innovation oriented transaction and consensus based incentives We have deep understanding of several consensus structure available today and here are them at a glance that explained why we are so confident that we are working on the future of the blockchain technology 09 \x0c1) PoW mandated an insertion of a nonce into a block \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d before the block \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d being submitted throughout every node So that H(B)\xe2\x89\xa4m From the above formula H represents a hash function m is a target value which is determined via a target calculation function (this function takes into account the rate of growth of the blockchain and reflects the size of the set of miners that participate in the protocol) A qualified nonce cannot be acquired until exhaustion of nonce is completed By adjusting H and m it is able to control nodes in the network and expectation of time window for each block submission As the time require to seek the qualified nonce is a variable in PoW hence a decentralized timing series is constructed and simultaneously it resolved the multi notes decentralized decision making process As result the entire network will accept the node that found the qualified nonce for data submission 2) Under PoW mechanism massive energy consumption and time is require to find the qualified nonce On the other hand PoS (Proof of Stake) gave up the nonce exhaustion process and turns to a faster algorithm H(H(Bprev) A t)\xe2\x89\xa4balance(A)m H is a Hash function and t as UTC timestamp Bprev refers to the previous block balance (A) the balance of account A and m is a target value At the left side of the equation t is the only parameter that can be constantly adjusted while at the right m is a fixed constant When balance(A) goes up it is more likely to find a reasonable t The t scope is confined in a case that the timestamp attemptable cannot be more than 1 hour from the default That said a node has 7 200 attempts to find a qualified t Otherwise 10 \x0cHence in PoS given same amount of computing power the more credit an account holds the easier it is to discover a next block 3) DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) is the optimization of PoS In both PoW and PoS the discounted efficiency lies in the fact that any newly added Block needs verifying by all nodes across the network While in DPoS solution per different strategy being set a minimal set of nodes is picked at certain interval which will be used to create verify sign and oversee new blocks In this way time and cost consumption is significantly cut for blocks creation and verification 4) DPoB (Delegated Proof of Belief) refers to the optimized consensus mechanism based on DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) that employs the hierarchical representative voting and anti spam mechanism It helps greatly speed up the transaction confirmation guarantee the same weighting of vote by the general public in the community and financial magnates and prevent from cheating with the help of financial rewards/penalties Existing distributed consensus mechanisms for cryptocurrencies must accomplish three distinct but related tasks First a mechanism must provide for determining the validity of a transaction This is accomplished by using digital signatures and thus does not vary across cryptocurrencies in ways relevant here Second a mechanism must provide a convention for determining whether the record of all transactions (the block chain) is in fact the authoritative one The central problem that a cryptocurrency must address is the danger of double spends and so this mechanism must ensure that this record is sufficiently comprehensive Third a mechanism must provide a convention for determining whether a proposed additional block of transactions should be added to the block chain 11 \x0cThe proof of work approach accomplishes the last of these tasks by awarding new currency to the first to solve a puzzle The puzzle is to generate a new block consisting of valid new transactions an arbitrary nonce and a link to the previous block in a way that produces a sufficiently low hash score A miner must try an enormous number of nonce values and transaction permutations to solve the puzzle correctly This leads directly to the mechanism for determining which of two alleged block chains is authoritative The authoritative block chain is the one that required more work (generally but not necessarily the longest block chain) Proof of stake approaches vary in their precise implementation but the general idea is similar A valid block in some versions is a block generated by a user whose \xe2\x80\x9cturn\xe2\x80\x9d it is to mine new currency thus each user has an incentive to participate in the mining process but need not solve difficult problems In other versions a valid block is a block consisting of transactions with sufficient \xe2\x80\x9ccoin age \xe2\x80\x9d which is proportional time since they were last spent In such a system the valid block chain is the one that uses the greatest coin age As in SoChain let us take the challenges in the reverse order addressing first the question of how to determine which block chain is authoritative among multiple competing block chains This can be determined by allowing decisions on the block chain as to whether any particular block is a valid block that should be on the block chain This is simply a binary version of the formal tacit coordination game and any player can initiate a decision making process to approve of a particular block as authoritative If otherwise there would be insufficient incentives to initiate this decision making process rewards could be proposed for those who successfully initiated designations of blocks as valid 12 \x0cThat allows a measure of proof of belief in a particular block and in a particular block chain The phrase follows from the recognition that any payment made in a formal tacit coordination game represents a bonded signal that the participant making it believes that others will agree with the participant\xe2\x80\x99s recommended decision The measure of proof of belief in a particular block is the difference between payments made in support of a block\xe2\x80\x99s authenticity and payments made in opposition to a block\xe2\x80\x99s authenticity The measure of proof of belief in a valid block chain (that is one in which the hash for each block refers to the previous block) is the sum of the proofs of belief for each block Note that a block currently viewed as invalid could still be part of the authoritative block chain such a situation could endure in the long term as an indication that validation of a particular block was a mistake but that the mistake is too far in the past to correct By implementing the delegated proof of belief it leaves room for future SoChain scalability using \xe2\x80\x9cSharding\xe2\x80\x9d technology 3 4 SoChain \xe2\x80\x93 Symmetric Side Chain Side Chain Structure SoChain also target to work well as the side chain to the others\xe2\x80\x99 main chain to speed up transaction strengthen security and privacy protection 13 \x0cSoChain improves features of symmetric side chain as follows 1) Two way peg to map the main chain assets to the side chain for transaction 2) Smart contracts compatible with EVM 3) Support to tokenize the digital assets between the real virtual world 4) Enhanced security and privacy The main chain serves only for asset transfer and ownership affirmation while the side chain completes fast transaction and protects the users\xe2\x80\x99 trade information account security and privacy 3 5 SoLightningNetwork

Basics The Lightning Network is a second layer payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain (most commonly Bitcoin) It enables instant transactions between participating nodes and has been touted as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem It features a peer to peer system for making micropayments of digital cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds and minimizing trust of third parties 14 \x0cTechnology 1) RSMC (Recoverable Sequence Maturity Contract) 2) HTLC\xef\xbc\x88Hashed Time Lock Contract\xef\xbc\x89 3) Lightning Network composed of multi hop nodes 4) Atomic cross chain swaps in the future 3 6 SoX \xe2\x80\x93 Smart Decision for Trading Channels SoX as the abstract layer to make smart decision in trading and execution of business logic At our early stage the decision will be made following the predefined trading scenario The decision is intelligently made to best fit for particular payment scenario among those are lightening network symmetric side chain and exchanges Features of lightening network scenario 1) Micropayment within the top up limit 2) Payments that initiated with currencies such as BTC and ETH that support lightning network 3) Currencies with high transaction cost within the main chain Features of symmetric side chain scenario 1) Turnover exceeds the top up limit of the lightning network 2) Or currencies with low cost of main chain transaction 3) Or the current lightning network fails to build a payment channel for the target Features of exchange scenario 1) Not supported by the lightening network 2) And not supported by the side chain 15 \x0c3 7 SoX \xe2\x80\x93 Smart Decision for Cross Exchanges Packaged with solutions to work with multiple exchanges\xe2\x80\x99 APIs Key components are including 1) Currency exchange route selection 2) Optimal currency exchange rate SoX works to select the best exchange route by evaluating few elements including the order quantity efficiency and rates Hence return with the best exchange route for particular transaction 3 8 SoX \xe2\x80\x93 Smart Decision for Cross Acquirers Provide intelligent matching for cross acquirers on the following basic rules 1) 1 N potential acquirers according to total orders 2) Exchange rate prioritization 3) Cryptocurrency pledge as guarantee on the SoChain SoPay Technology Implementations 1) Standard transmission protocol with quickFAST for each order 2) Intelligent order matching with liquiBook For exchange between digital and fiat currencies we are mainly working with C2C parties (OTC dealers) More acquirer options are in consideration including 1) C2C 2) Global major acquirers 3) Integrating with Zipper and Ripple so that to enable access to global financial institutions 4) Exchanges 16 \x0c3 9 SoKey \xe2\x80\x93 Strengthen Account Security with Financial Grade Hardware Isolation SoPay re constructs the account security system (differentiated from existing wallet providers) 1 Registration use phone number + PIN to register 2 Login Auto login if SoPay APP detected trusted hardware execution environment 3 Payment pin 6 digits payment pin Support pin retrieval after verification 4 Private key management true random number generator + user password + hardware isolation Based on the DPoB consensus we will implement and deploy Full Node witnesses under TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) for voting verification and merging transactions in the full chain The Full Node can accelerate verification and reinforce security under TEE The SoPay team has done many optimization and enhancement on the TEE standard On top of the one way signature widely used in banks and other financial agencies we adding the SoKey hardware isolation technology to prevent data security breach the user\xe2\x80\x99s key will never appear in cpu and memory runtime Just like key isolation in the cold wallet signature can only be found in isolated SoKey hardware TEE as an independent environment working parallel with OS to guarantee a safe runtime environment Different from consumer facing OS it targets at better performance and functions than SE (secure element) and protecting data with hardware and software hybrids Thus it is very secure many APPs 17 \x0cTrusted Apps in TEE can access to all functions in the main processor and memory while hardware isolation can protect these Apps from any potential backdoor programs being installed in the core OS The software and password isolation in TEE helps protect trusted Apps TEE is often used in financial payments DRM and other scenarios that require extremely safe operating environment and isolated sensitive data 3 10 SoWitness \xe2\x80\x93 Decentralized Witness In order to embrace the truly equality of rights and fairer incentives SoPay is designing a new approach called SoWitnessMobile that serve the block validation even on a mobile phone This approach with good wish to encourage more SOP holders who are general public to have fair amount of voting weight as large corporation to determine a valid block Under the DPoB model it is possible to achieve true decentralization for all witness to participate without miners needed This new consensus design for voting weight take into consideration of (but not limited to) phone number IMEL IMSI location and the witness\xe2\x80\x99s incentive points (both gain and lost incentives) Plus when using the mobile phone the innovative design of MSB and Block purge make it possible to partake in voting and witness block validation with low energy consumption The result will be verified and integrated back into the main chain when the mobile side chain has access to the Full Node in TEE Witness weight (W) is based on the composite weight of the three values below W = a*R + b*P + c*S 18 \x0cThe larger W is the more probable it is to be selected as the transaction witness 1) Witness reputation value (R) malicious acts will lead to deducted pledged SOP and R 2) Voter value (P) the number of voters in the community for equal rights and incentive feedback 3) The number of SOPs held by the voters (S) protect the biggest SOP holders Values of a b and c in the formula above will be numerically adjusted along with the community growth as an attempt for equality and freedom 1) Equality Users with SoPay have the right to vote for witnesses and can cast votes to potential witness simply by using the SoPay APP 2) Freedom Any user who are using SoPay are allowed to join in witness competition The number of SOPs and supporters determine the probability of being finally selected as the witness 19 \x0c4 Incentives 4 1 Tokens BTC ETH Token Holder BT C E Member SeekOne Exchange TH BTC ETH TH E TC B

contract infrastructures are not well established Such as the storage computing and traction providers are under developing SoPay will be released in the Japanese network environment firstly The development progress will be disclosed on Github and the official website (https //sopay org) for public scrutiny After the pilot test is completed In Japan SoPay will engage the system migration 22 according to the market demands gradually and improve infrastructure step by step \x0cacross the globe In the case of the technical readiness especially the maturity of the EOS main chain and source code it is necessary to build centralized nodes first before getting them onto the decentralized network later 5 2 Gaining Tractions Jun Dec 2018 Based on the established infrastructure the team will accelerate the function optimization of SoPay App OpenAPI to improve SoPay marketability and scenarios for better user experience After its launch the platform will gradually activate tens of millions of users mainly from the game publisher partners they will join the asset network and spending tokens with fun In the meantime the SoPay operation team will keep exploring more content part ners and retail networks for O2O cooperation 5 3 To Infinity and Beyond By 2019 SoPay will kick off the era of E business with cryptocurrency after online game content access as well as offline retail networks are perfectly hooked up Thousands of E business and skus will be listing on SoPay for our users can spend cryptocurrency (by then they should have some) And continuously expand the growth of the SoPay ecosystem 23 \x0c6 6 1 Laws & Regulations Operation Entity The SoPay Team is committed to \xe2\x80\x9cdecentralized organizations work far better than centrally controlled entity\xe2\x80\x9d SoPay per se was born as part of the decentralized community To this end SoPay had established the SoPay Foundation in Singapore with the approval of ACRA in accordance with the Singapore Companies Act It is committed to running the SoPay network in an open fair transparent and non profit way and giving support to the SoPay developer team The Foundation is operated by the board of trustees or management composed of qualified trustees independent of any government Singapore provides a favorable environment legally and financially As the Non Profit Entity lawfully founded in Singapore in accordance with local laws the Foundation supports or participates in activities for public or private interests instead of seeking any business profit Its \xe2\x80\x9cprofit\xe2\x80\x9d or regarded as abundance balance will be kept as fund for market education related activities rather than profit sharing among key stakeholders SoPay is planning to initiate root service and set up the law related content review board in every necessary country to ensure that the contents are legally and culturally correct locally With legal compliance the organization culture will be defined by the ethnic culture review board when taking featured culture into account provided by the traffic center 24 \x0c7 Who Are We Mission No 1 instrument of cryptocurrency payment \xe2\x80\x9cCryptocurrency pays all

market if the digital asset market is overvalued as whole investment will face even more risks that perhaps participants are over expected on the project achievement Regulatory Risks Digital asset transaction including SoPay faces extremely high uncertainties This field is so far yet to be well regulated so E tokens take risks in fluctuating and being manipulated by dealers Individual participants if inexperienced may be hard to fend off shock on assets and release mental pressure due to market volatility Although scholars and official media often give advice on prudent participation handicapped by lacking regulatory measures and regulations the risk is so far hard to hedge It is undeniable that in the foreseeable future there will be rules to regulate the blockchain and E tokens If regulators have a hand in this field it will perhaps have bearing on tokens bought during the swap period including (but not limited to) fluctuation or constraints on price and convenience to sell Team Risks Too many blockchain teams and projects join in the severe market competition bringing heave pressure on project operation The SoPay team in order to stand out and be widely accepted shall sharpen its own competence make better planning and rid off impact by competitors or even the oligopolistic Malignant competition is inevita 27 ble Thanks to the founder\xe2\x80\x99s relationship circle a strong and energetic team is built composed of sophisticated specialists and technicians in the blockchain field \x0cA stable and cooperative team is critical to the overall development of SoPay In the future SoPay will probably be adversely affected by key member\xe2\x80\x99s quit or team conflict Project Management Risks The SoPay founding team will do its best to achieve goals mentioned in this White Paper as an effort to extend its headroom At present the team has accumulated great business experiences But given unpredictable elements in this sector the existing business mode and mindset of coordination don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the market demands perfectly thus hard to gain considerable profits In the meantime the White Paper will be improved along with updates in project details If the updates fail to be acquired by participants or the public are blind to the latest information about SoPay participants or the public\xe2\x80\x99s lack of information will impede the progress in the project Technical Risks First SoPay is built on the basis of cryptographic algorithms The rapid development in cryptography will inevitably bring potential risks in being cracked Next blockchain distributed ledger decentralization and tamper resistant support the core business development The SoPay team cannot fully guarantee putting any of these technologies into practice Third underlying bugs will be fixed by way of releasing packs to update SoPay but the defects caused by bugs cannot be predicted Security Risks In this regard as the payment transaction goes up with mass adoption this requires a high level of security of SoPay E tokens are anonymous and hard to trace so that they are easy to be manipulated by criminals or hacked or probably involved in illegal asset transfer Presently other underlying risks include With advances in blockchain and the 28 overall industry SoPay will be confronted with unpredictable risks Before joining in please get full knowledge of the team background and the overall framework and mindset of the project so as to rationalize visions on token swap \x0c9 1 Disclaimer Notices The document is
