become the first and best e commerce platform that allows online stores and consumers to make direct purchases from manufacturers This is essentially the next generation decentralized e commerce platform to harness the power of distributed ledger technology (Blockchain) along with innovations in bulk pricing real time logistics e commerce and cryptocurrency ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 3/31 \x0cINTRODUCTION In today\xe2\x80\x99s generation transfer of money and e commerce have really become part and parcel of modern life Its impact has been felt through the unprecedented growth in online shopping and the move away from retail CITL believes that there are new business models new ways of distribution more effective methods of leveraging purchasing power efficiency in logistics and BackOffice operations that can help power the next wave of e commerce E commerce in its current form involves many moving parts including storefront creation BackOffice operations purchasing fulfillment distribution and more This begs the question\xe2\x80\x94is there a more vertically integrated efficient solution that improve the economics of e commerce The answer is a vociferous\xe2\x80\x94YES Cryptocurrency makes the transfer of money anywhere easy and accessible anytime from anywhere CITL is poised to take great advantage of this OUR CORE COMPETENCE IS Purchasing Power Harness the advantage of wholesale pricing by offering Direct to Consumer pricing by peer to peer networks Borderless Transfer of Money (low cost) Easy & Fast Delivery of Funds Storefront Creation Provide a first of its kind e commerce platform that enables e tailers to plug seamlessly into the decentralized network Micro distribution Micro distribution channels powered by decentralized networks and distributed ledgers (Blockchain) 24/7 Operation Our services are available anytime anywhere in the world ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 4/31 \x0cFIAT CURRENCY PROBLEMS Here are a few prominent issues which come with the use of fiat currencies Cross Border Payments Fiat money/currency depreciates value over time causing inflation This is a problem especially if doing business across borders It is also not very safe People with small capital find it very hard to do business globally travel worldwide and participate in events without converting their money into regional currencies Non Bankers It is noted that in the developing world only 41% have a bank accounts The rest of the population cannot easily make transactions or trade easily inside or outside their borders Double Spending or Double Booking Using fiat money Debit/Credit Cards to make online purchases exposes the user to online fraud because the same card data can be used by fraudulent parties to effect purchases without the owner\xe2\x80\x99s authorization The card data can be re used to make illegal purchases Data Tampering Fiat currency data can easily be counterfeited Identity Theft Fiat currency does not allow users to send or do any transaction online without any further information Identity information must be sent with the transaction along with other data This information becomes vulnerable online Centralization Due to the centralization of fiat currencies their associated fees are also quite high ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 5/31 \x0cOUR SOLUTIONS CITL is poised to bring about efficiencies in the e commerce ecosystem benefiting both the supply and demand sides of the equation tWe plan to do this through the following ground breaking innovations Here are a few prominent issues and how Blockchain technology could benefit cryptocurrency users Cross Border Payments Having a cryptocurrency allows users to make secure cashless transactions Cryptocurrency operates at the universal level making transactions quite easy It helps solve the problem of inflation as money can depreciate its value over time It enables everyone to do business globally travel worldwide and participate in events without having to convert into regional currencies The peer to peer mechanism allows easier international trade without having complications over the exchange fluctuations In countries like Tanzania and farther afield XCON will provide the best payment solutions for wholesale and retail businesses as well as utilities and services vendors By cutting off the middleman payments can be made with infinitesimal charges almost instantaneously from buyer to seller Non Bankers It is noted in the developing world that only 41% of the population has a bank account But about 89% of adults in Africa now own a cell phone With the influx of cheaper Chinese smartphones making in roads into Africa most people own smartphones This population with smartphones can make cashless payments globally with the help of Blockchain technology CITL\xe2\x80\x99s multi currency mobile wallet allows cryptocurrency users to store crypto tokens exchange currencies make purchase instantaneously and transfer money Double Spending or Double Booking Blockchain technology\xe2\x80\x99s strong confirmation mechanism and transaction recordings don\xe2\x80\x99t allow cryptocurrency users to double book or double spend i e it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow multiple transactions for the same coin This enables users to register tickets for events concerts conferences and music festivals etc ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 6/31 \x0cData Tampering Cryptocurrencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited They exist only as values in a global ledger platform that contains the entire history of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s cryptocurrency transactions This information is shared with every node in the Blockchain It has to be validated and accepted by all parties rather than one central administrator As the order of the transaction is performed by grouping them into blocks and linking them into a chain swapping a block out is impossible to complete the transaction So it avoids editing or removing the information through unauthorized channels Identity Theft Cryptocurrency allows users to send exactly what she/he wants to the recipient without any further information Blockchain consists of many nodes that are scattered across the world Since Blockchain is stored in a decentralized database any hacker will find it difficult to access the holder\xe2\x80\x99s information The decentralized nature of the Blockchain technology along with the public key cryptography doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow anyone to crack the chain De centralization Due to the de centralized nature of cryptocurrencies there are zero to negligible charges Micro distribution We offer decentralization of e commerce by turning every extra space at your home or office into a distribution center In addition to distribution centers run by CITL now anyone can become a node on the Connect Coin (XCON) by staking tokens (buy in) and leveraging existing storage in their homes or offices to become a micro distribution center This solves the last mile logistics issue that has plagued e commerce for the longest time It is similar to how Airbnb turns every spare room in a home to a hotel room or how Uber leverages excess driving capacity to turn every automobile into a taxi Bulk Pricing Enables online stores & consumers to receive direct from manufacturer pricing through bulk order quotes unlocked by achieving the Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) Real Logistics Leverages Blockchain solutions to deliver real time logistics data provide transparent smart contract enforced audit trails integrate PROXEUS & protect users with data encryption such as the SHA protocol that will keep information secured Manufacturers businesses and consumers will have seamless access to real time shipping data to optimize drop shipping costs provided by a permission less public Blockchain Cryptocurrency CITL utilizes its own cryptocurrency as a token which is used for transactions in its own native system Transparent and Auditable We combine the best of Blockchain to offer customers a digital ledger that offers fraud proof solution and auto verifies transactions leaving behind a transparent immutable audit trail Our ecosystem will provide features such as automated verification shipping cost optimization security enhancement smart contracts and a superior pricing model ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 7/31 \x0cTransparent

shipping cost optimization security enhancement smart contracts and a superior pricing model You can use it to any exchange Listed in Exchange platforms 24/7 Operation Our services are available anytime anywhere in the world Cryptocurrency CITL utilizes its own cryptocurrency as a token which is used for transactions in its own native system Purchasing Power Harness the advantage of wholesale pricing by offering Direct to Consumer pricing by peer to peer networks Non Bankers Anyone with smartphones can make cashless payments globally with the help of Blockchain technology De centralization Due to the de centralized nature of cryptocurrencies there are zero to negligible charges Cross Border Payments few prominent issues and how Blockchain technology could benefit cryptocurrency users which were not available in earlier generation platforms ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 8/31 \x0cBy utilizing Blockchain technology CITL will bring about market efficiencies which were not available in earlier generation platforms ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 9/31 \x0cCONNECT COIN (XCON) DESCRIPTION Connect Coin (XCON) is an Ethereum based cryptocurrency (ERC20) designed to connect the world by simplifying means of payment and transfer of money globally It aims to connect buyers and sellers through its Connect Global Marketplace Under this market consumers can pay for goods and services through Connect Coin But also Connect Coin empowers by installing facilities that allow them to accept the token This payment system shall allow consumers to pay for goods and services and transfer money through Connect App and Connect Cards to both local vendors through payment access points and online businesses internationally while still protecting commodity and service providers from losses associated with cryptocurrency market prices CITL built XCON to facilitate payment services and transfer of money to trade as native currency on CITL Exchange and other exchanges XCON will also facilitate withdrawals and deposits in Fiat Unlike many other coins XCON is not built for speculation PURPOSE OF CONNECT COIN The XCON token will be used in the following ways \xe2\x80\xa2Used to raise funds to build and enable the CITL Academy Connectmarketplace and Merchant Builder Platform and CITL Exchange which it will be used as a form of payment \xe2\x80\xa2Used for staking tokens in order for Micro distribution centers to participate \xe2\x80\xa2Used for staking tokens in order for delivery operators to participate \xe2\x80\xa2Used as rewards when a user recommends XCON to another service the former receives rewards in the form of tokens \xe2\x80\xa2As a form of payment to Micro distribution centers and delivery operators for providing a service \xe2\x80\xa2As a form of dividend payment to investors Consensus Algorithm Proof of Delivery When packages are delivered to a buyer if the package requires a delivery signature that signature would be captured over the Connectmobile application for Delivery Partners This Proof signature can be verified by the Buyer in a dispute over a mobile app Without a signature when one is required a transaction will not be approved ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 10/31 \x0cICO An Initial Coin Offering also commonly referred to as an ICO is a fundraising mechanism in which new projects sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for bitcoin ether etc It\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in which investors purchase shares of a company As with any other ICO our project will create XCON 70 000 000 (seventy million) tokens of Connect Coin to sell to the public in exchange for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether The public is usually interested in the crypto tokens on offer for either or both of the following reasons 1) The token has an inherent benefit \xe2\x80\x93 it grants the holder access to a service a say in an out come or a share in the project\xe2\x80\x99s earnings This is also the case with CITL\xe2\x80\x99s XCON ICO 2) The benefit will be in increasing demand which will push up the market price of the token Once again this is the also the case with XCON 3) XCON has a low supply of coins and high usability which makes it gain value faster 4) XCON tokens can be used as heirloom (can be passed down or inherited from the original owner) Tokens especially those of successful sales are usually listed on exchanges where initial buyers can sell their holdings and new buyers can come in at any time Buyers of XCON can benefit from both the access to the service that the token confers and from its success through appreciation of the token\xe2\x80\x99s price These gains can be realized at any time (usually) by selling the tokens on an exchange ICO Roadmap & Timeline XCON Roadmap Our aims to facilitate smooth running of cryptocurrency and to create the Connect coin (XCON) to be the utility coin used as the means of payment the platform allows people to transfer money globally to the Connect Coin which further can be used to pay bills at various utilities retail and wholesale outlets and various other sales and services as well We aim to become the best first e commerce platform that allows online stores and consumers to buy directly from manufacturers It is the next generation of decentralized E Commerce platform that harnesses the power of distributed

supply The low coin supply means it has even less risk Secondly the usability of the coin in other CITL platforms such as Academy Merchant Builder and Exchange ensure that its value will rise due to hiked demand So because the cause has routine use its value will rise Using a Marketing S Curve Adoption Model we have computed the Utility Value of the XCON Token For this model we have assumed the following Global e commerce Market of $2 86T in 2018 growing at a CAGR of 19% An initial market share of 0 01% tailing off at 2% over 10 years Discount Rate of 21% (adjust for risk) Token Velocity is assumed to 10 Formula MV = PT Where M= size of the asset base V= velocity of the asset (the number of times that an average coin changes hands every day) P= price of the digital resource being provisioned T= transaction volume (the economic value of transactions per time) We can rearrange this equation to solve for Token Price =PQ/VM In the crypto world to calculate token price one computes the market cap in dollars (PQ) divided by the velocity (V) and the number of coins in supply The formula for token velocity is as follows Formula Velocity = Total Transactional Volume / Average Network Volume Therefore Formula Average Network Volume = Total Transaction Volume / Velocity Token velocity is total transaction value divided by the average network value This means the average network value is equal to the velocity divided by the total transaction value Velocity is typically measured annually If transactions are absent then the token lacks liquidity and its velocity equals zero Consequently the asset will trade at a discounted rate There must be some minimal velocity for a token to reach its full value With tokens that people do not hold velocity increases linearly with transactional value The Present Value of the Utility Value of the Token in 2028 is computed to be $25 00 while the ICO sale offering price is $0 25 While this is not an indication of the token\xe2\x80\x99s market value it is a model that measures the value of the token in its ability to generate revenues within the CITL ecosystem ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 18/31 \x0cMARKET AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF XCON CITL ACADEMY Interest in cryptocurrencies is now greater than ever The virtual currencies has been a constant source of interest not to mention confusion since Bitcoin thrust itself into the mainstream in 2009 Therefore in the fast moving world of cryptocurrency it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to stay up to date with the latest in educational resources and new media Recently there has been an explosion in media attention and a desire for new users not only in Tanzania but also globally to learn as much as possible about the cryptocurrency phenomenon That is to say cryptocurrency educational resources are in great demand The average person knows little to nothing about cryptocurrencies and its underlying Blockchain technology This is partly due to the fact that little informative material has been published to educate the public on the inner workings of cryptocurrencies and the few published material available via the Internet is too technical for the average reader to grasp Therefore it is safe to assume that most people out there have a limited knowledge of the workings of cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x93 both Bitcoin and its derivative Altcoins This lack of understanding has fueled a lot of misinformation and misconceptions such as the mistaken belief in some quarters that cryptocurrencies are Internet based scams The CITL Cryptocurrency Training Academy intends to change some of these misconceptions The Academy is dedicated to providing the best information about cryptocurrencies ranging from the basics to advanced topics such as \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 How to pay for goods and services How to transfer value Understanding Ethereum based \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Contracts\xe2\x80\x9d How to protect your cryptocurrency funds How to invest in cryptocurrency How to exchange cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency to fiat Etc The objective is to build a cryptocurrency literate community in Tanzania and by extension the world at large in preparation of the inevitable and eventual transition to cryptocurrency based economy Accordingly our vision for the CITL academy is to become the leading and most trusted training center for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and organizations Our Academy\xe2\x80\x99s activities will not be online based only but we will also have centres in various other places some where the internet may not be readily available to everyone CITL will also establish a well programmed Online TV to offer education about the Blockchain technology cryptocurrency in general XCON specifically and forex trading These programmes will add value to the people\xe2\x80\x99s understanding not only of cryptocurrency at large but also of the XCON token This will create more users of the token and increase its value ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 19/31 \x0cCITL EXCHANGE The cryptocurrency world is a fast moving world and by all accounts the cryptocurrency economy is growing at dizzying rates For the most part the \xe2\x80\x9ccryptocurrency economy\xe2\x80\x9d is currently mostly what would traditionally be called basic financial services revolving around providing service to transfer (or spend) coins CITL exchange platform provides individuals and corporations a trusted platform to sell and buy cutting edge cryptocurrencies The platform\xe2\x80\x99s Blockchain based security protocol makes the platform less vulnerable to attacks thus making our platform a safe place for looking to buy or sell cryptocurrencies The platform was built with the objective of creating a secure market place where people can buy and sell cryptocurrencies to one another Moreover CITL offers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through the platform as a reliable service for those looking to acquire or dispose of their cryptocurrencies XCON will launch in its own ecosystem to trade as the native digital token within the Exchange XCON will be deployed to trade on CITL Exchange immediately after successful ICO bid has been conducted Our Exchange is scalable has robust security with Smart Contracts allows multi currency deposits and withdrawals allows fiat deposits on multiple platforms and integrates with Connect Marketplace CITL MERCHANT Merchant Builder System is a unique flagship payment system intended to spearhead the transformation of payment systems used by local businesses from fiat currency to cryptocurrency based systems The system enables local businesses (e g supermarkets hotels movie theaters) to accept cryptocurrencies as means of payment for their goods and services without having to deal with the market fluctuations associated with cryptocurrencies Businesses using our Merchant Builder System are guaranteed to dispose of their collected cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies at what was the operational Cryptocurrency Exchange rate at the moment the business transaction was completed CITL will install hardware to all member businesses that will enable them to accept payment in cryptocurrency This system as well as a special mobile App can be used to exchange cryptocurrency for fiat currency CITL will have its own ATM cards (Connect Card) which will also operate on all registered Point of Sale (POS) terminals This will bring about a revolution in e Commerce and foster new linkages between businesses and consumers by making it easier for people to get real value for their digital coin At our ATM machines our customers can use fiat currency to buy cryptocurrency Merchant Builder System is specifically customized to facilitate and ensure compliance with all applicable tax laws and regulations For example the system could automatically collect applicable value added tax (VAT) from the cryptocurrency transactions The VAT collected is subsequently remitted to the respective local tax collecting authority on behalf of the business The system is designed to allow cryptocurrency holders to pay for regular services such as utility bills (TV Electric Power Phone Bills and Water Bills) Government Taxes School Fees Student Loans Driving License Passport Company Registration and many others the list is virtually endless ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 20/31 \x0cCONNECT MARKET PLACE The Next E Commerce Revolution With the invention of Cryptocurrencies transferring value across state borders has never been easier however this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come without its challenges In the wake of cryptocurrencies a number of both consumers and entrepreneurs have fallen victim to manipulation and

based distributed computing platform featuring \xe2\x80\x9csmart contracts\xe2\x80\x9d functionality It provides the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) a decentralized turing complete virtual machine which can execute scripts using an international networks of public nodes Ethereum platform also provides a crypto token called Ether which can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computation performed Ethereum based Smart Contracts are account holding objects which contain code functions and can interact with other contracts make decisions store data and send Ether to others Contracts are creator designed but their execution is provided by the Ethereum network itself As long as the whole network exists they will also exist and be executable They will only disappear if they were internally programmed to self destruct Smart Contracts \xe2\x80\x9care applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime censorship frau or third party interference These apps run on a custom built Blockchain an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property This enables developers to create markets store registries of debts or promises move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet all without a middle man or counter party risk \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Source Ethereum org Now XCON is a crypto token built upon the foundation of the Ethereum smart contract This means it is quite secure Of note also is the fact that XCON is tethered to a company that has other on going concerns such as CITL Academy CITL Exchange Merchant Builder etc This creates security for XCON because then it is used to support those other concerns and create more value for itself ICO WHITE PAPER v 1 22/31 \x0cTEAM MEMBERS GEORGE LUCAS C E O & FOUNDER CADBV RENEE KROM SOFTWARE
