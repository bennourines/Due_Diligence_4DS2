most secure cryptocurrency in the world working on the #TraceChain protocol More than 5 billion under 3 seconds transactions per day The validation rate is #MetaApps #MetaGate Replacing smart contract Gateway to a decentralized internet Decentralized applications running in real time like any regular web services that are written in any programming language including Solidity PHP C++ etc A multi asset wallet that won\ t overload your computer A decentralized app directory and browser The #MetaHash network is infinitely scalable as the capacity of its resources grows MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 4 \x0cGoals and Objectives #MetaHash is a decentralized network for digital asset exchange and a platform for building decentralized applications that work in real time The popularity of cryptocurrencies in 2017 caused thousands of blockchain projects of different scales and focus to appear However the growth of most of these projects was limited by the technical capabilities of the existing blockchain / operators / networks The low speed closed nature of blockchain networks and their inability to interact with each other are the real problems slowing down the development of this technology in general #MetaHash is designed to create a single solution that allows blockchain systems of the future to unite into a single decentralized network capable of recording each and every transaction The self regulating #MetaHash network in fact creates a basis for the emergence of a fully fledged branch of the decentralized internet It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on individual creators once launched and is managed by open voting1 of users or #MetaHashCoins2 holders A fully decentralized internet would bring freedom from the control of large corporations Project management would be in the hands of end users The #MetaHash platform allows any project to become fully decentralized Thousands of projects require decentralization right now but the speed and capabilities of existing blockchain operators aren\xe2\x80\x99t sufficient to meet those needs The key distinction of decentralized projects running on open source3 code is the fact that they are built the way users need them Projects are created for users rather than for maximizing benefits to a limited group of stakeholders which harms both the market and the users #MetaHash enables the creation of Decentralized applications that work in real time like ordinary web services and applications and can respond to events both in any of the blockchain networks and on the regular internet Independent sub chains protected by the main #MetaHash network that also operate on the basis of the #TraceChain protocol These sub chains are created so thousands of #MetaApps can cost effectively operate without overloading the main network and slow other applications Lots of applications are waiting for a solution to build isolated cost effective and secure chains that would let them transfer the required data Digital assets in the form of tokens in the #MetaHash network for sharing within the network and converting to the tokens (digital assets) of other networks Any asset in another blockchain system (ETH ERC20 Bitcoin) can be converted to #MetaHashCoins #MetaHash supports the concept of blockchain interoperability assuming that the future of the internet lies in the ability of independent networks to interact and integrate with each other MetaHash org hello@metahash org 1 2 3 Open voting means that any voter can get access to the results of voting and see the IDs of participating wallets and their decisions #MetaHashCoins (#MHC) is the internal currency of the #MetaHash network An open source project allows any user to access its code and use it to create their own version of the application or to improve the current version White Paper 5 \x0cProblems and Solutions We believe in the future of cryptocurrencies But today it is far from perfect #MetaHash represents all the blockchain powered opportunities of the future embodied in a single project What needs to be changed Why it is important Existing cryptocurrencies #MetaHash Significantly increase the number of transactions per day Will allow cryptocurrencies to come into the real world Up to 2 million transactions per day More than 5 billion transactions per day Ability to send a transaction free of charge The ability to use #MetaHashCoins for micro transactions Often up to $80 or even $400 per transaction including the reward to miners Free for the user for most transactions Fees appear as network load grows to protect the network against spam transactions Transition from PoW (mining) to multi PoS (forging) Mining limits possible transaction speeds of the network and requires expensive resources to protect the network Dependant on hardware that costs billions of dollars wastes electricity and pays billions to miners Forging #MetaHashCoins with nodes and wallets provides the most important resources and eliminates pointless ones Protect the network from a money attack that could interfere with the network The growth of cryptocurrency capitalization will inevitably lead to a growing number of hackers trying to block the network\ s operations Less than 1% of the current capital of ALL leading cryptocurrencies is enough to block their work An additional verification step provided by wallets will not allow hackers to block or corrupt the network even if they possess 67% of nodes or coins Increase the speed of transaction approval Increasing the speed of the transaction affects the ability to implement the technology in everyday operations Minimum 30 seconds for first approval and minimum 1 5 minutes for final approval 1 second for first approval and under 3 seconds for final approval for most transactions Implement the built in mechanism of tokenization of any assets The ability to exchange digital assets used by blockchain networks makes the technology available to people who do not have special programming skills This contributes to quicker introduction of the technology in the social sphere Currently the best solution only allows the creation of tokens if you have advanced programming skills and can result in loss of money The smart contract technology is not transparent to people who do not know programming Any asset even other networks\ cryptocurrencies can be instantly tokenized in #MetaHash without knowledge of programming Token information is simple and easy to understand MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 6 \x0c#MetaHash Structure The #MetaHash network consists of four parts #TraceChain The solution to the speed problem is based on an automatic self learning algorithm for routing signals over the network Starting at a rate of 50 000 transactions per second (the capability of a 100 megabit channel) it grows as more nodes with higher bandwidth are added to the network forming the core of the network and improving the reliability of additional #DataChains which are needed for running applications #MetaApps Nodes added to the #MetaHash network are used by decentralized applications The core code of #MetaApps optimizes the location of application copies based on required resources and financial motivation of the owners of nodes connected to the network Any developer can create and publish an application in #MetaApps and #MetaHashCoin holders will decide by open vote whether or not to approve it reflecting the universal values of all the network members Four components of the system form a single synergistic solution that allows complex decentralized applications to work in a real time mode even with high system loads The technical complexity of the system is hidden behind a user friendly interface making it accessible to ordinary users #MetaGate This is an open source interface using the #TraceChain protocol making it possible to work with #MetaApps and networks Third party developers can use the #MetaGate code to embed #MetaApps and #TraceChain/ blockchain features into various applications and browsers #MetaHashCoin The network\ s digital payment currency It is used to ensure consensus to pay for all network services and to control self financing Recognised by FINMA on July 3 2018 as Utility token with payment function #MHC tokens are qualified as payment means in accordance with the AntiMoney Laundering Act MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 7 \x0c#TraceChain \x0c#TraceChain Technology #TraceChain is the new internet protocol that the #MetaHash network is based on #TraceChain uses a mathematical model of optimal signal propagation across the network The synchronization of thousands of computers overloads a network and slows it down To solve this issue #TraceChain relies on mathematical algorithms powered by #TraceChain AI all signals go from the outer radius to the cores The signals are synchronized in multiple powerful cores and go back across the network All existing blockchain systems (those already available and those that are under development) are too slow and expensive or are not fully decentralized The more computers that need to be simultaneously synchronized the higher the load on the network The cores are not static and are constantly altered by voting Adding high performance computers to the network does not automatically make them cores which protects the network against attacks The core\ s segments are fully decentralized and protected by Trust algorithms and additional verifications The performance of the network core\ s segments is checked and protected by external radiuses Main Advantages Comparison with current and prospective decentralized blockchain systems Modern blockchain projects imply that cryptocurrency can only be used by technical specialists traders and blockchain enthusiasts Cryptocurrencies are complex and incomprehensible to a mass audience Today none of the existing or prospective systems provide sufficient speed and convenience to make blockchain solutions usable on an industrial scale Speed high transaction fees and huge complexity are the issues that the #TraceChain1 protocol is designed to address 1 #TraceChain is an automatic self learning signal routing protocol Below is a comparative analysis of the systems that currently hold leading positions in the market MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 9 \x0cBitcoin PoW (Proof of Work) is a reliable but very expensive network integrity protection mechanism The four Bitcoin mining pools fully control the network and comprise 60% of Bitcoin hash power These four pools form the longest chain which is considered valid in case of conflicts The synchronization process in blockchain is renowned for the problem of slow nodes The network is slow as long as its nodes are slow A significant portion of the Bitcoin network is physically located in places with cheap electricity and slow internet (most often 3G) A lot of Bitcoin nodes have such low bandwidth that increasing a block size limit from 1 to 4 MB would cut off a significant part of the network Bitcoin\ s most pressing issue is that its core resources are concentrated in the hands of people who are most often not stakeholders Miners are interested in maximizing their income and exchanging coins to regular currency to cover electricity and equipment costs Thus PoW miners always act against the interests of the blockchain network At any time any blockchain miner can redirect the mining power to another blockchain platform Bitcoin forks and systems built on a similar code Typically they are characterized by higher bandwidth and a bigger block size Bitcoin has enough power to store transactions but it is still not enough to run applications EOS EOS is a reliable and fast banking system However it is centralized 20 supercomputers control the network and provide a maximum number of votes These top 20 computers synchronize transaction data and receive all commissions Sometimes the commission is paid to one more computer which is chosen on the basis of the weight of votes cast in its favor As the top 20 servers are static they attract high amounts of delegated coins and the system gets highly centralized as it is almost impossible to get a new server to the top 20 Lightning Network Lightning Network features an excellent concept of transferring data between several participants The system works well if a group of participants needs to make a lot of transactions amongst themselves in the course of a day The group\ s money is stored in the multi signature wallets of the participants However this platform has a limited use because the same group of participants are unlikely to need to exchange data multiple times When a transaction has to move outside the organized group there is no gain in speed and it is limited by the bandwidth of the network within which it operates MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 10 \x0cEthereum Ethereum features a good implementation of PoW but at a very slow speed caused by direct synchronization between a multitude of participants and low throughput of many PoW nodes Its smart contracts are of particular value because they enable response to events in the Ethereum network but unfortunately they cannot react to anything else and are unsuitable for real time applications Ethereum Plasma This is a very good solution for increasing the bandwidth of the Ethereum network Transfers of tokens and application data take place in separate blockchains and are based on the principle of PoS consensus with anchors stored in the main Ethereum blockchain which operates on the PoW algorithm This will significantly improve the performance of smart contracts that only respond to events in the Ethereum network But the speed of the main network will remain low and average users will still be unable to use wallets due to a very low block download speed (up to several days) even after a weekly break in use and the huge size of the current chain which has to be fully downloaded onto your computer Light wallets could be an alternative solution but using them could be risky because projects associated with them are under funded Other projects we are aware of do not have the sufficient documentation or coding to be considered serious alternatives Blockchain Comparison Table Bitcoin Ethereum EOS #MetaHash 10 minutes 15 seconds 5 seconds under 3 seconds Transactions per second up to 12 up to 30 from 1 000 to millions from 50 000 to millions The level of decentralization high high minimal high Transaction approval time MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 11 \x0cWhat Makes #TraceChain Stand Out From Existing Projects We couldn\ t find any project focused on creating a fully decentralized and synchronized network capable of quickly processing data on a large scale global basis so we created #MetaHash #MetaHash offers a solution that ticks all the boxes as a next generation blockchain platform Full decentralization You should never trust a network that is not decentralized enough Full synchronization If high speed and sufficient bandwidth are achieved through reduced network synchronization transferring data between network parts will eventually become problematic outweighing the benefit Many of the current projects feature clear and useful ways of application yet fail to fully meet the needs of the market Transaction speed under three seconds The longer a transaction takes the less convenient it is to use the system and the more difficult it is for decentralized applications to run in full capacity High bandwidth The amount of transactions per second is not just another number High bandwidth allows the network to keep transaction prices low because it has sufficient resources to process more transactions per unit of time Low prices The lower the transaction price the more potential customers are interested in using the platform to store their financial transaction info and technical data MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 12 \x0cFast and Safe Operation #TraceChain is a perfect solution for building isolated #DataChains more than 100 000 transactions per second on each node Phenomenal speed allows #MetaHash to Process ALL global transactions in blockchain Achieve the lowest price per transaction in the history of blockchain Offer decentralized projects an adequate price for data storage in blockchain Convert any Ethereum ERC20 digital asset (token) into #MHC and transfer it to the #MetaHash network or convert it back Make it possible for shops to instantly accept payments in #MetaHash digital assets More than five billion transactions per day Under three seconds transaction confirmation Five stages of consensus building verification #MetaHash block anchors in the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 13 \x0cHow It Works Wallets Torrent Nodes Verification Nodes Slave Nodes Master Nodes blockchain Backups Bitcoin & Ethereum Backup Anchors Speed Reliability Up to 3 seconds to confirm a transaction with cores Each transaction is protected by 5 different consensus algorithms More than 5 billion transactions per day 1 node can handle more than 100 000 transactions per second Machine learning algorithm that defines the roles of nodes and their distribution across the network MetaHash org It\ s impossible to gain control over the network even with a budget of billions of dollars Real decentralization amongst real people rather than groups of dominant pools with gigantic mining farms hello@metahash org Blockchain Interoperability Send transfers from #MetaHash directly to other networks Digital assets (tokens) of other networks can be used in the #MetaHash network even Bitcoin Ethereum and ERC20 Any asset can be converted into a #MetaHashCoin #MetaHashCoins (#MHC) can be transferred to the Ethereum or Waves networks and sent back through mirrored smart contracts White Paper 14 \x0cHow did we attain such swiftness 1 2 3 Transactions are distributed across the network by Peer Nodes Transactions begin at the outer radius and then run into the core network using the fastest route The fastest nodes of the core network verify and synchronize transactions between themselves 4 5 6 The core network returns the balance of the wallets to the network Blockchain nodes contain information about all #DataChains and #MetaHash network transactions Every day nodes belonging to the #MetaHash Company establish anchors (a hash from the latest block) of the Bitcoin Ethereum and other networks * system is successfully attacked this will help to restore the net*Ifworktheurgently through general voting An anchor can be verified by any network member In its early years any new technology may be prone to vulnerabilities so this method is an additional fail safe which will be eliminated later In order to modify the data stored in the #MetaHash network it would be necessary to successfully attack it as well as a number of other blockchain networks MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 15 \x0c#TraceChain AI Node Pool Slave Nodes #AI #AI Incoming Nodes Master Node Veri\xef\xac\x81cation Nodes #AI #TraceChain AI #AI #AI #AI #AI Torrent Nodes Backup Nodes #MetaApp Nodes #AI #AI Light Wallet Nodes Light Wallet Nodes #TraceChain AI Testing function Node trust evaluation It would be required to know the performance of each node and the data transfer rate between nodes to create an optimal TraceChain AI network map Therefore #TraceChain AI randomly puts some nodes into testing mode to collate information The tests are specifically designed so that even if a node is corrupt it will not be able to report the performance or speed above the claimed figures and will not be able to identify it is being tested because this information is only revealed at the end of the interaction The best protection against a brute force attack is blocking the node after an unsuccessful attempt This is the method we use to evaluate node trust If a node processes a transaction incorrectly it resets its trust level A node can achieve 99% trust value after approximately 6 months of continuous activity If a node is used to disrupt or slow down the network it loses the accumulated trust value and will not be used to its full potential for a long time In addition Trust Nodes also affect the votes required for other types of consensus We also use the data on the actual node performance in the decentralized network under normal operating conditions of the system to calculate node performance thus eliminating the inaccuracies of the testing methodology MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 16 \x0c#TraceChain AI Each node features a code that votes for the roles to be assigned to other nodes in the moment As a result of the voting every available node receives the roles for several subsequent cycles of the network\ s life #TraceChain Node roles #TraceChain AI 1 Peer Nodes These nodes deal with wallets and external services They protect the internal parts of the network from external overloading caused by signal reception and distribution including dDos attacks At the same time they protect the network\ s core parts against the threat of corruption 2 Master CoreNodes & Slave CoreNodes The fastest and most reliable nodes become the core of the network they receive the maximum reward and form commits Any Slave Node can at any time become Master Node and start performing corresponding functions In the Slave mode they check the accuracy of Masters\ work and reduce their workload in terms of signal distribution among verification nodes Testing Function 3 Blockchain Backup Nodes 6 #MetaApps Nodes These nodes verify network integrity and check for correct functioning of the core In addition blockchain Backup Nodes run a voting procedure if the core of the network is successfully attacked Many services such as smart contracts and decentralized apps require extensive resources in order to execute work In #TraceChain there is a separate fee for execution of work not related to transactions 4 Verification Nodes Approved transactions are sent to these nodes which verify the functioning of Master and Slave Nodes and transmit the information to Peer Nodes for distribution to wallets 5 Proxy Nodes Most wallets by default are light wallets that trust the network consensus but any wallet can become a full wallet decide not to trust the network and store all the transactions itself This is a high load that requires a good internet connection and enough space on the disc to store large amounts of data A wallet doesn\ t need to store all transactions it can store the transactions following the last trim or work with trusted full nodes only MetaHash org hello@metahash org 7 Test Nodes All nodes go to test mode from time to time collecting technical data concerning node speed capabilities and the speed of data transactions between nodes which is used by #TraceChain AI to create an optimal network map and assign roles Of course the testing function is not the only one that determines node performance White Paper 17 \x0c#TraceChain Multi consensus To finalize the voting procedure 67% of nodes in each of their possible roles must validate the transaction The use of multi consensus rules out the possibility of gaining control over the network even with a concentration of more than 67% #MHC on one hand or gaining full control over a network\ s part In addition the PoS multi consensus regards every network member as important not only the owners of the largest share of resources 67% is a mathematically backed value that proves the need and sufficiency of exactly 67% of nodes #TraceChain uses multiconsensus voting on node roles supported by the multiPOS (Multivote Proof of Stake) principle Technology Development This document describes the principle of operation of the distributed network which is launched together with the ICO Round A While developing the current protocol we are testing an alternative network synchronization option featuring unlimited transactions (up to millions of transactions per second) reduced latency and increased protocol security In this regard the version described below may be different from the final public release MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 18 \x0c#MetaApps \x0c#MetaApps Decentralized cloud for real time applications High speed decentralization and the ability to handle high loads shape the new decentralized internet With #MetaHash any program written in any programming language under any operating system can become a decentralized app and work with both data from the internet and data from any blockchain system #MetaApps #MetaApps run in real time as regular websites and services but they are decentralized and even their creator cannot change their behavior unless their users or owners of their digital assets (tokens) cast their votes Run in real time mode #MetaApps is an evolution of smart contracts and can be used to decentralize any service These are independent programs that can exist forever and do not belong to anyone They work exactly as programmed and cannot be tampered with by third parties GUI Any developer can create a #MetaApp from code in any language Program and operation systems image uploads onto the network and starts automatically on numerous computers As fast as regular web services and applications Can look like ordinary applications or webpages Work exactly as programmed No one can change the application\ s behavior by bypassing the update rules Are created in any programming language including C++ PHP Solidity and others Compatible with any OS Full support of smart contract functionality #MetaApps can work with any blockchain or just with data from the internet Ready made modules for applications The #MetaHash network will include an array of decentralized modules to accelerate the development of new projects For example creators of each project will be able to use the existing #MetaChains service instead of creating their own Bitcoin or Ethereum parsing scripts Projects requiring a decentralized database will be able to use #MetaDataBase The basic functions of the protocol support the creation of #MetaTokens and data networks protected by the basic consensus of the #MetaHash network MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 20 \x0cSelf financing Applications The number of computers running a copy of a #MetaApp depends on the amount of #MetaHashCoins generated per day as well as its resource consumption Anyone can top up the account from which #MHC will be debited Alternatively a certain percentage of an app\ s income may be transferred to its account This model gives rise to fundamentally new type of projects and the way in which they exist and are launched Any app developer can program an application to use a certain share of its revenue to support its work in the network and keep the rest of the revenue to finance further app development In this model the team that develops an application can be selected by the users of the project by general voting The issues of marketing and the need for other services can be addressed collectively too Following the logic described above we can create a social network that Is controlled by general voting of #MHC holders and the project\ s active users Encrypts data and user messages so no one has access to them Is self financed Here is an example of a decentralized self financed social network based on the #MetaHash platform The Project Team launches a ICO Round A to finance the development of the project The finished code of various project nodes is uploaded into the #MetaHash network and these nodes\ wallets receive funds The nodes\ code is automatically deployed in #MetaHash Users\ publications are encrypted and stored in the #MetaHash data network They can only be decrypted by users who are added as friends and therefore allowed to see updates Thus only those who are on the user\ s list will be able to get the key to decrypt and read current and past updates published by this user Private messages are encrypted with end to end encryption and are only available to their recipients despite the fact that they are stored publicly Please note that the described example is just a concept The implication of such a project would require detailed planning which cannot be done within the framework of this White Paper After the ICO the project is financed through ad sales carried out in #MetaHashCoins or through the Disable ads user function The team supporting the project as well as the project\ s Marketing Team get paid in #MHC while a certain amount of #MHC is exchanged through the automatic decentralized exchange service and credited to the wallets of the project\ s nodes MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 21 \x0cApplications developed by the #MetaHash Team #MetaChains Decentralized parsers of all popular blockchain platforms In order for #MetaApps to immediately respond to events in any blockchain system we will release decentralized parsers allowing the use of API to get balance info and transaction history from wallets across various blockchain platforms This will allow applications to respond to different blockchain events and verify data accuracy by sending queries to network nodes #MetaToken The app\ s features include Automatic tokenization of #MHC into ERC20 digital assets and others Conversion of any digital assets into #MHC Transferring digital assets between #MetaHash blockchain and Ethereum wallets Tokenization of digital assets Using the data provided by the #MetaChains app and taking advantage of the protected and automated decentralized data storage service the user can convert any blockchain network\ s token into #MHC and use it in the #MetaHash network If required the asset can be automatically converted back and transferred to its original blockchain network This way any digital asset (token) can be turned into a #MetaToken and used in the #MetaHash network The protected and automated decentralized data storage service will be created under the supervision of #MetaHash Company but financed from data storage fees They will not belong to the #MetaHash Company A digital asset equal in value to the original token is created within the #MetaHash network At the same time the original asset is frozen on the blockchain platform it belongs to Tokenization has the retroactive effect of converting a #MetaHash asset into an original token #MetaStorage Decentralized data storage service allows you to work with public encrypted data stored in the #MetaHash network as well as with individual data nodes that are funded by an application using this data #MetaICO The application allows the release of #MetaHashCoins through the #MetaToken interface without knowledge of any programming language using a combination of settings MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 22 \x0cIn addition to simplifying the process of creating #MHC it is very important to support the protocol and create a comprehensive protection environment against hackers by code verification on multiple applications At the moment all ICOs are held using smart contracts Creating executing and understanding their results would require extensive knowledge of programming #MetaICO offers a new ICO model Absolutely anyone will have an opportunity to hold an ICO using tools similar to smart contracts The tools offered by #MetaICO will be simple enough to be used by people who don\ t have any significant programming skills #MetaICO will accept any cryptocurrency using the data received from the #MetaChains app and convert the #MetaHashCoins into Ethereum tokens and other ERC20 tokens of other networks #MetaICO application will allow any ICO porticipant to use their digital assets (tokens) in any network not just the #MetaHash network facilitating the storage of various projects\ digital assets (tokens) and providing connection to various token exchanges Censorship in #MetaApps Although the idea of applications that cannot be blocked or deleted sounds wonderful we must not forget that some people would want to use the system to harm others We believe that we have to apply censorship but it is not for individual people to decide how this will be manifest but rather for the whole #MetaHash community This will be done through open voting When defining content placement rules the #MetaHash community will always take into account all applicable laws Blocking an application The open voting procedure is initiated if 10 000 000 voting coins have been accumulated in favor of blocking an application The voting takes a month If an application gets 100 000 000 voting coins the voting period is reduced to one week If an application gets 500 000 000 voting coins the voting period is reduced to 24 hours As a protective measure against numerous malicious applications a deposit sufficient for three months of hosting the application (not less than 10 000 #MHC) will be required in order to upload an application This figure may be changed by a general vote If an application is blocked the remaining deposit is frozen If 67% of votes in favor of blocking the application are gathered by the end of the voting period it is blocked The application owner can file an appeal unblock the application and return the deposit The appeal is subject to the same rules as blocking and is successful if 67% of votes are cast in favor of unblocking the application by the end of the voting period A second appeal can be filed one month after the first one The appellant may offer a modified version of the application eliminating the reasons that made the community members decide against it MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 23 \x0c#MetaGate \x0c#MetaGate Gateway to Decentralized Internet #MetaGate is not just another cryptocurrency wallet and browser

#MHC will be issued in the course of around 11 years 0 025% from this amount will be emitted daily to the wallet controlled by the team which is selected at that point of time to distribute funds for further project development The team selected by all coin holders to continue project development will be responsible to use this funds in the best interests of the majority of coin holders The emission will start on February 18 2020 and will take 4 000 days which is a bit more than 11 years 55% of #MHC will be issued in the next 20 years to stimulate forging The emission consists of two parts 50% of #MHC will be issued within 10 years from 2018 Starting from 15 5% in the first year and ending in 5 9% in the 10th year (From Fork reserve burned in May 2019) 5% of #MHC will be issued within around 10 years after the 50% emission will be over 125 000 #MHC per day will be added to the Forging pool each day during 3 680 days ** The exchange rate is fixed at 626 09 USD per 1 ETH (the

\x0cThe project has a high potential to successfully exist as a self financing entity once the funds raised during the ICO period are exhausted However if the team that develops the project offers to increase the share of commission paid to #MetaHash and #MHC holders find it necessary they can vote in favor of this plan Project Authors Experts and Advisors are paid a share of commission and can buy #MHC at the ICO price (on general grounds) Authors fees will be paid from project\ s income during 25 years from launch date regardless of the people or companies managing #MetaHash in the future To maintain competitive prices the network\ s commission fees may be changed by a general vote based on the value of #MHC If data transactions start to interfere with the network they will be allocated an isolated network with the same consensus as the main network With standard load on the network no commission fees are charged for #MetaHash transfers Commission on Transactions in the

Rewards are calculated every 6 hours when a new block (trim) is formed The frequency of calculations and payments may vary depending on technical requirements at the discretion of the #MetaHash Team Unlike the PoW system #MetaHashCoins forging servers don\ t go out of date and don\xe2\x80\x99t lose their effectiveness as their number is limited and depends on #MHC stakes The only thing that will need improvement is the system\ s core (if scaling becomes necessary ) but transaction commissions at this stage will fully cover the upgrade 50% of all rewards for Forging are distributed among #MetaHashCoins owners (delegators) Coin holders can entrust their voting rights to any of the network nodes including their own nodes This can be easily done via the wallet interface Delegation initiates a technical transaction in the network Instead of establishing their own node an #MHC holder may give their voting right to the operator of the node they trust and get a share of the commission In this way large numbers of votes are concentrated at nodes that the community trusts making attacks on the system more difficult Commission paid to #MHC holders amounts to 50% of the total pool regardless of the stake limits that are taken into account when the voting power for each commit (block) is calculated The amount of #MetaHashCoins received for the forging process (also known as mining) of #MetaHash commit (block) is calculated by the following formula h * (fp + \xd1\x81) t h Holder\ s Stake t Total at stake fp Forging pool c Comissions Forging Stimulation by Year

can become the core of the network The system is designed to encourage users to add nodes with maximum capacity Rather than requiring a multitude of computers the system needs a limited number of computers with high processing capacity as well as weaker computers that could perform the role of Proxy Nodes and protect the network\ s core As the network fills with high performance nodes the amount of transactions that the network can carry out per unit time increases MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 31 \x0cCurrently there are 2 types of nodes available Infrastructure Torrent Node Proxy Node (Further on more roles such as Verification Torrent and Core will be introduced so as to make #MetaHash network fully decentralized) The potential node owner should run a test to be approved for one of the node roles the user may specify which role he prefers The minimum requirements for passing a test must comply with the requirements in Yellow Paper This 40% nodes\xe2\x80\x99 reward pool will be split into 6 equal geo/node parts Infrastructure Torrent Node Asia Infrastructure Torrent Node Europe Infrastructure Torrent Node Americas Proxy Node Asia Proxy Node Europe Proxy Node Americas Each node will be automatically affiliated to one of the regions based on the speed tests in these internet connectivity clusters With further introduction of other roles the total amount of which according to current plans will make up to 5 or more including proxy and infrastructure torrent nodes the reward system will be adjusted in order to keep it clear predictable and fair for all node owners All changes will be respectively added to White Paper and Yellow Paper Minimum stakes To become an active node a minimum of delegated coins is required 500 000 #MHC to act as an Infrastructure Torrent Node with a maximum voting strength of 10 000 000 delegated #MHC per node 100 000 #MHC to act as a Proxy Node with a maximum voting strength of 1 000 000 delegated #MHC per node 1 000 #MHC to participate in Active Forging with Wallet MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 32 \x0c10% is paid to the owners of Wallet nodes (Forging Wallets) Wallet Forging Reward pool is distributed in two ways 1% Equally shared between all active wallets which forge with not less than 100 #MHC 9% Randomly shared between active wallets which forge with not less than 1 000 #MHC Winning wallets for a new round are chosen with a mathematical formula providing a random distribution of active wallets based on the previous trim\ s hash value (that is from all transactions that occurred before the end of the last round) Thus winners become known immediately at the start of a new round and their wallets receive corresponding notifications Since the hash of the past trim is known throughout the network all users can easily check the correctness of the calculation using the same mathematical formula During multiple hash upon hash calculation a wallet that is closer to the current hash number in this round gets its place and the next hash is calculated to determine a new winner Wallets protect the integrity of the system Thanks to wallets the system can\ t be controlled by anyone even if they own more than 67% of all #MHC In contrast to nodes wallets can\ t generate significant rewards but may still bring a nice bonus to any network user Let\ s calculate the awards for wallets assuming that the Wallet Forging reward pool on this day is 190 400 #MHC (10% of the daily rewards pool during the first year) ignoring commissions that increase the reward pool 1% is shared equally between all Forging Wallets (100 #MHC frozen) Every full 4 hours of Forging guarantee 1 share from this reward 1% shared reward is 19 408 22 #MHC 9% for a sweepstake with 1 000 winning tickets every day at 00 00 UTC Every full 4 hours of Active Forging (1 000 #MHC frozen) add tickets to wallet\ s daily stake increasing chances for rewards 4% first place (77632 88 #MHC) 1% second place (19408 22 #MHC) 0 5% third place (9704 11 #MHC) 0 415% fourth place (8054 4113 #MHC) 0 335% fifth place (6501 7537 #MHC) 0 95% from 6th to 100th (0 01% or 194 0822 #MHC each) 1 8% from 101st to 1 000th (0 002% or 38 81644 #MHC each) MetaHash org hello@metahash org White Paper 33 \x0cBelow is an example of how Nodes and delegation rewards are calculated As an example let\ s calculate the rewards assuming that the reward pool is 1 904 000 #MHC 50% of reward is given to delegated coins and is 952 000 #MHC 40% of reward is given to Node owners for supporting Nodes and is 761 600 #MHC Alice took part in delegating with 1 000 000 #MHC and a total of 10 000 000 #MHC is delegated to Nodes Alice will receive 10% of 952 000 #MHC = 95 200 #MHC If Alice set up a Node and delegated her coins to her node she will receive 76 160 #MHC for the node If Bob who doesn\ t have a node delegates his 1 000 000 #MHC to Alice\ s server she\ ll get 76 160 #MHC more So Alice will earn 247 520 #MHC in this commit (block) Bob will receive 95 200 #MHC for delegating his coins NOTE This calculation in #MHC is a subject to minor correction as it ignores commissions which increase the reward pool #MetaHashCoins Emission by Year 15% of all #MetaHashCoins will be distributed among the participants of Founders\ round Private Round and ICO Round The remaining 85% will not exist at the time of the ICO and will be issued at planned times in accordance with #MetaHash code 85% is made up of 55% for #MetaHash forging stimulation 20% to support the Project Team and 10% to support the project\ s

was based on the achievements of AdSniper created in 2012 through 2016 in the field of advertising technologies A network library for receiving signals working on C++ and capable of simultaneously receiving and sending more than 1 000 000 requests per second to one inexpensive standard server A network library for synchronizing signals within a cluster that manages gigantic data flows between cluster machines A machine learning system that decides in 10 milliseconds to respond to a signal taking into account multifactorial interrelationships Own analogue of Hadoop\xe2\x80\x99s for similar systems in C++ for distributed processing of large data We received a lot of requests from different companies for the application of blockchain technology and came to understand that current technologies cannot satisfy requests for such types of systems So in 2016 we started developing our own protocol #TraceChain Now each of the geographically dispersed nodes belonging to AdSniper accepts requests from the entire internet at the rate of more than a million requests per second and can be scaled without limits by adding more servers 2017 May August September October Development
