12 Roadmap 14 Links 15 References 15 1 \x0cIntroduction In the emerging decentralized and pseudonymous environment there is a need for coordinates to assess the trustworthiness of those to deal with U\xc2\xb0OS is a universal reputation system constituting an open source blockchain protocol U\xc2\xb0OS was created to be the standard for evaluation of reputation on the emerging decentralized web Problem Statement Reputation is the Missing Piece to the Trustworthy Web Existing cryptocurrencies are used by the decentralized environment for maintaining economic relationships However our reputation on the web also has an economic capacity Until now this capacity could not be fully revealed as there were no coordinates to quickly effortlessly and comprehensively assess the trustworthiness of those to deal with across multiple online platforms The absence of a universal and distributed reputation system makes the decision making process slow and costly According to the study by \xe2\x80\x8bLene Pettersen\xe2\x80\x8b peer to peer platforms\xe2\x80\x99 users consider rating score as the most important factor of making decisions on whether they would deal with strangers However the study also found that platforms control and change rating categories with subsequent consequences Thus existing evaluation systems are not fully reliable and not transparent 2 \x0cSolution The U\xc2\xb0OS reputation system scores digital entities based on the network\xe2\x80\x99s feedback Following 1 5 years of research and development the U\xc2\xb0OS team introduces a new technology \xe2\x80\x94 an open source blockchain protocol that translates social and economic actions into reputation U\xc2\xb0OS brings the reputation system to the peer to peer environment without violating its decentralized and privacy friendly nature Value Proposition Velocity and Cost Efficiency for Economic Interactions Online U\xc2\xb0OS reputation system can be effortlessly integrated with any service or application such as payment systems value exchange services social platforms etc U\xc2\xb0OS integration augments user experience with competitive gameplay elements by revealing the reputation of digital entities The key characteristics of the U\xc2\xb0OS reputation system are \xe2\x97\x8f Portability \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x8b the system is integrable into any other existing application via robust API and OAuth \xe2\x97\x8f Multi Contextuality \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x94 it is sufficiently flexible to be adjusted to a specific context \xe2\x97\x8f Transparency\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the blockchain recorded data allows tracing causal links which creates a holistic picture and increases trust to a digital entity \xe2\x97\x8f Distributed nature\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 algorithmic operation on the public ledger without belonging to any centralized authority \xe2\x97\x8f User ownership \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x94 reputation is inseparable from a user account Control over both belongs solely to a user by means of a private key \xe2\x97\x8f Privacy friendliness\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 users are not required to reveal their identity to use the system \xe2\x97\x8f Resiliency\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the protocol is immutable and censorship resistant 3 \x0cTechnology U\xc2\xb0OS network protocol is based on E \xe2\x80\x8b OSIO open source code\xe2\x80\x8b U\xc2\xb0OS inherits its key features \xe2\x97\x8f Zero fee transactions \xe2\x97\x8f Account system \xe2\x97\x8f WebAssembly support \xe2\x97\x8f Smart contracts execution \xe2\x97\x8f Currencies and tokens support and takes it a step further with \xe2\x97\x8f Social Transactions \xe2\x97\x8f DPoI Consensus Algorithm \xe2\x97\x8f Dynamic Emission Algorithm Social Transactions U\xc2\xb0OS introduces a new type of blockchain transactions \xe2\x80\x94 social The social transaction is a reaction of network participants on each other\xe2\x80\x99s activity recorded in a public distributed ledger In addition to account balance and its financial transactions U\xc2\xb0OS also operates with social interaction which creates a more holistic portrait of our digital identity owned to us on the sovereign rights The \xe2\x80\x8bU\xc2\xb0Community\xe2\x80\x8b dApp uses this type of transactions to upvote downvote publish content and follow or trust users \xe2\x80\x94 this is just one of the countless potential use cases for social transactions Social transactions along with economic ones are used to determine Importance\xc2\xb0 of each account by calculator nodes the community owned nodes that perform importance\xc2\xb0 score calculation and distribute the resulting scores back to the network 4 \x0cDelegated Proof of Importance You Enrich the Network the Network Enriches You DPoI consensus algorithm integrates the concepts of EOSIO DPoS with the idea that social interactions naturally generate economic activity between individuals or organizations The consensus is achieved with the help of delegates Delegates are elected by the network participants based on the Importance\xc2\xb0 of each voter Importance\xc2\xb0 (and thus influence) of a digital entity for a network is achieved by the value they produce for others along with the amount of their stake Importance\xc2\xb0 is calculated using the following formula ri = (1\xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x89a \xe2\x88\x92\xcf\x89s)vi + \xcf\x89a\xcf\x80i + \xcf\x89s\xcf\x83i where v i is the stake volume index \xcf\x80i is the financial activity index \xcf\x83i is the social network activity index and \xcf\x89a and \xcf\x89s are the weight coefficients that determine the relative significance of each component of the user activity Thus unlike PoW PoS and DPoS approaches DPoI ensures a bigger influence over the network to those who have earned approval by the community A more detailed explanation of the Importance\xc2\xb0 calculation can be found in section 2 1 of U \xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xb0OS Yellow Paper\xe2\x80\x8b Botnet Activity Prevention The network uses the NCDAwareRank algorithm that takes into consideration the level of integration of the account in the general network helping to protect the system from the botnet attacks System of trusts distributed by the users of the network also augments the algorithm to prevent activity imitation A more detailed explanation of the U\xc2\xb0OS vulnerability resistance can be found in section 2 3 of \xe2\x80\x8bU\xc2\xb0OS Yellow Paper\xe2\x80\x8b 5 \x0cTokenomics UOS Token Model and Resource Usage PLEASE NOTE CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS REFERRED TO IN THIS WHITE PAPER REFER TO CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS ON A LAUNCHED BLOCKCHAIN THAT ADOPTS THE U\xc2\xb0OS SOFTWARE THEY DO NOT REFER TO THE ERC 20 COMPATIBLE TOKENS BEING DISTRIBUTED ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN IN CONNECTION WITH THE UOS TOKEN DISTRIBUTION UOS tokens constitute the core of U\xc2\xb0OS crypto economy They are used in the system in several ways \xe2\x97\x8f To allocate CPU and bandwidth resources using staked token amounts Only core UOS tokens can be used for CPU and bandwidth resource allocation \xe2\x97\x8f To purchase other resources such as RAM and storage space and perform other forms of financial transfers via smart contracts using unstaked tokens \xe2\x97\x8f To vote for Block Producers and calculator nodes The amount of staked tokens owned by the account contributes to the user\xe2\x80\x99s Importance\xc2\xb0 during the voting process \xe2\x97\x8f To increase the importance\xc2\xb0 score and receive the dynamic emission Amount of tokens staked by the account directly influences the Importance\xc2\xb0 received by the user and the amount of dynamic emission Thus staked core tokens are used for the resource allocation and play an important part in emission and importance\xc2\xb0 calculation while unstaked tokens can be used in direct transfers 6 \x0cDynamic Emission The Algorithm Supports the Network Growth Dynamic emission is introduced to provide additional liquidity during network growth Emission amount at launch constitutes one billion of protocol tokens distributed to the original network accounts to start the protocol The U\xc2\xb0OS project implements adaptive emission The emission volume is calculated regularly in a certain time interval t\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b= ti\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b+ T\xe2\x80\x8b The 0\xe2\x80\x8b t\xe2\x80\x8b 1\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\xa6 t\xe2\x80\x8b i \xe2\x80\x8b where\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bti+1 volume of emission depends on the network activity growth in the preceding time period T \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b The indicator called Network Importance (NI) describes the total volume of social and economic transactions among network participants and is used as a trigger for additional emission The emission takes place every time NI reaches its all time maximum Newly issued tokens are distributed among network participants according to their Importance\xc2\xb0 rate Dynamic emission allocated to users for their social and financial activities motivates the users to participate in the network development thus helping to achieve the overall network growth A more detailed explanation of the network activity calculation and emission value calculation can be found in U \xe2\x80\x8b \xc2\xb0OS Yellow Paper\xe2\x80\x8b in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively 7 \x0cUse Cases U\xc2\xb0Community U\xc2\xb0Community\xe2\x80\x8b is the first dApp and a user friendly interface for U\xc2\xb0OS blockchain launched in Oct 2018 It allows users to interact with each other make offers publish content create and govern communities/organizations powered by the U\xc2\xb0OS reputation system 8 \x0cMaking Offers U\xc2\xb0Community allows its users to make offers to one another \xe2\x80\x94 a public piece of content with a call to action Offers\xe2\x80\x99 visual design is freely customizable it may contain text pictures links countdown or anything else depending on a purpose The purpose of an offer could be asking for a donate advertising event invitation direct selling etc Reputation system enables quick verification of trustworthiness of the offer s creator which accelerates the process of decision making for offer receivers An example of the existing offer Interacting Within Communities U\xc2\xb0Community enables people to get into autonomous communities initiate discussions or share ideas on the subject the community is devoted to Users are free to organize the community\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchical structure and govern it by themselves Besides the general reputation rate community members are ranked at their reputation within the community that displays their competence on the subject An example of the existing community Creating Content Any content created by U\xc2\xb0Community users is public and can be evaluated by other users It may be a short post on a user profile a comment to someone\xe2\x80\x99s content or a big publication The reputation rate of content consumers who react to it directly influences the rate of content and reputation of its creators This supports the level of content quality on the platform and creates an opportunity to get a reward for valuable content by means of receiving dynamic emission or asking for a donation An example of the existing publication Network Governance U\xc2\xb0Community has the functionality to govern the U\xc2\xb0OS protocol by voting for Block Producers and Calculator Nodes with user\xe2\x80\x99s importance\xc2\xb0 9 \x0cIntegration Into
