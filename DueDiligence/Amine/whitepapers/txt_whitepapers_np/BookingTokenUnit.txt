b Whitepaper BTU [Booking Token Unit] Protocol An open protocol for decentralized bookings Vidal Chriqui Herv\xc3\xa9 Hababou vidal@btuprotocol com\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bherve@btuprotocol com 808 Labs March 22nd 2018 Version 1 2 Abstract Our mission is to create an open source standardized decentralized booking protocol along with reference implementations that can be leveraged by participants in industries such as hospitality travel finance healthcare retail automotive and more The Booking Token Unit (BTU) protocol is a building block for any decentralized application (dApp) or web site willing to implement booking features for their end users This standard also brings interoperability among decentralized applications that incorporate it The BTU protocol is being standardized as ERC 808 and requires the use of the Ethereum based \xe2\x80\x8bBTU token\xe2\x80\x8b The purpose of the BTU Token is to incentivize proper behaviors such as rewarding successful bookings and enforcing late cancellation and no shows policies All applications implementing the BTU protocol would benefit from a hybrid approach that combines an on chain smart contract and off chain software components providing more scalability Finally a transparent and public inventory enabled by an open source protocol would considerably lower the entry barriers into the online booking markets 1 \x0cTABLE OF

to an imbalance where online platforms are gaining more power over the actual service providers who bear the operational costs and investments Digital network effects are preventing existing players from operating in a free market As a result service providers are experiencing high commission fees ranging from 15% to 35% Those fees are paid to the centralized \xe2\x80\x9cwinner takes all\xe2\x80\x9d booking platforms Other issues with centralized booking platforms include but are not limited to Loyalty points are platform or service specific End user confidential information is at risk of large scale hacks Complementary services offered are limited With blockchain networks emerging as a new global infrastructure we have the opportunity to create vastly different power structures A public inventory and an open protocol lower operational costs while allowing fair competition between a higher number of market participants 2 Impacted markets 2 1 General At first the Internet was thought to lead to disintermediation in many industries Twenty years after the dot com bubble a new type of intermediary \xe2\x80\x9cInternet Platforms\xe2\x80\x9d dominate these industries Internet platforms have provided superior value propositions to end users in terms of convenience price or performance But they have also benefited from powerful digital network effects due to the very nature of the Internet technology The centralized platforms have exploited this market power to win it all and eventually to collect higher and higher returns Our blockchain based booking protocol can benefit any industry that relies on a reservation process and where centralized players have become the dominant participants Since decentralized platforms foster the adoption of more transparent practices it should encourage healthier competition It should then alter the walled garden content policy in place and encourage a new wave of developers to deliver innovative and open services leading to better functioning markets An array of markets could benefit from the above For instance our protocol could be used to book many of the following services Hotel and Apartments 3 \x0c Offices Studios and Warehouses Cars Flights Jets Trains Buses Yachts and Ferries Tours Holiday packages Cruises and Museums Shows Sports Events and Restaurants Medical and Well being appointments Tests Photographers Guides Caterers Car repair \xe2\x80\xa6 Innovative offerings could be built that enable the booking of bundled services As our protocol is industry independent and easy to implement existing players in one industry may be able to offer new services to their existing customers (cross sales) That is what platform envelopment strategy suggests where a second entry path is required that does not rely on Schumpeterian innovation This strategy has been documented by Thomas R Eisenmann the Howard H Stevenson Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School in the Platform Envelopment working paper ( see \xe2\x80\x8bRef [1] ) 2 2 Impacted market example hotel booking The hotel booking sector was one of the most impacted industries at the start of the Internet revolution It is now a highly concentrated oligopolistic market with a Herfindahl Index above 5 000 we have found it to be an excellent first example use case of the BTU Protocol Indeed two online travel agency (\xe2\x80\x9cOTA\xe2\x80\x9d) namely Expedia and Priceline are dominating the market due to market forces only possible with the current state of the internet as well as extensive consolidation (acquisitions) Expedia now owns Expedia com Hotels com HomeAway Hotwire Orbitz Worldwide Travelocity Traveldoo Trivago Venere Wotif Group Carrentals com Classic Vacations and eLong com Priceline now owns Booking com Kayak Priceline com Agoda com Cheapflights com Ctrip com (partially) Momondo com Opentable com Rentalcars com and Rocketmiles Economic theory predicted that leading OTA would increase their fees and that these costs are split between consumers and hotels according to the relative elasticity of supply and demand This is exactly what is happening In September 2017 AccorHotels\xe2\x80\x99 CEO S\xc3\xa9bastien Bazin explained the business issue facing large Hotel operators \xe2\x80\x9cI think all the big hotel companies in the world we have the same market cap as Booking and Expedia together $130 billion They probably have together 80 000 to 90 000 employees All together we have over 3 million employees So it is a weakness It appears to be a weakness which is why they have so much value in the stock market because they have better agility less volatility and better free cash flow\xe2\x80\x9d However he seemed to agree he could hardly do without these OTA \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more and more costly tougher on the acquisition of a new client because Booking and Expedia have a 4 \x0cbetter reach to new clients You accept to pay more because they give you a client you cannot have otherwise \xe2\x80\x9d Still the Hotel industry in Europe (via the HOTREC trade association) is trying to fight back by alerting the E U and requesting new regulation to be enforced Its latest position paper (\xe2\x80\x8bRef [2]\xe2\x80\x8b) that we recommend reading includes screenshot proofs of problematic issues HOTREC claims to have identified over the past years several unfair practices of oligopolistic platforms which are putting pressure and increasing the fragility of the 200 000 European establishments (composed of 91% micro enterprises) They also note that the power of narrow access gates to the online market has resulted in uniformed contracts and several market practices which are considered unfair such as platforms dictating their conditions and influencing consumers choices in an opaque manner The detailed mechanisms of how two OTAs ended up controlling 95% of the U S market and how they use this position to command outrageously high fees are very well documented in this July 2017 article from Benjamin G Edeman (\xe2\x80\x8b@bgedelman\xe2\x80\x8b) http //www benedelman org/publications/ota bias 12jul2017 pdf Benjamin G Edelman is an Associate Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School where he studies and teaches about the economics of online markets He is a Winner of the 2013 Prize in Game Theory and Computer Science from the Game Theory Society for \xe2\x80\x9cthe best paper at the interface of game theory and computer science in the last decade\xe2\x80\x9d His bottom line is that OTA practices drive up costs for both hotels and consumers Some of his arguments are summarized here but we highly recommend reading the article Consumers are unaware of the hundreds of dollars of OTA fees 25% or even more of their hotel booking budget due to the OTA market structure Consumers choose these OTA sites in part as a result of billions of dollars spent on advertising Expedia is the 31st largest advertiser in the U S just behind Pepsi spending an estimated $1 3 billion in 2015 And travelers perceive no cost to booking through OTAs and have had little reason to seek out the \xe2\x80\x9ccheapest OTA\xe2\x80\x9d or to think about OTA fees at all Priceline and Expedia have adjusted their pricing and rules to extract higher payments from hotels including auctioning off the top positions in search results No other OTA controls more than 1% of the OTA market The hotel industry remains fragmented and smaller hotels especially cannot oppose fees that have increased as OTAs have merged and gained in market power OTAs have incentives to bias results including to bias results towards hotels that pay them greatest commissions and to demote the hotels that insist on lower commissions When a small property requested a lower fee the OTA had every reason to decline knowing that customers would be unlikely to miss that property Independent hotels pay dearly for the favored placement they receive 25% or 30% more than they spend on physical plant maintenance or cleaning 5 \x0c When some hotels have offered lower \xe2\x80\x9cmembers only\xe2\x80\x9d rates on their own sites OTAs changed the sequence of search results (e g placing on subsequent pages of results) changed color schemes to deemphasize these hotels withheld standard promotional text or removed photos these hotels previously uploaded to the OTA Search bias is deceptive Consumers have no reason to expect properties to be sorted based on fees paid while OTAs indicate \xe2\x80\x9cRecommended\xe2\x80\x9d properties by default Search bias perpetuates the expectation that prices are the same at OTAs and directly So hotels risk end up competing not to offer low prices or high quality to consumers but instead competing to offer the highest commission to OTAs \xe2\x80\x8bThis is discouraging hotels from soliciting direct bookings Moreover OTAs have taken steps to impede hotels\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to become more self reliant Multiple hotel chain marketing managers reported that OTAs rejected their requests for contract terms preventing OTAs from bidding on their own hotel names As a result when a user searches for an affected hotel the user sees OTA advertisements A corrective disclosure is necessary to put consumers on notice of actual practice \xe2\x80\x8bOnce consumers begin direct booking in earnest the change might be virtually irreversible Reasonable inquiry should examine OTA internal emails as they might reveal other practices intended to mislead consumers penalize hotels that seek to reduce marketing costs or otherwise fall short of applicable standards As much as we agree with Ben\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant analysis of the market we do not think regulation alone could solve the issues outlined above in a timely fashion Actually in April 2017 the European Commission and ten national competition authorities (Belgian Czech French German Hungarian Irish Italian Dutch Swedish and UK) published a coordinated report on competition in the online hotel booking sector with the objective to assess the effects of the antitrust enforcement measures adopted in recent years in this sector The detailed report can be found here http //ec europa eu/competition/ecn/hotel_monitoring_report_en pdf The results are so unconvincing that the European Competition Network has had to \xe2\x80\x9ckeep the online hotel booking sector under review\xe2\x80\x9d We believe blockchain innovation could be called to the rescue Decentralization openness and tokenization would lower the cost of entry and enable new market entry strategies This is where the BTU protocol can help 6 \x0c3 The BTU protocol 3 1 Definitions A reservation process involves at least 4 parties or components a provider a booker a booking infrastructure and the RES smart contract Provider The provider is an entity providing its own resource or a third party party resource to be booked Booker The booker is an entity that books the resource for itself or a third party Booking The booking infrastructure is the public \xe2\x80\x9clocation\xe2\x80\x9d where providers can infrastructure \xe2\x80\x9cpost\xe2\x80\x9d resource availability data and where these resources can be reserved by bookers The booking infrastructure facilitates signaling between providers and bookers by aggregating a high volume of resource type and availabilities RES RES is the smart contract implementation of the decentralized standardized BTU protocol Payments are handled outside of the scope of the BTU protocol 7 \x0c3 2 Specification and sequence of steps The BTU protocol involves potentially ten steps and our standardized decentralized reservation contract (RES) Some of following steps can be relayed off chain but are always settled on chain Hereafter the general sequence \xe2\x97\x8f (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 1 1\xe2\x80\x8b) Provider is creating an \xe2\x80\x9cavailability offer\xe2\x80\x9d (OFFER) specifying \xe2\x97\x8b resource id OR bundle id A bundle is a group of resources \xe2\x97\x8b resource name OR bundle name \xe2\x97\x8b resource category \xe2\x97\x8b deposit amount in BTU amount requested for escrow in order to allow a reservation request \xe2\x97\x8b commission amount in BTU amount paid to booker \xe2\x97\x8b availability start date \xe2\x97\x8b availability end date \xe2\x97\x8b limit date and time for a free reservation cancellation \xe2\x97\x8b signed (r s v) hash of previous information\xe2\x80\x8b This signed hash serves as a signed identifier of the resource to be reserved \xe2\x97\x8b Metadatas daily price of the resource (fiat amount to be paid at resource \xe2\x80\x9cdelivery\xe2\x80\x9d) links to images long description key values that can be used as search criteria etc The availability data is broadcasted over any communication channel ideally a decentralized off chain solution \xe2\x97\x8f (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 1 2\xe2\x80\x8b) At any moment the provider can update the resource metadata by broadcasting a new message It is very common that yield management requires many prices (fiat price of the resource) update during the same day This update only impacts the off chain components 8 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f \xe2\x97\x8f (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 2)\xe2\x80\x8b Booker is looking for a resource is querying all resources matching his criteria and is selecting a resource he is willing to reserve (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 3 1\xe2\x80\x8b) In the same operation \xe2\x97\x8b Booker is approving to RES smart contract the required amount of BTU to make the booking (amount defined in step 1 1 by the provider) \xe2\x97\x8b A booking entry is registered into the smart contract with following information \xe2\x96\xa0 Signed hash of resource \xe2\x96\xa0 Signed pointer to all full offer information (datas + metadatas) at the moment of the reservation request Those information are stored in the offchain booking infrastructure \xe2\x96\xa0 Public address matching the hash signature \xe2\x96\xa0 desired reservation start date \xe2\x96\xa0 desired reservation end date \xe2\x96\xa0 status RESERVATION_REQUESTED (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 3 2\xe2\x80\x8b) Booker broadcasts the resource reservation request to the Booking infrastructure adding all end user profile information off chain that may be necessary for the reservation approval This would help comply with privacy protection requirements It is the responsibility of the Booker to notify its end user customer of the full resource information and the provider signature (Availability \xe2\x80\x9csnapshot\xe2\x80\x9d data) This can be used as proof of reservation details in (the extreme) case resource information at reservation time is deleted from off chain infrastructure (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 4)\xe2\x80\x8b Provider is validating the reservation request and broadcasts the new status to \xe2\x80\x9cRESERVATION_CONFIRMED\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 5)\xe2\x80\x8b RES smart contract is updating the reservation status to \xe2\x80\x9cRESERVATION_CONFIRMED\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 6 1 Optional\xe2\x80\x8b) Booker cancels the reservation by broadcasting a cancellation request This triggers a submission to the RES smart contract that empties the registries for this resource Depending on the conditions and cancellation date the BTU escrowed into the RES smart contract are affected back to the user or to the provider (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 6 2 Optional\xe2\x80\x8b) Provider cancels the reservation by broadcasting a cancellation request This triggers a submission to the RES smart contract that empties the registries for this resource RES smart contract is releasing the escrowed amount to booker (\xe2\x80\x8bStep 7 1 & 7 2\xe2\x80\x8b) Booker is notifying that the resource has been paid (presumably at resource check out) RES smart contract is releasing the escrowed BTU back to user in addition to a BTU agreed commission 3 3 Anti spam To avoid any malicious behavior the protocol implementation may request providers to escrow some BTU tokens before being allowed to submit availabilities offers into the booking infrastructure 9 \x0cThe amount of BTU tokens to be escrowed may depend on the provider\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as tracked by a third party service 3 4 Broadcasted message format Each availability message contains the following parameters \xe2\x97\x8f unique resource id \xe2\x97\x8f resource description \xe2\x97\x8f resource category useful as a filtering criteria \xe2\x97\x8f booking price BTU amount requested for escrow in order to allow a reservation request \xe2\x97\x8f availability start date and time \xe2\x97\x8f availability end date and time \xe2\x97\x8f limit date and time for a free reservation cancellation \xe2\x97\x8f JSON metadata describing the bookable resource (fiat price to be paid images list of images full description options etc ) This metadata is specific to each category of resource Also the hash submitted to the smart contracts are using the blockchain network platform standard Example ECDSA signature and Keccak 256 function for Ethereum 3 5 Booking infrastructure For Bookers and Providers to meet a booking infrastructure is required to host and propagate the messages In its principle this infrastructure is very similar to an exchange order book (availability book in this case) that aggregates sell & buy orders (availability offer & availability request) This leads us to qualify this booking infrastructure as an \xe2\x80\x9cexchange\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crelayer\xe2\x80\x9d The protocol described in this section does not describe an incentive for third parties to operate such a relayer platform However the next section will offer suggestions of how BTU token may be used to design such incentives 3 6 The RES smart contract 3 6 1 Motivation The following describes standard functions for BTU standardized and extensible reservation process The reservation process embeds some actions (listing availabilities deposit sharing customer information etc ) and claims (proof of reservation) This standardized reservation interface allows Dapps smart contracts or any Third Party to initiate a booking process and to check the status of a booking 10 \x0c3 6 2 Coverage The specification covers all the steps even the ones that are potentially off chain Nevertheless in practice and while waiting for more scalability on existing smart contracts infrastructures only a few of RES smart contract function will be used 3 6 3

specification and contribute to enrich the process definition 4 Protocol token 4 1 The BTU token The BTU token is an ERC20 token working in conjunction with a ERC 808 standard reference implementation contract that is compliant with most booking processes The BTU token is issued on top of Ethereum public infrastructure It can be used as Deposit value for booking a resource The deposit is an incentive for any Booker to cancel its reservation on time If the resource is not released the deposit will be kept by the resource owner Reward mechanisms BTU tokens can be used to reward usage of the protocol This would incentivize consumption of those resources through the BTU infrastructure rather than via other legacy and incumbent platforms that may list the same resources Our vision is that a large share of the legacy platform commissions (15 to 35%) can be used to incentivize new platforms connections to the BTU infrastructure 12 \x0cFurthermore envelopment entails entry by one platform provider into another\xe2\x80\x99s market by bundling its own functionalities with that of the target\xe2\x80\x99s so as to leverage shared user relationships and common components With BTU tokens a standard protocol and open source software dominant firms that otherwise are sheltered from entry due to strong network effects and high switching costs can be vulnerable to such envelopment attacks 4 2 Governance 4 2 1 BTUIPs BTU improvement proposals Any changes to BTU protocol (smart contracts architecture message format or functionality) should be proposed in the BTU Improvement Proposals (BTUIPs) available on our github The contribution guidelines are provided there and are inspired by the Ethereum EIPs process 4 2 2 Forks Future proof protocol is a hard challenge when deployed in an immutable system of smart contract like Ethereum Once the RES smart contract is deployed its logic and modelisation cannot be upgraded Hence any protocol update or upgrade that is deployed may cause a disruption a fork of the network and data that may invalidate current approved reservations To limit the potential disruptions of our development roadmap we will Maximize upgrades keeping backward compatibility with previous version (soft fork) Use an ENS address such as \xe2\x80\x8bbtuprotocol eth and recommend calling the smart contract with its ENS address to allow Dapps benefiting automatically from Even if we worked hard to innovate and provide leadership on the Protocol governance we cannot guarantee that a situation where two versions of the protocol are live (fork) could be avoided 4 3 Token function As it is open source the BTU protocol and related software could substantially lower the cost for any party in providing relevant booking services to their customers The BTU token is a network token facilitating (off and on chain) signaling between a Provider and a Booker The token\xe2\x80\x99s role is also to create financial incentives in order to drive a network of participants to behave rationally and with economic interests aligned For instance the BTU tokens will be used to reward Bookers In essence Bookers are effectively rewarded with tokens as they are \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d successful bookings 13 \x0cAnti spam parameters are also making use of token staking in order to enforce fair use The token also serves as a de facto standard and eventually enabling a virtuous network effect And different industries could adopt the same protocol thereby amplifying the network effects that would otherwise be limited to one industry Finally other adoption mechanisms and token use cases may be implemented by anyone in the community independently from the token initial purpose 4 4 BTU infrastructure Scalability considerations Existing blockchain networks do not yet offer the scalability required for data storage and querying at reasonable transaction rates to cope with existing booking volumes in whatever market even the smallest one The role of the BTU booking infrastructure is to provide a cost effective scalable way for any company (Provider or Booker) to operate a Dapp based on the BTU protocol and the BTU token Three options are currently considered (in no specific order) to build the BTU infrastructure Cosmos that can provide a good way to build a sidechain like infrastructure that can offer scalability and benefit from on chain security In this approach our relayer infrastructure will be constructed as our Cosmos Zone and the incentive for operating the booking infrastructure comes from ATOM token (Cosmos token) Raiden\xe2\x80\x8b + IPFS + Any open source Indexing solution Raiden + \xe2\x80\x8bIPDB (BigChainDB public infrastructure) Raiden is used to follow deposits and IPDB to store and query availabilities This option is a good fit for our MVP and can even be rolled out in a private BigChainDB infrastructure Over time we may revise this strategy depending on the technology advances We may also develop several implementations on top of different blockchain networks 4 5 Roadmap Macro phase Estimated delivery date Description On chain MVP Code name \xe2\x80\x9cEarth\xe2\x80\x9d May 2018

Hosting of data storage nodes Integration with decentralised identity systems 5 First use case Hotel Booking 5 1 Description & involved parties This use case leverages the BTU open source software by the following parties 15 \x0c A hotel channel manager (BTU Provider) already working with many hotels and able to publish their availabilities into the BTU booking infrastructure A website platform (BTU Booker) willing to provide hotel booking services to its end customers Channel managers\xe2\x80\x99 mission is to provide seamless real time connections to Hotels through their Property Management Systems (PMS) or Central Reservation Systems (CRS) For instance channel managers Sabre Hospitality and Siteminder are respectively integrated with 40 000 large hotels and 26 000 independent hotels Website platforms already have relationships with end customers They could be operated by established companies that have millions of customer relationships in other markets such as publishing telecom e banking insurance utilities or retail They could also be operated by independent owners catering to a specific community or even by a facebook friend of yours 5 2 Architecture 5 3 Simplified process description Channel Manager Set up 1 A channel manager implements the BTU open source SDK 2 Its customers (all connected hotels) accept to publish their availabilities to the BTU \xe2\x80\x9cchannel\xe2\x80\x9d Website Platform Set up 16 \x0c1 A website platform implements the BTU open source plug in 2 Its visitors (travelers) are presented with the opportunity to book hotels Booking Process 1 Traveler initiates booking request of a hotel on the website platform 2 Website platform may escrow some BTU tokens according to the hotel terms 3 Channel manager checks with hotel and confirms booking Cancellation Process 1 Traveler initiates a booking cancellation request on the website platform 2 Website platform may charge its customer (traveler) depending on terms 3 Channel manager informs hotel of the cancellation and may provide compensation Payment Process 1 Traveler pays at the hotel using any accepted payment method 2 Channel manager may charge its customer (hotel) for commission 3 Channel manager may reward BTU tokens to website platform Conclusion It is our belief that open source blockchain software and protocols along with token design supported by business strategy research and game theories can bring new solutions to a vast number of business issues We have applied these concepts and technologies in order to demonstrate how the current centralized internet booking services could be disrupted by creating a new technical protocol (BTU Protocol) and a specific token (BTU) We have explained how such a protocol could be leveraged by any developer on a first example use case the internet hotel booking industry Implementation of the BTU token would facilitate the creation of a more rational fairer and dynamic market there Other use cases could be implemented yachts car ski or apartment rentals medical appointments spa booking token booking computing resources reservation etc By providing a transparent inventory through an open source protocol the community would considerably lower the entry barriers for many internet booking providers ultimately benefiting consumers and service providers as well Decentralization is getting to a new level
