Ethereum technology and Smart Contracts Betting is a huge business but the online betting industry is plagued by multiple problems There is an overall perception of unfairness due to security issues lack of transparency and social character skewed odds high fees and low returns \xe2\x80\x93 all factors alienating many potential bettors or driving them to underground betting The Bethereum solution leverages Blockchain technology to ensure the safest and most transparent betting experience There is no middleman involved Players create the bets set the rules and provide the liquidity for fulfilling payouts Smart Contracts protect funds and automatically distribute winnings based on bet conditions and outcomes The entire process is fully decentralised secure and self regulating All this while unique social and gamification elements deliver a whole new level of community engagement But Bethereum is not just about better betting The platform has versatility and scalability ingrained in its DNA starting from sport betting it will expand to include a variety of content and third party games It is designed to support a whole ecosystem ranging from casual bettors to high rollers through white label customers and conventional betting agencies to third party developers and affiliates All fuelled by our digital token the Bether Our vision is to develop such ecosystem centered around a superior betting solution \xe2\x80\x93 and to establish the Bether token as a global betting standard To give you a taste of things to come we already have a functional iOS prototype on the App Store (Bethereum Lite) and a web based Blockchain powered betting contest at worldcup bethereum com Join us in this adventure today KEY TAKEAWAYS \xef\x82\xb7 All of us have at some point in our lives made a bet with somebody else \xef\x82\xb7 Betting was originally a social activity but it has lost its social nature \xef\x82\xb7 Conventional betting is highly centralised taking power away from players and placing it in the hands of bookmakers \xef\x82\xb7 By removing the middleman and leveraging Blockchain technology a whole new era of safe and transparent betting can be ushered \xef\x82\xb7 Bethereum is poised to reinvent online betting as a social activity \xef\x82\xb7 We aim to develop a broad ecosystem fuelled by our Bether digital token Keywords trustless betting

community responsibility Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 3 \x0cIntroduction Through its unique combination of risk excitement and potential financial gain betting has been blessed with everlasting appeal From the times of Roman gladiators to the rise of eSports players have wagered on the outcome of their favourite events The global betting and gambling market is worth a massive 3 trillion USD1 (80% of which underground) And as online and mobile channels continue to thrive the industry is poised to grow even further Nevertheless betting has always been plagued by a dark side Regular scandals involving malicious bookmakers and fraudulent agencies have seriously undermined the industry\xe2\x80\x99s reputation When bettors lose they lose everything And when they win they may not receive the promised amounts Furthermore exorbitant fees and unwarranted complexity discourage potential bettors from playing at all Somewhere along the lines betting went from being a social engaging activity to becoming an individual risk ridden peril Even in its fairest implementation traditional betting remains a highly centralised endeavour taking power away from the players and placing it in the hands of bookmakers Simply stated in the long run individuals inevitably lose all their funds against \xe2\x80\x9cthe House \xe2\x80\x9d We will bring the fun back in betting building an innovative decentralised transparent platform combining modern technology with a superior social experience By doing so we can reach segments with untapped market potential such as casual bettors overwhelmed by the complexity or trust issues of conventional betting solutions With all this in mind we created Bethereum a brand new Blockchain based platform designed to address the shortcomings of traditional betting and bring a host of innovative features Starting with sports players and group of friends bet against each other on match results instead of playing against odds designated by bookmakers Whatever the outcome of the bet money stays within these groups instead of going into a bookie\xe2\x80\x99s pocket Blockchain is the perfect technology to support this revolution in betting Within Bethereum transactions are secured by cryptography and governed by Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain All financial movements are recorded on the Blockchain and remain transparent and viewable for each participant We aim to become the leading social betting platform on the market But our vision does not stop there We believe there can be significant demand for a betting token catering to the needs of existing betting and gambling operators This is why we are creating Bether a unique token aimed at becoming a market standard for betting operators worldwide As market adoption rather than mere technical superiority will be conducive to fulfilling this vision we will work from day one to create the ecosystem required for widespread token acceptance This means Bethereum will always be an open platform designed for maximum versatility and scalability fully welcoming third party applications and service providers Sounds ambitious You bet But we have the team the vision and the passion to make this happen Read on to find out more 1 United Nations conference Doha 2015 as reported in \xe2\x80\x9cGlobal sports gambling worth up to $3 trillion\xe2\x80\x9d (http //www dailymail co uk/wires/afp/article 3040540/Global sports gambling worth 3 trillion html) Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 4 \x0cWhat is Bethereum and why Broadband and mobile connectivity literally put betting in the hands of millions But centralised conventional betting suffers from serious structural shortcomings (see \xe2\x80\x9cIndustry Challenges\xe2\x80\x9d section) The advent of Blockchain technology ushers in the opportunity to redefine the industry delivering a solution with all the advantages of conventional betting and none of the drawbacks At its core Bethereum is a social betting platform allowing people to bet on events with other players without going through a \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle man\xe2\x80\x9d (e g a bookie or betting provider) It operates as a fully Think of Bethereum as watching a football game with your decentralised secure solution built on Ethereum based friends and saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you Smart Contracts All bets are carried out using Bether \xc2\xa35 Chelsea wins tonight\xe2\x80\x9d and our purposefully designed digital token your friend from Manchester Bethereum is safe transparent provably fair and taking the bet Whether you simple to use It\xe2\x80\x99s this easy you create a bet on one or win or lose the money stays more events designating the minimum amount and between the two of you how winnings will be split Others join the bet (with their own event predictions) After the events end Smart Contracts automatically calculate the winnings and award Bether tokens based on the agreed split (e g winner takes all) Betting with Bethereum on the Blockchain Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 5 \x0cBut beyond the basic betting mechanics Bethereum will deliver a set of industry winning features and advantages (see \xe2\x80\x9cCore Benefits\xe2\x80\x9d section) including \xef\x82\xb7 Strong support for social and community building elements \xef\x82\xb7 High simplicity to bring in casual bettors but with advanced functionality for top gamblers and high rollers \xef\x82\xb7 Designed from the ground up to deliver viral uptake (minimising player acquisition cost) well beyond the standard friend get friend referral programs \xef\x82\xb7 Support for limitless rewards and massive bet wagers (High Roller Club) \xef\x82\xb7 Powerful gamification elements (aimed at higher player retention and engagement) \xef\x82\xb7 Privacy respect (planned support for self sovereign ID integration such as Civic) \xef\x82\xb7 Ready for AI based robotisation to improve user experience and platform profitability \xef\x82\xb7 Multi channel experience Web iOS Android (plus other platforms as market relevant) \xef\x82\xb7 Future proof and ready to include betting and gaming content well beyond sports \xef\x82\xb7 Designed for rapid ecosystem uptake (e g open source third party integration) \xef\x82\xb7 Built as modular technology components enabling offering of near turnkey white label solutions with low customisation cost \xef\x82\xb7 A custom solution delivering fast processing time at a lower cost and supported by our ERC 233 digital token (Bether) Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 6 \x0cMarket Opportunity The market potential for a superior social betting platform is absolutely massive Recent estimates place the global gambling and betting market at a value of up to 3 trillion USD 2 (both regulated and unregulated) Licensed gambling alone exceeds half a trillion USD As broadband and smartphone penetration keep rising the market is inexorably shifting from traditional to online channels The online betting industry is already worth nearly 50 billion USD with mobile based platforms experiencing explosive growth of over 40% per year Just in the European Union the average mobile gambling spend per adult went from 1 USD in 2010 to over 15 USD in 2017 Football (soccer) betting dominates the industry with an estimated 50% 60% share of total spend For this reason Bethereum will initially focus on football betting allowing us to scale our business and reach an operating profit as rapidly as possible However the platform will shortly after integrate additional sport and non sport betting content (e g horse racing basketball cricket eSports fantasy social events and possibly casino gaming) Thanks to our focus on simplicity and security we believe we will appeal to non gamblers as well the mass of casual bettors who has not yet dared to place an official bet intimidated by the complexity and lack of transparency of conventional betting solutions MASSIVE POTENTIAL AN D MARKET GROWTH $533

market situation http //www egba eu/media/Sports Betting Report FINAL pdf 3 Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 7 \x0cIndustry Challenges The online betting industry is afflicted by a number of serious problems Among other considerations odds are vastly in favour of the bookmaker payouts are not always honoured and regular winners are restricted or banned There is a lack of transparency and security high fees and low returns and low social involvement These factors alienate a significant number of potential bettors from taking part in such systems More specifically these are the key industry challenges Bethereum is set to solve UNFAIR CONDITIONS Over time the House always wins Odds are massively in favour of bookmakers Players who regularly beat such odds are banned When a bet has no winners the bookie \xe2\x80\x9ctakes it all \xe2\x80\x9d And bets where the bookmaker stands to make a large loss are sometimes cancelled In Bethereum all bets have a winner the money stays with players and we will always welcome winners LACK OF TRANSPARENCY Betting companies operate under a shade of secrecy not letting customers know how odds are created or how much money is poured in Some even manipulate odds after a game starts In Bethereum players set the odds and all transactions are visible on the Blockchain BETTING LIMITS AND LOW RETURNS Due to payout matching liability operators limit players on how much they can bet Faced with low limits and unattractive odds bettors often seek higher returns in underground betting We place no limits on odds and returns and plan a High Roller Club for truly massive bets LACK OF SOCIAL AND G AMING CHARACTER Bets have a strong social root but online betting is truly impersonal People bet against faceless bookmakers instead of playing with friends and colleagues It just does not feel like a game anymore Bethereum is a social communitydriven platform including powerful gamification elements INHERENT COMPLEXITY Successful bettors need to master a wealth of information odds spreads handicaps vigorish moneyline\xe2\x80\xa6the list is nearly as vast as the betting choices Complex registration and interfaces compound the problem This can be overwhelming to casual players Bethereum is designed for maximum simplicity and intuitiveness Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 8 \x0cSECURITY CONCERNS Casual bettors are more interested in security than regular gamblers The centralised nature of betting providers makes all bettors vulnerable to external and internal attacks putting players\xe2\x80\x99 funds and financial information at risk Bethereum\xe2\x80\x99s decentralised setup and Smart Contracts offer unmatched player protection OUTDATED PAYMENT METHODS AND SLOW PAYOUTS No more credit cards wire transfers deposits and other outdated payment systems No more delays in receiving payouts The Bether token will enable near instant bet participation and winning distribution HIGH FEES Most betting operators charge fees for everything even for depositing money Or hide fees within each transaction (e g adding a premium on exchange rates) Players will only be charged a small fee from their winnings in order to cover the cost of third party services Read more on the Bethereum solution and its unique advantages in the next sections Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 9 \x0cThe Bethereum Solution In a nutshell Bethereum addresses the most profound challenges of conventional betting by shifting power away from the betting provider and into the hands of the player community Players create the bets set the rules and provide the liquidity for fulfilling payouts The whole process is fully decentralised transparent and self regulating Blockchain technology makes it possible to operate the network without a middleman (the main source of structural issues and vulnerabilities in conventional systems) While Smart Contracts not only ensure that betting terms are respected and immune from manipulation but also protect player funds in an escrow account Only when a bet ends will such funds be released to the bet winner(s) All this automatically and seamlessly The Bethereum platform is comprised of three core components \xef\x82\xb7 BetherNet Protocol \xef\x82\xb7 Application Layer \xef\x82\xb7 Bether token KEY COMPONENTS OF TH E BETHEREUM SOLUTION BETHERNET PROTOCOL APPLICATION LAYER Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 BETHER TOKEN 10 \x0cBETHERNET PROTOCOL This is the Blockchain based engine powering our entire solution Including the Bethereum Wallet Smart Contracts and a set of tools it is the technology that enables transparent fair and secure betting The BetherNet Protocol meets all the requirements for supporting a successful betting network stability versatility scalability security performance and cost effectiveness APPLICATION LAYER Superior technology can only go so far The Application Layer is where the magic really happens This is the set of innovative in house and third party applications built on top of the BetherNet Protocol Offering full support for Web and mobile platforms all apps will be designed to be as intuitive and engaging as possible BETHER TOKEN Bether (BETHER) is the ERC 223 digital token fuelling Bethereum All transactions on the platform and most of the ecosystem payments would be carried out in Bether The Bether token is already trading on Coinbene a leading exchange and is fully compatible with most Ether wallets (e g MyEtherWallet) Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 11 \x0cBetherNet Protocol The Bethereum platform will be built across multiple systems such as web apps the Ethereum Blockchain and a backend The main function of the BetherNet Protocol is to ensure interoperability between all the platform\xe2\x80\x99s systems and components The BetherNet Protocol is what makes our solution so powerful also vis \xc3\xa0 vis the competition Comprised of the Bethereum Wallet and a set of tools and Smart Contracts this is the technology that enables transparent fair and secure betting on the platform Parts of the protocol such as the Bethereum Wallet and Smart Contracts will be opensourced to facilitate community usage and expansion We will also provide modified versions of the BetherNet Protocol to third parties as part of our business model COMPONENTS OF THE BETHERNET PROTOCOL DEVELOPER SDKS BETHEREUM WALLET ORACLE BETHER SERVICE TOKEN SMART CONTRACT BUILDER Developer SDKs The BetherNet Protocol is designed to support applications developed internally as well as by third party developers To facilitate the creation and deployment of third party applications we will release a software development kit (SDK) for multiple platforms such as web iOS and Android These SDKs will include a set of tools libraries guidelines and templates to allow external developers to easily integrate their applications on the Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 12 \x0cBethereum platform These SDKs will also significantly cut development times as developers will have to write minimum overhead code to communicate with components like Smart Contracts \xe2\x80\x93 these things will be handled within the SDK\xe2\x80\x99s libraries automatically The Bethereum Wallet In Bethereum players will not use Fiat money (such as EUR or USD) to enter bets They will use the Bether token instead As Smart Contracts do not support Fiat currencies creating our own token is necessary to ensure a truly secure and transparent betting platform Fully compliant with the ERC 20 standard and compatible with Ether wallets such as MyEtherWallet the Bether token will trade on selected crypto exchanges We will release an open source Bethereum Wallet app for iOS Android PC and Mac In addition to strong fund protection and other exclusive features the Bethereum Wallet will allow players to easily obtain Bether tokens as the app will be interlinked with third party exchanges via their APIs Smart Contracts Smart Contracts are essentially digital contracts When a certain condition is met (such as when all matches in a bet have ended) the code is automatically executed Once a Smart Contract is deployed its terms cannot be changed In Bethereum all bets are set up as Smart Contracts They specify parameters such as \xef\x82\xb7 the buy in amount for the bet \xef\x82\xb7 which matches or events are being bet on \xef\x82\xb7 how the winnings should be split once the bet is complete Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 13 \x0cSmart Contracts are crucial to prevent any kind of internal or external manipulation once they are deployed on the Blockchain there is no way for any party to change the terms and manipulate the bet Human error is also impossible After all matches have been played the winners are paid out instantly using transactions controlled by the Smart Contract Smart Contracts are the key instrument to keep all bets on the Bethereum platform secure and transparent as all bet data is permanently recorded on the Blockchain Graphical Smart Contract Builder We are planning to develop a graphical tool to build and configure Smart Contracts both for internal and external use (e g by third party developers) This will allow us to rapidly add new betting options to the Bethereum platform without incurring significant internal costs The tool will also enable us to onboard third party betting agencies and tailor the technology to their needs at a much faster pace Thanks to the Graphical Smart Contract Builder third party developers will be able to focus on the entertainment and monetisation aspects of their software rather than spending time on complicated Smart Contract coding and deployment Oracle Service An Oracle is an agent that finds and verifies real world occurrences and submits this information to a Blockchain This information will then be used by Smart Contracts for a variety of purposes On the Bethereum platform Oracles will feed results to our Smart Contracts so that we can evaluate bet outcomes To ensure result accuracy Oracles will aggregate and validate data for betting events from various sources Bet evaluation will only proceed if a given result can be verified across multiple sources If that is not the case the bet will be invalidated and funds returned to the bettors Third Party Business Development The BetherNet Protocol will be offered to third parties such as conventional betting agencies as part of our business model In the specific case of conventional betting agencies the transition to our solution would provide them with significant benefits including \xef\x82\xb7 decreased complexity of their betting platforms \xef\x82\xb7 the ability to provide instant payouts to their players \xef\x82\xb7 the highest possible level of security player protection and transparency Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 14 \x0cThe BetherNet Protocol can also automate many of the processes connected with conventional betting such as payment verification and validation Automation will lower human error dramatically and save money both in error induced losses and personal costs We also see tremendous opportunity for white labelling our platform providing other companies and betting operators with a flexible and powerful solution \xe2\x80\x93 tailored and rebranded to their needs Our unique modular architecture will enable us to offer turnkey implementations and complementary services with low customisation cost Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 15 \x0cBethereum Application Layer The Application Layer is comprised of all the betting and gaming applications accessible to players via the Bethereum platform We will support the most common Web based and mobile platforms including both iOS and Android operative systems The Application layer also includes all backend solutions and applications The Bethereum platform will feature both in house and externally developed applications built on top the BetherNet Protocol and fuelled by the Bether token This will ensure a wide variety of betting options for players while retaining the advantages of our powerful and secure technology We aim at delivering the most user friendly and engaging betting experience in the market Every internally developed application will need to adhere to very high quality and design standards We will also be very selective in the community and third party created applications which will be accepted in the program At the start the Application Layer will feature the Bethereum Social Betting app developed in house and built on top of the BetherNet Protocol Bethereum Social Betting App The Bethereum social betting app offers players an intuitive interface to bet on a variety of events It will be available for iOS Android and Web and include such features as \xef\x82\xb7 24/7 betting on a large set of sport teams \xef\x82\xb7 jackpot and time based events \xef\x82\xb7 built in player chat \xef\x82\xb7 unique social features (e g leaderboards group events achievements alliances) \xef\x82\xb7 betting on local teams \xef\x82\xb7 exclusive High Roller Club \xef\x82\xb7 detailed bet history and stats \xef\x82\xb7 secure wallet and withdrawal options \xef\x82\xb7 easy to navigate personalized experience \xef\x82\xb7 live score and news on favourite teams In order to reliably evaluate bet outcomes the Bethereum social betting app will also handle and compare data feeds from various sources These feeds will contain data such as \xef\x82\xb7 sport results \xef\x82\xb7 results of eSport and eGaming competitions \xef\x82\xb7 outcomes of social events such as general elections Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 16 \x0cTo illustrate the basic functionality of the Bethereum social betting app we made our iOS prototype available on the App Store (\xe2\x80\x9cBethereum Lite\xe2\x80\x9d) It includes a selection of sports and leagues and can be tested using a free virtual currency We truly care about community feedback and look forward to receiving suggestions A simple interactive demo is also available on our website Also check out our World Cup Betting Contest at worldcup bethereum com HOW IT WORKS 1 In just 3 clicks you can create a betor join an existing one 2 Easily set up the bet conditions Choose the bet amount how the winnings will be split and your favourite matches 3 Challenge friends who are immediately notified and can jump right in on the bet 4 Have fun as you watch the progress of your bet and get notified about winners group members and global rankings 5 After all bet events end the Smart Contract pays out the winners instantly The first iteration of the Bethereum social betting app supports football which is the most popular sport in online betting The selection of supported sports and events will be gradually expanded starting with mainstream sports such as basketball and ice hockey Externally Created Apps and Games The Bethereum platform will also feature selected betting apps and games created by the community or third party developers provided they are built on the BetherNet Protocol These apps and games will be reviewed by the Bethereum Team to ensure that the technology is used properly that players are protected by the underlying Smart Contracts and that the content and quality is of high standard All externally developed apps will also utilise the Bether token as the in app currency No matter what players want to bet on whether sport betting casino games or the presidential elections we will ensure that they can do it on the Bethereum platform using the Bether token and protected by the BetherNet Protocol Smart Contracts Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 17 \x0cBether Token Bether is the digital token powering nearly every aspect of the Bethereum solution It is the betting currency behind every platform transaction the financial reward paid to thirdparty developers for their games and the fuel enabling key processes on the platform Fully compatible with the ERC 20 standard Bether is an unmineable token designed to be easily transferable and storable in widely used Ether wallets such as MyEtherWallet or Mist \xe2\x80\x93 as well as in our own Bethereum Wallet Players will be able to obtain the token either directly via the Bethereum Wallet or on selected exchanges BETHER TOKEN UTILITY IN APP TOKEN All platform transactions will be carried out using the Bether token GLOBAL STANDARD The Bether token will be used by a variety of other betting platforms VALUE DISTRIBUTION Bether will be used to pay revenue share and commissions to third party developers and affiliates In App Token The Bether token will be used for all transactions in the betting process or to purchase upcoming optional services (e g AI powered betting predictions) It enables the use of Smart Contracts which are in turn crucial for platform security and transparency Players who didn\xe2\x80\x99t acquire the Bether token during the token sale will be able to obtain it on selected crypto exchanges or directly via the Bethereum Wallet Global Betting Token Our ultimate goal is to establish the Bether token as a global standard for betting In order to achieve this we will pursue a number of strategic initiatives aimed at developing a broad ecosystem and drive widespread Bether adoption B2C social betting will always be at the core of our market presence But we will also engage in strong B2B push partnering with strategic industry players white labelling our solution and offering our technology to conventional betting agencies and other relevant operators Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 18 \x0cValue Distribution Grossly speaking the value of a digital token (or any finite asset) is driven by the laws of supply and demand The greater the demand and the lower the supply the higher the value We created a token with solid network utility and a vast number of use cases Demand for Bether will grow as the number of players increase and more businesses and operators join the ecosystem The Bether token will also be used to compensate third party developers for the games they integrate in our platform and even to pay commissions to selected partners and marketing affiliates Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 19 \x0cCore Benefits We do not plan to be the first and only Blockchain based betting platform but we will deliver a set of benefits and features that can truly set us apart from the competition including uniquely disruptive innovations such as our High Roller Club or local event betting These are the key competitive advantages of our solution and why players would choose Bethereum over conventional operators or other solutions in the crypto space SIMPLICITY Everything is kept as simple and intuitive as possible there are no complicated odds or conditions The interface is designed to be easy to understand also for non gamblers and casual bettors EASY ACCOUNT CREATION Super simple registration Planned support for private single click signups with self sovereign technology GAMIFICATION ELEMENT S Users can compete with friends through

the winnings No manual intervention means no possible human error or tampering TRANSPARENCY Smart Contracts ensure there is no chance to manipulate bets Transactions are permanently recorded on the Blockchain and viewable by all involved parties FUNDS UNDER CONTROL In conventional systems players need to deposit money into the bookmaker\xe2\x80\x99s account and withdraw it when winning Say goodbye to outdated payment systems and forward deposits In Bethereum people keep control of their funds and can play directly from their crypto wallet Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 20 \x0cINSTANT PAYOUTS No more lengthy delays or waiting for wire transfers to arrive Smart Contracts instantly distribute winnings and payouts are usually processed within the Ethereum network in less than a minute UNLIMITED WINNINGS There is no limit to the amount of bettors Catch an unusual result on a popular bet and you may be getting your retirement fund from a few dollars Large public groups for events such as the World Cup will pool thousands of players offering rewards that are well beyond standard betting odds WINNERS WELCOME POLICY Successful bettors are often limited or banned by conventional bookmakers Our business model is built on volumes rather than margins which means we will always welcome winners NO HIDDEN FEES No withdrawal or transaction fees No fees hidden into skewed odds No

Solution for the Whole Ecosystem The development of a broad Bethereum centered ecosystem is of crucial importance for fulfilling our vision The Bethereum platform is therefore designed to cater to the needs of a wide variety of parties Below are some examples of common use cases CASUAL BETTORS A safe and engaging experience makes betting accessible to a whole new audience the non gamblers intimidated by the complexity and lack of trust of conventional solutions From office pools on local teams to social competitions everything is fully secure and intuitive HIGH ROLLERS No conventional centralised solution can risk accepting massive bets turning high rollers to underground betting Bethereum\xe2\x80\x99s decentralised peer to peer platform allows unlimited wagers for high rollers Why risk millions underground when betting can be done safely and legally via Bethereum WHITE LABEL CUSTOMERS Companies and gaming operators will be able to set up their betting platform in no time by licensing rebranded versions of our technology Our modular technology architecture allows us to offer near turnkey solutions and complementary services at a low customisation cost CONVENTIONAL BETTING AGENCIES Bethereum is ideally positioned to solve the key issues of traditional operators Transitioning to our solution will deliver lower cost (in servers personnel fraud or human error) greater security instant payouts and new revenue streams GAME AND APP DEVELOPERS Bethereum will integrate selected games and apps by third party developers Players will enjoy more content while developers benefit from reaching a global audience and earning Bether commissions through our platform AFFILIATES Bethereum will encourage player acquisition by reputable affiliates via a generous Bether based commission scheme Smart Contracts will ensure instant and transparent payments This will further increase Bether adoption and value Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 22 \x0cThe Gamification Advantage \xe2\x80\x9cA soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of coloured ribbon\xe2\x80\x9d (Napoleon Bonaparte 1815) Gamification is the application of game design principles and techniques to non gaming contexts Conventional betting operators have generally disregarded this aspect dismissing such features as achievements and leaderboards as trivial videogame fanfare And yet plenty of research and empirical evidence shows that gamification plays an essential role in driving player engagement satisfaction and loyalty 4 Mobile game developers in particular have long embraced and honed many mechanisms aimed at tapping straight into players\xe2\x80\x99 natural desires for achievement competition status social belonging and recognition and cooperation The 2 2 billion mobile players out there are quite used to gamification and social sharing from the games they play on a daily basis But all that online betting operators are offering to this \xe2\x80\x9cmobile collective\xe2\x80\x9d is a functional dry and impersonal experience void of entertainment and social engagement We believe gamification is an absolutely critical source of competitive advantage in the online betting space Bethereum will therefore make extensive use of individually and socially oriented game design techniques to deliver the most engaging and rewarding betting experience in the industry In Bethereum players will be rewarded with badges and Bether prizes for completing achievements They will advance in rank as they accomplish tasks and \xe2\x80\x9cmissions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 in turn boosting their status and account privileges They will create communities and make friends sharing achievements and challenging others on time based competitions and special events A number of leaderboards will track and display the rank of players and their alliances While chat functionality will bring together the player community in a way no other betting application has ever done before Gamification will turn betting from a money driven pastime into a truly social gratifying experience And this will have important repercussions on platform KPIs resulting in \xef\x82\xb7 Lower player acquisition cost thanks to greater referral based organic growth \xef\x82\xb7 Higher retention driven by increased player loyalty and engagement \xef\x82\xb7 Higher monetisation as players compete to advance in rank and complete achievements \xef\x82\xb7 Higher in app time there is always something to do (e g with \xe2\x80\x9cdaily missions\xe2\x80\x9d) \xef\x82\xb7 Greater satisfaction from the many gaming features rewards and personalisation options (e g avatars and custom skins) 4 For example \xe2\x80\x9cHow gamification motivates An experimental study of the effects of specific game design elements on psychological need satisfaction\xe2\x80\x9d (Elsevier 2017) https //doi org/10 1016/j chb 2016 12 033 Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 23 \x0cWe have extensive knowledge of gamer classification and drivers and will leverage this know how to bring truly innovative features in betting As a simple illustration based on Bartle player taxonomy 5 here are some examples on how we\xe2\x80\x99d appeal to each player type ACHIEVERS Achievers love a challenge They want to win and share their successes with everyone expecting praise from the Socialisers and envy from the Killers To appeal to them we will implement a number of competitive features including various leaderboards (e g country global alliance friends) publically displayed profile badges elite progress rank levels uniquely challenging achievements and time based individual and alliance competitions Victory sharing and feedback channels (\xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d chat) will also be in place Winners should always be publically celebrated which is of vital importance to Achievers EXPLORERS Explorers are often lone wolves Naturally curious people they prefer the process of playing rather than the result They are excited by the opportunity to map uncharted territories turning every stone and discovering every secret For Explorers it is important to create a storyline which takes them through a journey full of twists and turns Progress based functionality unlocking increasing level of information \xe2\x80\x9cquests\xe2\x80\x9d to discover new betting possibilities collectible sets of reward badges and even Easter eggs These are all elements that can keep Explorers engaged long term Explorers are also attracted by the possibility of curating content for others Functionality to post feedback and reviews is therefore very important to them SOCIALISERS Socialisers may enjoy the community and sharing aspect of a game more than the game itself They will seek a group to join share their opinions and congratulate others on their successes \xe2\x80\x93 the reward being a sense of belonging and collective approval Features important to Socialisers include chat channels alliances and interest groups community awards and the possibility of posting public recommendations or sharing comments tips or subjects of interest 5 Albeit overly simplistic and not entirely flawless one of the most practical player classification schemes in existence \xe2\x80\x9cHearts Clubs Diamonds Spades Players who Suit MUDs\xe2\x80\x9d (Richard Bartle 1996) Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 24 \x0cKILLERS Killers are not a pleasant bunch Their satisfaction comes from winning at all costs and disrupting the game for everybody else They will use every cheat and exploit every hack to get ahead of others often harassing the competition The job with Killers is about containing them more than anything else so they don\xe2\x80\x99t ruin the game for others Killers get bored if there is no reaction to their attacks so scripts checking for inappropriate behaviour and player report mechanisms can be used to identify them and isolate them (e g by hiding them from other players\xe2\x80\x99 chat and leaderboards) Anti cheat systems chat profanity filters and admin banning solutions are also a must to cope with Killers M E D A LS E X A MP LE S BRONZE Win 10 bets SILVER Win 25 bets GOLD Win 100 bets C U P S E X A MP

2018 \xc2\xa9 26 \x0cToken Sale A token sale is an innovative fundraising method based on Blockchain technology Our token sale and the corresponding token creation process is covered by Bethereum Ltd a company based in Hong Kong For maximum transparency and participant protection the sale is regulated by a Smart Contract deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain During the token sale Bether tokens will be available in return for Ether (ETH) contributions To obtain Bether tokens contributors will send Ether to the official Bethereum token sale Smart Contract address Bether tokens will be automatically sent to the contributors\xe2\x80\x99 wallet address as soon as the purchase is confirmed Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 27 \x0cToken Distribution The total token supply (1 billion BETHER tokens) will be distributed as shown in the diagram below \xe2\x80\x9cToken sale costs\xe2\x80\x9d include commissions and fees paid to marketing and promotional partners As previously stated the token supply will be fixed at the time of the token sale (token generation event) and no further token creation will be possible afterwards Token Sale Costs Token Sale 5% 60% Team and Advisors 20% 12% Long Term Budget 3% Bounty Vesting Tokens allocated to the Long Term Budget will vest over the period of 400 days releasing 25% of the Budget every 100 days These tokens may be primarily used to finance incentive schemes for new employees or attractive extra budgetary opportunities Tokens distributed to core team members will also be subject to vesting in 20% increments over a period of 72 weeks commencing at the end of the token sale Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 28 \x0cToken Sale Proceed Allocation Bethereum warrants that it will not purchase Bether tokens in its own token sale We are committed to building a superior betting platform and a successful trustworthy company Accordingly we will invest all proceeds from the token sale into strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve this objective Most of the funds raised will be used to develop the platform and market it to end users (players and relevant businesses) Development 25% Operations 20% 40% 8% Marketing 7% Partnerships Legal Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 29 \x0cBusiness Model Our business model is based on the following revenue streams \xef\x82\xb7 fees and commissions from the Bethereum platform(e g sponsored groups and bets inapp purchases for special services High Roller Club) \xef\x82\xb7 commissions from partners adopting the BetherNet Protocol \xef\x82\xb7 fees for white label solutions \xef\x82\xb7 revenue share from third party developers Effectively we will generate returns not only from the Bethereum platform but also from the underlying technology This ample revenue stream diversification is not only likely to result in better financial performance but also bears lower operational risk Business Plan core metrics The financial projections that appear in this Business Plan are based on estimated revenues expenses planned marketing spend and other metrics such as expected user acquisition cost retention and ARPU They constitute Bethereum s best estimates as of this time and are provided in good faith However in no way should these projected financial statements be considered as a forecast of future results As such these projections should not be used to reach any conclusion on Bethereum s future financial performance Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 30 \x0cTechnical Overview The Bethereum platform will be developed as a state of the art solution in terms of security scalability versatility stability and betting engine accuracy Its modular architecture will enable a smooth implementation of new features and integration of third party solutions The following section discusses various technical considerations and sheds some light on the most important processes and components in the platform Prototype and Target Solution Our current prototype solution consists of two core components 1 The backend built on the Parse Platform Node js framework hosted on Heroku and including \xef\x82\xb7 A MongoDB hosted by mLab storing the majority of user and bet data \xef\x82\xb7 CloudAMQP for communication between instances \xef\x82\xb7 Redis for fast database operations \xef\x82\xb7 A Postgres Database to store sport data feed 2 A frontend iOS application written in Objective C utilising numerous frameworks such as the Parse Platform and Facebook SDK While this approach for the backend offered the path of least resistance for a fully working prototype and is scalable up to a few million users this is not an optimal solution for a project of the scale of Bethereum The backend will be rewritten utilising the flexibility processing power and scalability of cloud computing solutions such as the Google Compute Engine or Amazon Web Services and their respective toolkits The frontend iOS application will be extended to integrate new features and redesigned to further optimise the player experience It will support the new backend and Smart Contracts as the current version uses virtual transactions to simulate the use of the Bether token The frontend Android and Web applications will be rewritten together with the new Bethereum backend using the latest development technologies and standards Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 31 \x0cBetting Process Overview To provide users with the best balance of user experience and security we will offer two options to setup their wallets during account creation 1 Default (good security fast setup) We generate a wallet for the user encrypting the private key using the login credentials inaccessible to us or any third party 2 Optional (top security slower setup) The user generates the wallet using the opensource Bethereum Wallet app saving the private key locally and backing up the mnemonic phrase for wallet recovery Users will be able to create new bets free of charge Smart Contract deployment will be paid by Bethereum To forgo abuse a fair usage policy will be put in place To enter a bet a user needs to input predictions for selected events (e g football matches) At that point a transaction containing the user\xe2\x80\x99s buy in funds and predictions is sent to the address of the bet Smart Contract If the user opted for a self generated wallet the transaction will need to be confirmed using the Bethereum Wallet app At a certain time before the start of the first bet event the bet Smart Contract will no longer receive new predictions and will send back all funds received past this time After the last bet event has ended the Smart Contract will request the actual results for all bet events from an Oracle (see next section) To determine the winners a point based score is computed for all players who took part in the bet Funds are then automatically distributed to the wallet addresses of the winners according to the predetermined bet reward conditions (e g winner takes all) For more information see the betting process diagrams on the following pages Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 32 \x0cBetting Process without the Bethereum Wallet The Bethereum 2018 \xc2\xa9 33
