surge in altcoin issuance \xe2\x80\x93 particularly Bitcoin hard forks \xe2\x80\x93 our Europe based development team decided to try something different For one we viewed hard forks for the most part as Bitcoin clones that would be difficult to discern from the real thing Second after the first two Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold none had been supported by major exchanges or wallets \xe2\x80\x93 making them nearly impossible to acquire let alone safely Lastly in a world where hundreds of new altcoins were emerging it was becoming clear that without a viable long term use case \xe2\x80\x93 that could be convincingly communicated to investors \xe2\x80\x93 the odds of significant price appreciation were extremely low First we considered what other altcoins were doing \xe2\x80\x93 and then what Bitcoin couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do given its ability to subsume nearly all vital crypto asset functions Which is when we came up with the idea of \xe2\x80\x9cultra Bitcoin scarcity\xe2\x80\x9d i e a coin with all of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s best features and a lifetime cap of just 2 1 million or one tenth of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s of which roughly half would trade upon launch with the other half to be mined by the public over the next 100 years Additionally we added a privacy feature in our quest to create a crypto asset that would cater to large long term holders Next we determined that the best way to build community was to distribute our coin Bitcoin Rhodium \xe2\x80\x93 named for the relatively unknown and by far scarcest Precious Metal \xe2\x80\x93 via an \xe2\x80\x9cairdrop\xe2\x80\x9d to existing Bitcoin holders By airdrop we mean that unlike hard forks there is no requirement for a third party to split and/or store the coin Instead proactive Bitcoin holders could claim BTR by \xe2\x80\x9cregistering\xe2\x80\x9d non zero balance public Bitcoin addresses from online and offline wallets in which they held their own private keys \xe2\x80\x93 like online Electrums or offline Trezors and Ledgers By \xe2\x80\x9csigning\xe2\x80\x9d the unique message supplied by Bitcoin Rhodium one could \x0cprove Bitcoin ownership without giving out their private keys thus enabling the receipt of FREE Bitcoin Rhodium in the subsequent claiming process in one\xe2\x80\x99s personal online Bitcoin Rhodium wallet Finally we aimed to create a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity\xe2\x80\x9d to foster long term support through the Discord chat room that we the development team actively monitor in a de facto \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer service\xe2\x80\x9d function \xe2\x80\x93 particularly during the airdrop process which started in December and will end March 31st Through Discord Twitter and Reddit we believe awareness of Bitcoin Rhodium\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cultra Bitcoin scarcity\xe2\x80\x9d use case has increased to the point that we expect the launch currently scheduled for late summer to be met with significant investor enthusiasm Ultimately in the words of one of the project\xe2\x80\x99s most well known public supporters we hope Bitcoin Rhodium will be viewed as \xe2\x80\x9cElite Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x9d to be BRODL\xe2\x80\x99ed as passionately as Bitcoin is HODL\xe2\x80\x99ed October 22 2018 Bitcoin Rhodium\xe2\x80\x99s development team announced that after a year of exhaustive work the Bitcoin Rhodium (BTR) MainNet was launched this weekend \x0cUser Cases The Crypto Trinity Bitcoin Rhodium was introduced to a market environment that lacked the appeal for investors looking for a long term investment in crypto securities Ever since BTR has met every objective to effectively fulfil this role one that no single cryptocurrency has managed to subsume so far BTR\xe2\x80\x99s inherent qualities naturally discern it from the plethora of altcoins available on the market that lack any viable use case But more importantly they are the bases to a natural convergence with Bitcoin and Litecoin The three coins (BTR BTC LTC) form an efficient ecosystem that can facilitate users/investors with different needs and preferences Where LTC has traditionally provided its users with primarily transactional properties and BTC still fails to find its appeal for traditional investors BTR emerges as the natural complement to meet the demand for long term security investments investment diversification a coin that is tightly held and transparent towards its users For these reasons BTR represents the final piece of the puzzle the Crypto Trinity whose efficient co existence satisfies the complete spectrum of investors and their diverse needs \x0cStrong hands programme Hold & Get Rewarded Bitcoin Rhodium is introducing a new feature that will reinforce its use case reward proactive holders and stimulate new investment Through Strong hands programme you can earn a reward of between 0 5% and 30% on your BTR holdings every year Strong hands and exit aversion two qualities that set BTR investors apart from the rest Reinforce your position
