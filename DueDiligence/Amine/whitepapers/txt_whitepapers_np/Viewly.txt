 EXECUTIVE 
 SUMMARY 
 
 
 Some 
 of 
 the 
 greatest 
 achievements 
 in 
 the 
 arts 
 and 
 science 
 of 
 human 
 history 
 were 
 made 
 possible 
 by 
 the 
 patronage 
 of 
 wealthy 
 institutions 
 and 
 families 
 Nowadays 
 cultural 
 expression 
 has 
 shifted 
 to 
 digital 
 content 
 distributed 
 on 
 the 
 web 
 The 
 majority 
 of 
 web 
 content 
 platforms 
 are 
 using 
 an 
 advertising based 
 revenue 
 model 
 which 
 makes 
 creators 
 dependent 
 on 
 advertising 
 dollars 
 controlled 
 by 
 a 
 few 
 large 
 corporations 
 One 
 such 
 platform 
 is 
 YouTube 
 a 
 monopolist 
 among 
 web 
 video 
 platforms 
 
 
 Centralized 
 and 
 advertising based 
 platforms 
 have 
 total 
 control 
 and 
 put 
 maximization 
 of 
 ad 
 revenue 
 above 
 everything 
 else 
 Unfortunately 
 this 
 is 
 not 
 in 
 the 
 best 
 interest 
 of 
 all 
 other 
 parties 
 and 
 leads 
 to 
 the 
 following 
 problems 
 viewers 
 are 
 bombarded 
 with 
 ads 
 and 
 manipulated 
 into 
 fast 
 content 
 consumption 
 and 
 creators 
 receive 
 only 
 a 
 fraction 
 of 
 revenue 
 from 
 value 
 they 
 create 
 Struggling 
 to 
 sustain 
 on 
 ad 
 revenue 
 alone 
 creators 
 are 
 pushed 
 into 
 mass consumer 
 market 
 They 
 have 
 few 
 opportunities 
 to 
 engage 
 with 
 fans 
 and 
 grow 
 their 
 community 
 when 
 binge 
 consumption 
 is 
 inherently 
 promoted 
 Furthermore 
 advertising 
 businesses 
 lose 
 out 
 due 
 to 
 inefficiencies 
 in 
 reach 
 and 
 rampant 
 ad 
 fraud 
 
 
 The 
 ad based 
 business 
 model 
 exhibits 
 inherently 
 misaligned 
 incentives 
 between 
 viewers 
 creators 
 and 
 advertisers 
 It 
 disproportionately 
 profits 
 the 
 middlemen 
 and 
 it 
 is 
 the 
 source 
 of 
 problems 
 described 
 above 
 Even 
 incumbent 
 platforms 
 arent 
 motivated 
 to 
 fix 
 it 
 as 
 it 
 would 
 directly 
 undercut 
 their 
 revenues 
 
 
 
 We 
 believe 
 that 
 there 
 is 
 a 
 better 
 way 
 to 
 monetize 
 content 
 and 
 promote 
 content 
 creators 
 
 
 Thats 
 why 
 we 
 are 
 building 
 Viewly 
 a 
 social 
 video 
 platform 
 
 
 
 Without 
 pesky 
 ads 
 where 
 users 
 privacy 
 is 
 respected 
 
 Where 
 communities 
 thrive 
 and 
 engagement 
 between 
 fans 
 and 
 creators 
 is 
 highly 
 encouraged 
 
 Where 
 creators 
 with 
 small 
 medium 
 or 
 large sized 
 audiences 
 can 
 sustain 
 themselves 
 through 
 modern 
 monetisation 
 a 
 combination 
 of 
 frictionless 
 micro payments 
 fan 
 patronage 
 sponsored 
 endorsements 
 and 
 commerce 
 
 Where 
 businesses 
 can 
 improve 
 advertising 
 efficiency 
 and 
 lower 
 costs 
 by 
 skipping 
 the 
 middlemen 
 and 
 sponsoring 
 creators 
 and 
 supporting 
 their 
 communities 
 directly 
 Viewly 
 is 
 a 
 decentralized 
 video 
 platform 
 powered 
 by 
 blockchain 
 and 
 peer to peer 
 video 
 sharing 
 technologies 
 Run

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 Viewly 
 is 
 a 
 next 
 generation 
 video 
 platform 
 leveraging 
 new 
 technology 
 for 
 a 
 design 
 that 
 better 
 serves 
 both 
 viewers 
 and 
 creators 
 
 
 The 
 history 
 of 
 cultural 
 creation 
 and 
 its 
 reward 
 has 
 seen 
 phase 
 shifts 
 which 
 ingeniously 
 solve 
 problems 
 of 
 the 
 past 
 while 
 creating 
 new 
 ones 
 In 
 the 
 mid 19th 
 century 
 commissions 
 for 
 both 
 artistic 
 and 
 scientific 
 works 
 began 
 to 
 shift 
 from 
 the 
 old 
 patronage 
 model 
 which 
 had 
 arisen 
 in 
 aristocratic 
 societies 
 While 
 patronage 
 funded 
 many 
 great 
 works 
 which 
 still 
 stand 
 the 
 test 
 of 
 time 
 the 
 opportunity 
 to 
 shape 
 the 
 culture 
 remained 
 only 
 in 
 the 
 hands 
 of 
 a 
 wealthy 
 few 
 
 
 The 
 shift 
 into 
 the 
 mass 
 consumer 
 age 
 effectively 
 diffused 
 patronage 
 across 
 society 
 to 
 all 
 with 
 even 
 a 
 little 
 disposable 
 income 
 Cultural 
 consumption 
 became 
 focused 
 upon 
 the 
 novel 
 theater 
 cinema 
 television 
 and 
 today 
 the 
 Internet 
 This 
 heralded 
 a 
 great 
 democratization 
 of 
 culture 
 and 
 a 
 shift 
 of 
 values 
 However 
 it 
 can 
 be 
 argued 
 that 
 the 
 power 
 of 
 the 
 mass 
 market 
 came 
 at 
 a 
 price 
 
 
 The 
 patronage 
 model 
 funded 
 some 
 of 
 the 
 finest 
 works 
 of 
 art 
 literature 
 and 
 scientific 
 discovery 
 in 
 human 
 history 
 by 
 liberating 
 creators 
 to 
 produce 
 great 
 work 
 where 
 lofty 
 endeavors 
 could 
 soar 
 without 
 commercial 
 pressures 
 and 
 corrupting 
 enticements 
 The 
 new 
 commercial 
 age 
 it 
 can 
 be 
 argued 
 brought 
 a 
 crass 
 commercialism 
 the 
 triumph 
 of 
 pop 
 culture 
 and 
 a 
 dependence 
 on 
 advertising 
 that 
 could 
 often 
 shackle 
 and 
 drown 
 out 
 the 
 artists 
 message 
 
 
 The 
 modern 
 online 
 digital 
 era 
 has 
 brought 
 a 
 new 
 proliferation 
 of 
 free 
 content 
 and 
 the 
 largest 
 audiences 
 in 
 history 
 However 
 we 
 should 
 here 
 remember 
 the 
 old 
 adage 
 If 
 youre 
 not 
 paying 
 youre 
 whats 
 being 
 sold 
 Revenue 
 generated 
 by 
 digital 
 content 
 creators 
 is 
 for 
 the 
 most 
 part 
 dependent 
 on 
 advertising 
 dollars 
 and 
 controlled 
 by 
 a 
 few 
 large 
 enterprises 
 Web 
 users 
 have 
 become 
 accustomed 
 to 
 ad supported 
 sites 
 and 
 services 
 which 
 increasingly 
 comes 
 with 
 the 
 surrendering 
 of 
 personal 
 data 
 This 
 helps 
 large 
 networks 
 profile 
 users 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 serve 
 them 
 more 
 relevant 
 ads 
 as 
 determined 
 by 
 advertisers 
 
 
 Google 
 YouTube 
 and 
 Facebook 
 the 
 three 
 most 
 popular 
 websites 
 in 
 the 
 world 
 all 
 rely 
 upon 
 this 
 ad based 
 business 
 model 
 
 
 
 There 
 is 
 a 
 growing 
 awareness 
 and 
 dissatisfaction 
 with 
 the 
 flaws 
 inherent 
 in 
 the 
 ad based 
 model 
 
 
 
 the 
 model 
 increasingly 
 results 
 in 
 the 
 bombarding 
 of 
 viewers 
 with 
 ads 
 
 viewers 
 are 
 manipulated 
 into 
 fast 
 content 
 consumption 
 
 creators 
 receive 
 only 
 a 
 fraction 
 of 
 revenue 
 from 
 the 
 value 
 they 
 create 
 
 advertisers 
 also 
 lose 
 due 
 to 
 inefficiencies 
 in 
 reach 
 and 
 ad fraud

 Problems 
 with 
 present 
 platforms 
 
 
 
 Demonetization and creator exploitation 
 
 
 Most 
 creators 
 struggle 
 to 
 build 
 and 
 sustain 
 sufficient 
 ad 
 revenue 
 receiving 
 only 
 a 
 small 
 portion 
 of 
 the 
 value 
 they 
 create 
 Additionally 
 even 
 if 
 they 
 do 
 manage 
 to 
 build 
 a 
 significant 
 following 
 creators 
 remain 
 forever 
 at 
 the 
 mercy 
 of 
 the 
 platform 
 on 
 which 
 their 
 work 
 is 
 hosted 
 which 
 can 
 demonetize 
 their 
 content 
 overnight 
 due 
 to 
 wholly 
 arbitrary 
 decisions 
 Suddenly 
 creators 
 can 
 find 
 their 
 income 
 slashed 
 or 
 eradicated 
 
 
 YouTube 
 recently 
 (Jan 
 2018) 
 changed 
 their 
 eligibility 
 thresholds 
 for 
 monetization 
 giving 
 affected 
 channels 
 just 
 30 
 days 
 to 
 surpass 
 the 
 new 
 levels 
 or 
 be 
 demonetized 
 Under 
 the 
 new 
 rules 
 only 
 channels 
 with 
 more 
 than 
 4 000 
 hours 
 of 
 watchtime 
 within 
 the 
 past 
 12 
 months 
 and 
 more 
 than 
 1 000 
 subscribers 
 are 
 eligible 
 for 
 monetization 
 
 
 Viewly 
 takes 
 only 
 a 
 symbolic 
 cut 
 from 
 creator 
 earnings 
 and 
 does 
 not 
 demonetize 
 
 
 
 Pesky ads 
 
 
 Nobody 
 really 
 likes 
 watching 
 ads 
 Their 
 production 
 has 
 become 
 a 
 fine 
 art 
 in 
 itself 
 just 
 to 
 catch 
 our 
 attention 
 But 
 where 
 theres 
 a 
 choice 
 audiences 
 will 
 skip 
 them 
 Ad based 
 platforms 
 distract 
 us 
 and 
 promote 
 binge 
 watching 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 increase 
 their 
 revenue 
 Viewer 
 experience 
 and 
 privacy 
 are 
 compromised 
 for 
 the 
 sake 
 of 
 the 
 platforms 
 ad based 
 model 
 
 
 There 
 are 
 no 
 official 
 stats 
 on 
 click through 
 rates 
 (CTR) 
 of 
 video 
 ads 
 on 
 platforms 
 such 
 as 
 YouTube 
 but 
 estimates 
 range 
 from 
 just 
 1 
 to 
 3% 
 [26] 
 This 
 is 
 an 
 extremely 
 high 
 price 
 to 
 pay 
 by 
 viewers 
 as 
 a 
 whole 
 
 
 Viewly 
 doesnt 
 serve 
 ads 
 Viewly 
 aims 
 to 
 be 
 ad 
 free 
 removing 
 incentives 
 to 
 track 
 users 
 and 
 manipulate 
 attention 
 Instead 
 meaningful 
 engagement 
 and 
 community 
 building 
 between 
 creators 
 and 
 fans 
 is 
 facilitated 
 
 
 
 Expensive content delivery 
 
 
 The 
 primary 
 cost 
 of 
 present 
 video 
 platforms 
 is 
 global 
 content 
 delivery 
 which 
 is 
 unfairly 
 passed 
 on 
 to 
 creators 
 Under 
 this 
 model 
 creators 
 pay 
 hosting 
 and 
 storage 
 for 
 all 
 the 
 content 
 including 
 content 
 not 
 creating 
 value 
 
 
 This 
 model 
 of 
 centralized 
 repositories 
 for 
 content 
 now 
 seems 
 outdated 
 in 
 an 
 increasingly 
 decentralized 
 and 
 networked 
 world 
 
 
 
 Viewly 
 not 
 only 
 reduces 
 cost 
 of 
 video 
 delivery 
 by 
 using 
 a 
 peer to peer 
 content 
 delivery 
 network 
 but 
 also 
 enables 
 users 
 to 
 earn 
 VIEW 
 tokens 
 by 
 leveraging 
 their 
 redundant 
 resources 
 and 
 hosting 
 videos 
 
 
 
 Advertising revenue above everything else 
 
 
 Under 
 the 
 present 
 system 
 great 
 ingenuity 
 has 
 been 
 set 
 to 
 work 
 to 
 develop 
 machine 
 learning 
 algorithms 
 to 
 manipulate 
 audience 
 attention 
 and 
 maximize 
 ad 
 revenues 
 While 
 advertising 
 revenue 
 is 
 optimized 
 viewing 
 experience 
 is 
 sacrificed 
 Click 
 bait 
 is 
 employed 
 to 
 manipulate 
 the 
 audience 
 into 
 consuming 
 more 
 content 
 than 
 their 
 natural 
 interest 
 would 
 dictate 
 so 
 as 
 more 
 ads 
 can 
 be 
 consumed 
 This 
 engenders 
 a 
 pressure 
 upon 
 content 
 creation 
 to 
 appeal 
 to 
 lowest 
 common 
 denominator 
 interests 
 that 
 capture 
 the 
 most 
 attention 
 
 
 There 
 is 
 less 
 opportunity 
 for 
 deeper 
 discovery 
 community 
 building 
 and 
 bonding 
 with 
 the 
 audience 
 
 
 Viewers 
 are 
 being 
 pushed 
 around 
 and 
 force fed 
 content 
 to 
 be 
 quickly 
 consumed 
 Binge 
 content 
 consumption 
 is 
 promoted 
 and 
 quality 
 content 
 creators 
 are 
 treated 
 as 
 a 
 commodity 
 
 
 Viewly 
 monetizes 
 without 
 advertising 
 in 
 a 
 way 
 synchronized 
 with 
 the 
 interests 
 of 
 content 
 creators 
 and 
 their 
 viewers 
 
 however 
 diverse 
 for 
 audiences 
 of 
 any 
 size 
 We 
 use 
 nuanced 
 machine 
 learning 
 that 
 caters 
 to 
 the 
 true 
 interests 
 of 
 viewers 
 
 
 
 Poor engagement between creators and fans 
 
 
 As 
 already 
 mentioned 
 the 
 drive 
 to 
 maximize 
 ad revenue 
 comes 
 at 
 a 
 great 
 cost 
 One 
 method 
 of 
 dumbing 
 down 
 of 
 content 
 occurs 
 via 
 the 
 exploitation 
 of 
 the 
 dopamine 
 reward 
 circuit 
 of 
 the 
 human 
 brain 
 The 
 fast 
 delivery 
 of 
 diverse 
 novelty 
 triggers 
 dopamine 
 release 
 which 
 increases 
 total 
 time 
 spent 
 on 
 the 
 platform 
 and 
 ultimately 
 ad 
 impressions 
 and 
 clicks 
 
 
 Such 
 platforms 
 employ 
 devious 
 ingenuity 
 to 
 effectively 
 hack 
 human 
 vulnerability 
 and 
 keep 
 attention 
 locked 
 in 
 for 
 as 
 long 
 as 
 possible 
 We 
 are 
 now 
 learning 
 of 
 the 
 personal 
 and 
 social 
 cost 
 of 
 this 
 kidnapping 
 of 
 attention 
 Users 
 are 
 complaining 
 of 
 growing 
 dissatisfaction 
 in 
 hand 
 with 
 social 
 media 
 addiction 
 they 
 nevertheless 
 cannot 
 break 
 Engineers 
 who 
 designed 
 these 
 mechanisms 
 are 
 breaking 
 rank 
 to 
 regretfully 
 speak 
 of 
 designing 
 such 
 exploitative 
 systems 
 For 
 creators 
 with 
 a 
 broader 
 scope 
 of 
 ambition 
 such 
 methods 
 are 
 also 
 a 
 poor 
 foundation 
 for 
 the 
 building 
 of 
 communities 
 around 
 their 
 work 
 
 
 Complaints 
 also 
 abound 
 around 
 the 
 quality 
 of 
 commenting 
 systems 
 on 
 established 
 platforms 
 We 
 speculate 
 that 
 their 
 commenting 
 systems 
 may 
 be 
 deficient 
 on

 Mass market preference 
 
 
 Ad supported 
 platforms 
 are 
 only 
 a 
 viable 
 solution 
 for 
 creators 
 who 
 target 
 a 
 mass consumer 
 
 
 market 
 equating 
 to 
 only 
 the 
 most 
 popular 
 5 10% 
 of 
 YouTube 
 creators 
 making 
 a 
 living 
 
 
 Many 
 of 
 the 
 other 
 90 95% 
 of 
 creators 
 produce 
 highly 
 valued 
 work 
 yet 
 too 
 many 
 fall 
 foul 
 of 
 the 
 present 
 system 
 and 
 miss 
 out 
 
 
 An 
 exceedingly 
 large 
 proportion 
 of 
 advertising 
 revenue 
 is 
 taken 
 by 
 middlemen 
 
 the 
 video 
 platforms 
 ad 
 and 
 content 
 networks 
 For 
 example 
 YouTube 
 takes 
 a 
 hefty 
 45% 
 cut 
 of 
 ad 
 revenue 
 earned 
 by 
 content 
 
 
 creators 
 Creators 
 with 
 near sustainable 
 medium sized 
 audiences 
 are 
 incentivized 
 to 
 produce 
 more 
 mass market 
 oriented 
 content 
 While 
 this 
 might 
 work 
 for 
 certain 
 types 
 of 
 content 
 it 
 tends 
 to 
 incentivize 
 lower 
 quality 
 production 
 
 
 Viewlys 
 video 
 monetization 
 models 
 are 
 especially 
 suited 
 to 
 niche 
 and 
 quality 
 content 
 creators 
 with 
 medium 
 to 
 small 
 sized 
 audiences 
 which 
 otherwise 
 lose 
 out 
 on 
 ad based 
 legacy 
 platforms 
 
 
 Rampant ad fraud 
 
 
 Various 
 independent 
 reports 
 estimate 
 that 
 ad 
 fraud 
 (advertising 
 revenue 
 earned 
 via 
 use 
 of 
 botnets 
 that 
 watch 
 videos 
 and 
 click 
 ads) 
 is 
 as 
 high 
 as 
 50% 
 costing 
 businesses 
 billions 
 of 
 dollars 
 Unsurprisingly 
 advertising 
 platforms 
 generally 
 dont 
 publicly 
 disclose 
 the 
 extent 
 of 
 the 
 fraud 
 
 
 Ad 
 fraud 
 is 
 an 
 incredibly 
 hard 
 problem 
 to 
 solve 
 as 
 detection 
 technology 
 attempts 
 to 
 outfox 
 ever 
 evolving 
 fraud 
 technology 
 Additionally 
 solving 
 the 
 problem 
 tends 
 not 
 to 
 be 
 a 
 high 
 priority 
 of 
 the 
 platforms 
 as 
 it 
 would 
 deeply 
 undercut 
 their 
 revenues 
 
 
 
 Viewlys 
 modern 
 approach 
 to 
 content 
 monetization 
 circumvents 
 this 
 problem 
 The 
 opportunity 
 now 
 exists 
 to 
 pioneer 
 new 
 approaches 
 to 
 online 
 value 
 creation 
 
 
 Flawed advertising based model 
 
 
 As 
 can 
 be 
 seen 
 the 
 ad 
 based 
 model 
 is 
 deeply 
 problematic 
 and 
 dated 
 Centralized 
 platforms 
 that 
 use 
 it 
 hoard 
 the 
 power 
 and 
 are 
 able 
 subordinate 
 all 
 to 
 the 
 maximization 
 of 
 ad revenue 
 This 
 unbalanced 
 system 
 serves 
 these 
 platforms 
 at 
 the 
 expense 
 of 
 viewers 
 creators 
 and 
 even 
 advertisers 
 
 
 As 
 incentives 
 in 
 the 
 advertising 
 model 
 are 
 inherently 
 misaligned 
 when 
 a 
 platform 
 optimizes 
 for 
 ad 
 revenues 
 all 
 other 
 stakeholders 
 lose 
 
 
 
 viewers 
 are 
 bombarded 
 with 
 ads 
 
 quality 
 of 
 content 
 suffers 
 
 creators 
 receive 
 only 
 a 
 fraction 
 of 
 revenue 
 from 
 the 
 value 
 they 
 create 
 
 advertisers 
 lose 
 due 
 to 
 inefficiencies 
 in 
 reach 
 and 
 ad 
 fraud 
 
 VIEWLY 
 VIDEO 
 PLATFORM 
 
 
 Viewly 
 is 
 a 
 social 
 video 
 platform 
 with 
 a 
 smart 
 contract based 
 monetization 
 system 
 enabling 
 the 
 transcending 
 of 
 the 
 advertising based 
 model 
 This 
 model 
 is 
 designed 
 to 
 better 
 provide 
 sustainable 
 revenue 
 for 
 all 
 creators 
 not 
 just 
 mainstream 
 content 
 producers 
 
 
 Viewly 
 also 
 employs 
 peer to peer 
 video 
 sharing 
 technologies 
 to 
 establish 
 a 
 truly 
 decentralized 
 platform 
 befitting 
 the 
 dawning 
 of 
 the 
 blockchain 
 era 
 
 
 
 Direct monetization 
 
 
 The 
 traditional 
 advertising 
 model 
 has 
 previously 
 worked 
 well 
 for 
 mainstream 
 content 
 that 
 captures 
 millions 
 of 
 impressions 
 But 
 the 
 model 
 falls 
 far 
 short 
 for 
 most 
 particularly 
 high quality 
 creators 
 with 
 modest 
 audiences 
 
 
 Viewlys 
 solution 
 seeks 
 to 
 better 
 incorporate 
 this 
 group the 
 majority 
 of 
 creators 
 (the 
 mid 
 tails 
 of 
 the 
 distribution) 
 enabling 
 them 
 to 
 build 
 greater 
 audience 
 engagement 
 while 
 also 
 earning 
 far 
 more 
 than 
 under 
 the 
 ad based 
 model 
 
 
 The 
 Viewly 
 patronage 
 model 
 enables 
 content 
 creators 
 to 
 directly 
 receive 
 support 
 from 
 their 
 fans 
 freed 
 from 
 such 
 metrics 
 as 
 views 
 watch time 
 and 
 likes 
 With 
 Viewly 
 fans 
 gain 
 control 
 They 
 can 
 choose 
 to 
 support 
 content 
 creators 
 via 
 small 
 one time 
 donations 
 recurring 
 
 
 
 micro payments 
 based 
 on 
 newly 
 published 
 content 
 or 
 periodic 
 quota based 
 micro payments 
 to 
 favorite 
 categories 
 and 
 channels 
 
 
 These 
 frictionless 
 micro payments 
 are 
 made 
 possible 
 by 
 the 
 power 
 of 
 blockchain 
 transactions 
 seamlessly 
 integrated 
 into 
 the 
 Viewly 
 platform 
 Effectively 
 any 
 kind 
 of 
 monetization 
 idea 
 will 
 be 
 possible 
 as 
 business 
 logic 
 is 
 programmable 
 via 
 smart 
 contracts 
 As 
 all 
 payments 
 and 
 transactions 
 also 
 take 
 place 
 through 
 smart 
 contracts 
 trust 
 is 
 automated 
 eliminating 
 the 
 cost 
 and 
 risks 
 incurred 
 when 
 using 
 third 
 parties 
 
 
 A place where communities thrive 
 
 
 
 Viewly 
 represents 
 the 
 next 
 generation 
 of 
 video 
 platform 
 leveraging 
 new 
 technology 
 to 
 enable 
 innovative 
 design 
 that 
 better 
 serves 
 creators 
 and 
 their 
 audience 
 
 
 With 
 the 
 outdated 
 ad based 
 model 
 removed 
 the 
 need 
 to 
 optimize 
 for 
 ad revenue 
 is 
 also 
 removed 
 Cynical 
 measures 
 such 
 as 
 the 
 manipulation 
 of 
 view 
 count 
 are 
 not 
 in 
 the 
 best 
 interest 
 of 
 viewers 
 or 
 creators 
 Better 
 design 
 enables 
 networks 
 and 
 communities 
 to 
 thrive 
 with 
 more 
 benefits 
 for 
 more 
 participants 
 than 
 in 
 previous 
 generations 
 
 
 Viewly 
 enables 
 creators 
 to 
 build 
 a 
 community 
 of 
 fans 
 and 
 converse 
 with 
 them 
 in 
 new 
 and 
 unique 
 ways 
 empowering 
 fans 
 to 
 support 
 their 
 favorite 
 artists 
 and 
 directly 
 influence 
 the 
 content 
 creation 
 process 
 
 
 Viewly 
 users 
 have 
 flexibility 
 in 
 how 
 they 
 chose 
 to 
 support 
 content 
 creators 
 and 
 become 
 their 
 patrons 
 In 
 return 
 creators 
 can 
 set 
 up 
 multiple 
 membership 
 levels 
 with 
 various 
 benefits 
 such 
 as 
 access 
 to 
 limited 
 content 
 private 
 chats 
 discussing 
 ideas 
 for 
 upcoming 
 content 
 being 
 featured 
 in 
 content 
 etc 
 
 
 As 
 rewards 
 are 
 customizable 
 within 
 the 
 platform 
 the 
 possibilities 
 are 
 endless 
 and 
 only 
 depend 
 on 
 the 
 ingenuity 
 of 
 content 
 creators 
 and 
 their 
 engagement 
 with 
 their 
 audience 
 Furthermore 
 
 
 
 there 
 will 
 be 
 rewards 
 for 
 the 
 biggest 
 contributors 
 in 
 each 
 category 
 ranging 
 from 
 special 
 badges 
 to 
 influencing 
 future 
 content 
 
 
 Creators 
 publishing 
 on 
 Viewly 
 will 
 be 
 able 
 to 
 invite 
 sponsors 
 and 
 accept 
 sponsorship 
 deals 
 Unlike 
 algorithms 
 that 
 feed 
 users 
 with 
 irrelevant 
 ads 
 these 
 opportunities 
 will 
 be 
 selected 
 at 
 the 
 creators 
 discretion 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 provide 
 value 
 to 
 their 
 community 
 Unlike 
 ads 
 which 
 can 
 interrupt 
 flow 
 they 
 will 
 be 
 integrated 
 into 
 the 
 content 
 by 
 the 
 creator 
 enhancing 
 it 
 and 
 providing 
 value 
 
 
 
 First 
 decentralized 
 video 
 platform 
 
 
 
 Viewly 
 is 
 an 
 entirely 
 decentralized 
 platform 
 enabled 
 by 
 two 
 foundational 
 pieces 
 
 
 1 
 peer to peer 
 hosting 
 network 
 and 
 2 
 smart 
 contract based 
 transactions 
 on 
 the 
 blockchain 
 A 
 non governing 
 user facing 
 web 
 application 
 that 
 connects 
 to 
 this 
 backbone 
 will 
 initially 
 be 
 implemented 
 in 
 traditional 
 web 
 architecture 
 in 
 order 
 to 
 lower 
 barriers 
 to 
 adoption 
 and 
 accelerate 
 growth 
 A 
 decentralized 
 version 
 of 
 the 
 frontend 
 application 
 will 
 also 
 be 
 built 
 but 
 it 
 will 
 remain 
 a 
 secondary 
 option 
 until 
 the 
 DAPP 
 technology 
 stack 
 matures 
 and 
 is 
 suitable 
 for 
 large 
 scale 
 mass market 
 adoption 
 
 
 Transaction 
 processing 
 through 
 smart 
 contracts 
 provides 
 the 
 framework 
 for 
 all 
 interactions 
 on 
 the 
 platform 
 including 
 donations 
 micro payments 
 sponsoring 
 agreements 
 access 
 level 
 to 
 limited 
 content 
 etc 
 It 
 has 
 all 
 the 
 intrinsic 
 qualities 
 of 
 blockchain 
 systems 
 like 
 immutability 
 and 
 transparency 
 The 
 blockchain 
 application 
 also 
 serves 
 as 
 a 
 reward 
 synchronization 
 and 
 enforcement 
 layer 
 for 
 the 
 peer to peer 
 hosting 
 
 
 Decentralized 
 hosting 
 networks 
 are 
 also 
 a 
 crucial 
 piece 
 of 
 the 
 Viewly 
 platform 
 Since 
 creators 
 have 
 to 
 pay 
 hosting 
 providers 
 for 
 long term 
 storage 
 of 
 videos 
 it 
 also 
 serves 
 as 
 a 
 content 
 quality 
 filter 
 creators 
 are 
 incentivised 
 to 
 remove 
 early 
 or 
 to 
 not 
 even 
 publish 
 low value 
 videos 
 in 
 the 
 first 
 place 
 
 
 Furthermore 
 a 
 decentralized 
 architecture 
 provides 
 natural 
 anti fragility 
 of 
 the 
 system 
 It 
 is 
 censorship 
 resistant 
 and 
 much 
 harder 
 to 
 be 
 taken 
 down 
 by 
 intervention 
 of 
 corrupt 
 governments 
 or 
 by 
 attacks 
 of 
 malicious 
 hackers 
 
 
 
 Content 
 monetization 
 models 
 
 
 In 
 this 
 section 
 we 
 propose 
 three 
 models 
 which 
 respect 
 user 
 privacy 
 require 
 no 
 middlemen 
 and 
 encourage 
 the 
 formation 
 of 
 positive 
 self organizing 
 communities 
 
 
 
 Vote based Tipping 
 
 
 Many 
 people 
 are 
 naturally 
 motivated 
 to 
 support 
 their 
 favorite 
 creators 
 This 
 support 
 can 
 be 
 facilitated 
 and 
 further 
 fostered 
 via 
 gamification 
 with 
 incorporated 
 special 
 perks 
 for 
 supporters 
 
 
 Our 
 model 
 provides 
 a 
 solid 
 baseline 
 mechanism 
 to 
 deal 
 with 
 rewards 
 in 
 a 
 content 
 abundant 
 ecosystem 
 Via 
 this 
 mechanism 
 users 
 are 
 able 
 to 
 support 
 multiple 
 creators 
 at 
 once 
 without 
 the 
 mental 
 overhead 
 attached 
 to 
 traditional 
 micropayments 
 
 
 To 
 establish 
 such 
 a 
 system 
 we 
 have 
 developed 
 a 
 frictionless 
 voting 
 based 
 micropayment 
 model 
 in 
 part 
 influenced 
 by 
 the 
 highly 
 successful 
 Patreon 
 model 
 and 
 the 
 voting 
 model 
 of 
 Steem 
 
 
 How 
 does 
 it 
 work 
 
 
 Each 
 user 
 has 
 their 
 own 
 donation 
 pool 
 in 
 the 
 form 
 of 
 a 
 virtual 
 wallet 
 Based 
 upon 
 the 
 users 
 upvoting 
 patterns 
 this 
 pool 
 is 
 automatically 
 distributed 
 to 
 creators 
 on 
 a 
 pro 
 rata 
 basis 
 
 
 
 Gamification 
 and 
 status 
 symbols 
 
 
 One 
 potential 
 way 
 of 
 gamifying 
 support 
 for 
 creators 
 is 
 to 
 add 
 flares 
 perks 
 and 
 other 
 reward 
 mechanisms 
 which 
 can 
 be 
 awarded 
 to 
 supporters 
 Contributions 
 can 
 also 
 be 
 quantified 
 to 
 increase 
 their 
 visibility 
 to 
 the 
 creator 
 and 
 the 
 wider 
 the 
 community 
 For 
 example 
 social 
 networks 
 like 
 Reddit 
 rank 
 comments 
 by 
 net 
 upvotes 
 This 
 system 
 however 
 strongly 
 favors 
 comments 
 that 
 come 
 in 
 first 
 and 
 get 
 the 
 first 
 upvotes 
 pushing 
 the 
 rest 
 of 
 the 
 conversation 
 into 
 obscurity 
 
 
 Instead 
 of 
 favoring 
 submission 
 time 
 we 
 can 
 rank 
 comments 
 by 
 the 
 net 
 size 
 of 
 a 
 commenters 
 contributions 
 to 
 the 
 creator 
 and 
 leverage 
 community 
 input 
 (votes) 
 to 
 amplify 
 the 
 best 
 replies 
 as 
 well 
 as 
 filter 
 spam 
 
 
 Recurring patronage 
 
 
 Some 
 creators 
 may 
 choose 
 to 
 create 
 special 
 content 
 for 
 their 
 most 
 loyal 
 fans 
 accessed 
 when 
 a 
 sufficient 
 and 
 recurring 
 monthly 
 pledge 
 has 
 been 
 setup 
 The 
 recurring 
 pledge 
 model 
 is 
 also 
 extensible 
 to 
 other 
 forms 
 of 
 value 
 exchange 
 
 
 Selling 
 access 
 to 
 the 
 content 
 
 
 We 
 believe 
 that 
 direct 
 content 
 sales 
 are 
 a 
 sub optimal 
 monetization 
 strategy 
 Such 
 a 
 strategy 
 adds 
 overhead 
 additionally 
 in 
 this 
 era 
 most 
 consumers 
 prefer 
 to 
 avoid 
 the 
 extra 
 hassle 
 of 
 making 
 a 
 payment 
 to 
 watch 
 a 
 single 
 video 
 
 
 Companies 
 like 
 Netflix 
 and 
 Spotify 
 have 
 popularized 
 the 
 subscription 
 model 
 which 
 grants 
 access 
 to 
 entire 
 catalogs 
 of 
 content 
 Humble 
 Indie 
 Bundle 
 also 
 pioneered 
 a 
 pay 
 what 
 you 
 want 
 model 
 where 
 any 
 amount 
 above 
 a 
 minimum 
 threshold 
 grants 
 access 
 
 
 We 
 believe 
 that 
 we 
 can 
 apply 
 these 
 principles 
 to 
 the 
 patronage 
 model 
 Fans 
 can 
 pledge 
 any 
 amount 
 of 
 tokens 
 on 
 a 
 monthly 
 basis 
 to 
 their 
 favorite 
 creators 
 and 
 if 
 the 
 pledge 
 surpasses 
 the 
 threshold 
 set 
 by 
 the 
 content 
 creator 
 (e g 
 $5 
 per 
 month 
 worth 
 of 
 View 
 tokens) 
 access 
 to 
 special 
 content 
 and 
 perhaps 
 say 
 the 
 creators 
 inner 
 circle 
 is 
 unlocked 
 
 
 Value added 
 economy 
 
 
 While 
 content 
 is 
 abundant 
 services 
 merchandise 
 and 
 other 
 products 
 are 
 less 
 so 
 With 
 Viewly 
 content 
 creators 
 could 
 create 
 Kickstarter like 
 packages 
 as 
 up sells 
 to 
 their 
 most 
 loyal 
 fans 
 For 
 
 
 
 example 
 a 
 fitness 
 and 
 bio hacking 
 channel 
 might 
 create 
 its 
 own 
 food 
 supplement 
 or 
 nootropic 
 which 
 they 
 could 
 distribute 
 to 
 fans 
 in 
 exchange 
 for 
 a 
 monthly 
 pledge 
 
 
 In 
 the 
 future 
 we 
 could 
 expand 
 these 
 marketplace 
 features 
 to 
 solve 
 additional 
 problems 
 such 
 as 
 crowdsourcing 
 services 
 Content 
 creators 
 could 
 hire 
 editors 
 designers 
 writers 
 and 
 so 
 on 
 through 
 the 
 network 
 itself 
 paying 
 for 
 work 
 completed 
 in 
 the 
 native 
 coin 
 The 
 escrow 
 model 
 from 
 sponsorships 
 can 
 be 
 applied 
 here 
 as 
 well 
 
 
 Creator delivered endorsements 
 
 
 While 
 the 
 patronage 
 model 
 is 
 the 
 purest 
 form 
 of 
 value 
 exchange 
 
 with 
 near 
 perfectly 
 aligned 
 incentives 
 and 
 an 
 honest 
 feedback 
 loop 
 many 
 creators 
 today 
 do 
 depend 
 on 
 sponsorships 
 We 
 would 
 therefore 
 like 
 to 
 provide 
 a 
 sponsorship 
 option 
 and 
 encourage 
 creators 
 to 
 foster 
 such 
 opportunities 
 based 
 on 
 their 
 understanding 
 of 
 and 
 alignment 
 with 
 their 
 audience 
 
 
 We 
 assume 
 there 
 will 
 be 
 a 
 better 
 alignment 
 of 
 values 
 between 
 sponsors 
 creators 
 and 
 viewers 
 when 
 a 
 creator 
 also 
 creates 
 the 
 endorsement 
 since 
 creators 
 need 
 to 
 maintain 
 a 
 good 
 relationship 
 with 
 their 
 audience 
 while 
 simultaneously 
 satisfying 
 the 
 demands 
 of 
 the 
 sponsor 
 
 
 The 
 Viewly 
 blockchain 
 application 
 will 
 offer 
 an 
 on chain 
 escrow 
 service 
 (smart 
 contract) 
 that 
 sponsors 
 and 
 creators 
 can 
 utilize 
 once 
 pricing 
 structure 
 and 
 deliverables 
 are 
 agreed 
 After 
 both 
 parties 
 have 
 delivered 
 on 
 their 
 commitments 
 the 
 transaction 
 is 
 executed 
 The 
 service 
 will 
 also 
 be 
 used 
 for 
 dispute 
 resolution 
 to 
 mediate 
 re negotiation 
 for 
 delivery 
 of 
 additional 
 work 
 as 
 well 
 as 
 offer 
 options 
 for 
 a 
 partial 
 or 
 full 
 refund 
 If 
 disputes 
 escalate 
 a 
 trusted 
 (elected) 
 third 
 party 
 will 
 be 
 used 
 as 
 an 
 arbitrator 
 The 
 process 
 will 
 be 
 fully 
 transparent 
 and 
 open 
 to 
 community 
 feedback 
 
 
 
 Market 
 landscape 
 
 
 According 
 to 
 research 
 firm 
 Frost 
 and 
 Sullivan 
 the 
 online 
 video 
 platform 
 market 
 will 
 generate 
 more 
 than 
 800 
 million 
 USD 
 in 
 revenue 
 by 
 2019 
 and 
 it 
 is 
 estimated 
 to 
 grow 
 at 
 a 
 compounded 
 annual 
 growth 
 rate 
 of 
 14 88% 
 by 
 2020 
 according 
 to 
 Research 
 and 
 Markets 
 As 
 for 
 the 
 market 
 value 
 of 
 the 
 online 
 video 
 platform 
 market 
 YouTube 
 holds 
 a 
 74% 
 market 
 share 
 and 
 is 
 estimated 
 to 
 be 
 worth 
 in 
 excess 
 of 
 90 
 billion 
 USD 
 [9] 
 yielding 
 the 
 total 
 market 
 value 
 of 
 online 
 video 
 platform 
 companies 
 at 
 122 
 billion 
 USD 
 The 
 next 
 largest 
 platform 
 by 
 market 
 share 
 is 
 Vimeo 
 which 
 holds 
 15% 
 of 
 the 
 market 
 Together 
 YouTube 
 and 
 Vimeo 
 hold 
 just 
 shy 
 of 
 90% 
 of 
 the 
 total 
 video 
 platform 
 market 
 
 
 
 However 
 the 
 majority 
 of 
 the 
 current 
 traditional 
 platforms 
 limit 
 the 
 monetization 
 options 
 available 
 for 
 content 
 creators 
 By 
 doing 
 so 
 platforms 
 also 
 limit 
 the 
 kind 
 of 
 content 
 that 
 works 
 on 
 such 
 platforms 
 For 
 example 
 ad based 
 platforms 
 works 
 best 
 for 
 the 
 mainstream 
 and 
 viral 
 content 
 whereas 
 niche 
 content 
 creators 
 struggle 
 to 
 make 
 a 
 living 
 on 
 such 
 platforms 
 
 
 When 
 analyzing 
 the 
 video 
 platforms 
 market 
 we 
 believe 
 that 
 the 
 platforms 
 should 
 be 
 measured 
 by 
 two 
 parameters 
 (1) 
 breadth 
 of 
 monetization 
 options 
 and 
 (2) 
 the 
 size 
 of 
 the 
 cut 
 that 
 the 
 platform 
 takes 
 for 
 itself 
 If 
 we 
 look 
 at 
 the 
 popular 
 video 
 platforms 
 such 
 as 
 YouTube 
 and 
 Vimeo 
 we 
 can 
 observe 
 that 
 they 
 take 
 a 
 substantial 
 cut 
 of 
 advertising 
 revenues 
 YouTubes 
 recent 
 moves 
 into 
 providing 
 more 
 monetization 
 options 
 only 
 proves 
 that 
 we 
 are 
 heading 
 in 
 the 
 right 
 direction 
 for 
 better 
 supporting 
 content 
 creators 
 Patreon 
 promotes 
 patronage style 
 recurring 
 revenue 
 options 
 that 
 are 
 desired 
 by 
 most 
 content 
 creators 
 However 
 recent 
 findings 
 have 
 shown 
 that 
 revenues 
 of 
 the 
 content 
 creators 
 on 
 Patreon 
 are 
 rather 
 meager 
 
 
 What 
 all 
 of 
 the 
 aforementioned 
 platforms 
 have 
 in 
 common 
 are 
 high 
 percentage 
 cuts 
 that 
 they 
 take 
 from 
 content 
 creators 
 Blockchain 
 and 
 smart 
 contracts 
 cryptocurrencies 
 and 
 DAO 
 governance 
 style 
 enables 
 projects 
 like 
 Viewly 
 to 
 strive 
 for 
 very 
 low 
 cut a 
 cut 
 that 
 more 
 accurately 
 matches 
 the 
 content 
 delivery 
 costs 
 
 
 
 As 
 shown 
 in 
 the 
 graphic 
 below 
 most 
 traditional 
 online 
 video 
 platforms 
 limit 
 the 
 monetization 
 options 
 and 
 take 
 a 
 significantly 
 high 
 cut 
 of 
 the 
 revenue 
 
 
 
 
 THE 
 VIEW 
 TOKEN 
 
 
 These are our views and expectations on how the platform would use VIEW token VIEW 
 token will be used as a payment mechanism Stakeholders i e viewers and content 
 creators will need to hold certain amounts of tokens to ensure access to certain 
 platform functionalities 
 
 
 
 VIEW Token Utility 
 
 
 As 
 already 
 mentioned 
 earlier 
 there 
 are 
 several 
 monetization 
 mechanisms 
 in 
 plan 
 for 
 content 
 creators 
 Regardless 
 of 
 the 
 monetization 
 mechanism 
 favored 
 by 
 the 
 individual 
 content 
 creator 
 he 
 will 
 receive 
 the 
 payment 
 in 
 VIEW 
 tokens 
 
 
 On 
 the 
 other 
 hand 
 content 
 creators 
 will 
 use 
 some 
 of 
 their 
 VIEW 
 tokens 
 to 
 pay 
 CDNs 
 for 
 their 
 services 
 
 
 The 
 platform 
 will 
 require 
 the 
 CDNs 
 to 
 keep 
 some 
 VIEW 
 tokens 
 as 
 a 
 deposit 
 to 
 ensure 
 the 
 quality 
 of 
 services 
 Similarly 
 content 
 creators 
 will 
 need 
 to 
 keep 
 some 
 amount 
 of 
 tokens 
 proportional 
 to 
 the 
 number 
 of 
 their 
 videos 
 (e g 
 10 
 VIEW 
 tokens 
 per 
 video) 
 and 
 viewers 
 will 
 need 
 some 
 amount 
 of 
 tokens 
 if 
 they 
 want 
 to 
 actively 
 participate 
 like 
 upvote 
 videos 
 etc

 The 
 following 
 diagram 
 represents

 Content creators 
 
 
 Content 
 creators 
 publishing 
 on 
 Viewly 
 will 
 be 
 offered 
 hosting 
 contracts 
 for 
 a 
 certain 
 time 
 period 
 
 
 (e g 
 one 
 year) 
 The 
 price 
 is 
 determined 
 by 
 the 
 hosting 
 providers1 
 on 
 a 
 basis 
 of 
 publicly 
 available 
 data 
 and 
 discretionary 
 risk 
 models 
 We 
 came 
 to 
 this 
 price 
 point 
 after 
 thorough 
 research 
 of 
 current 
 storage 
 costs 
 We 
 assessed 
 a 
 sample 
 seven 
 (7) 
 minute 
 4k 
 video 
 that 
 was 
 stored 
 in 
 all 
 the 
 different 
 playing 
 formats 
 (from 
 low 
 resolution 
 to 
 HD) 
 Based 
 on 
 this 
 analysis 
 we 
 will 
 use 
 2 4GB 
 of 
 space 
 for 
 one 
 copy 
 which 
 is 
 12 
 GB 
 for 
 five 
 (5) 
 distributed 
 copies 
 According 
 to 
 current 
 hosting 
 prices 
 charged 
 by 
 the 
 hosting 
 providers2 
 projected 
 retail 
 cost 
 of 
 storing 
 such 
 video 
 is 
 in 
 a 
 scale 
 of 
 1$ 
 per 
 year 
 The 
 costs 
 of 
 storage 
 will 
 deteriorate 
 over 
 time 
 due 
 to 
 increased 
 market 
 efficiency 
 as 
 well 
 as 
 being 
 in 
 line 
 with 
 Moores 
 law 
 
 
 The 
 price 
 of 
 storage 
 will 
 only 
 be 
 (1) 
 a 
 small 
 proportion 
 of 
 earnings 
 for 
 popular 
 content 
 providers 
 
 
 (2) 
 a 
 small 
 price 
 to 
 pay 
 for 
 storing 
 videos 
 with 
 high 
 intrinsic/emotional 
 value 
 and 
 (3) 
 too 
 expensive 
 for 
 low 
 quality 
 content 
 and/or 
 spam 
 ultimately 
 eliminating 
 the 
 surplus 
 of 
 unpopular 
 and/or 
 spam 
 videos

 will 
 be 
 an 
 order

 and 
 a

 Each

 will 
 be

 will 
 likely

 offers 
 from 
 potential

 primarily 
 influenced 
 by 
 popularity 
 and

 profiles 
 To 
 make 
 this 
 process 
 easier 
 as 
 well 
 as 
 to 
 aid 
 in 
 matching 
 the 
 particular 
 content 
 creators 
 with 
 the 
 optimal 
 hosting 
 providers 
 we 
 should 
 aggregate 
 additional

 based 
 on 
 usage

 such 
 as

 (timing

 is 
 based 
 on 
 PoA

 is 
 purposefully 
 discarded 
 both 
 the

 and 
 remaining 
 funds 
 in 
 the

 The

 forgoes 
 the

 of

 liability 
 and

 uploader 
 loses 
 the

 suffers 
 a 
 small 
 loss 
 in

 Publicly available fully transparent data 
 
 
 We 
 will

 idea 
 is 
 that

 primarily 
 consisting

 Since 
 the

 is 
 recorded 
 on 
 the

 side 
 it 
 cannot 
 be 
 trusted 
 and 
 as 
 such 
 is 
 not 
 useful 
 for 
 calculating

 It 
 does 
 however 
 provide 
 useful 
 feedback 
 in

 to

 CDN 
 network 
 nodes 
 will 
 provide 
 both

 and

 (bandwidth) 
 The 
 nodes 
 will 
 be 
 constantly 
 challenged 
 with 
 a 
 set 
 of 
 two 
 distinct 
 challenges 
 (1) 
 Proof 
 of 
 Storage proving 
 that 
 they 
 store 
 a 
 distinct 
 copy 
 of 
 a 
 video 
 as 
 claimed 
 and 
 (2) 
 Proof 
 of

 prove 
 that 
 the 
 stored 
 video 
 is 
 available 
 for 
 streaming 
 in 
 acceptable 
 time 
 
 
 
 Proof 
 of 
 Storage 
 
 
 We 
 introduce 
 a 
 cryptographic 
 primitive 
 Proof of Storage 
 that 
 will 
 enable 
 hosting 
 node 
 to 
 prove 
 to 
 the 
 verifier 
 that 
 they 
 actually 
 provided 
 hosting 
 services 
 for 
 a 
 specific 
 file 
 in 
 a 
 specific 
 time 
 period 
 PoS 
 builds 
 on 
 the 
 work 
 done 
 by 
 Moran 
 & 
 Orlov 
 [21] 
 and 
 on 
 works 
 of 
 Proof 
 of 
 Storage 
 / 
 Retrievability 
 [22 
 23 
 24] 
 
 
 At 
 this 
 point 
 we 
 would 
 like 
 to 
 note 
 that 
 PoS 
 is 
 a 
 work 
 in 
 progress 
 and 
 will 
 need 
 to 
 withstand 
 rigorous 
 stress 
 tests 
 and 
 therefore 
 might 
 consequently 
 be 
 considerably 
 adapted 
 in 
 its 
 final 
 form 
 
 
 Proof 
 of 
 Storage 
 enables 
 hosting 
 nodes 
 to 
 prove 
 to 
 the 
 network 
 that 
 it 
 offered 
 storage 
 in 
 a 
 particular 
 time 
 period 
 In 
 order 
 to 
 work 
 the 
 PoS 
 protocol 
 assumes 
 two 
 phases 
 (1) 
 an 
 initialization 
 phase 
 and 
 (2) 
 an 
 execution 
 phase 
 that 
 is 
 repeated 
 multiple 
 times 
 The 
 protocol 
 is 
 designed 
 in 
 such 
 a 
 way 
 that 
 the 
 initialization 
 phase 
 is 
 more 
 costly 
 than 
 actually 
 proving 
 a 
 hosting 
 service 
 
 
 We 
 assume 
 the 
 verifier 
 (V) 
 and 
 a 
 prover 
 (P) 
 both 
 have 
 access 
 to 
 a 
 random 
 oracle 
 (H) 
 Just 
 as 
 in 
 
 
 [21] 
 we 
 define 
 the 
 initiation 
 and 
 execution 
 phase 
 as 
 follows 
 Initialization 
 phase 
 V 
 and 
 P 
 receive 
 a 
 binary 
 input 
 string 
 of 
 length 
 k 
 and 
 both 
 produce 
 state 
 strings 
 s 
 The 
 work 
 w 
 spent 
 in 
 the 
 initialization 
 phase 
 should 
 be 
 larger 
 than 
 the 
 work 
 needed 
 to 
 actually 
 provide 
 a 
 hosting 
 service 
 to 
 avoid 
 rationality 
 attack 
 
 
 H 
 VH
 
 (sP 
 sV 
 ) 
 P 
 (id) 
 (id) 
 
 
 
 Execution 
 phase 
 V 
 and 
 P 
 both 
 receive 
 their 
 states 
 and 
 ids 
 It 
 can 
 run 
 several 
 times 
 without 
 repeating 
 the 
 initialization 
 phase 
 At 
 the 
 end 
 of 
 each 
 execution 
 phase 
 V 
 produces 
 an 
 output 
 which 
 is 
 either 
 an 
 acceptance 
 or 
 rejection 
 
 
 H 
 VH
 
 ( outV 
 ) 
 P 
 (id sP 
 ) 
 (id sV 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 Similar 
 to 
 [21] 
 we 
 define 
 work 
 / 
 distinct 
 storage 
 tradeoff 
 function 
 f 
 as 
 the 
 work 
 / 
 storage 
 bound 
 for 
 the 
 PoS 
 proof 
 
 
 As 
 proved 
 by 
 Moran 
 and 
 Orlov 
 [21] 
 the 
 protocol 
 (P 
 V) 
 is 
 a 
 Proof 
 of 
 Storage 
 if 
 it 
 satisfies 
 the 
 properties 
 of 
 completeness 
 and 
 soundness 
 
 
 Completeness 
 The 
 Proof 
 of 
 Storage 
 is 
 perfectly 
 complete 
 if 
 for 
 any 
 id 
 and 
 every 
 H 
 the 
 following 
 statement 
 is 
 true 
 
 
 HH
 
 Pr 
 [outV 
 =

 (sP

 ) 
 P 
 (id) VH 
 (id) 
 ( outV

 P 
 (id sP

 (id sV 
 )

 Soundness 
 After 
 Moran 
 and 
 Orlov 
 [21] 
 we 
 define 
 a 
 security 
 game 
 with 
 two 
 phases 
 and 
 corresponding 
 adversaries 
 A 
 = 
 (A1 
 A2) 
 They 
 cannot 
 communicate 
 between 
 themselves 
 during 
 the 
 game 
 itself 
 or 
 between 
 phases 
 
 
 Let 
 each 
 phase 
 of 
 the 
 PoS 
 n Security 
 Game 
 correspond 
 to 
 a 
 PoS 
 phase 
 as 
 follows 
 
 
 1) 
 In 
 the 
 initialization 
 A1 
 chooses 
 a 
 set 
 of 
 ids 
 {id1 
 id2 
 idn} 
 and 
 then 
 interacts 
 with 
 n 
 independent 
 verifiers 
 and 
 execute 
 the 
 initialization 
 phase 
 of 
 PoS 
 protocol 
 sending 
 i th 
 verifier 
 idi 
 sA 
 is 
 the 
 output 
 of 
 this 
 phase 
 and 
 (sV1 
 sV2 sVn) 
 the 
 outputs 
 of 
 the 
 verifiers 
 2) 
 The 
 adversary 
 A2 
 (id1 
 id2 
 idn 
 sA) 
 interacts 
 with 
 n 
 independent 
 verifiers 
 executing 
 the 
 execution 
 phase 
 where 
 i th 
 verifier 
 is 
 given 
 (idi 
 sA) 
 as 
 input 
 We 
 denote 
 a 
 Succn 
 an 
 event 
 of 
 adversarys 
 success 
 if 
 all 
 verifiers 
 accept 
 We 
 define 
 a 
 PoS 
 protocol 
 as 
 (e f) sound 
 (where 
 s 
 > 
 0 
 and 
 n 
 = 
 1) 
 if 
 every 
 adversary 
 A 
 = 
 (A1 
 A2) 
 that 
 uses 
 at 
 most

 satisfies 
 the 
 following 
 conditions 
 in 
 the 
 PoS

 game

 If 
 we 
 want 
 to 
 motivate 
 honest 
 provers 
 to 
 use 
 storage 
 rather 
 than 
 work 
 the 
 following 
 condition 
 must 
 hold 
 true 
 for 
 every 
 n 
 = 
 1 
 as 
 in 
 [21] 
 
 
 1) 
 The 
 optimal 
 strategy 
 is 
 storing 
 an 
 e fraction 
 of 
 the 
 honest 
 storage 
 s*= 
 arg 
 mins 
 (n 
 
 f(s/n) s) 
 = 
 e nm 
 
 
 2) 
 Rerunning 
 initialization 
 is 
 costlier 
 than 
 storage 
 ew 
 + 
 f(0) 
 
 
 enw 
 +nf(0) 
 = 
 e nm 
 
 = 
 
 
 e m 
 
 
 As 
 proved 
 by 
 Moran 
 and 
 Orlov 
 [21] 
 the 
 protocol 
 satisfying 
 these 
 conditions 
 and 
 the 
 cost 
 of 
 storage 
 unit 
 is 
 less 
 than 
 
 the 
 optimal 
 strategy 
 is 
 to 
 store 
 at 
 least 
 e 
 compared 
 to 
 the 
 honest 
 storage 
 costs 
 
 
 Optimizing 
 CDN 
 network 
 topology 
 
 
 On 
 the 
 other 
 side 
 CDN 
 nodes 
 network 
 ensures 
 streaming 
 of 
 videos 
 all 
 over 
 the 
 world 
 They 
 are 
 geographically 
 distributed 
 servers 
 with 
 high 
 bandwidth 
 Although 
 the 
 network 
 topology 
 will 
 be 
 in 
 the 
 domain 
 of 
 CDN 
 providers 
 we 
 propose 
 the 
 following 
 network 
 topology 
 optimization 
 strategy 
 
 
 Recent 
 upticks 
 in 
 popularity 
 of 
 video 
 on demand 
 streaming 
 services 
 have 
 uncovered 
 new 
 challenges 
 in 
 how 
 to 
 stream 
 high 
 quality 
 (large) 
 videos 
 to 
 a 
 large 
 number 
 of 
 viewers 
 and 
 ensure 
 sufficient 
 quality 
 of 
 service 
 while 
 overcoming 
 storage 
 and 
 bandwidth 
 bottlenecks 
 There 
 are 
 many 
 researchers 
 and 
 research 
 groups 
 that 
 are 
 tackling 
 the 
 problem 
 from 
 different 
 angles 
 such 
 as 
 peer to peer 
 [16 
 17 
 19] 
 distributed 
 storage 
 [13 
 14

 statistical 
 modeling 
 of 
 demand 
 [16] 
 efficient 
 caching 
 [15

 etc

 We 
 define 
 q#
 P 
 as 
 a 
 number 
 of 
 queries 
 party 
 P 
 makes 
 to 
 an 
 oracle 
 H 
 
 
 
 We 
 are 
 designing 
 a 
 P2P 
 video 
 streaming 
 network 
 with 
 a 
 high 
 number 
 of 
 unreliable 
 nodes 
 having 
 limited 
 storage 
 bandwidth 
 and 
 availability 
 a 
 set 
 of 
 reliable 
 nodes 
 that 
 will 
 assist 
 when 
 the 
 unreliable 
 nodes 
 cannot 
 meet 
 the 
 desired 
 quality 
 of 
 service 
 As 
 the 
 demand 
 varies 
 so 
 should 
 the 
 data 
 stored 
 at 
 each 
 node 
 Research 
 [19] 
 has 
 shown 
 that 
 the 
 problem 
 can 
 be 
 formulated 
 as 
 a 
 static 
 convex 
 optimization 
 problem 
 and 
 can 
 be 
 divided 
 into 
 three 
 sub problems 
 (1) 
 what 
 videos 
 should 
 be 
 stored 
 on 
 which 
 node 
 based 
 on 
 the 
 demand 
 and 
 network 
 capacity 
 (2) 
 topology 
 of 
 which 
 nodes 
 should 
 cover 
 which 
 demand 
 and 
 (3) 
 minimizing 
 the 
 need 
 for 
 the 
 expensive 
 reliable 
 nodes 
 It 
 has 
 been 
 shown 
 that 
 the 
 problems 
 are 
 NP hard 
 [19] 
 
 
 As 
 in 
 the 
 distributed 
 P2P 
 setting 
 we 
 cannot 
 affect 
 the 
 topology 
 directly 
 we 
 should 
 optimize 
 the 
 problem 
 with 
 the 
 topology 
 as 
 a 
 given 
 We 
 will 
 use 
 the 
 optimization 
 solution 
 put 
 forward 
 by 
 K 
 W 
 Lee 
 et 
 al 
 [19] 
 What 
 follows 
 is 
 a 
 summary 
 of 
 their 
 proposed 
 solution 
 of 
 the 
 optimization 
 problem 
 for 
 the 
 fixed 
 overlay 
 graph/topology 
 
 
 We 
 will 
 allow 
 nodes 
 to 
 hold 
 fractional 
 streams 
 as 
 defined 
 below 
 
 
 Given 
 the 
 data 
 stream 
 S0 
 and 
 rate 
 x0 
 S0(x0) 
 a 
 fractional 
 stream 
 S(x) 
 is 
 defined 
 as 
 a 
 stream 
 that 
 satisfies 
 the 
 following 
 conditions4 
 
 
 1 
 Additivity 
 S(x) 
 can 
 be 
 generated 
 by 
 S(x1) 
 and 
 S(x2) 
 if 
 x1 
 + 
 x2 
 = 
 x 
 2 
 Recovery 
 S0(x0) 
 can 
 be 
 generated 
 by 
 any 
 S(x) 
 if 
 x1 
 = 
 x 
 Given 
 the 
 data 
 stream 
 S0(x0) 
 a 
 cache 
 can 
 generate 
 a 
 fractional 
 stream 
 S(x) 
 if 
 and 
 only 
 if 
 the 
 cache 
 stores 
 no 
 less 
 than 
 x/xm 
 fraction 
 of 
 the 
 source 
 file 
 of 
 the 
 stream 
 
 
 4 
 Let 
 1 
 denote 
 a 
 route 
 rate 
 of 
 r 
 
 
 
 Therefore 
 the 
 optimization 
 problem 
 can 
 be 
 formulated 
 as 
 follows5 
 
 
 
 Such 
 that 
 
 
 678
 K 
 W 
 Lee 
 et 
 al 
 [19] 
 propose 
 the 
 problem 
 can 
 be 
 solved 
 by 
 the 
 three step 
 primal 
 dual 
 algorithm 
 that 
 converges 
 to 
 the 
 optimal 
 solution 
 For 
 the 
 proof 
 of 
 the 
 solution 
 see 
 [20] 
 Step 
 1 
 Update 
 the 
 upload 
 rate 
 
 
 
 Where 
 is 
 the 
 derivative 
 of 
 function 
 over 
 xr 
 is 
 the 
 aggregate 
 route 
 price 
 where 
 l 
 is 
 the 
 single 
 link 
 price 
 on 
 link 
 l 
 which 
 is 
 updated 
 as 
 
 
 
 Where 
 dr 
 and 
 l 
 > 
 0 
 are 
 adaptation 
 parameters 
 
 
 Step 
 2 
 Update 
 the 
 demand 
 index

 Let 
 Whm 
 denote 
 a 
 storage 
 of 
 video 
 m 
 on 
 cache 
 h 
 Let 
 u 
 denote 
 an 
 user 
 and 
 U 
 a 
 set 
 of 
 users 
 Let 
 Vu(z) 
 denote 
 a 
 
 
 function 
 that 
 represents 
 the 
 utility 
 of 
 user 
 u 
 when 
 the 
 perceived 
 rate 
 is 
 z 
 and 
 let 
 that 
 function 
 be 
 concave 
 6 
 The 
 streaming 
 rate 
 from 
 cache 
 h 
 to 
 user 
 u 
 can 
 be 
 0 
 if 
 cache 
 does 
 not 
 store 
 the 
 video 
 m 
 otherwise 
 the 
 streaming 
 rate 
 cannot 
 be 
 greater 
 than 
 m

 Routing

 Storage 
 constraint 
 
 
 
 Where 
 r 
 is 
 a 
 positive 
 constraint 
 that 
 captures 
 the 
 relative 
 demand 
 (absolute 
 demand 
 minus 
 supply) 
 of 
 video 
 on 
 route 
 r 
 
 
 Step 
 3 
 Update 
 cache 
 storage 
 
 
 
 Where 
 the 
 Lagrangian 
 variable 
 h 
 is 
 interpreted 
 as 
 the 
 storage 
 price 
 of 
 the 
 storage 
 constraint 
 
 
 
 is 
 the 
 aggregate 
 demand 
 index 
 and 
 m 
 the 
 size 
 of 
 the 
 video 
 m 
 
 
 We 
 are 
 aware 
 of 
 the 
 sheer 
 size 
 and 
 magnitude 
 of 
 what 
 we 
 are 
 building 
 compared 
 to 
 other 
 projects 
 built 
 on 
 the 
 blockchain 
 A 
 critical 
 element 
 to 
 success 
 will 
 undoubtedly 
 be 
 engaging 
 in 
 an 
 in depth 
 proof of concept 
 and 
 proof of technology 
 analysis 
 to 
 ensure 
 the 
 feasibility 
 of 
 the 
 undertaking 
 The 
 end 
 product 
 must 
 be 
 of 
 supreme 
 quality 
 taking 
 into 
 account 
 potential 
 storage 
 limitations 
 and 
 network 
 capacity 
 constraints 
 Our 
 intention 
 is 
 to 
 prove 
 the 
 feasibility 
 and 
 build 
 the 
 platform 
 for 
 the 
 greater 
 community 
 to 
 enjoy
