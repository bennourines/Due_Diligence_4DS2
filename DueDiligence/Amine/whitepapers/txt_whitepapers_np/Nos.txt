has been staked for three months would grant five times more voting weight than its non staked equivalent A stake must consist of \xe2\x80\x8b10 000 NOS a \xe2\x80\x8b t minimum This 10 000 NOS minimum is the initial configuration of the network As any other configurable network option (including future staking bonuses though the stakes that are already locked and cannot yet be redeemed should have their vote weight \x0cbonus remain unaffected from future configuration changes) forging nodes can adjust this minimum at future blocks should they reach majority consensus After a s

the stake\xe2\x80\x99s (halved) VW is removed For example \xe2\x80\x8b If a wallet owner with 1\xe2\x80\x8b 0 000 NOS\xe2\x80\x8b (thus 10 000 VW) stakes all their NOS for t\xe2\x80\x8b hree

the stake can be redeemed at any time\xe2\x80\x8b When redeemed the \xe2\x80\x8b10 000 NOS \xe2\x80\x8bstake goes back to the owner\xe2\x80\x99s balance and their VW goes back to 10 000 A wallet can have multiple stakes (with varying amounts and durations) at any given time \x0cBenefits of Voting and Staking Network benefits The primary role of delegates is to secure the network and optionally to provide the network with valuable content as a curator Delegated Proof of Stake economics give delegates an incentive to acquire votes If a delegate has enough votes it would become a \xe2\x80\x8b ctive\xe2\x80\x8b thus earning block rewards A delegate is active if it\xe2\x80\x99s among the top forty seven delegates In an effort to garner votes delegates may pledge to provide v \xe2\x80\x8b arious services\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bthat contribute to the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x8b Such services could include \xe2\x97\x8f nOS codebase contributions and development \xe2\x97\x8f Distributing rewards to creators of curated content based on quality and popularity \xe2\x97\x8f Marketing and bounty campaigns \xe2\x97\x8f Hosting events (conferences hackathons competitions) \xe2\x97\x8f

\xe2\x80\x8bvote weighted\xe2\x80\x8b s \xe2\x80\x8b ervices \xe2\x80\x8bcould attract n \xe2\x80\x8b ew v \xe2\x80\x8b oters and persuade \xe2\x80\x8bexisting \xe2\x80\x8bvoters to increase their

Fees To submit a transaction to the network the signing wallet must pay a t\xe2\x80\x8b ransaction fee\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bThis is to discourage network abuse and to appropriately scale the rewards for delegates to process any volume of transactions A delegate receives a portion of the fees collected from all transactions made during their block while \xe2\x80\x8bthe majority of collected fees are removed permanently from circulation\xe2\x80\x8b The fee collection model is as follows \xe2\x97\x8f 100% of collected fees up to the amount equal to the block reward in a block are permanently removed from circulation \xe2\x97\x8f 50% of any remaining collected fees are also removed from circulation \xe2\x97\x8f The other 50% are awarded to the forging delegate \x0cThis fee system helps in combating possible shifts in vote weight going from voters towards delegates during times of increased transaction activity on the network Example 1 A block has collected \xe2\x97\x8e\xe2\x80\x8b10 00 i\xe2\x80\x8b n transaction fees 2 \xe2\x97\x8e\xe2\x80\x8b4 00 f\xe2\x80\x8b rom the collected fees (the amount equal to the block reward) are removed from circulation 3
