campaigns and data monetization to thwart ad fraud and help businesses create real personalization across customer journeys resulting in higher engagement and greater returns on marketing investment Using an SDK and API NOIZ has integrated its AI powered marketing campaigns with WordPress email service providers blockchain protocols ad networks chatbot services payment gateways and messenger apps An individual person or team can build and service their own customizable NOIZ campaigns and even contribute to the growing list of integrations Consumers who monetize their data are rewarded in NOIZ tokens In the fashion of a loyalty program framework they can redeem their NOIZ tokens for special offers and redeemed tokens are donated to social impact organizations This boosts the profile of the brand providing the special offer and this is how engagement becomes impact through NOIZ NOIZ is being built by a 10 person team including 1 serial entrepreneur 1 DSP architect and 2 lead developers with past experience at AxePay the Candadian Space Agency NEM and The Boeing Company DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 5 \x0c3 INTRODUCTION NOIZ is a platform that combines communication with marketing technology tools to help businesses acquire genuine data and to truly personalize customer journeys for a higher return on investment (ROI) NOIZ is also making use of blockchain technology to securely store and monetize consumer data converting the data to impact through loyalty rewards programs Efficient customer journeys an end to ad fraud and impact through data compensation that\xe2\x80\x99s the NOIZ advantage 3a Online Advertising Current State There are three core groups in online advertising and media consumers marketers and publishers With each group facing different challenges NOIZ has created solutions to help all three 3a i Consumer Perspective 1 Data Leakage According to the Princeton Web Transparency & Accountability Project1 76% of websites now contain Google trackers (cookies) and 24% have Facebook trackers With programmatic advertising cookies GPS tracking systems and bots all following consumer actions on and off line ad platforms publishers and third parties have been exploiting consumer data 2 Manipulation of information and opinion Due to leaked data consumers are frequently victimized and manipulated by malicious targeting Recent political campaigns around the world have used this to their advantage with 30+ countries already affected2 including the US China Russia Sudan and Mexico Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s data piracy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica3 is an example of how such data collection can occur 3 Lack of control Consumers are often unable to control what information is collected about them Options to \xe2\x80\x9copt out\xe2\x80\x9d exist on some platforms but consumers need to take deliberate actions in their accounts to make updates Most consumers struggle to protect their privacy either because they are unaware or find it challenging or tedious to navigate the process Consumers also have limited options when it comes to providing feedback They are unable to speak out for or against the marketers and publishers they like or dislike This leads to consumers continuously being exposed to advertisements they do not wish to see 1 2 3 https //webtap princeton edu/research/ https //www npr

analytica scandal with full page print ad/ DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 6 \x0c4 Irrelevant repetitive ads Consumers are tired of seeing irrelevant and persistent online ads As a result many consumers prefer not to see ads at all and end up using ad blocking services4 5 Lack of data ownership Consumers do not own the data that they generate they are not compensated for the information they provide to marketers publishers nor third parties Their personal information is instead freely traded as valuable data in the market as described in Point 1 of the Consumer Perspective 3a ii Marketer Perspective 1 Lack of data transparency Digital media has been estimated to take in US$ 237 billion in 2018 40% of the global ad expense This figure is expected to grow5 to US$ 291 billion or to 50% of global ad expense in 2020 Yet in a 2017 survey6 the vast majority of chief marketing officers responding said they could not demonstrate return on investment (ROI) for online advertising This is the result of programmed bots and scam accounts inflating the number of views clicks and impressions that determine the cost and effectiveness of digital advertising In 2017 big brands demanded greater data transparency from both ad networks such as Google and Facebook along with publishers such as NYTimes and ESPN P&G Chief Marketing Officer Marc Pritchard spearheaded this demand7 in January of 2017 Similarly even if marketers connect with publishers directly the problem still exists It is hard to validate the web traffic numbers provided by publishers and translate these numbers into accurate ROI and/or KPIs for marketers 2 Low ROI A Juniper Research report8 has predicted that ad fraud will consume US$ 42 billion in 2019 and US$ 100 billion in 2023 With ROI already being difficult to calculate due to fraudulent traffic the situation is made worse by the fact that fraudulent traffic consumes half of online advertising budgets 3 Inefficient Targeting Brands often end up displaying ads to consumers who often are uninterested in those particular ads This is due to targeting based on the analysis of online interactions and collected personal information This is not always accurate information however 4 Ads display next to malicious content hurting brand image Many ad platforms have been ineffective at keeping a check on malicious publishers (those that publish fake news plagiarised content or even extremist content9) thereby potentially harming the reputation of those who 4 5 6 7 8 9 https //marketingland com/survey shows us ad blocking usage 40

fees Ad networks exchanges and agencies all act as middlemen and take a portion of ad budgets that could instead be spent on additional ad space This money is lost as a result of working indirectly with publishers 3a iii Publisher Perspective 1 Lack of data transparency hinders content strategy Publishers use data analytics to optimize content strategy this includes methods of delivery (email social media time of day frequency) medium (video blog infographic) length (500 750 words 20 second videos) and topic Using skewed data to make the decisions which are meant to optimize this strategy means there is higher potential for errors in the content strategy 2 Lack of data transparency devalues media kits Media kits are the documents that publishers prepare to let the advertising community know the value of the publishers\xe2\x80\x99 ad space Publishers use information such as monthly page views unique visitors and subscribers along with demographic info such as location age and gender to create audience profiles in their media kits However the numbers and information they provide in their media kits can be skewed due to fraudulent traffic making the data they provide flawed Yet this flawed data is used by publishers to determine the value of their ad space With CMOs like P&G\xe2\x80\x99s Marc Pritchard demanding greater data transparency (as mentioned above) publishers will face the challenge of providing authenticated data in their media kits 3 Middlemen fees Like marketers publishers have the option to work with ad networks exchanges and agencies to sell ad space Publishers determine the value of their ad space and middlemen ensure the publisher receives the requested amount In this method marketers need to give more money to the middlemen which means less money gets spent on publishers\xe2\x80\x99 ad space 3b The NOIZ Solution Using blockchain technology AI a Software Development Kit (SDK) and an API NOIZ is redeveloping the online advertising industry by combining the following features 1 Asset creation and verification Large amounts of information are shared across the Internet every second of every day and this information is a huge asset in the hands of the right people To further explain each click view image and tag that a person company government or any organization generates through their online actions contributes to the exponentially growing pool of information known as Big Data For many Big Data provides information about target audiences constituents and economies Having such information allows decision making to be more accurate and efficient and that is valuable DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 8 \x0cHowever not all information holds the same value NOIZ is using blockchain and AI to verify the value of information that is shared across the online advertising and media industries creating true digital assets on which consumers marketers and publishers can all capitalize 2 Ad fraud prevention NOIZ analyzes campaign interaction data such as timestamps and mouse movements to filter out suspicious activity Consumers also need to complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) process to collect NOIZ tokens this is another layer of anti fraud protection 3 Ownership and transfer of digital assets through blockchain All private information that is shared on the NOIZ network is owned by those who create the information Marketers own the images and copy that make up their ads publishers own the content and ad space on their platforms consumers own the data that is created from their engagement and everyone owns their personally identifiable information This information the digital assets can be transferred shared and sold between the different actors of the NOIZ network and with individuals or organizations on non NOIZ networks creating a method for everyone to monetize the value of their digital assets (more details in section 7) 4 NOIZ SDK and API Marketers contribute to the development of NOIZ campaigns by integrating their own marketing components into the campaigns they create 5 Increased engagement Consumers are incentivized to engage with virtual assistant NIKOLA in marketing campaigns through the reward of NOIZ tokens Tests are being run to confirm the belief that token incentivization will increase engagement NOIZ\xe2\x80\x99s NIKOLA is a virtual assistant that complements the artwork of an ad by enabling marketers and publishers to converse directly with consumers This type of interactive advertising gives consumers greater opportunity to engage much more than the standard click NIKOLA also learns from consumers\xe2\x80\x99 engagement improving its conversational abilities over time and further increasing engagement through a more customized customer journey Consumer control over data resulting in hyper targeting (explained further in 3c i) also generates higher engagement 6 Engagement to impact NOIZ awards consumers tokens for sharing their personal information and online engagement data this data is converted into impact when consumers redeem their NOIZ tokens for special offers 7 Community regulated Decentralization is sought after by using consensus voting in combination with Proof of Stake (as explained further in section 5d) Actors in the NOIZ ecosystem can vote DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 9 \x0cup or down to indicate how they feel about the content and/or actions of other actors in the NOIZ community along with the other actors themselves Consumers can upvote or downvote specific marketers and publishers content social impact organizations as well as NOIZ\xe2\x80\x99s ad matching algorithm Marketers publishers and social impact organizations can also vote in similar ways but they cannot vote within their own category (i e marketers can\xe2\x80\x99t vote on other marketers) The Proof of Stake model adds weight to holding NOIZ tokens and strengthens the voting process preventing actors from voting maliciously 8 Peer to peer (P2P) marketplace NOIZ is an ad network that allows marketers and publishers to work with one another directly and transparently Once NIKOLA creates the first asset transfer for marketers and publishers NIKOLA will no longer be necessary to organize the transactions Instead on the NOIZ platform marketers and publishers will be able to streamline their system for selecting which ad space to purchase / which ads to allow 3c What Makes NOIZ Unique 3c i NOIZ Profiles NOIZ profiles are designed for consumers to easily create and store their engagement data and personal information on the NOIZ blockchain network This is the consumer information brands use to best deliver ads and other media online Consumers monetize the data stored in their NOIZ profiles by granting brands individuals and/or thirdparties access to target them based off this information Consumers can choose which parts of their NOIZ profiles they would like to share with whom They can opt to share only segments the entire NOIZ profile or none of it all As stated in the paragraph above this data is used to determine the flow of content consumers see online and with consumers in control of who has access to this data they are also in control of the content flow NOIZ users will be able to rank their data in different categories and have the data verified by friends or trusted 3rd parties (see section 4 for more details) This gives brands an idea of how true the data is that they use to target the consumer resulting in brands knowing exactly who to place their ads in front of and resulting in consumers seeing ads and media that are of actual interest to them This is known as hyper targeting and with consumers in control it is more efficient than ever before Consumers seeing ads and media they like means they will be more likely to engage which means brands will be more efficiently spending their ad budgets for significantly improved ROI DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 10 \x0c3c ii Conversational Data through Interactive Marketing Campaigns NOIZ equips display ads and web page marketing campaigns with virtual assistant NIKOLA creating campaigns that converses with consumers The fact that the campaign is cognitive will enable it to continuously learn from consumer interactions for the purpose of improving user experience and increasing engagement even further Conversational data is much more contextual than simple demographic data as well which provides marketers greater insight into their target audiences beyond that of even the NOIZ profiles 3c iii Social Impact NOIZ includes social impact organizations in its token economics allowing such organizations to receive tokens through the seamless transactional processes that occur between the other actors of the NOIZ community Should a consumer redeem tokens for special offers provided by an advertiser or publisher those redeemed tokens will be forwarded to social impact organizations Actors in the NOIZ community can also donate their tokens directly if they so choose 3c iv Experienced Team and Partners NOIZ has a team of professionals with over 150 years of collective experience in digital media In DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 11 \x0caddition to this NOIZ is partnered with well established agencies and ad networks As a result NOIZ is able to leverage the relationships these partner companies have with their clients to grow the advertiser and publisher communities in the NOIZ network NOIZ advisor and former Asia Miles CEO Stephen S Y Wong is an expert in rewards points systems and is using this expertise to help determine the reward process for the NOIZ ecosystem Helene Li another advisor of NOIZ is a consultant and Top 10 Influencer of sustainability and social impact investing She is passionately working towards purpose led investment becoming mainstream in the financial industry and she is using this passion to help boost investment and partnership opportunities for NOIZ Co founder of 8 Decimal Capital Herbie Fu is an advisor investor and strategic partner for over 10 blockchain projects and he is now using his expertise to advise on the NOIZ project 3c v Governance NOIZ has combined a consensus voting system with Proof of Stake This enables community members to form a token backed consensus for three purposes 1 To upvote or downvote on advertisers publishers and social impact organizations staying within the NOIZ ecosystem of integrity and remain compliant with the community standards 2 To upvote or downvote advertiser\xe2\x80\x99s ads and publisher\xe2\x80\x99s contents 3 To educate the NOIZ\xe2\x80\x99s ad matching algorithm Simply voting with no stakes tells NIKOLA how better to deliver content to consumers on individual levels but votes that are backed using the Proof of Stake mechanism indicate a desire to keep or remove an actor and/or an actor\xe2\x80\x99s content In this way the community governance is also a layer of filtration for keeping malicious parties and their content out of the NOIZ ecosystem 3d NOIZ Value 3d i Token Use 1 Marketers use NOIZ tokens to pay community members and publishers for marketing campaign creation and distribution and to purchase consumer data 2 Publishers use NOIZ tokens to purchase consumer data attract new viewership and become marketers (for subscriptions) 3 Consumers use NOIZ tokens to earn special offers on products and services provided by marketers and publishers DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 12 \x0c4 Social impact organizations use NOIZ tokens to create ads they can also sell their tokens to the marketers looking to purchase tokens for marketing campaigns 5 The more tokens that are held by an actor of the NOIZ ecosystem the higher that actor\xe2\x80\x99s trust score and the greater weight on his or her votes 3d ii Business Value 1 NOIZ has monetized consumer data and created a marketplace in which this data can be sold and purchased 2 Programmatic advertising algorithms that are trainable will be used for the ad matching optimization 3 Marketers choose and create the dialogue / interaction flow on their advertisements allowing marketers to collect a plethora of consumer information 4 NOIZ will create marketing campaigns on behalf of marketers should they request in exchange for NOIZ tokens 5 NOIZ campaigns are customizable so that marketers can create the user experience their audience wants 6 NOIZ will also implement other interactive ads into the NOIZ ecosystem enabling NOIZ to not only have conversational data but also interaction data from other ad forms such as interactive videos AR/VR and affiliate programs DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 13 \x0c4 NOIZ PROFILES & HYPER TARGETING 4a NOIZ Profiles Engagement data automatically accumulates in an individual\xe2\x80\x99s NOIZ profile if the individual allows it Additionally consumers can upload their lifestyle data directly into their NOIZ profiles or by interacting with NIKOLA NOIZ profiles are stored on the NOIZ blockchain network Thus authenticating consumer data keeping it safe from being hacked or leaked giving consumers control over who has access to their data and enabling consumers to monetize this data 4a i Lifestyle Data Lifestyle data includes 1 Images (with keyword tags) 2 Videos (with keyword tags) 3 Demographic Information such as a Age b Gender c Location 4 Personal details such as a Favorite color is green b Father/mother of two children 5 Personal preferences such as a Preferring hiking over biking b Preferring blue over red 6 Interests such as a Modern art b Travel 4a ii Validation of NOIZ Profile Consumers can grant their friends access to all or some of the lifestyle data stored in their NOIZ profiles and then request that their friends upvote the lifestyle data made available to them Having friends upvote one anothers\xe2\x80\x99 lifestyle data helps to verify that the information is true making it more valuable to brands A data needs to be validated by half of user\xe2\x80\x99s friend community to be considered as approved trustful and premium data DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 14 \x0c4a iii Validation Points Consumers acquire validation points on their lifestyle data each time another user provides an upvote Validation points are used to segment consumers into tiers based on a general score of all validation points they have in different categories Each category has its own validation score and each user has an overall validation score The higher the overall validation score is the better the special offers will be when the consumer chooses to redeem his or her NOIZ tokens 4a iv NOIZ Badges Validations points are associated with categories or tags known as NOIZ badges Consumers can be targeted based off which badges they have For example Consumer A has a photo of him/herself playing tennis and that photo is upvoted by Consumer A\xe2\x80\x99s friends 10 times Consumer A now has a score of 10 in both the Tennis badge and the Sports badge Earning different NOIZ Badges allows users to have access to special offers specifically created for badge owners (e g promotion on Tennis rackets for Tennis badge owners) Badges are created over time by NOIZ users are able to create new badges as well which become accepted after the badge receives enough validation points from other community members 4a v Monetization of NOIZ Profiles Consumers monetize the data stored in their NOIZ profiles by granting brands individuals and/or thirdparties access to the information Consumers can choose which parts of their NOIZ profiles they would like to share with whom They can opt to share some segments the entire NOIZ profile or none of it all 4b Hyper targeting With consumers having control over the information that brands use to target them they now have the control over the flow of advertisements and other media that are displayed to them online From a brand\xe2\x80\x99s perspective they use the information they know about consumers to optimize advertising and media strategies With consumers granting trusted brands access to their Lifestyle Persona data\xe2\x80\x94 which could differ on a brand by brand basis\xe2\x80\x94consumers are enabling brands to hyper target them As a result consumers will see the ads that are specific to their interests which leads to higher engagement and more efficient ad spend for brands A Proof of Engagement concept is created by using AI and blockchain to verify users and authenticate engagement preventing ad fraud from occurring within the NOIZ ecosystem DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 15 \x0c5 NOIZ SERVICES FOR MARKETERS NOIZ has started offering value to marketers through campaign management services

users and authenticate engagement preventing ad fraud from occurring within the NOIZ ecosystem Authenticated data provides marketers with the transparency they so rightfully deserve and desire This allows marketers and publishers to make more accurate decisions from data analysis resulting in higher ROIs Proof of Engagement is achieved through conversing with NIKOLA in cognitive marketing campaigns where REM Passive Monitoring and verification of users occurs 6a What is NIKOLA NIKOLA is a virtual assistant that NOIZ has equipped to the creative of display ads to make cognitive marketing campaigns currently in the form of display ads and web/landing pages A plug in to equip emails with the cognitive marketing campaign is also on the horizon This new campaign technology stores conversational data from user interactions and learns from the collected information\xe2\x80\x94using AI and NLP methodologies\xe2\x80\x94to better improve its conversational abilities in the future This results in a friendlier more personalized user experience NIKOLA is able to work with multiple languages using freestyle text or voice messages It is currently operating within English Chinese and Korean at text levels NIKOLA can also classify consumer responses their engagement into a Level of Intent system and deliver tokens to consumers based on this rating system Level of Intent

Lead Generation Dialogue 2 Customer Service Dialogue 3 Brand Engagement 4 Campaign Promotion 5 Event/Sign up/Subscription Engagement 6 e Commerce 7 Online to Offline (O2O) Traffic 8 Surveys 9 Gamification 10 Loyalty Extension Promotion 11 Localized & Personalised Attraction Promotion 12 Live Video Interactions 6b NLP and NLG Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) improve enable NIKOLA to analyze and continuously improve conversational data Through such a feeding process NIKOLA is able to gain valuable insight of user behavior and generate satisfactory responses which evoke positive emotions from users NIKOLA will be trained to reach a high level of accuracy in predicting the most relevant underlying content to help unveil the most wanted subject related to a potential customer The purpose of NLP Natural Language Processing means analyzing natural languages to generate a structured model through text data The purpose of NLG Natural Language Generation means simulating natural language from the generated model 6b i Purposed Workflows 1 NLP In this initial stage NIKOLA analyzes the input of the conversation text from NOIZ ads and transforms it into structured data a The basic components of a given language can be broken down into \t\t i Lexical basic structure of the text \t\t ii Morphology analysis of the structure of each word (e g birds = + noun + plural) \t\t iii Vocabulary the set of words of a language b The following levels of linguistic analysis can be found \t\t i Pragmatics intended meaning of the sentence DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 21 \x0c\t\t ii Semantics meaning of the sentence \t\t iii Syntax grammatical structure of the sentence Lexical \xe2\x80\xa2 Morphology Split text in sentences and

eligible underlying \xe2\x80\x9clanguage model\xe2\x80\x9d from which we can sample in order to generate text to improve the output performance of NIKOLA a Foundation models through which the most eligible model is built upon i Probabilistic Language Model Assigns a probability for the next part of the sequence (e g Conditional Frequency Distribution) DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 22 \x0cii Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) finds internal representation of sequence instead of exact matches (e g long short term memory RNN architecture could be a good choice to predict the very next point of a given time series) iii Generative Advanced Networks (GANs) distinguish fake images from a real images 6c REM and Passive Monitoring NIKOLA comes equipped with Run time Execution Monitoring (REM) and Passive Monitoring These two forms of AI algorithms enable NIKOLA to analyze user actions before and after the actions are made Should NIKOLA suspect any foul play in a user\xe2\x80\x99s activities\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because multiple users perform the exact same actions in the exact same amount of time\xe2\x80\x94that user will be put up for review by the NOIZ community\xe2\x80\x99s elected NOIZers (as described in section 5a 4) and possibly blocked from the NOIZ ecosystem REM and Passive Monitoring pair with the marketing campaign to analyze conversations As the campaign generates more opportunities for consumers to perform actions NIKOLA will be able to analyze the wording sentence structure and frequency of button clicks that a consumer performs As more information becomes available to be analyzed through the conversational data NIKOLA will continuously update its REM and Passive Monitoring algorithms blacklisting fraudulent actions In its current state due to this new method of NIKOLA asking consumers to perform interactions NIKOLA will be capable of identifying spambots and fraudulent accounts 6d Verified Users NOIZ is a permission based blockchain network that requires users to complete a KYC process This registration process helps to prevent fraudulent actors such as spambots and scammers from joining the NOIZ community Should community members deem another actor in the NOIZ ecosystem as being fraudulent they can vote to have the fraudulent actor removed from the network Blockchain also enables NOIZ to analyze transaction history which sets up an additional process for verifying users as fraudulent users would have transaction histories that are flagged DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 23 \x0c7 TOKEN ECONOMICS 7a Actors of the NOIZ Ecosystem Actors or parties of the NOIZ ecosystem make up the community They are those who have completed the KYC process and have been granted access to the NOIZ permission based blockchain network The devices that are granted to be nodes make up the storage space that NOIZ and its data will exist upon and this network of nodes will be confidential The actors of the NOIZ platform consist of 1 Marketers These are the brands wishing to place ads across the NOIZ ecosystem 2 Publishers These are the brands that create content to attract and grow audience members Publishers sell ad space on their sites to fund content creation 3 Consumers These are the people who view and interact with the NOIZ ads exchanging their personal information only to those they so choose and being rewarded for doing so 4 NOIZers These are the actors who have been elected by the NOIZ community to be the key decision makers of the consensuses that are formed through the voting process 5 NIKOLA This is the virtual assistant for the NOIZ ecosystem and is the combination of several machine learning algorithms It handles cognitive interactive conversations with users filtering out fraudulent traffic and securely storing data and other digital assets across the NOIZ blockchain network 6 Social Impact Organizations These organisations are beneficiaries of donated and redeemed tokens DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 24 \x0c7b Token Flow NOIZ tokens can be purchased from and/or traded by any member of the NOIZ community Once community members hold tokens depending on their selected actor role they can perform a variety of different actions 1 Create Marketing Campaign Marketers use NOIZ tokens to purchase ad space from publishers create marketing campaigns and reward consumers 2 Share Data Consumers generate conversational data by chatting with the cognitive ads this data is provided to the marketers that create the ads 3 Receive NOIZ Tokens Consumers are awarded with NOIZ tokens by the marketers for sharing access to conversational data and personally identifiable information 4 Receive In ad Special Offers Consumers can receive special offers within the marketing campaigns themselves or by looking through a brand\xe2\x80\x99s profile on the NOIZ app Marketers provide special offers in exchange for redeemed NOIZ tokens Redeemed tokens are then forwarded to social impact organizations 5 Purchase Data From their dashboards publishers and third parties can use NOIZ tokens to purchase consumers\xe2\x80\x99 conversational data and personally identifiable information should the consumers approve 6 Monetize Data Consumers can sell their data to marketers publishers and third parties in exchange for NOIZ tokens DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 25 \x0c7 Redeem Tokens Consumers can access their NOIZ wallets to view special offers located on brands\xe2\x80\x99 profiles Consumers redeem their NOIZ tokens for these offers and the tokens are forwarded to social impact organizations 8 Receive Special Offers Consumers receive special offers by redeeming their tokens 7c Personal Interest Votes Individuals can upvote or downvote content and/or actors of the NOIZ community to indicate personal preferences This system operates in a similar way to \xe2\x80\x98following\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98unfollowing\xe2\x80\x99 people on social media The purpose of indicating preferences through votes is to allow NOIZ community members to more easily control the flow of information that is presented to them through their online advertising experience As an example perhaps Consumer A sees an ad about basketball but Consumer A greatly dislikes basketball The ad is appearing because Consumer A is 18 25 years old male and has previously engaged with a golf (sports) ad By downvoting the basketball ad Consumer A is indicating that he simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the ad or similar ads in the future For consumers personal interest votes can occur directly within the marketing campaign or within the NOIZ wallet Marketers publishers and social impact organizations wishing to make personal interest votes can do so from their dashboards 7d Proof of Stake and Consensus NOIZ is using a revolutionary Proof of Stake and consensus mechanism that enables actors of the NOIZ platform to hold themselves accountable for one another\xe2\x80\x99s actions Proof of Stake only applies to the strengthening of the NOIZ ecosystem It can combine with the voting system in order to form a consensus A vote that is staked indicates that a NOIZ actor has expressed explicit interest in having another actor or another actor\xe2\x80\x99s content removed through a consensus vote where all votes are backed by stakes Parameters effectively a Constitution will clearly address voting rules such as duration and proportions of stakes and votes necessary to form a consensus Here\xe2\x80\x99s how the Proof of Stake and Consensus mechanism works 1 Community cleanup Should NOIZ actors wish to remove content or other actors from the ecosystem they need to validate their vote by placing a stake on it This is designed to prevent actors from voting out content solely due to a personal dislike for or grudge with a brand Providing a stake behind a vote should only occur when the individual voting believes content and/or an actor are truly inappropriate for the NOIZ community DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 26 \x0c2 Correcting content matching NIKOLA uses an algorithm to match advertiser content with publisher content and in doing so places stakes on it\xe2\x80\x99s matches If NIKOLA makes a mistake with the matching and places a divorce attorney ad on a wedding site the community can vote against the placement rather than the ad the advertiser or the publisher 3 Supporting stakes Marketers in the NOIZ ecosystem are required to stake the advertisements they put on display Doing so certifies their confidence that the ad meets the standards of the NOIZ community Publishers are not required to stake their content however their content can be voted against and removed from the NOIZ ecosystem as well Staking their content will help to prevent this 4 Returned stakes If staked content is not voted to be removed the stakes in support of the content will be returned to the actor(s) who placed the supporting stakes The actor of these returned supporting stakes will also receive a higher trust score adding greater weight to their future stakes 5 Winning stakes NOIZers (mentioned in section 5a 4) will review consensuses to determine if verdicts are valid Should a consensus be deemed valid the actors who win the consensus will be rewarded the tokens from the actor(s) who lose the vote 7d i Trust Score A trust score is calculated using the following factors 1 Token amount The amount of tokens an actor holds will affect their trust score Those with large amounts of tokens held will have higher trust scores 2 Stakes won / returned Actors who place stakes and are part of a winning consensus will receive higher trust scores Actors who place stakes that go unchallenged receive their stakes back and a higher trust score 3 Successful transactions The number of successful transactions that an actor performs will increase the actor\xe2\x80\x99s trust score To prevent new users from being taken advantage of by those with high trust scores a grace period is assigned to new users where their trust scores will be equivalent to that of the community average A maximum trust score will exist to prevent actors from holding too great of a weight keeping the Proof of Stake and voting system balanced Trust scores may also become tiered in future versions of NOIZ DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 27 \x0c8 SOCIAL IMPACT FACTOR It is very important to the NOIZ team to make a true global impact with this project hence the reason social impact organizations are included in the NOIZ ecosystem Before tokens are sent to social impact organizations though they are stored among 17 buckets that represent the UN\xe2\x80\x99s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Each bucket will have a set limit once the limit is reached the tokens within will be distributed amongst social impact organizations that are specifically dedicated to the cause associated with the bucket and are part of the NOIZ community In other words if SDG Bucket #2 Zero Hunger reaches its token limit of 10 000 NOIZ tokens the 10 000 tokens will be donated to social impact organizations devoted to feeding the hungry 8a Incentivization through Donation Any actor of the NOIZ ecosystem can directly donate NOIZ tokens to the 17 buckets representing the UN\xe2\x80\x99s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) However the majority of tokens donated would be coming from the token redemption program Marketers and publishers can provide special offers such as product discounts limited time deals and rewards points in exchange for consumers\xe2\x80\x99 redeeming their NOIZ tokens All tokens that are redeemed for special offers will be donated to social impact organizations making the incentive of the special offers simultaneously represent an incentive to make the world a better place As consumers redeem their NOIZ tokens for special offers they will be supporting a good cause Through this dual incentive not only does engagement with ads increase but so too does the amount of NOIZ tokens being donated to social impact organizations Consumers and brands will also be able to boast how many tokens they\xe2\x80\x99ve donated to which social impact organizations making this process competitive and adding yet another incentive to redeem / donate NOIZ tokens 8b Choosing a social impact organization to support Brands will have the option to select which social impact organizations are on the receiving end of the redeemed tokens allowing for brands to work with organizations they have already opted to support such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) campaigns If a brand chooses not to select a specific social impact organization to support the redeemed tokens the brand receives will be donated to one or several of the social impact organizations that are on an approved list DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 28 \x0cConsumers marketers and publishers will also be able to view the profiles of social impact organizations in the NOIZ ecosystem via the NOIZ wallet / dashboard Actors can then donate NOIZ tokens directly to the social impact organization(s) of their choosing 8c Why Provide Special Offers It is not mandatory for brands to provide special offers however this is a feature for brands that want to show the world how they are making an impact at the same time they providing special offers is a useful marketing technique to promote products and/or services Each token that is donated to a social impact organization through a brand\xe2\x80\x99s special offer will contribute to an Impact Score that the brand can display to the world 8d Social Impact Organizations Make Use of NOIZ Tokens With social impact organizations on the receiving end of many NOIZ tokens they will be able to 1 Sell their tokens to marketers wishing to create more NIKOLA ads 2 Create and place ads on the NOIZ network promoting events donation pages etc DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 29 \x0c9 BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER DESIGN AND DATA MONETIZATION 9a Cross chain Ledger NOIZ is partnered with IBM Blockchain Harmony (One) NEM and XCHNG protocols and the NOIZ tokens have been created on the Ethereum network Different types of asset transfers can occur on different protocols In the case of asset transfers between advertisers and publishers XCHNG is designed to make the process of buying and selling ad space easier and faster for brands Marketers will also be able to choose which blockchain protocol they would like to integrate with their marketing campaigns Allowing them to choose where the campaign data is stored In the case of Fortune 500 companies who tend to be skeptical of blockchain IBM blockchain provides a peace of mind for such large companies as it carries the weight of IBMs reputation DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 30 \x0c9b Data Monetization through NEM Blockchain Asset Transfer 9b i Types of Interactions The NOIZ platform creates secure interactions between industry stakeholders to facilitate the following actions 1 Marketers can announce their advertising campaigns and optionally put them out to tender 2 Publishers can indicate their preferences and capabilities such as types of ads that can be paired with their content and prices for ad free experience They can also communicate special offers and bounty programs to consumers 3 Consumers can specify which types of engagement data and personally identifiable information (PII) are allowed to be shared when other actors opt to purchase their data They can set parameters that marketers and third parties must meet if wanting to purchase the consumer data For example the purchaser may be required to provide their name to the consumer 4 Social Impact Organisations can set parameters such as types of actors allowed to make donations and minimum / maximum donation amounts NOIZ records all donations and issues receipts for publisher and advertiser tokens sent to social impact organizations in the NOIZ network DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 31 \x0c5 Proof of Stake Actors can place stakes for or against another actor or content within the NOIZ ecosystem 6 Trade and Purchase Actors in the NOIZ ecosystem can exchange value by transferring NOIZ tokens and may trade tokens or purchase new tokens 7 Public Network NOIZ will facilitate and verify peer to peer interactions between consumers and purchasers of their private data from outside the NOIZ ecosystem 8 Conventional Marketing NOIZ data can be used for conventional digital marketing such as retargeting on Google or Facebook Search Engine Marketing and email marketing 9b ii Data Monetization Consumer data is monetized when consumers opt to share their engagement data and personally identifiable information to marketers publishers and third parties Consumers set their own rules of which purchasers must abide by should they wish to acquire the consumers\xe2\x80\x99 data In addition to setting minimum price levels consumers can also request personally identifiable information from the purchaser like name and location In this way consumers can be always aware of who has their data Data that is sold through the NOIZ public network can be purchased with cryptocurrencies other than NOIZ tokens DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 32 \x0c10 NOIZ BUSINESS MODEL 10a NOIZ Ad Network 10a i Peer to Peer Advertising Marketplace NOIZ uses asset transfers to create a peer to peer (P2P) campaign marketplace where marketers publishers and designers can directly connect with one another on the NOIZ platform and make an agreement over a campaign Marketers will be able to enlist their campaigns which publishers can opt to pick up or marketers can directly approach publishers and apply for the enlisted rates of display ads on the publisher\xe2\x80\x99s media network 10a ii Peer to Peer Consumer Data Marketplace Marketers publishers and third parties can all purchase consumers\xe2\x80\x99 shared data should the consumers choose to sell Marketers who place the ads will send automatic requests for access to data each time someone engages In these situations consumers choose to provide their information rather than having it extracted DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 33 \x0cOther marketers publishers and third parties interested in purchasing consumer data will be required to go through the conditions that the consumers have set up as described in section 9b i 3 Consumers will be able to decide what data they wish to share and with whom and they will be rewarded in NOIZ tokens and other cryptocurrencies for sharing their information 10a iii Programmatic Ad Buying In using programmatic ad buying NOIZ will automate the process of providing marketers with the ideal times locations and bid prices in which marketers can best reach their target audiences and significantly improve ROI All programmatic ad buying algorithms require user data in order to perform such predictive analyses Since NOIZ uses its Proof of Engagement system to authenticate user data digital ad placement through NOIZ will be more effective than on conventional ad exchange networks 10a iv Campaign Targeting Options 1 Automatic Targeting (Category Targeting) This is a type of targeting where a marketer can launch ads by including a set of keywords to target and NIKOLA automatically finds the appropriate publishers / content / audiences that interacts with such kinds of ads 2 Manual Targeting (Private Bidding) In this type of targeting marketers can directly approach publishers and offer them an advertising contract via the NOIZ platform If publishers accept the ad goes on their website 3 Audience targeting Marketers can search in the NOIZ blockchain and select consumers based upon their past interactions with other marketers and data sharing preferences stored on the NOIZ platform sending the creatives directly into such audience members\xe2\x80\x99 NOIZ wallets 10b NOIZ Wallet Each new actor in the NOIZ platform gets a NOIZ NEM account and wallet or they can register using any NEM compatible wallet which also identifies them uniquely in the in the NOIZ ecosystem The wallet ID is how actors (marketers publishers consumers and social impact organizations) will be recognized and tracked While all the NOIZ tokens can flow freely only registered NOIZ participants wallets will be able to conduct transactions (i e creating new AI powered marketing campaigns) on the NOIZ network This allows NOIZ to verify actors participating in the ecosystem Any person can play multiple roles in the NOIZ ecosystem marketers can use their wallet with NOIZ tokens to login to the dashboard and create new advertisements or data collection campaigns Publishers
