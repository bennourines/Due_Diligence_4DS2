revolution Follow the Token Sale on https //wildcrypto com/ 5 \x0cThe Problem The Traditional Lottery Market Today the lottery sector has become one of the largest industries in the world and the online lottery industry is still growing It is considered to have significant growth potential PWC in their Global Gaming Outlook said the online market is complementary to the offline indicating huge growth potential The market is huge standing at $280+ billion with approximately only 4% of this online According to the World Lottery Association this percentage is growing rapidly hence the entire industry is set for disruption In today\xe2\x80\x99s global society it is astounding that players only have local lotteries to play Not only do players suffer poor odds (156 million to 1) or slightly better odds with low jackpot prizes they have to walk to the shop and buy a paper ticket Even with extremely low odds traditional lotteries successfully sell hope to the World Hope is clearly a valuable commodity and even amongst the poorest countries according to a national polls players spend an average 2 3% of their total household income per year on lottery tickets Everybody likes to play the lottery Today country governments heavily regulate and guard their local country lottery With each government taking their \xe2\x80\x98cut of the prize\xe2\x80\x99 (in taxes license fees regulatory charges and charitable charges) there is little profit left to enrich player experience and fun exciting jackpot prizes Wild Crypto is changing the game with WILD the lottery is now a simple game of numbers with significantly better players chances of winning bigger jackpots than anywhere else 6 \x0cThe Market Today the lottery sector has become one of the largest industries in the world and the online lottery industry is still growing it is considered to have significant growth potential It is important to appreciate that a lottery is a unique gambling event because it costs a proportionately small amount for good win odds and a large jackpot prize Lotteries offer by far the best odds of winning when played on a global scale Thanks to the innovation of crypto the prohibition of a global lottery has now been lifted Currently the market is measured economically in fiat currencies with the majority of sales via government backed monopolies This is not the true market potential the bigger picture is obscured and even so the market is huge and breaks down as follows Today the lottery segment holds a 29% share of the global gambling revenue but when focusing specifically on the online gambling section the lottery is responsible for only 10% of the revenues The forecast is that this gap will be closing rapidly within the next few years as online lottery activity grows Further proof the global market is moving online can be seen when analyzing Camelot the respected UK lottery provider which grew its digital channels by 72% with sales via smart phones and tablets accounted for 35% of sales 7 \x0cThe Market The UK whilst a mature market demonstrated that sales are rapidly moving online perhaps more interesting is that it only actually ranks 52nd on spend per capita globally A recent report by Global Betting & Gambling Consultants (GBGC) illustrates that global online lotteries are in general a significantly untapped market with just 3 6% of global lottery sales taking place online Once again this is far from the complete market potential It is based on a traditional model in traditional markets If the global market was presented with a game that offered significantly better odds of winning and engaging content on the same terms via a global currency the market size could widen significantly 8 \x0cExisting Market Players Crypto currency is starting to be accepted on some gaming sites indeed some are encouraging pay outs in Crypto due to the inherent advantages of speed and cost There are a couple of competitors in the Crypto Lottery market which are positioned below as you will see from the analysis this sector is relatively untapped The existing players are True Flip odds are 1 in 49 million jackpot $260K (with 4% transaction fee) jurisdiction Costa Rica (unregulated) Crypto Lottery this is actually a raffle not a lottery with a prize based on the number of tickets sold this will limit the prizes and therefore the desirability Kibo Lotto 6 from 49 numbers gives odds of 12 million the jackpot is based on the number of players so will be limited From the best we can tell Kibo seems to be based in Singapore where gambling is prohibited apart from government approved exceptions which are not mentioned on the Kibo site as having By Contrast Wild Crypto will have odds ranging from 3 million to 1 to 12 million to 1 depending on the game Jackpots will be progressive starting from $10 million Wild Crypto offer a suite of Instant Win games to complement the lottery offering with Slots and Casino to follow Wild Crypto are regulated in Curacao and the platform is regulated in Jersey In summary the competitors Jackpot prizes are small unlikely to grow and they have no complementary games content They have very poor usability and little if anything in terms of regulatory approvals Considering their weaknesses these lotteries have done ok True Flip even had a successful Token Sale with what is a very mediocre platform Wild Crypto is already significantly ahead of the game 9 \x0cCompetive Advantage Wild Crypto has the Competitive Advantage The world\xe2\x80\x99s first truly global and regulated Crypto Lottery with WILD as the global currency Our jackpots will be progressive and huge with by far the best odds globally The lottery platform will also provide a suite of the most entertaining complementary games Pay out will be to a player\xe2\x80\x99s wallet or to our branded WILD pre paid card that can be used world wide Wild Crypto is the first global lottery to create its own lottery gaming currency WILD Tokens can be used across all lottery and instant win games on the platform making the WILD a token of true gaming value Increase the size market by providing a mobile focused product to the un served 18 45 age group Due to the Token Sale part funding the initial prize pool Wild Crypto can deliver huge progressive jackpots from launch They will redefine the crypto value proposition of ticket price and the prize They will also increase the win probability creating greater hope of a win They will also increase the number of players engaging in a winners experience and therefore increase the potential player market and crowd content With a content rich and dynamic lotto and gaming platform Wild Crypto will also stimulate the players habit formation developing loyal player relationships and a higher play to win spend Players are assured of the governance and game controls of a tier 1 regulatory environment 10 \x0cThe Solution Wild Crypto intends to drive this market expansion by offering a global lottery based on its own crypto currency (called WILD) to facilitate a global online market that has thus far not been possible Wild Crypto is regulated in a tier one Jurisdiction Curacao and will acknowledge social responsibility ensuring players are of the appropriate age and providing facilities for problem gamblers to limit their plays or exclude themselves for periods of time in line with best practice Wild Crypto can provide a range of lotteries and games that improve the win odds from 156 million to 1 (in the case of the Euro millions) to 3 million to 1 (in the case of Wild Crypto Lotto) With huge jackpots Wild Crypto may have several weekly multi million token winners Wild Crypto is able to increase win odds in several ways \xe2\x80\xa2 As a technology business we are inherently more efficient we outsource non core activities to trusted partners \xe2\x80\xa2 We are commercially more efficient using self insured prizes which is made possible through the Token Sale \xe2\x80\xa2 Using a dynamic approach to the price of tickets and the associated prizes offering complementary games with different return to player percentages \t\t Slots up to 98% \t\t Instant Win games up to 80% \t\t Lotto ranges vary from 35% to 75% \t\t Virtual sports odds can vary depending on the game Wild Crypto further addresses the market in 5 key ways \xe2\x80\xa2 By increasing the size of the market by offering a seamless decentralized lottery using our Ethereum ERC20 based WILD Token \xe2\x80\xa2 By increasing the size of the market by offering mobile focused product to the un served 18 45 age group \xe2\x80\xa2 By providing unprecedented odds and player experience by eliminating bureaucratic overheads and government

\x0cRegulation Wild Crypto is based and regulated in Curacao by https //www curacao egaming com Curacao has been chosen for its understanding of blockchain and its implementation within the eGaming environment Curacao has been the leading place for regulation in the eGaming arena with regulated jurisdictions for blockchain However it is noted that this month another eGaming regulator has started to engage Malta (http //www mga org mt) has just announced it is to regulate blockchain eGaming though there are no specific details The Isle of Man regulator has also announced it will regulate crypto based gambling https //www gov im/about the government/statutory boards/gambling supervision commission) this is important as it demonstrates growing acceptance from regulators for the business model A regulated lottery specialist Twelve40 Limited (http //twelve40 com) supplies the certified back end game technology Twelve40 have a state of the art platform for lottery and lottery games the results of games will be immediately placed on the blockchain to demonstrate probity They are regulated in Jersey a tier 1 jurisdiction ( see platform providers in list of licensees https //www jgc je/list oflicensees ) This provides assurance to Operators and their players that the games are tested certified true to the published odds and therefore fair Self Regulation via the Blockchain Wild Crypto have developed a revolutionary model Not only are they regulated and certified by the traditional regulators Wild Crypto has self imposed a hybrid blockchain solution that benefits the players whilst maintaining the traditional game controls that regulators are comfortable with Wild Crypto pushes game \t\t results to an Ethereum blockchain meaning for the first time the lotto is truly compliant tamper proof and transparent Wild Crypto leads the future of lotto regulatory compliance As regulators globally become more comfortable with the application of blockchain technology to the eGaming sector Wild Crypto and their partner Twelve40 will develop more of their technology in that direction Today however eGaming industry regulators are conservative by nature and are therefore only typically comfortable to evolve as technology matures The optimal way today to provide a regulated and certified blockchain lottery experience in this environment is to deliver a hybrid solution that benefits the players whilst maintaining the traditional game controls that regulators are comfortable with 15 \x0cIntellectual Property The Wild Crypto IP is held in a Jersey holding company The Wild Crypto mark is already registered All of the games that appear on the platform are also protected individually with the respective third party gaming providers The WILD Token The WILD Token is an Ethereum based ERC20 token of value The token is a digital asset bearing value by itself based on its underlying assets properties and/or associated rights Ethereum based tokens rely on a well established Ethereum infrastructure benefiting from several advantages \xe2\x80\xa2 Security and predictability (as opposed to for example having to run an independent blockchain network) \xe2\x80\xa2 Use of robust and well supported clients (Ethereum based tokens can be managed with official Ethereum clients) \xe2\x80\xa2 High liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum based tokens or Ether) easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place Our Ethereum based token contract complies with the ERC20 standard More detailed info about the ERC20 standard can be obtained from https //github com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20 Because our WILD Tokens are created on the Ethereum ERC20 standard it can be easily stored and transferred as any other Ether token We recommend \xe2\x80\x9cMyEtherWallet\xe2\x80\x9d for Storage and \xe2\x80\x9cEtherDelta\xe2\x80\x9d for trading We also intend to have WILD Tokens listed on larger exchanges once the Token Sale is complete A Wild Crypto \xe2\x80\x9cWinners Club\xe2\x80\x9d pre pay card accepted worldwide will be available (conditions will apply) so that players can conveniently spend their winnings 16 \x0cExchange & Wallet We are currently working hard to add to the list of following exchanges \xe2\x80\xa2 Cryptopia \xe2\x80\xa2 HitBTC \xe2\x80\xa2 Bithumb \xe2\x80\xa2 Huobi China \xe2\x80\xa2 And others \xe2\x80\x83 The Wild Crypto Wallet & Security The team at Wild Crypto are heavily invested in the security of the WILD Token and the Wild Crypto Wallet after all they are protecting their own money as well as yours The WILD Tokens fund jackpots It is essential that the crypto wallet is secure and that prizes are expedited quickly to ensure the best winners experience We segregate funds as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 Player fund wallet \xe2\x80\x93 legally owned by the players \xe2\x80\xa2 Prize fund wallet \xe2\x80\x93 separated to ensure there is cover to pay out all the jackpots and prizes \xe2\x80\xa2 Eco mine / bonus wallet \xe2\x80\x93 to pay out bonuses \xe2\x80\xa2 Operations wallet \xe2\x80\x93 Business operations \xe2\x80\xa2 Plus a cold storage facility Because our WILD Tokens are created on the Ethereum ERC20 standard it can be easily stored transferred and converted to fiat as any other Ether token Wild Crypto employs a 4 eyes and 4 keys approach to crypto currency transactions To approve any transaction we have a 4 eyes (2 human approvals to pay away) and 2 keys (2 keys to action pay away) approach on all transactions greater than $50 000 17 \x0cTimeline Token Sale and Launch dates & Wild Crypto Timeline Key dates The Wild Crypto early adopter round was sold out in 24 hours on the 16th August 2017 selling 9 000 000 WILD Tokens The Wild Crypto Pre Token Sale will launch on September 2nd 2017 at 9am EST and will last for 24 hours at an exchange rate of 3000 1 and offer 6 million tokens for sale The Wild Crypto Token Sale will launch on September 5th 2017 at 8 00 am GMT+1 and will last for 7 Days at an exchange rate of 2000 1 and offer 30 million tokens for sale The Wild Crypto Lotto Platform will launch in January 2018 ahead of the ICE Gaming Conference where we will be able to boast our Crypto Lotto jackpot as 40 times higher than our competitors We hope to make a one lucky player a \t\t Millionaire each and every month Meanwhile Eco mining / bonus will be available immediately returning 8 33% per month in WILD Tokens starting just weeks after a successful Token Sale launch 18 \x0cToken Distribution Token distribution and Token Sale Wild Crypto will produce 100 million WILD Tokens in total which are distributed as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 Early Adopter Sale sold 9 million WILD Tokens \xe2\x80\x93 ISSUED \xe2\x80\xa2 Pre Token Sale 6 million WILD Tokens offered at 3000 WILD tokens to1 Ether \xe2\x80\xa2 Token Sale 30 million WILD Tokens offered at 2000 WILD Tokens to 1 Ether We have coined the term Eco mine which is our way of providing players bonuses this is a marketing pool we have set up to provide players a bonus for storing their WILD Tokens with us After a successful Token Sale we will launch the Eco Mine pool allowing players an opportunity to bonus their WILD Tokens by storing them with Wild Crypto WILD Tokens eligible for bonus will attract 8 33% per month this is a way of growing WILD Tokens prior to the launch of the site in January 2018 Please be aware that the Eco Mining pool is limited to the first 5 Million tokens submitted to it and is only available as a first come first serve basis Once the gaming site is launched players can purchase our tokens at a fixed rate of 100 1 (100 WILD Tokens to 1 Ether) The Token Sale will provide funding for the final stages of development and setting up the operational structure for a minimum of three years however the business is expected to be profitable within the first 12 months The remaining 55 million WILD Tokens will be distributed as follows 15 Million WILD Tokens will be held as a prize pool bond It is important to note that a percentage of each game played will flow into the prize pool so the prize pool will be self sustaining However to cover the possibility of a very early Jackpot winner the prize pool bond has four times contingency from day one to cover the edge case of statistical anomalies Wild Crypto is effectively self insuring its games to avoid paying expensive lottery insurance This also enables Wild Crypto to \t\t offer roll over capability in the early stages thereby generating more excitement and ticket sales 19 \x0cToken Distribution 5 Million WILD Tokens will be used for player bonus we have coined the term Eco mining for a specific type of game bonus we call this Eco mining because no mining rigs are required hence it is environmentally friendly To qualify for Eco mining players store their WILD Tokens securely with Wild Crypto for security players will not have to divulge their private key to store their WILD Tokens This bonus provides 8 33% per month return effectively doubling your deposited tokens over the course of a year The Eco Mining pool has a limit of 5 Million Tokens and is based on a first come first serve basis 35 Million WILD Tokens The remaining tokens will be available for sale on our platform at a fixed rate of 100 1 Please Note We have had some valid questions concerning our original breakdown being a bit confusing so we have decided to simplify this section in order to make it easier to understand The main concern was WILD Crypto having the ability to sell the above 35 Million WILD Tokens on the open market effectively flooding the market with WILD Tokens This thought was mostly fueled by the recognition that we have not put in place any form of \xe2\x80\x9cLock in Period\xe2\x80\x9d for the WILD Tokens after initial crowd sale The main reason for a \xe2\x80\x9dNo Lock Up Period\xe2\x80\x9d is simple The Wild Token is in essence what we are selling on the website if we placed these tokens in any form of lock up period we would have nothing to sell on the platform Think of the WILD Token as a digitized casino chip players come to the platform and purchase WILD Tokens with Ether then use the newly purchased tokens to play the games Selling these tokens on the open market would not make financial sense None of these tokens are reserved for owners founders or advisors their share of profits strictly comes from net revenues The Ether we collect from the sale of WILD Tokens will be used for the following \xe2\x80\xa2 Prize Pool Replenishment \xe2\x80\xa2 Operations \xe2\x80\xa2 Marketing \xe2\x80\xa2 Research and Development \xe2\x80\xa2 Strategic Alliances and new products 20 \x0cCrowdsale Date of crowdsale start 8am GMT+1 05 Sep 17 Date of crowdsale end 8am GMT+1 11 Sep 17 Minimum Token Sale Raise Amount Our minimum goal for the Token Sale is to sell 10 000 000 WILD Tokens and Raise 5 000 Ether this will guarantee the ability to launch our business If at the end of the Token Sale the minimum has not been reached all Ether received in the Pre Token Sale and the Token Sale will be returned to the original owners by smart contract to the original key address (so make sure you do not use a one time wallet) Note The early adopter round was non refundable Those individuals or companies purchased their WILD Tokens with that understanding 21 \x0cOperational Structure Wild Crypto has adopted an agile structure combining full time executive positions part time non executives and a full time
