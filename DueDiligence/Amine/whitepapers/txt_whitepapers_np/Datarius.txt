and FinTech companies have become ingrained in our everyday lives According to forecasts of The World Bank 10% of world\xe2\x80\x99s GDP will be processed by means of blockchain by 2025 Cryptocurrencies are already demonstrating benefits for public but have not yet received wide opportunities to implement full power of their truly breakthrough technologies in physical world mode Many high end ITOs focus their efforts on providing possibility of using cryptocurrencies and services in everyday life creating advanced decentralized banks for this purpose 1 1 CRYPTOCURRENCIES We know that there are digital currencies like Waves NEM Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin Zcash Dash etc and their rate is growing fast We also know that it is possible to make good money off it by using mining rigs and buying ITO tokens (analogue of shares) The latter can be done with specialized platforms they are also issued in form of jetton shares or credit tokens during ITO You can sell token at a higher price draw dividends from the shares and you get interest return on the amount you spent from the credit token Matt Levine an investment banker at Goldman Sachs gave a perfect definition of cryptocurrency in his column at The Bloomberg View According to him blockchain has two ways of development in financial world \xd0\xa0\xd0\x95\xd0\x97\xd0\xae\xd0\x9c\xd0\x95 \xd0\x9f\xd0\xa0\xd0\x9e\xd0\x95\xd0\x9a\xd0\xa2\xd0\x90 The first feature which makes bitcoin interesting is its decentralized nature no one owns or controls the system as a whole The principle of ITO according to Levine is that you do not build a business you create a comprehensive system for all users The second way regards blockchain as advanced technology It is used as such by banks multipurpose centers and insurance companies Companies gain access to constantly synchronizing database of their customers Levine believes that future of public joint stock companies lies in blockchain The first development path was taken by developers of debit cryptocurrency card Centra which is accepted in every place where Visa and MasterCard are Its data are linked to customer\ s cryptocurrency wallet and are constantly updated Travelers were the first people who gave recognition to this novelty because of digital currencies not being linked to any particular country and are easily converted into various fiat money 3 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY This is a convenient way to store money in economically unstable countries money is not depreciated and its purchasing power is not lost The second path of blockchain development is introducing technology to companies Main advantage of decentralized system is that there is no need to involve human resources when processing transactions This reduces fees by virtue of automation and at the same time increases transparency and controllability of deals With aid of smart contract technologies two individuals can autonomously close entire deal from contract issuing to its certification As explains author of TechNative portal cryptocurrency funds are usually stored in intermediate tenure and after contract terms are fulfilled and agreed events are completed funds are automatically delivered to the seller Everything is quite simple and effective Banks and insurance companies intensively master smart contract technologies Going ahead decentralized technologies will perform all bureaucratic work without risk of losing or shadowing data and companies founded from there on will become the forefront of the economy 1 2 FINTECH Over past two years volume of investments in Fintech startups has significantly grown Annual volume of investments in Fintech startups $ billion \xd0\xa0\xd0\x95\xd0\x97\xd0\xae\xd0\x9c\xd0\x95 \xd0\x9f\xd0\xa0\xd0\x9e\xd0\x95\xd0\x9a\xd0\xa2\xd0\x90 848 836 725 572 451 $ 2 5 M $ 3 1M $ 7 7 M $ 14 6 M $ 14 6 M 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Investment volume Number of deals 4 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY We often encounter them in everyday life we use Internet banking send and receive money transfers According to PayPal General Director in 2017 200 million users registered in the system and quantity of scheduled operations will be more than 6 billion As research shows the greatest interest of users is caused by currency exchange operations in online mode the lowest being instruments of financial budgeting and investment Speed and transaction transparency is just one side of the coin Fintech technologies are complete analytical systems which will change the principles of banking and insurance sector operations in the future Artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics when combined with proliferation of smartphones and millennial generation prejudice towards traditional banking system give these industries an opportunity for growth Research of consulting companies McKinsey and Deloitte showed that contemporary high performance organizations in pursuit of speed and convenience for their services are striving to create digital customer experience model where all processes are digitized to accelerate customer experience transformation To do this they discard traditional approaches in favor of high tech performance improvements Fintech services have already changed process of insurance issuing and principles of insurance business running Based on research conducted by Delloite experts 31% of surveyed companies implement artificial intelligence technology and 34% already use it in some fields In the future these changes will affect banking technologies (analytics data management CRM security) payments (mobile wallet POS P2P money transfer payment solutions) cybercurrencies (blockchain bitcoin e wallets cryptocurrency exchange) business finance (P2P business lending credit lines crowdfunding) and consumer financing system (P2P lending robot advisors personal finance loan appraisal) In insurance sector appearance of clearly structured smart contracts will significantly improve the quality of insurance claims consideration Their mode of operation consists of standard if then logic laws and well defined conditions adherence to which is monitored by autonomous devices The clearer payment parameters are formulated the faster you get the result Such technologies will 5 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY assist both companies and customers to adapt insurance payment plan for their needs allowing to save on services In personal finance field smart contract technologies will help to understand exactly how and where financial resources are spent how well financial receipts flow is adjusted and so on Technical capabilities of Fintech services based on Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer principles will allow to effectively solve financial crime problem Prevention of financial crime consists of three parts transparent reporting tracking and law enforcement At that the latter is a prerogative of law enforcement institutions Huge financial and human resources are spent to investigate cases of money laundering as a result law enforcement institutions are overwhelmed with abundant reports on the activities of financial institutions Fintech services will accelerate and facilitate investigations making them less expensive Banking institutions will be able to lower expenditures on less performant fields to reduce fees in most vulnerable sectors of banking sphere and will enable Fintech companies to gain another competitive advantage over traditional financial firms 1 3 DATARIUS Fintech company iCrypto S A developing Datarius Cryptobank is at the forefront of new digital economy The Datarius project is a new social type cryptobank with transparent conditions In cryptobanking industry Datarius will become the first financial institution capable of offering its customers a full range of financial services implemented within a decentralized system The uniqueness of Datarius Cryptobank is that the project allows customers to get services adapted to their needs Datarius will operate on the basis of P2P ecosystem (peer to peer) where transaction participants are private users and not banking institutions This is not a novelty in the financial market but system offered by Datarius inherited best traits from traditional banking products adapting them to the principles of decentralized system operation 6 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY Such platform will be a perfect solution for people without credit history to whom traditional banks cannot provide loan proposals or for whom current offers on the market will cost much more The Datarius project has a global value It is designed to overcome current difficulties connected to use of cryptocurrencies in non digital world introducing options of integrated crypto and fiat money services into payment infrastructure for this purpose Primary mission of Datarius cryptobank is creation of P2P system that would make use of full potential of decentralized financial technology within the framework of cryptocurrency payment system and real life Another substantial part of Datarius mission is to provide world community with access to major financial instruments in P2P transaction format In relatively short time cryptobank clients will receive services that ultimately meet their needs because transactions will be conducted in automatic mode while services will be customizable Any transaction will be much more profitable since P2P platform does not split loan and deposit products and does not involve staff dealing with this Unlike most developers who continue promoting monopolization of world financial market by large players Datarius team aims to create perfect financial institution that would adopt all advantages of traditional financial organizations leaving behind their major disadvantages non transparency unpredictability lobbyism and administrative burden Datarius model represents decentralized system in exceptional and most complete format It includes blockchain technologies that ensure secure information recording and storage This excludes the possibility of changing or falsifying any piece of data Usage of cryptocurrencies which do not require central control as well as smart contracts allows to process transactions more efficiently and safely compared to conventional deals Datarius is a decentralized partially closed system which sometimes excludes bank participation that makes it possible for users to gain profits The system allows users to make their own decision when judging appropriateness of certain services and applications which minimizes cost of processing transactions Customer selects a service according to his/her own requirements and pays the price without customer service charge 7 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY There are a few more basic differences from the traditional banking system which should be emphasized TRADITIONAL BANK FINTECH COMPETITORS DATARIUS BANK INSTRUMENTS Limited by specialization Field specific Widest possible CLIENT EARNING POSSIBILITY IN COOPERATION WITH A BANK Excluded Not applicable Possible (roles programs fees for activities commissionback) LENDING Traditional Simple P2P Package landing (3 levels of landing) CURRENCY EXCHANGE More than 5% Less than 5% 0% RISK MANAGEMENT SCORING Obsolete statistics Bigdata + sometimes AI

No limits COMMUNICATION WITH THE CUSTOMER Template approach Indefinitely 1 based on AI Individually 8 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY System of decentralized Datarius Cryptobank is oriented on cooperation with wide audience and is available all over the world In addition to current members of Crypto Community Datarius welcomes people who are just starting to get acquainted with cryptocurrencies or who do not trust FinTech market yet Customers will be able to conduct transactions from any corner of the world in a matter of seconds with no limits and no need to wait for a plastic card issue for several weeks Customers from different countries receive Datarius cryptobank services on equal terms Transactions and funds transfers are done instantly after closing a deal Fees for processing the operation will be reduced to minimum payment for the transaction regardless of both parties\xe2\x80\x99 location Datarius provides an opportunity for its clients to receive credit lines from creditors from other countries For example a customer can choose a loan with a lower interest rate in countries of Western Europe or America where such services are much cheaper This practice was used by traditional banks at dawn of mortgage lending within decentralized P2P system cost of such products will be lower due to savings on customer service charges Thanks to blockchain technology whole operation history and credit check results (scoring) are recorded in data chain and cannot be changed from outside This approach reliably protects customer\xe2\x80\x99s personal data and records all information about their activity in the system which significantly reduces the risk of document falsification or financial fraud when closing a deal Account is linked to user\ s identity scammers will not be able to intercept or falsify their data Datarius offers a wide range of tools in investment credit and currency fields FinTech startups individuals and legal entities gain access to loans bailment and investments Flexible system allows any customer to transfer their personal and/or company accounts to cryptospace considerably saving on banking servicing and even earning from it Datarius products have simple completely transparent and comprehensible conditions without hidden fees and fine print requirements Thanks to flexible settings system all operations will meet customer\xe2\x80\x99s requirements to the best extent so they will not overpay for general conditions of the product Datarius Cryptobank does not charge additional bank fees for servicing product which makes it possible to reduce operation cost by 30% compared to conventional bank fees 9 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY Datarius is a partially closed system in which a part of funds always remains inside The cryptobank is the guarantor of the fact that cryptocurrency exchange prompts a financial bubble jump that can burst at the most unexpected hour but will not grow All data is under reliable protection of the system which excludes the possibility of illegal money circulation In Datarius project customer receives a rating and gains full access to various service sectors Depending on its value users can try themselves as borrowers or investors place funds at any deposit to accumulate interest Datarius is not limited to operations within cryptocurrency system It provides gateways for both national banking and electronic payment systems Account holder can pay cryptocurrency for goods and services pay bills in online stores that support this type of payment Customers of Datarius cryptobank can customize personal cabinet for their own needs Initially all users have access to standard simplified model additional services can be added at any time A set of these advantages is far from all that Datarius project offers In addition to payment investment and credit systems Datarius offers currency transactions that gain popularity Automatic interchange internal exchange and gateways to the TOP exchanges will be available for users Automatic exchange is a traditional currency exchange in cryptobank\xe2\x80\x99s own exchange In internal exchange it is possible to choose different rates at which participants profit without bank regulation and thanks to gateways to TOP exchanges users are invited to exchange their funds at the cryptocurrency best rates Datarius gives users 3 options for direct lending from which one can choose the most adequate For investors there is a flexible system of deposits in Datarius 2 options for investment programs and demand deposits service Thanks to use of quick turnover instruments depositors have simplified opportunity to earn money quickly and by legal means Compared with mining mechanisms this is a much simpler way to multiply your capital A distinctive feature of Datarius Cryptobank was exceeding of crowdfunding platform limits and as a result emergence of a more efficient services for legal entities Datarius offers companies to take out credits directly without intermediaries This allows organizations to obtain required amount on attractive terms for a short period of time 10 \x0cPROJECT SUMMARY Cryptobank plans to issue cryptocurrency cards that will operate within the system and in partner companies systems Customers can use card to pay for goods and services make purchases on sites that accept bankcards as payment It will be possible to withdraw and deposit cash at partner\xe2\x80\x99s ATMs To verify borrowers Datarius uses scoring system based on unique algorithms which takes into account already available data of partner companies Based on these and other settings system decides to grant loans on the definite terms Datarius combines features of decentralized and traditional banking systems When opening an account for a cryptocurrency Datarius opens a real account for a physical person in customer\ s name In current situation with legislative status of cryptocurrencies this expands customer\ s payment abilities while blockchain economy is in development All Datarius customers can use their bank account funds with no limit as if they used traditional bank services Datarius is open for cooperation with other blockchain projects and plans to assist market participants in overcoming cryptocurrency transaction barrier within payment system For this unique methods of verification for their partners were developed Project creators considered possible failures of automatic rating system of the borrower and added user ratings of individual system participants user groups and specific transactions These and other parameters form participant\xe2\x80\x99s general rating which allows for more objective assessing of prospects for mutual interaction Confirming its status as a social bank Datarius integrated Trust Limits system into the credit segment This option is available in Webmoney but an advanced system of settings that allows defining limits for different groups of borrowers is applied here It is possible to set credit line criteria for a particular user group or all users It is also allowed to create more flexible system settings for accepting trust limits by predefined criteria Datarius system involves development of an extensive API network in terms of the interface In the future a full fledged hardware complex is planned for creation Both individuals and businessmen can use products and services provided by Datarius Datarius can offer to integrate crypto startups and legal entities seeking to transfer financial transactions to crypto space into its unique system Due to such competitive advantages Datarius plans to establish strong market leadership in cryptobanking industry 11 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN MILESTONES PLAN 50m 50 000 000 USD 10 000 000

decentralized system of financial services for a wide range of people those who are already aware of the cryptocurrency market and those who are still wary of such services Another overarching aim of the project is to bring cryptocurrency system from virtual space to \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d financial services market preserving the best features of traditional banks but taking away bureaucratic practices and excess service costs This will save up to 80% on services Development of multifunctional cryptobank is a complex process of integrating huge number of additional services issuing and obtaining permits registering founder organization and establishing shareholding order drafting a charter and determining legal address of the bank Along with organizational moments Datarius team will work to enhance preliminary agreements with potential partners and implement their services in the system All main steps which form the basis for Datarius cryptobank development are described in detail below These stages represent the most comprehensive picture of Datarius project development 1m PAYMENT SYSTEM LICENSED UNDER THE DPL (1 MILLION) Datarius basis used to develop the system is a fully functional payment system based on DTR tokens Learn more about the possibilities and components of this system Innovative Authentication Partner Interface which combines high security level and ease of use Dashboard Control Panel with useful widgets Receiving and sending internal currency (tokens) DTRC to wallets of Datarius users Purchasing DTR tokens at intra system exchange rate through traditional payment systems Even at this stage Datarius users can replenish their accounts in the system through a simple bank payment with international SWIFT system or European SEPA Consultations underway on processing payments from credit cards and PayPal Selling DTR tokens with the possibility to withdraw funds in fiat 13 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN User Profile which contains personal information detailed history of operations within the system preferences and user behavior Rating System Rating of each user is affected by two basic factors feedback on cooperation and algorithmic account analysis which ranks in accordance to user activity and verification of system parameters User Profiles are groups that allow determining access rights to information and providing specific categories of users with additional functionality Possibility of opening a dispute to resolve a disputable situation Datarius system of internal arbitration allows holding open discussions and voting while voting power of the user depends on his / her rating within the system Mandatory two factor authentication (2FA) in case of exceeding certain wallet balance to provide back up security Secure messaging that allows communicating with other Datarius users as well as with the system administration Knowledge Base is a Wiki like system designed to ensure easy learning of all Datarius tools It contains step by step tutorial videos and illustrated articles with a detailed description of all system capacities Datarius deals are effective in exchanging fiat money for cryptocurrency and vice versa due to the Data Processing License (DPL) received in Costa Rica This license allows working as a payment system and issuing electronic currency as well as providing brokerage services and managing customer assets Datarius incorporates experience of famous Liberty Reserve payment system which operates under DPL license Enhanced user verification and withdrawal limits allow Datarius to operate exceptionally within legal framework that increases confidence level of users existing payment systems and banks Even at early stage Datarius has a full fledged financial ecosystem in which user makes payments and transfers receives necessary financial services 14 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Personal IBAN (co branded) Each user receives a wallet related to personal account with the corresponding IBAN International Bank Account Number All user accounts are linked to Datarius account in partner bank with certain cash balance that is constantly maintained This allows for circulating of fiat money within established limits without the involvement of intermediaries namely exchanges or exchangers Despite additional bank account maintenance and transaction fees this approach provides users with a number of indisputable advantages lack of additional risks related to the participation of third parties in exchange process depositing / withdrawing funds in a short period Multi Currency Accounts In Datarius a user can create and use wallets denominated in any currency Due to this feature system turns into a full fledged payment hub which allows to freely convert various national and cryptocurrencies without using other exchange platforms Technically multi currency wallets can be implemented in two ways In traditional payment systems wallets denominated in different currencies work on balancing principle In case of Datarius this means instant exchange of DTRC token to a user selected currency credited to his account Cryptocurrency allows to solve this issue in another way \xe2\x80\x93 to use smart coins which value is pegged to that of another currency both fiat and digital Usage of smart coins is the cornerstone of multi currency wallets at the first stage of Datarius development As user base grows usage of smart coins will be combined with classical \xe2\x80\x9cbalancing\xe2\x80\x9d approach As a result user can utilize same account number for a full fledged work with any national currency and cryptocurrency while necessary conversion will be fully automated P2P Lending P2P lending is one of the most dynamically developing services in financial market It is estimated that by 2022 P2P lending volumes will reach $ ~319 billion while in 2015 P2P lending market was valued at just $ 100 billion 15 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN P2PLending Market Volume $billion $ 100 3 M $ 147 1 M 2015 2016 $ 178 2 M 2017 $ 215 8 M $ 261 4 M $ 318 6 M 2018 2019 2020 Market volume Market Datarius P2P lending system has two key objectives to increase reliability and to automate technical aspects of lending with smart contracts and data recording in a blockchain to analyze and cluster loan applications by levels of risks through the algorithmic selection and in some cases processing by analysts of Datarius system To access Datarius P2P lending system users need to undergo verification procedure (a principle called Know Your Client) by adding personal information to the profile and confirming mobile phone number Lending procedures and loan recovery consist of the following steps Transaction participants enter into a legally binding contract electronically User can request a loan both in fiat currency and in cryptocurrency creditor sends assets to the transitory loan account which is labeled with contract number smart contract analyzes payment label orders and automatically sends the currency from loan account to borrower\ s account The fact of granting a loan is registered in a blockchain 16 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN borrower makes monthly payments from his / her account to the creditor A smart contract labels further transactions with contract number whereupon it is recorded in a blockchain when all payments have been made in full completion of transaction is registered in a blockchain user rating is updated Transaction registration in a blockchain ensures specialty principle and smart contracts automate process of transferring funds between the borrower and the lender To facilitate application selection procedure and to offer the best financial terms for borrowers and lenders all applications are divided into 3 listings The Core Listing comprises the least risky mid and long term fundraising applications by applicants with high rating Each transaction in Core Listing is preliminarily examined by Datarius Risk Department Partner companies provide insurance to all loans At the first stage Datarius uses services of traditional insurance companies Decentralized insurance systems are expected to emerge in future Top priority task of Core Listing is to ensure a refund guarantee In order to support Risk Department Datarius charges a transaction fee which is calculated individually for each loan considering interest rate amount and terms of the loan The fee is charged upon loan repayment Listing 2 comprises mid and long term low risk applications but unlike Core Listing the application data is not examined by Datarius Risk Department Unique algorithm is used to verify applications It determines the degree of transaction credibility based on user profile interest rate terms and other loan parameters A small fee required to maintain system operation and to further improve data processing algorithms is charged upon loan repayment You can insure transactions by accepting additional conditions offered by a partner insurance company Listing 3 is a list of ranked applications from all borrowers A wide range of additional tools and enhanced verification procedure provided by partner companies allows obtaining the most comprehensive information on the applicant and potential risks in order to make a rational decision on each application This type of transaction facilitates the lowest fee Applications of the Listings 2 and 3 can be transferred to Core Listing after they have been 17 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN successfully processed by Datarius Risk Department If necessary creditor or borrower can initiate paid processing of a particular application An applicant may establish a ban on application processing by Risk Department such application has an additional label and is rejected automatically Co branded Credit Cards Credit cards development is an important element of Datarius integration into user\xe2\x80\x99s daily life which allows to significantly expand target audience of the project At the first stage we provide users with cards of our own design which additionally contain logo of issuing partner bank The procedure of processing credit cards is broadly similar to the mechanism of using personal IBAN and is supported by partner provider When ordering a card user is provided with additional account which is also associated with administrative account of the system A partner services the card Datarius receives data about card transactions through provider API the system will only maintain required balance on the account of a specific user who owns the card Asset Exchange Establishment of the exchange as a part of a powerful payment system makes Datarius a full fledged hub for exchanging digital assets Within the exchange users can enter into exchange transactions related to a wide range of payment instruments including DTRC tokens and fiat money as well as other cryptocurrencies Availability of buying and selling loans is currently under discussion this tool will significantly increase system flexibility and expand creditors\ capabilities Exchange trading is fully automated Transaction Insurance Partner companies provide transaction insurance in Datarius When purchasing a transaction insurance service user acknowledges acceptance of the offer and contributes to insurance fund \xe2\x80\x93 a special account of partner company registered in Datarius system In case of violation of any terms of transaction the user will be compensated from insurance fund 18 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Online Training Centre for System Users Datarius has a broad target audience thus the most important condition for successful development of the project is rapid involvement of new customers in the system Interface of most modern cryptocurrency projects is designed for a tech savvy user That is why people who are first ever interested in digital finance face serious difficulties To quickly master Datarius system and to use it effectively we created an embedded online assistant which will step by step present the interface of payment system to the user and describe its functionalities in a user friendly terms If a user wants to expand his knowledge about certain aspects of Datarius system they can always consult Wiki Knowledge Base containing detailed instructions and articles about all features of the project 5m ADDITIONAL LICENSING (5 MILLION) As the user base grows it becomes very important to get additional licenses This step will positively impact level of confidence toward payment system on behalf of users banking and government structures Laws of most states require additional licensing of payment system on their territory and due to expansion Datarius project will also need such permits The type of license is primarily chosen in accordance with requirements of specific region PayPal operates on territory of the United States under the Money Service Business while EMI license is more relevant for Europe Regardless of particular jurisdiction these documents share a similar scope and allow payment system to freely process online payments as well as to convert their own tokens into fiat currencies and vice versa Trust Management Users will be able to entrust part of their own funds to the management of other system participants We offer a sufficiently broad scope for using this tool from small service payments to full fledged capital management for making profit Instead of making a traditional deposit client chooses a particular manager according to their personal preferences and acceptable risks A distinctive feature of Datarius Trust Management is a possibility to determine clear boundaries related to user\xe2\x80\x99s capital management For example funds can be used solely to pay for certain services 19 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN For this purpose an additional wallet is created to store funds subject to trust management The manager can control these funds exclusively within pre established limits Membership in VISA and MasterCard Payment Systems World Clients in Payment Systems Local systems 2% 26% 18% 2% 2% 20% 30% VISA and Mastercard are the most popular payment systems in the world According to VISA statistics annual volume of transactions within the system makes up for more than 6 trillion dollars and the number of transactions exceeds 140 billion The client base growth increase of transactions quantity and enhanced interaction with traditional banking structures will reasonably secure membership in payment systems Partner Programs Partner Programs is an effective tool for credit systems and payment services to attract new customers The most common model is to pay for a particular action of a new client in the system The partner receives a reward for each attracted user who has performed any financial transaction deposited funds into the system or applied for a loan Reward is paid in DTRC tokens which promotes additional activity within the system 20 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Public API Software integration with other online services is crucial for sustainable development and growth of Datarius Along with public APIs Datarius customers gain new opportunities to use external services of cryptobank partners Here are just the clearest examples of using Datarius API integration with online retailers for fast and cheap payment processing access to public user information making instant donations receiving Datarius Asset Exchange Quotation API development increases user activity they receive convenient tools for processing routine financial transactions in a traditional way On the other hand convenient tools of obtaining information increase interest of business structures within the capabilities of Datarius system Mobile Applications Using iOS or Android smartphone and Datarius application you can make payments and transfers anywhere in the world create and respond to loan requests and trade on Asset Exchange Alongside applications release we will introduce mobile digipass an application generating two factor authentication codes (2FA) to ensure additional transaction security The degree of account protection and number of access levels to the system is configurable at user\ s request User can find step by step instructions and detailed descriptions of how to use mobile applications in our Training Center No matter what awareness level of Internet security a customer has we will show how to reliably protect account by embedded Datarius tools Short Term Accumulation Accounts ( Money Box ) Money box is an additional user account assets on which are frozen until meeting certain conditions Such conditions may include accumulation of certain amount or accrual on a fixed date At the stage of money box creation user can specify a number of standard rules auto replenishment settings automatic transfer of certain proportion of incoming payments to money box a method for rounding off the amount To simplify interaction with money box user is offered pre defined sets of rules Currently the possibility of interest accrual of money boxes balance with a long shelf life is discussed Assets on balances can be handled under management of users with high trust level which stimulates activity within the system and allows managers to receive additional profits via depositors 21 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Consultants Training Program and Training Center Franchise Extending functionality of Datarius system inevitably leads the project to the need for a large number of professional consultants To solve this problem effectively we organize our own training program and launch training center franchise The existence of strict training standards and lack of need to use own assets allows to optimize consultant training and facilitates ease of scaling the project 10m DEPOSIT LIMITS (10 MILLION) Deposit limit is a permission to use assets of a particular user on specified terms This tool is used in WebMoney system where it determines loan terms for the applicant Datarius extends use of Deposit limits they become a security tool for transactions and allow you to regulate asset transfer between users via set of pre defined conditions A graphic illustration of deposit limit usefulness is the interaction between a freelancer and regular customer Supposed that a copywriter is committed to daily filling of a news blog for 1 month Since daily volume of work can not be predicted a customer sets only upper budget limit No more than $70 per day and utmost $2100 per month Having issued a deposit limit using both conditions a customer automates payment process to worker\xe2\x80\x99s wallet now copywriter will be able to request payment regardless depending on the amount of work performed and exclusively within agreed budget Deposit limits is an important tool for interaction between Datarius users that provides additional incentives for using our system Credit Cards Logical continuation of Datarius line of credit offers is credit card issuance Operation of credit cards in Datarius is connected with the use of deposit limits Imagine that N users open deposit limits for all participants of the system with a rating above 150 Each limit also fixates interest rate maximum period and loan amount Now credit card holders with rating above 150 can use assets issued within the terms of specified deposit limits In this case loaner can establish a set of rules independently by which they accept or reject the limit So if an interest rate of no more than 4% per month with a repayment period of at least 22 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN 60 days is suitable for a user they can specify this in settings and the system will automatically accept only those bids that meet established rules Datarius collects all deposit limits available for particular user and rejects applications that do not satisfy its preferences Technically operation of credit cards is carried out by means of intermediate trust limit for administrative account opened for card sub accounts with reverse API Virtual Cards Usage of virtual cards is a promising course in online payments field According to Nathan Colbron\xe2\x80\x99s opinion product manager of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group the amount of virtual cards will grow as their advantages become known by large corporations They are convenient to use and their maintenance is much cheaper than in case of traditional plastic cards Datarius implements full function work with virtual cards Users can make online payments without having to enter their primary card data Release of an unlimited number of virtual cards provides additional protection against fraud a plotter will not be able to draw assets from main user accounts Additional cards allow users to plan budget to issue payments for certain services and purchases in online stores more accurately Cold Accumulative Accounts (Hardware Wallets) Hardware wallets are the safest way of long term asset storage This is a small USB keychain with a pre installed *nix system and an enclosure for using custom wallets Hardware wallets have the highest security level when working on any computer UNIX family operating systems are absolutely resistant to viruses and hacking attempts user identification can be carried out by means of scanning biometric data which excludes theft as a result of hacking passwords most of the time wallet is off data is transmitted only when connected to PC to perform operations Use of cold accumulation accounts guarantees protection of assets and ensures safe work with the system in both private and public networks 23 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Professional Managers and Analysts Special user statuses expand existing mechanism of trust management For additional profit users can transfer their DTRC tokens to hands of competent managers There is a mechanism for assessing loans by professional analysts which facilitates process of selecting applications for creditors Let\ s get acquainted with each of new statuses Professional manager is an individual or legal entity that has confirmed necessary qualifications partner of Datarius system Professional managers operate user assets transferred to them for making deals in Datarius system striving to obtain maximum profit Interface of professional manager is affiliated with specific user wallets Control panel allows you to quickly view the list of current transactions and performance reports Transaction history for each wallet is presented in form of an action tree with the display of specific financial results An important element of successful system operation is a promotion of competition Rating of each manager is constantly updated based on an algorithm that takes into account asset amount under management number of customers profit level terms and percentage of successful transactions Users can choose a manager from general rating which stimulates competition and improves quality of decisions made A manager is a system user who has confirmed necessary competencies and has undergone a thorough verification procedure Capabilities of such user are identical to those of a professional manager In addition to own accounts affiliate wallets of customers appear in manager\ s interface A professional analyst is an expert in lending In the process of making a decision to grant a loan lender can seek opinion of one or more professional analysts in exchange for a small fee in DTR tokens Introduction of the institute of professional analysts makes it possible to reduce the number of problem loans and increase attractiveness of the platform for loaners and managers Portfolio Investments and Investment Packages Portfolio investment consists of a wide range of assets that can bring maximum profit in medium term stable cryptocurrencies and tokens investments into working capital of European companies investments in enterprises of developing economies tokens attached to national currencies 24 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN All investment portfolios are formed by specialists in the field of economics and financial markets This approach allows minimizing risks and increasing the level of user satisfaction from use of investment services in Datarius system Acquisition of investment package implies the possibility or obligation to regularly make additional payments which positively affects effectiveness of instruments and leads to an increase in the total volume of transactions within the system Batch investments help to attract large borrowers into Datarius system By combining resources of many users in one portfolio we satisfy needs of applicants who require a large amount of money for specific purposes If a borrower requires $60 000 for 3 months Datarius will provide such a loan using assets of several hundred or thousands of private creditors As a result an applicant receives the necessary amount and users \xe2\x80\x93 the opportunity to make investments in large projects with a low risk level and a small budget At the first stage of tool implementation we use an algorithm that analyzes the flow of applications and automatically closes counterproposals preliminarily collecting assets on a common deposit wallet The development of the system involves introduction of artificial intelligence to promptly inform users about new investment opportunities Based on analysis of preferences and behavioral patterns of creditors artificial intelligence will be able to offer them most appropriate applications Payment Schedule and Deferred Payments The payment schedule is a powerful tool for automating financial transactions With its help user can set reminders create tasks for making one time or regular automatic payments Ability to set up automatic payments is closely related to Datarius loan products If user\ s account does not have enough assets to make a transaction then available deposit limit is used for payment Due to this feature creditors receive additional opportunities for profit and loaners may not worry about account balance Payment schedule contributes to close integration of the Datarius system with daily needs of users such as the regular payment of utility bills or service subscriptions replenishment of cell phone account or asset transfer to an account of a significant one 25 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Integration with Instant Transfer Systems Integration with instant money transfer systems such as Western Union Money Gramm Transferwise allows users to deposit and withdraw fiat currency Limits on the size of operations are set in accordance with requirements of each particular system and also take into account user limits within Datarius system Annual volume of investments in Fintech startups $ billion 13 14 15 14 13 13 12 12 12 12 12 47 63 69 68 70 73 72 74 77 74 73 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Volume of transfers $ billion Market share % Source SaveOnSend com analysis 26 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN 20m OBTAINING SWIFT PARTICIPANT STATUS (20 MILLION) Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is the largest international interbank payment system used by 11 000 participants in more than 200 countries Connection to SWIFT system is a ticket to the higher league of world financial system which gives a number of advantages when conducting interbank transfers High speed of operation the average delivery time for ordinary transfers is 20 minutes for urgent ones \xe2\x80\x93 1 5 minutes No restrictions on the amount of payment Work with a large number of national currencies A high level of confidentiality ensured by a wide range of organizational and technical measures The most attractive tariffs for transferring payments in comparison with competing systems Wide use SWIFT operates practically in every country of the world Guarantee of timely delivery of a transfer In case of delivery time violation due to system failure SWIFT covers customer losses Shortcomings of the system include need to provide a large package of documents and an impressive entrance fee for potential participants of the system According to some reports US State Department has been monitoring payments in the system since 2011 Despite these shortcomings SWIFT remains main system for making international payments due to low commissions wide spread and high speed of message delivery Creation of Personal IBAN Accounts and Access to SWIFT Connection to SWIFT allows Datarius system to reject services of partner banks and independently create personal IBAN accounts for users of the system This gives several advantages reduction of commissions and costs simplification and optimization of account opening procedure tighter technical integration with services of Datarius system 27 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Integration of Biometric Authorization Biometric authentication devices are a simple and effective way to protect your account from hacking It is necessary to conclude large contracts with suppliers of corresponding devices for introduction of biometric authorization and conduct serious technical work As a result each customer of Datarius gets the opportunity to order a device that can be used for authorization in the system and transaction confirmation User no longer needs to remember long passwords and think about their keeping \xe2\x80\x93 biometric authentication combines a high level of security and ease of daily use Opening of Gateway to World\ s Cryptocurrency Exchange Cryptocurrency is becoming an increasingly popular tool for speculation and long term investment According to assessments of analyst and founder of Standpoint Research investment company Mr Ronnie Moas total capitalization of cryptocurrency market will reach $2 trillion in the next 10 years According to the data of coinmarketcap com portal the amount of transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges is already estimated in billions of dollars Usage of traditional cryptocurrency exchanges may not be very convenient for the user complex multi level verification absence of necessary cryptocurrency pairs on a particular exchange problems with withdrawal of fiat currency difficulty of earning on the difference of exchange rates on various exchanges The last point is relevant in periods of high volatility for example the exchange rate difference in the period of the boom of Chinese exchanges has reached 15% Even in a quiet time for the market a sharp rise in the price of a certain cryptocurrency is accompanied by an increase in the exchange rate difference between individual exchanges Datarius gives its customers the opportunity to send requests to major cryptocurrency exchanges instantly Technically this is realized by registering our own or partner\ s account on exchanges on whose behalf all transactions are conducted Once user creates an application on the internal Datarius exchange his application is automatically placed on the cryptocurrency exchange through its API 28 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Within the limits set users will have the opportunity for trade and exchange arbitrage Our algorithms will independently select variants with the most attractive exchange rate difference and offer users the possibility of simultaneously close opposite deals Fixed Cryptochecks With cryptochecks users transfer assets between their accounts using special codes Each code corresponds to a certain amount frozen on account of a particular user The best known way to implement cryptochecks were btc e exchange codes which allowed freezing bitcoins on user\ s balance and transferred them to the balance of another participant of the system at their request Datarius also uses codes to transfer checks expanding scenarios for their use Unlike btc e checks in the Datarius can be denominated in any fiat currency or cryptocurrency which greatly simplifies freezing of funds for a long period User can create three types of checks personal nameless and with limited access A personal check can be paid only at a pre specified address whereas an unnamed one can be used by any person Checks with limited access can be redeemed for a pre determined list of wallets without limiting their number The user who received check code can verify its validity find out the frozen amount and pay off the check Introduction of Artificial Intelligence Usage of machine learning integrated with Big Data makes it possible to offer customers the most relevant services and to track suspicious operations in the system by conducting an effective analysis of user behavioral patterns Let\ s get familiar with main tasks that are solved by artificial intelligence in Datarius system Fighting fraud (anti fraud) Automated system for tracking suspicious transactions makes it possible to identify unreliable users with high probability to suppress attempts at fraud and artificial rating raising and also protects the system from mass registrations In case of doubt the system is capable of independent analyzing of incoming information and requesting additional data from users In addition to information collected in automatic mode the system can be guided by additional data received from operators 29 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Identify optimal product line for each user By analyzing statistical data on behavior and preferences of users the system is able to predict needs of customers quickly and accurately by offering them most relevant services for example specific loans or portfolio investments Forecasting the outcome of transactions and provision of preferences Processing large amounts of data on previous transactions and analyzing participant profiles makes it possible to predict success of a future transaction with a high probability Based on predicted risks the system independently determines edge limits such as the amount of available deposit limits credit limits restrictions on fund input and withdrawal maximum loan amount when transferring an application to a higher level listing and other parameters Scoring \xe2\x80\x93 risk assessment when granting a loan The system makes a detailed portrait of the borrower taking into account their personal data patterns of behavior system usage statistics and interaction with other users Calculation of commissions Artificial intelligence independently determines the size of commission using completeness of data on risks and profiles of participants in each transaction In the calculation data for a particular transaction is taken into account as well as the analysis of previous transactions and patterns of behavior of participants This approach allows you to build a special system of relations between the user and Datarius system where the commission depends not only on formal parameters but also on customer\ s loyalty Forming a second listing of loan applications Now the task of forwarding applications from third listing into the second one will be entirely entrusted to artificial intelligence In the process of self learning AI will be able to take into account all new factors that affect risk level for each transaction which will ensure high accuracy in assessing reliability of the loan Big Data is a set of tools and methods for processing large amounts of information in Datarius The use of machine learning allows the system to effectively detect dependencies between individual pieces of data that seem unrelated to each other at first glance Big Data makes it possible to obtain a significant statistical advantage in compiling complex multifactor models Any available information can be analyzed in detail country of residence name and age of the user their professional and social status habits hobbies profiles in social networks interaction with other 30 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN users and organizations scoring money transfers \xe2\x80\x93 in other words a huge array of data allowing to create a detailed financial and social portrait of a customer At the next stage artificial intelligence processes received data makes conclusions useful to the system and corrects them during independent learning The more information AI analyzes the more accurately the result of its work is obtained Development of algorithms and data processing usually lasts a fairly long time and can take from 9 to 18 months As a result the system gets access to unique statistical data and patterns which are revealed in a fully automatic mode Based on this data we can not only offer user the most relevant services but also introduce new products predicting needs of our customers Rating formation of enterprises with public or provided reporting using Big Data and artificial intelligence An effective data analysis tool that allows you to detect non obvious patterns and make right decision 50m FOOT BANKERS (50 MILLION) Despite the worldwide trend towards transfer of most services to online mode many customers still prefer to solve complex problems through personal contact with representatives of the system Datarius provides such opportunity introducing the institute of foot bankers \xe2\x80\x94 people who are able to quickly meet user in a designated place and solve any problem having in their hands only a tablet with access to the system Foot bankers receive a commission from each successfully resolved application Mortgage Credit Lending Issuance possibility of long term installment on real estate through the partnership with developers and other building structures Consultations conducted with a number of large companies showed interest of partners in development of this service By this time customer base of Datarius system is at least 50 000 users which is a compelling argument in negotiations with developers around the world Introduction of mortgage lending service allows significant product line expanding for portfolio investors Professional analysts will help to weigh up risks and determine profit potential of 31 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN development projects presented in Datarius system Customers of the system get an opportunity to invest money in real estate which is not just a financial commitment or a speculative instrument but a real physical asset that brings regular income for many years Services for Small and Medium Business For small and medium business Datarius offers enhanced functionality related to opening and management of corporate accounts opening of sub accounts fixation of individual limits changing automatic payments under sub accounts issue of branded cards linked to sub accounts convenient expense control sending bulk payments Establishment of Venture Capital Investment Fund Over the past few years venture capital investments have become an incredibly popular instrument of capital multiplying According to Ernst & Young British consulting company small startups and independent companies with a large profit potential increasingly attract investors Datarius is considering the establishment of a special venture investment fund that will allow users to make high risk investments in promising projects Mode and technical implementation of fund operation are at introductory discussion stage Development of such an attractive financial instrument will induce an additional influx of users into the system and will intensively contribute to the growth of customer base 32 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Integration of Crowdfunding Platform As of now there are two long standing models for working with crowdfunding Keep It All and All Or Nothing In the first case the project receives all collected funds regardless of whether required amount has been reached or not In the second case investors receive the funds back if minimum amount required for implementation of the project was not reached A joint study of York University in Toronto (Canada) and French Universit\xc3\xa9 Lille Nord de France proves that normally All Or Nothing model gives more effective result that\ s why it was chosen as basis for crowdfunding platform operating in Datarius system Any user with a sufficient rating can announce public fundraising with a detailed indication of the financing objectives required amount and maximum deadline of the application not exceeding 45 days The use of smart contracts allows initiation of fundraising with their subsequent freezing until certain conditions occur and a deal is confirmed by a specific number of Datarius users who have rating above specified threshold Application for crowdfunding is automatically closed upon reaching requested amount or upon onset deadline date for funds collection Depending on terms of a smart contract money can be frozen or instantly transferred to user\ s wallet If after expiration of the application the required amount could not be collected the funds are automatically returned to the remitters Direct Access to Government Bond Market Financial analysts and experts talk with increasing frequency about the process of tokenization of world economy in which any including state assets may be presented in a digital form We are ready to lead this process and provide a full range of services related to purchase and sale of government loan bonds for DTRC tokens on Datarius platform Now closed consulting is being conducted with the representatives of government agencies who show interest in the technology Providing access to bond market will become a powerful activity driver in Datarius system and will attract many large investors with a huge capital 33 \x0cMILESTONES PLAN Private Pension Fund The existence of personal savings accounts allows us to gain access to funds that can be invested in long term projects with low risks and long term returns Based on Datarius we can create full fledged pension fund by investing money in long term projects in accordance with severely limited risks and capital management rules Choice of jurisdiction for the work of pension fund is the subject of ongoing negotiations One of most promising options \xe2\x80\x94 membership in trust funds in UAE Consultations on registration of pension trust in Jersey are under way The presented options provide reliable protection of assets and do not require undergoing excessive bureaucratic procedures for creation and management of the fund Commodity Exchange and Securities Exchange Finalization of Datarius system into a powerful financial system that provides all in one place services will occur with the advent of instruments for trading traditional assets goods and securities Technically access to trading platforms is carried out by integrating accounts of our partners into Datarius system To make deals partners register account in the system which receives DTRC tokens from customers who want to make a deal User gets access to all world exchanges through partner terminal built into the system and can make deals using funds on their personal wallet in Datarius Access to global exchanges allows providing the widest choice for portfolio investors including shares of world companies futures and option contracts into investment packages Emergence of additional instruments dramatically increases level of demand for manager and professional analysts\xe2\x80\x99

the forefront of digital economy Datarius sets itself for task of offering the most complete and up to date set of instruments and participating in trend formation To this end it was decided to form Datarius as an independent cryptobank by attracting people who are interested in development of the project \xe2\x80\x93 bankers \xe2\x80\x93 as active participants The model fully meets concept of Datarius cryptobank freedom sociality globality transparency independence high technology and is the foundation for further successful implementation DTRC Token DTRC token (Datarius Credit) \xe2\x80\x94 a utility token based on the ERC 20 smart contract of the Ethereum network This is a unique access key and the only tool for participating in the Datarius decentralized cryptobank system The whole range of the ecosystem financial products and services is based on the direct users\xe2\x80\x99 interaction between each other through DTRC tokens Financial products are formed by system users based on predefined rules with the help of designers Customers independently establish and accept terms of interactions using the token With the transition of Datarius cryptobank to its own blockchain DTRC token will be transferred in equivalent of 1 to 1 When carrying out internal system operations using DTRC token a service fee of 0 02% to 0 15% of the transaction amount is automatically calculated and charged The fee is calculated using special algorithms taking into account such factors as amount type of operation risk level scoring and type of involved users The lowest fees charged for the most risky operations without involving internal and partner services Consistent with the commitment to sociality openness and freedom of choice Datarius provides all active DTRC token holders with the right to receive 65% of all Datarius commissions and fees as a special internal DTRR token (DaTaRius Reward) 35 \x0cITO Assuming the function of social responsibility Datarius cryptobank decided to transfer 0 005% of fees collected from all operations with the use of DTRC token to charitable organizations List of organizations participating in the social responsibility program is formed directly by token holders The final number of DTRC tokens will be determined by the ITO round and will be equal to the total number of tokens emitted based on
