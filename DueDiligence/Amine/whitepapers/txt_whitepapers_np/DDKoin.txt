on the ETPS technology called DNC (DinarCoin) which represents 4 25grams of 999 9 karat gold (24k) on which the team started working on Furthermore the board decided to make ETPS technology more focused towards the community rendering ETPS more community centered 31 The team worked full hours on the Pre ICO project and the first instance of ETPS was developed for the public 27 To further increase awareness the team developed websites and used every marketing technique the security was also greatly improved to secure the system from malicious attacks February 2016 The DDK team developed teams of traders called MICE (Masters of International Crypto Exchanger) and ICE (International Crypto Exchanger) to grow the pre ICO community and further increase research on the target markets The team also participated in multiple international conferences to promote ETPS and DNC January 2015 December 2015 January 2016 March 2016 The team launched UBW (Universal Bitcoin Wallet) London in which DNC can be exchanged with BTC and ETH \x0c7 April 2017 www ddkoin com The Universal Bitcoin Wallet London was rebranded to Universal Blockchain Wallet Singapore security patches were also applied October 2017 This was the transition phase from ETPS to DDK coin the team also decided on making the consensus system based on DPoS (Delegated Proof Of Stake) April 2018 1 The ETPS platform ceased and development of the interface of DDK started DDK voting DPoS systems were thoroughly tested for their user friendliness and functionality DDK Documentation v1 0 was also prepared to make users understand the concept of DDK 30 The DDK Documentation v1 0 was released and the pre introduction to the web wallet interface made users familiar after the migration 8 The pre ICO has finished April 2018 June 2018 DDK has passed through it\xe2\x80\x99s initial stages with flying colours and we are aiming to continuously expand in the right direction with our team working on protocols and modules to further propel DDK in the market \x0c8 www ddkoin com Our Platforms | ETPS DDK DDK is a community centered platform that provides the economic opportunity through the development of blockchain solutions From 2015 our community has worked on many different ideas where users can collaborate in a business partnership using our platforms and currency DDK is an extension of our platform ETPS (Estimated Time Pool Sharing) where we launched the currency DNC (DinarCoin) DNC is a digital asset pegged to the value of 4 25 grams of 999 9 Karat gold (24K) Setting their eyes on another milestone the community has decided to excel by increasing the number of their users who use ETPS For the execution of this goal our community has decided to launch DDK platform with the integration of the revolutionized technology Blockchain With the integration of blockchain technology the ETPS platform has been converted into the DDK platform where delegated proof of stake will be used to establish consensus making the platform secure faster and democratic Note For the initial migration phase current users need to log in using the same username and password Then they will receive a passphrase in which they must keep security Current users are also not required to click on the stake button for the first stake as it will be automated The voting process is a must for users to receive staking rewards After migration the remaining ETPS Contract will be in the DDK platform Example If the user has undergone 3 months contract in the ETPS Platform user may continue another 3 months in the DDK Platform \xe2\x80\xa2 ETPS users received diamond rewards \xe2\x80\xa2 Cut off date diamond awards \xe2\x80\xa2 Accumulation of diamond awards will cease 16 29 th ETPS

Accumulation of overriding reward will cease 15 May th March 2018 th April 2018 8 30 June 2018 th th \xe2\x80\xa2 Announce to users the closing date of ETPS Platform which will be on the 8th till 30th June 2018 \xe2\x80\xa2 Users may transfer of their DNC in their DNC Wallet to their Blockchains My Wallet / Universal Blockchain Wallet / ImToken / MyEtherWallet 2018 1 July st 2018 Migration Process \xe2\x80\xa2 Start the migration details and 6 phases of migration All future stakeholders must follow the phases accordingly \x0c9 www ddkoin com Comparison between DDK and ETPS Characteristics DDK

Voting the delegates who distributed Token through blockchain Gains automatically run through server Regulation Bound to Singapore rules and regulation Bound to offshore rules and regulation \x0c10 www ddkoin com The DDK Platform DDK uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain for its platform This perfectly fits in our active community because it allows stakeholders to participate in the voting process as to whoever is elected to verify and maintain transactions on the platform This means that community members have a democratic voice in deciding who is responsible for processing and managing transactions on the platform This is done using a unique voting system to achieve consensus the process of verifying that transaction data is valid based on the general agreement of the trust elected network DDK platform with its innovative concept facilitates its users with Creating opportunities for supporting economic growth Faster and efficient transactions Global exchanger High security Suitable for micro payments Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) through DPoS Distributed database through delegates (Block Producer) \x0c11 www ddkoin com Get DDKoin from Global

Platform \x0c13 www ddkoin com The Stakeholder DDK users are those who have DDKoins in their wallet Users can get DDKoin from a global exchanger on which DDKoin is listed By default every DDK user on the platform staking DDKoin in their account is a stakeholder Stakeholders participate on the platform by voting for delegates In return for voting stakeholders are rewarded DDKoins because their participation helps in securing the network Role on the Platform Staking DDKoin Participation in the governance and voting of the block producer \x0c14 13 www ddkoin com Stakeholders Purchase DDKoin from Global Exchanger Transfer DDKoin to DDK platform Enter DDKoin into Staking Contract (24 times votes) Vote for Delegates (7 Days per vote) Receive Staking rewards after 4 times voting \x0c15 www ddkoin com The Delegates Based on the outcome of the voting process a stakeholder can become a delegate A delegate is a democratically elected stakeholder who is given the trusted position to process and manage transactions on the DDK platform In return for processing transactions the delegate is rewarded DDKoin(s) because his participation as delegate provides the operation and record of transactions Delegates digitally sign the transactions on the network They (like default stakeholders) also provide security to the network by operating as trusted delegates to process transactions

\x0c21 www ddkoin com Reward Incentives Giving rewards plays a significant role in our community because it creates an incentive for all of the community to participate and contribute to the security and productivity of the DDK platform It is the active participation of the community that empowers the platform to operate and continue effectively \x0c22 www ddkoin com Rewards Mechanism DDK incentivizes its community members with multiple types of rewards such as Un mined Staking rewards Pre Mined Airdrop rewards Direct referral Chain referral Delegate rewards Un mined DDKoins Staking Rewards This reward is given to community members who freeze their DDKoins in a staking contract for 6 months or more They will receive a reward of 10% on staked amount which will decrease in the first year and then every 6 months by 2% The staking reward will be given only if the stakeholder will complete 4 times voting in a month Each time on voting a stakeholder can select minimum 1 and maximum of 3 delegates with the same fee and 0 01% will be deducted from the amount staked from the stakeholder as fee On completing the target of voting 4 times in a month the stakeholder will get the DDKoin as reward \x0c23 www ddkoin com For example A stakeholder freezes 50 DDKoins for 6 months For the first 12 months every 30 days (for the period of 6 months) they will receive 5 DDKoins Stakeholder must have to complete 24 times vote per staking contract in order to gain rewards The initial staking rewards begins at 10% for the first 12 months then declines gradually to 2% This is all dependent on the voting of delegates which are applicable up to 4 times 1 Year 10% Rewards 6 Months 6 Months 6 Months 8% Rewards 6% Rewards 4% Rewards Reward scale for staking Remaining years 2% Rewards 41 Million DDKoin \x0c24 429 337 463 684 500 778 540 841 584 108 630 836 www ddkoin com \x0c25 www ddkoin com 8 Block Reward Reduction Note Possible to be 10 years because Not all DDK users are continuously staking since users could possibly withdraw or exchange to other coins The allocation for both direct and chain referral rewards will come out from Airdrop Rewards reserved until the 2% is finished For staking rewards the distribution will be based on voting activity by stakeholders until all reach 41 million total DDKoin supply for staking \x0c26 www ddkoin com Pre mined Airdrop Rewards These are rewards that are distributed to community members for specific activities carried out on the platform The airdrop rewards on the DDK platform include Stakeholder rewards table No Type of rewards Rewards 1 Referral reward 10% from referral staked amount 2 Chain referral 15 level DDKoin Allocation for Rewards 2% of 45 Million DDKoin (Pre mined for Airdrop Rewards) Direct Referral This reward is given to community members for referring new stakeholders to the platform Whenever their new referral member freezes DDKoins for staking they receive a 10% referral reward based on their referee\xe2\x80\x99s staking amount For example A new referee gets 100 DDKoins then takes 50 of those DDKoins and freezes them in 6 months staking contract In this case the referral will receive 5 DDKoins as a direct referral reward because 5 DDKoins is 10% of the amount staked by their referee \x0c27 Chain Referral This is a reward that community members will receive from their chain of referees In other words community members are rewarded indirectly from the referee\xe2\x80\x99s of their direct referrals DDK has a 15 level chain referral reward This reward is based on staking and it is received by \xe2\x80\x9cchain network\xe2\x80\x9d registered users through their referral links Here is a complete example explaining how chain referral system of DDK works www ddkoin com Referral Link Introducer of B Referral Link Referral to A Username B Second level of A First level of B Referral Link Username C Third level of A Second level of B Username D First level of C Chain Referral System First level of A \x0c28 www ddkoin com Based on diagram above \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 gives his referral link to \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 registers under \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 Hence \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 is called the \xe2\x80\x98INTRODUCER\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 is called the \xe2\x80\x98REFERRAL\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 As the extension goes on let \xe2\x80\x98Username C\xe2\x80\x99 registers using the referral link of \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 and in the same way \xe2\x80\x98Username D\xe2\x80\x99 registers using the referral link of \xe2\x80\x98Username C\xe2\x80\x99 In other words we can say that \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 is the first level of \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Username C\xe2\x80\x99 is the second level of \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 and First level of \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 while \xe2\x80\x98Username D\xe2\x80\x99 is the third level of \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 second level of \xe2\x80\x98User name B\xe2\x80\x99 and first level of \xe2\x80\x98Username C\xe2\x80\x99 Example \xe2\x80\x98Username D\xe2\x80\x99 stakes 10 DDKoins After complete voting for 4 times \xe2\x80\x98Username D\xe2\x80\x99 will receive the 10% from 1 DDKoin as staking reward From 1 DDK (the staking reward) \xe2\x80\x98Username C\xe2\x80\x99 (first level of username D) will receive 5% from 1 DDKoin earned by \xe2\x80\x98Username D\xe2\x80\x99 which is equal to 0 05 DDKoin \xe2\x80\x98Username B\xe2\x80\x99 (second level of D) will receive 3% from 1 DDKoin which is equal to 0 03 DDKoin \xe2\x80\x98Username A\xe2\x80\x99 (third level of D) will receive 2% from 1 DDKoin which is equal to 0 02 DDKoin Hence the reward received for all levels is A (third level) = 0 02 DDKoins B (second level) = 0 03 DDKoins C (first level) = 0 05 DDKoins D (staking reward) = 1 DDKoin \x0c29 www ddkoin com Therefore the first level of a chain referral begins with one\xe2\x80\x99s direct referrals referee As those referees gain their own referrals the chain of referees extends onward level by level until the 15 levels are completed Furthermore as the chain extends one still gets benefit from each level Here is a list of the percentage for each chain referral level Levels of chain referral rewards Level Chain Referral Rewards (%) 1 5 2 3 3 2 4 2 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 0 9 9 0 8 10 0 7

a community forum where those interested in becoming delegates post their campaigns to encourage the DDK community to vote for them Those who are already delegates can also use the forum to encourage community members to continue voting for them Campaigning usually includes writing articles and updates about why voting for you as a delegate is beneficial for the community Once the stakeholder gets successfully registered then he/she will run a campaign on a campaign platform where he/she can pitch his/her unique idea of how he/she will give benefits to the stakeholders who are casting votes for him It is a community forum for the people interested to become a delegate The delegates post their campaigns through the forum to motivate the community to cast votes for them Those who are already delegates can use the forum to encourage community members for keep voting for them The campaign includes writing articles and updates on the forum about why casting votes for you would be beneficial for the community For example campaigns can include topics such as promising to share a percentage of the delegate\xe2\x80\x99s transaction rewards with those who vote for them informing the community about their success rate of processing transactions on the platform which helps everyone benefit from speedy transactions informing the community that a percentage of their transaction rewards will go to a specific charity or just cause There are numerous ways to pitch a campaign to the community which is left to the creativity of the delegate \x0c35 www ddkoin com Process Flows for transferring

challenges for customer centric businesses are Barriers to market entry are lower The value of data only continues to grow The need to strengthen customer loyalty and attract new customers is intensifying More opportunities with new data driven personalized products and services A community can play a vital role in the longevity of a product\xe2\x80\x99s lifecycle as its engagement can increase market growth or more community members which in turn can also make the community more aware about blockchain cryptocurrencies and its benefits The market size and opportunity of community centered cryptocurrencies combined are far more greater than Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s current market cap It is because the basis of cryptocurrencies are under the governance of decentralization where the community reaches consensus on transactions and blocks alike in a unison manner There are rewards in place for keeping up this type of unity in the form of transaction fee and block rewards which are

than other existing algorithms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake as it does not require very high computational power and the mining opportunity depends on the number of votes for the miners from stakeholders In terms of reward incentives DPoS incentivize the miners with the transaction fees on validation and block reward on block generation Unlike DPoS in PoW the miner gets reward on block generation while in PoS the miners only get the block\xe2\x80\x99s pooled transaction fees Why DPoS Proof of work (Pow) Participants Called miners open to everyone on the network Proof of Stake (Pos) Called forgers created of a new block is chosen based on the amount of stake Delegated Proof of Stake Called delegates creator of new blocks are chosen based on the number of vote casted by stakeholers Requirements Requires burning an external resource (mining hardware Power) Creation of Cryptocurrencies New cryptocurrency coins are created each time a transaction is validated serves as a block reward Has a set amounts of circulating cryptocurrency coins were Pre mined in advance Validation process All miners completed with one another to solve a cryptographic puzzle to validated the transaction Set validators participate in a consensus algorithm to vote on the next to be forged The one who gets most number of votes will earn the opportunity to validate transactions No block reward the forger takes the block\xe2\x80\x99s pooled transaction fees The delegate gets the transaction fees and reward on block creation Incentivization Block reward is given Requires a high stake on the cryptocurrency to be determind as a block validator To set up a personal node and holds a specific amount of coins in his/her wallet Coin are created on the generation of new block \x0c46 www ddkoin com PoW Proof of Work is a consensus protocol for achieving a unanimous validation of the member devices on a distributed network In PoW the validators are those who solve the complex hashes and validate the transactions for adding them into the blocks they are creating The whole process is carried out in 3 steps a very complex mathematical challenge is proposed to the network of blockchain the miners then compete to solve the given problem which takes time and resources making it more expensive for them the first miner to solve the problem gets the chance to validate transactions create a block and receive reward afterwards As the mining process requires a high computational power and time to solve the complex problems therefore PoW is considered as a costly consensus mechanism Proof of Work is effective for large systems like bitcoin only ensuring security for them as the attackers require 51% of the whole network power to get their attack successful making it difficult In fact it is impossible to temper But for small systems PoW cannot ensure the security because it is relatively easier to own more than 51% of the computational power at lower cost PoS PoS is the consensus mechanism in which the number of coins held by a miner is directly proportional to the chances to mine the block or transactions This means that the more coins a miner owns the more mining power he/she has As compared to the PoW consensus protocol PoS requires less computational power as the opportunity to mine now depends more on the number of coins a miner holds and less on the computational power he/she has This makes PoS a relatively cost efficient consensus protocol Besides its cost efficacy PoS has a disadvantage in terms of authority where the stakeholders who own more coins enjoy the extensive control in both technical and economic aspects of the network which let them to make any changes they like without considering the will of the community developers and miners This defeats the purpose of a distributed network where everyone gets involved in making consensus \x0c47 www ddkoin com DPoS DPoS is the decentralized fast secure and efficient consensus mechanism which leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way In DPoS those who hold the network token are given the opportunity to cast votes to elect block producers For selecting the block producers the votes from the stakeholders are weighted by the stakeholder\xe2\x80\x99s stake and the block producer candidates who receive the most votes are those who become delegates The delegates are the community members who validate the transactions and add them to the block On block creation the delegates get reward While there are problems with both democracy and corporate governance one important feature of DPoS that sets it apart from other consensus mechanisms is the open source nature of these protocols which means that if users disagree they can fork The flexible and transparent nature of DPoS makes it useable for entire blockchains or as a consensus algorithm for sidechains private blockchains and more In addition to this the lower fees fast confirmations and the potential for increased profitability make the DPoS a perfect democratic consensus mechanism Why Fork Lisk One of the main problems in DPoS lies in getting delegates to come and secure the blockchain To guarantee an ultra secure network the delegates need to compete with each other in order to be within the top 101 delegates Without fierce competition individual delegates will never strive to be faster more secure and always on Forging rewards create this necessary competition In much the same way the arms race at Bitcoin has pushed miners to compete even more Forging rewards will create a battle amongst the best performing delegates One of the biggest problems with Lisk (and the reason why many are forking it) is that these wallets have unlimited votes Each node can cast all 101 votes to select a total number of 101 active delegates at the same time This has led to the creation of cartels The majority of all Lisk delegate nodes are owned by 2 cartels that demand their voters vote for all of their nodes if they want to receive forging reward payments This makes it incredibly hard to ever unvote a delegate in Lisk and if one of the cartel nodes go down it\ s very hard to knock them out of the top 101 and let a more attentive delegate with a more stable server take their spot \x0c48 www ddkoin com In Ark on the other hand a wallet can only vote for one delegate at a time This makes cartel creation much harder and is easier to remove bad delegates from forging Due to very low ICO price of Ark ($0 01) a private investment group bought a lot of Ark very early and owns at least 4 forging nodes at time Instead of their bad nodes which result in slowing down the network one cannot unvote them because nobody but they themselves are voting in the network DDK DPoS It seems like the number of votes per participant is a good tuning parameter in deciding the fate of the network and keeping it as far from cartel creations and monopoly as possible DDK charting out the best way possible has forked lisk so that the community can invest and earn in a more transparent and democratic way In DDK Delegated Proof of Stake provides the community members to select the best from the candidates who are willing to become a delegate (miner) through voting The candidate with the highest number of votes gets the opportunity to validate the transactions and get block reward on block creation In DDK DPoS if the number of votes for two candidates is equal then the decision takes place with the amount of stake the voter accounts hold weight of vote This makes the DDK DPoS consensus mechanism more efficient because the vote count is considered prior to the vote weight \x0c49 www ddkoin com Technical Concept of DDK Invalidated transactions \x0c50 www ddkoin com Key Generation Edward Digital Signature Algorithm Edward Digital Signature Algorithm EdDSA is a digital signature scheme which is faster than the existing digital signature schemes In DDK EdDSA is used to generate keys Key pair A key pair consists of A private key A public key Private key is a piece of information known only to the owner of the key Public key is derived from the private key and can be used to validate that the private key belongs to the owner but not provide access to the owner\xe2\x80\x99s private key The user signs the transactions using private key into a transaction object and broadcasts that object to the network The receiving nodes will verify the validity of the signatures using the public key which is attached with the transaction This provides an efficient mechanism for securing the network as Ks (secret key/private key) is known only to the user while Kp(public key) is used to validate that either the signature is valid or not valid \x0c51 How Key pair is generated The process used to generate the key pair operates under the following assumptions When a user creates an account a BIP39 mnemonics (the passphrase) is generated for the user This hash is subsequently used as a seed in ed25519 to generate the private key (ks) and derives its public key kp www ddkoin com \x0c52 www ddkoin com Transaction Pool Transaction pool serves the DDK network for three purposes Reducing Unspent Transaction Output (UXTO) Mechanism for transaction propagation Holding transactions with pending signatures Reducing UXTO The transaction pool is a solution for preserving unconfirmed transactions that have overflowed into the next block The transaction pool could be thought of as a memory pool keeping transactions ready until they are signed into a block Mechanism for transaction propagation Transaction pool provides a mechanism for propagating transactions When a node prepares a transaction bundle that node draws transactions from the pool and performs validation on those transactions These transactions are then broadcasted to other nodes in a bundled JSON object Holding transactions with pending signatures Transaction pool keeps transactions with pending signatures on hold These transactions with pending signatures follow the same model as unconfirmed transactions In order to keep the transaction pool tidy all transactions are assigned a time to live Like unconfirmed transactions these transactions will expire out of the pool based on the lifetime specified when the transaction is first generated \x0c53 www ddkoin com Transactions DDK involves the following four types of transactions which include P2P transaction Rewards transaction Referral transaction Staking contract transaction The transactions taking place in the DDK network consists of Name Data Type Size Transaction type Integer 8 bit Timestamp Epoch 32 bit Public key String 256 bit Amount of DDKoin Integer 64 bit The minimum amount of DDKoins can be transferred through one transaction is 0 0001 DDKoins and the transaction fee that will be charged on transacting 0 0001 DDKoins is 0 00000001 DDKoin \x0c54 www ddkoin com Broadcast Queue Broadcast queue serves the functionality of keeping the transactions gathered from transaction pool After getting transactions from transaction pool the broadcast queue aggregates these transactions into a bundle This bundle is then broadcasted to the network on an interval To prevent over broadcasting of the object the bundle is assigned a relay limit In the current implementation the relay limit is 2 that means every bundle will be broadcasted once from the originating node and twice more from the receiving nodes P2P network Communication Peers communication is an essential component within the DDK network The peering mechanisms provide the required architecture to facilitate network consensus block propagation and transaction propagation The DPoS mechanism further helps in the efficiency of communication between peers Inside P2P network Transaction Signing Regardless of the type every transaction must be signed by the sender before it gets accepted by the network The process of signing the transaction is identical for every transaction and it includes the following steps First a data block representing the transaction must be generated Once the data block has been generated it is hashed using the SHA 256 algorithm and this hash is signed using the key pair of the issuer If the issuer has enabled a second passphrase the first signature is appended at the end of the data block and the process is repeated generating a second signature \x0c55 A signed transaction uses the following flow www ddkoin com \x0c56 With a second signature the flow looks like this www ddkoin com ks \x0c57 Name Integer Epoch String Integer Integer Integer Integer Integer String String \x0c58 www ddkoin com How is block generated In DDK block generation happens through the DPoS consensus mechanism Where every block generation happens through a delegate that has been given the permission to generate blocks by the election process held between stakeholders and the coin holders When a candidate becomes a delegate by getting the most number of votes through DPoS consensus he/she will be assigned the unvalidated transactions from the transaction pool Each block can contain a maximum of 25 transactions in it The delegate will validate the transactions and add them in the block When the block is completed the delegate broadcasts it on the network and gets block reward in DDKoins Block Propagation Block propagation takes place when a block is created and broadcasted to all existing nodes on the network to establish consensus Once generated a block is broadcasted to peers which broadcast the block to other peers on the network In this way the block propagates through the whole network so that all the existing nodes can update and make consensus Otherwise the system would grind to a halt and the blockchain would cease to be functional \x0c59 www ddkoin com Consensus mechanism DPoS DDK uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as the consensus system of the chain the delegates are the nodes that have the ability to generate blocks The delegates are selected by rigorous voting between the stakeholders In DDK the delegates\xe2\x80\x99 ranks depend on the VOTE COUNT where VOTE COUNT is only one vote per account A stakeholder can vote for a delegate using a vote transaction However when vote count is the same among other delegates the vote weight will eventually put into rank Stakeholders may unvote delegates with fees imposed Consensus is a required aspect of any blockchain system It serves a vital purpose for the system where there are many nodes and all nodes must agree on the integrity of the data All nodes participating must agree on what transactional data is legitimate in order to move the blockchain forward Delegates A delegate is a type of node that has been registered by the transaction delegate registration These nodes have a special purpose within DDK as they are allowed to generate blocks for the system if the delegate has been allocated enough stake by other users of the system Any node may become a delegate but only if the pre conditions of the required stake are allowed to generate blocks Voting Mechanism (DPoS) DDK implements DPoS consensus algorithm for the selection of delegates For this the stakeholder who wants to become a delegate registers on the platform and submits a fee of 10 DDKoins Perfect Scenario 10% Earning Voting Process in a Month Voting mechanism 7 days 1st Week (Vote 1/4) 7 days 2nd Week (Vote 2/4) 7 days 3rdWeek (Vote 3/4) 4th

for the following 6 months No 2% for the remaining years until allocation for staking rewards is finish Valid Stakeholders stake their DDKoins on the platform and gets 10% on the staked amount after every 6 months for one year After that the percentage reward will deplete by 2% every month and it will stop decreasing when it will reach at 2% Standby Delegates (Unlimited) For example a community member put 50 DDKoins on staking they will receive 5 DDKoins after they are done with 4 times voting Voting Enter into (201) delegate ranking Delegate in 201 ranking get the transaction fees 1

equally distributed to delegates who create block \x0c62 www ddkoin com DDK asset issuing (interchain) development In the world of cryptocurrencies there are no easy mechanisms for managing the funds in various life circumstances or according to your business needs DDK platform is dedicated to solving this issue For example currently there are over 15 millions of Bitcoin wallets from which more than a quarter of all existing bitcoins were lost forever Running customer\ s own side chains with their own blockchain and cryptocurrencies is not a solution To solve this issue DDK decided to use smart contracts making crypto assets quick safe and convenient Smart Contracts are the special computer software on the blockchain which will be executed by a network of computers They are the key to unlock the world where any computer oriented task can be performed completely autonomously and correctly without fear of external manipulation or imitation Using smart contract technology our customers\xe2\x80\x99 financial tasks become available to all who can use it in a fully automated independent way which records these tasks directly to the blockchain Although smart contracts are unambiguous in their meaning only those who are familiar with the programming language can understand them so it makes it difficult to reach an agreement with any party that does not have technical knowledge This technology excludes the possibility of closing banks or financial institutions and changing deleting transactions and also ensures that each payment will be made exactly as indicated without any risk of misuse or malicious interference Companies strive to use smart contracts in their work correcting their various faults Without easy to use proven and reliable methods to effectively create accurate smart contracts their widespread adoption will never happen Simply put smart contracts will allow you to use advanced locking options for the widest audience Logically the

Choosing the type of smart contract Before migration process you need to choose (old) smart contract with exact parameters Token migration process is starting and DDK Token Service is transmitted to (old) smart contract Type ID and (old) smart contract ID 2 Preparing data to create a new smart contract DDK Token Service requests a list of (old ) tokens holders that must be migrated from old smart contract The list of token holders is nec essary for the correct distribution of new tokens by wallet in the new smart contract In DDK Node transmits a request to provide a list of holders of old tokens of old smart contract and old smart contract ID 3 Data transfer for creating a new smart contract DDK Node prepare a list of token holders of the old smart contract and transmitted it to DDK Token Service for the creation of a new smart contract Transmitted a list of old token holders from old smart contract to new smart contract ID 4 Creating a new smart contract DDK Token Service creates a new smart contract Parameters of the new smart contract which is also transferred from the old smart contract list of token holders The list of holders of the tokens to be sent to the Node DDK which must be migrated according to the valid smart contract the ID (ad dress) of the new smart contract This action is the initialization of the Deploy operation of the new smart contract 5 Deploy a new smart contract For new tokens it is necessary to create a new smart contract with the following characteristics list of new token holders the amount (num ber) of new tokens DDK Node started the procedure for deploying a new smart contract The parameters of the new smart contract (token ID list of token holders for the new smart contract the ID of the new smart contract the amount (number) of new tokens) are fixed 6 Start the migration procedure DDK Node starting the process of token migration from old smart contract in a new smart contract (transfers the new smart contract to the migration mode) Being used the (old) token ID the new token ID the old smart contract ID (address) the new smart contract ID \x0c71 www ddkoin com 7 Send notification of the beginning of migration DDK Node sends to the old token holders (holders from list of holders of tokens under the current smart contract) from which the migra tion occurs notification of the beginning migration and the need to implement it The ID of the transmitted token the ID of the new token to which the migration occurs the ID (address) the current smart contract and the ID (address) of the new smart contract are transmitted 8 Voting of token holders To start the token migration procedure the token holders must perform the action in their electronic wallet It is inadmissible to anyone even the owner of the smart contract to burn the tokens of other token holders This kind of operations on their tokens can only be carried out by their holder Therefore the token holder of the current smart contract must also migrate the tokens For example to migrate to a token holder it is sufficient to transfer any amount (number) of tokens to the ID (address) of the new smart contract in the migration mode The token holders confirm the fact of the migration of their tokens using the voting method and fix their decision The ID of the electronic purse the ID of the token from which the migration occurs the ID of the token to which the migration occurs the amount (number) of tokens the ID (address) of the valid smart contract the ID (address) of the new smart contract the voice ( confirmation) of the holder are transmitted 9 Fixing the decision of the holders of the tokens Based on the information received (see clause 8) the Node DDK captures the confirmation holders of the token for conducting a token migration operation and launching directly functionality of token migration 10 Burning of tokens creating new tokens Node DDK using the list of holders of the token from which the migration occurs and confirmation of their holders burns the tokens from which migration occurs and creates new tokens on the new smart contract The amount of new tokens created should correspond to the amount of burned tokens in the holder\ s section (ID of Web wallets) 11 Preparation of data to verify the completeness of the migration To verify the correctness of generation of new tokens and the correspondence of their amount (number) of old tokens To verify the compliance of the distribution of new tokens by electronic purses of tokens holders Node DDK uses the parameters ID (address) the current smart contract the ID (address) of the new Smart Contract the amount (number) of tokens under the smart contract \x0c72 www ddkoin com the amount (number) of tokens under the new smart contract 12 Checking the correctness and completeness of the token migration Node DDK checks the correctness of the distribution of new tokens by electronic purses of holders equality of the total amount (number) of new tokens to the sum (amount) tokens from which the migration was made (the amount (number) of tokens and new tokens is not should change) The data which is used the ID (address) of the current smart contract ID (address) of the new smart contract amount (number) of tokens for the Smart Contract amount (number) of tokens under the new Smart Contract ID of electronic purses 13 Fixing the parameters of the migration operation The Node DDK sends a confirmation to DDK Token Service that the operation has been completed migration of the token and transmits the ID (address) of the new smart contract the list of the holders of the token for new smart contract 14 Completion of the token migration operation In the DDK Token Service a confirmation from the Node DDK is fixed and a characteristic is set completion of the token migration opera tion The data is used the ID (address) of the new smart contract list of holders of the token under the new smart contract All holders of the new token and smart contract Owner will be notified 15 Sending a confirmation to the holder of a new token of the performed migration operation token DDK Token Service forms and sends a new token to the holder a notification with confirmation of successful execution of the operation of the token migration with indication of the amount (number) of new tokens and the ID (address) of the new smart contract The data is used the ID (address) of the new smart contract the list of holders of a new security key for the smart contract the amount of new tokens in context of electronic wallets 16 Sending confirmation to Owner about completed token migration operation DDK Token Service generates and sends to smart contract Owner a response with confirmation about successful execution of the opera tion of the token migration with indication of the amount (amount) of new tokens and the ID (address) of the new smart contract The data is used the ID (address) of the new smart contract and list of
