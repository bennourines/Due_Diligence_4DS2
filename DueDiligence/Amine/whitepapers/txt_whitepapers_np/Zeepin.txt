The Foundation\ s goal is to promote development research and advocacy for the Zeepin blockchain (Zeepin Chain) which is a decentralised blockchain developed for the global creative industry and the decentralised sharing new economy community thereon which would help global creative content producers and innovators with assets digitisation and rights confirmation enable efficient transactions and crowd funding of creative assets help organisations and individuals improve innovation efficiency and incubate a large number of self governing for profit creative organisations applying blockchain technology to the sharing economy model In the community on Zeepin Platform each organisation or individual will have a reliable digital identity and be able to convert innovative or creative resources into digital assets which are secure and may be shared on Zeepin Chain so as to reduce risks in trading between users and improve creation efficiency The decentralised platform to be build by the Foundation on the Zeepin blockchain is designed to be the world\ s leading blockchain based innovation transaction and crowd funding platform for the creative industry (Zeepin Platform) Based on the standard open source framework consisting of the NeoContract smart contract system and front end library Zeepin Platform enables any organisation or individual (including creators manufacturers and channel partners) to launch innovative projects or jointly organise decentralised self governing innovation teams To better suit the features of the Sharing New Economy the Foundation\ s technical team has designed and built the bottom blockchain infrastructure and business framework in a manner which will be more suitable for the Zeepin community and future applications In this way the Zeepin Chain database will be more suited to develop applications based on the consistency of massive data covering credit investigation digital copyright anti counterfeiting etc It is planned that atomic transactions on Zeepin Chain can support electronic assets asset swaps payment and other functions Meanwhile the technical team has greatly extended functions at the protocol layer so as to support various dApps which are planned for release under the Zeepin name In conclusion Zeepin Plaform provides support for innovators from putting forward an idea to fully operating project including project crowd funding team formation copyright protection IP transactions etc In addition the Zeepin team behind the development of Zeepin Platform has accumulated rich industrial experience and resources and the Foundation will work with Arting365 to enable over 1 2 million designers worldwide to provide creative services for their customers and possibly even the whole industry in the Zeepin community Through the usage of the native tokens (ZPT) on Zeepin Chain the Zeepin Platform connects creative content with people in need of creative ideas through embedded smart contracts 7 \x0cZeepin Platform = Creative industry + Smart economy 8 \x0c2 Problems to Solve 2 1 Currently right confirmation and protection is difficult in the creative market which reduces passion for innovation ZEEPIN CHAIN SOLUTION COPYRIGHT PRO How can one prove that the copyright is created by the creator Recording copyright confirmation information on an authoritative centralised platform may result in the risk of tampering by the supreme database administrator or external hacker such that such information is unsatisfactory evidence in a court and/or unable to fully support the creator\ s right confirmation It is difficult to carry out right confirmation because the creator supervisory authorities and copyright user cannot achieve mutual trust in an effective and low cost manner In Zeepin Chain each creator who has validated their rights will receive a type of digital asset called Copyright Pro which will get the support from Zeepin Chain in its whole lifecycle including copyright selling transfer and co creator copyright distribution Zeepin certificate of registration will be issued for the digital asset and will be recorded on the blockchain with timestamp Each right confirmation can be treated as right confirmation transaction recorded on the blockchain which publicizes creator\ s information copyright information and creative theme Hash 2 2 The supervision and distribution mechanism for copyright assets is not complete and users lack a trust mechanism ZEEPIN CHAIN SOLUTION SMART CONTRACT BASED AUTHORISATION PRO AND ITS TRACEABILITY On Zeepin Chain once creators successfully validate their right and obtain Copyright Pros they can use the Copyright Pros to further issue Authorisation Pros grant the Authorisation Pros to relevant stakeholders involved in production / distribution and implement the pre agreed plan for profit sharing for that particular copyright between the copyright creator and relevant stakeholders (to be programmed into smart contract) On Zeepin Chain Authorisation Pros are a type of digital assets with fast safe trusted and decentralised transaction features similar to other digital assets Zeepin Chain\ s smart contract function will be performed according to related information specified in the Authorisation Pros and the system will automatically distribute profits for that particular copyright according to the preagreed percentage It is impossible to change stop or tamper with the whole process 2 3 The centralised transaction venue is unable to adapt to the lightweight innovation development trend ZEEPIN CHAIN SOLUTION DECENTRALISED INTERCONNECTION AND TRANSACTION PLATFORM 9 \x0cA feature of the creative market today is lightweight innovation referring to a myriad of ideas and intellectual property which may potentially be copyrighted but which individually have small value Should owners of these lightweight innovation go through the traditional process of negotiations contract signing and subsequent profit distribution this small value would be barely able to cover the hefty transaction costs associated with the traditional process The traditional process is complicated with multiple procedures due to the requirement of trusted third parties to act as the middleman between two unfamiliar parties involved and these third party(ies) would also want to participate in profit sharing which raises transaction cost Zeepin Platform (together with the planned DApps such as Zee Create and ZeeRights on Zeepin Chain) aims to provide a decentralised and trusted creativity interconnection and copyright transaction environment thus ensuring trust between multiple parties on copyright creativity need and production without a trusted third party In this way the transaction cost will decrease to adapt to the transaction trend of lightweight innovation 2 4 The opaque and untrusted transaction mode is difficult to merger into financial innovation ZEEPIN CHAIN SOLUTION TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SCALABILITY OF THE BLOCKCHAIN TO INTERCONNECT WITH THIRD PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIERS Under the current creativity production and copyright transaction model the whole chain cost is not able to support financial services through traditional procedures and on the other hand financial institutions find it almost impossible to evaluate and price small amounts of creativity service and digital copyright transaction in a cost effective manner Zeepin Chain had been conceptualised to provide blockchain based information encompassing copyright confirmation transaction authorisation and pre agreed profit distribution between users which exists on the tamper proof transaction record on the blockchain timestamp The Zeepin Platform is designed to allow financial institutions to design products e g petty insurance with smart contract like features thus enabling financial products to integrate into the whole chain covering digital copyright production interconnection and transaction and providing relevant protection to participants Due to the open and public nature of the blockchain more financial institutions stakeholders and third party commercial institutions can link up with Zeepin Chain in the future thus enhancing traffic guidance transaction and service on different nodes of the entire community while accelerating value circulation for the entire creative industry 10 \x0c3 Mission The Foundation\ s goal is to promote development research and advocacy for Zeepin Chain which is a decentralised blockchain developed for the global creative industry and the decentralised sharing new economy community thereon which would help global creative content producers and innovators with assets digitisation and rights confirmation enable efficient transactions and crowdfunding of creative assets help organisations and individuals improve innovation efficiency and incubate a large number of self governing for profit creative organisations applying blockchain technology to the sharing economy model Although the global creative industry is developing rapidly its growth rate still falls short of the expectations of industry analysts One key reason is that the leading enterprises tend to develop slowly whilst the development of medium small and micro sized enterprises organisations and innovative individuals is limited due to copyright territory talent financing and other related problems NEO is an open sourced publicly maintained distributed computing bottom layer network built on blockchain technology The subsequent development of NEO offers the possibility of realising a smart economy decentralising organisational structure promoting digitisation of blockchain based assets creation of digital identities and the automatic management of digital assets via smart contracts The Foundation is actively involved in establishing communities and decentralised organisations which non technical users may use in dApps in order to create and manage based on NEO Relevant tools have created a new mode for mass collaboration based on economic incentives Meanwhile blockchain and encryption technologies are changing the situation accelerating the development of the creative industry and enabling innovators to change the world in an easier and more comfortable way The Foundation aims to create a fair and efficient creative ecosystem which can be understood as a public facility in the blockchain field which has various kinds of tools (dApps) which anyone can use These dApps are designed to solve the problems related to the protection of innovation copyright remote cooperation talent recruitment and project financing For example the most fundamental dApp in the Zeepin community is ZeeRights which helps innovators in copyright protection ensures tradable digital assets and solves problems from the industrial source The blockchain technology based trust system and infrastructure will help achieve collective coordination creation of value and accelerate the organic integration of participants in the cultural and creative industries thus to make it possible for everyone to easily utilise the value resources scattered around the world Every user of Zeepin Platform may find his/her needed resources and launch innovative / crowd funding projects 11 \x0c4 Zeepin Community 4 1 Zeepin Infrastructure The Zeepin Platform\ s infrastructure network is built based on the underlying technology of DNAProject Meanwhile in light of different needs Zeepin Platform also provides innovative multilayered and classified ledger methods There will be standardised procedures and services reference data sharing standardised processing capacity and timely data display In the future all people can release applications and digital assets or provide the derivative products/services of digital assets on the chain 4 2 Zeepin Utility 4 2 1 ZeeCrew Zeepin Platform will introduce ZeeCrew which is designed to be a key public facility in the community which enables organisations or individuals to form decentralised and autonomous project teams ZeeCrew is an efficient and cost benefit way to set up the team running a separate legal entity With the blockchain based smart contract and Zeepin\ s public facilities the founders are able to outsource various tasks such as office administration legal services accounting services and sharing of profits from the project Participants can set up a new team contract address as the team\ s public account Then new team participants can be added by directionally sending out a profit distribution proportion Meanwhile the team can apply for a name and bind its name with its address through Zeepin Name Service hence enhancing the team\ s credit standing ZeeCrew applies to any individuals and organisations For example it can be used to flexibly establish new operations or project groups with joint efforts between different companies between different individuals as well as between individuals and companies It is a modern eco friendly and effective operation model as an alternative to the traditional company operation system The 12 \x0cessence of efficiency lies in the fact that you can find project required resources and partners around the world through the community For example you can take advantage of the quality copyright of creators to drive the excess capacity of small and medium sized manufacturers 4 2 2 Zeepin Token\xef\xbc\x88ZPT\xef\xbc\x89 The native token for Zeepin Chain (ZPT) is the infrastructure of the decentralised community It is a functional utility token which may only be utilised on the Zeepin Platform (if successfully completed and deployed) as a unit of exchange for valuable products / services provided in the ecosystem on Zeepin Platform and provide incentives which will encourage participants to contribute and maintain the ecosystem on Zeepin Platform ZPT is a non refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of exchange between participants on the Zeepin Platform ZPT does not in any way represent any shareholding participation right title or interest in the Foundation its affiliates or any other company enterprise or undertaking nor will ZPT entitle token holders to any promise of fees revenue profits or investment returns and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction ZPT may only be utilised on Zeepin Platform and ownership of ZPT carries no rights express or implied other than the right to use ZPT as a means to enable usage of and interaction with Zeepin Platform All dApps and tools planned to be developed by the Foundation (e g ZeeRights ZeeCreate ZeeTalent ZeeFund ZeeProof and ZeeSure) will be launched on Zeepin Platforms and ZPT is the only means by which payment may be made for these dApps and tools The Zeepin Platform is also planned to have features which would allow for reward based crowdfunding of certain projects by users on the Zeepin Platform (securities and equity based crowdfunding projects would rejected) and the project organisers would receive ZPT from other users The ZPT received may be spent by these project organisers on Zeepin Platform e g engaging the services of other developers designers or professionals In particular you understand and accept that ZPT (a) is non refundable cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation or any affiliate (b) does not represent or confer on you any right of any form with respect to the Foundation (or any of its affiliates) or its revenues or assets including without limitation any right to receive future revenue shares ownership right or stake share or security any voting distribution redemption liquidation proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property) or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Zeepin Platform the Foundation and/or its service providers (c) is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money) security commodity bond debt instrument or any other kind of financial instrument or investment (d) is not a loan to the Foundation or any of its affiliates is not intended to represent a debt owed by the Foundation or any of its affiliates and there is no expectation of profit and 13 \x0c(e) does not provide you with any ownership or other interest in the Foundation or any of its affiliates The contributions in the token sale will be held by a separate entity after the token sale and contributors will have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in these contributions or the assets of that entity after the token sale To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading ZPT does develop it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Foundation the sale of ZPT and Zeepin Platform The Foundation will not create such secondary markets nor will it act as an exchange for ZPT 4 3 Zeepin dApps Similar to the Apple Store Zeepin dApps provides various API data interfaces for community developers Any user of Zeepin Platform may release Zeepin based applications via Zeepin dApps to serve the whole creative industry The dApps developed or planned to be developed by the Foundation are as follows 4 3 1 ZeeRights Creative copyright plays a very important role in the ecosystem on the Zeepin Platform The existing difficulty of rights confirmation and protection limits the innovative impetus for innovators The Zeepin Platform\ s solution to this issue is to digitize and record these creative assets through the usage of \xe2\x80\x9cCopyright Pro\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAuthorisation Pro\xe2\x80\x9d The Foundation aims to reduce the actual cost to the user for copyright certification to close to zero Zeepin Platform aims to offer the dApp ZeeSure to support innovators and to ensure the protection of their copyright 14 \x0cZeeRights is also a decentralised transaction site It can achieve decentralised creativity protection and transactions by harnessing the breakthrough technology of the blockchain Internet platform with smart contract For partners who jointly set up organisations or talent recruiters for projects any violation of copyright by designs provided by their creativity provider will impact their integrity and credibility of their project Interested parties may thus leverage ZeeRights to gain insights into the credibility and progress of the projects thus managing and controlling their risks Core function of ZeeRights has been developed and is under internal testing 4 3 2 ZeeProof Zero knowledge proof blockchain based technique is able to provide conclusive proof of copyright existence without disclosing any of the copyright contents thus greatly reducing the risk of intellectual property violation 4 3 3 ZeeSure Asset Insurance As a blockchain based IP insurance platform ZeeSure will provide creative thinkers/practitioners with one stop insurance service for various digital intellectual property as well as legal consultation Comparing the Zeepin Platform to traditional transaction models it is very difficult for traditional transaction models to achieve financial innovation For projects on the Zeepin Platform insurance or other financial products / requirements are integrated into the entire chain covering digital copyright development needs and production and corresponding protection and services are provided for the participants to improve the security circulation and transaction of digital assets 15 \x0c4 3 4 ZeeCreate As a decentralised design interconnection platform on Zeepin Chain ZeeCreate uses ZPT as the medium of exchange on embedded smart contract and is able to quickly connect / bridge creative contents and people in need of creative ideas The Foundation will work with Arting365 to enable over 1 2 million designers worldwide to provide creative services for their customers and possibly even the whole industry in the Zeepin community ZeeCreate\ s matchmaking mechanism makes decentralised peer to peer transactions possible 4 3 5 ZeeTalent Each participating user of the community on the Zeepin Platform will have an independent digital identity incorporating second time authentication on the real name authentication through KYC and external identity in order to ensure completeness of the community information system It provides a low cost talent recruitment service a fast and international communication method Project parties can recruit teams worldwide using ZeeCrew 4 3 6 ZeeFund Crowd Funding Compared with traditional fund raising models ZeeFund Crowd Funding on the Zeepin Platform is designed to be more open and effective After the evaluation of projects by the Foundation (or its affiliates or third party service providers) autonomous project teams may quickly launch project crowd funding for their project on ZeeFund and project parties can obtain support for the project (to be paid in ZPT) 16 \x0c5 Core Participants Zeepin Chain is a blockchain based creative industry infrastructure Any individual or organisation may join the community on the Zeepin Platform and access the infrastructure to provide the resource service which he/she is good at publish notices about his/her needs and be paid in ZPT Participants holding ZPT are entitled to vote for improvements to Zeepin Platform infrastructure as well as some of the projects thereon and receive incentives for maintaining the Zeepin Platform However in order to avoid legal complications ZPT holders shall not have legal control over any matters relating to the Foundation or any of its assets or any of its affiliated companies (including without limitation the selection of governing board of the Foundation over corporate matters final development direction specific projects or deployment of the Foundation\ s assets which shall be the final responsibility of the governing board of the Foundation) Creators People engaging in advertising graphic design fashion industry architecture and design make up the core groups of the cultural and creative industries They can promote assets digitisation and copyright protection and transaction participate in projects looking for skilled manpower and obtain payment (in ZPT) for their services and launch creative projects in the community gain ZPT to fund the project and win favor with manufacturers Industrial Manufacturers After Zeepin Chain revitalizes the traditional manufacturing sector manufacturers can use their excess capacity to form economic entities with creators and channel providers and then unveil competitive products or new consumer goods for crowd funding on Zeepin Platform thus facilitating project implementation Entrepreneurial Teams Entrepreneurial teams are often distracted from their own projects by complex issues like talent recruitment & management accounting financing and sales Zeepin Chain\ s infrastructure can help them effectively recruit talents and manage teams and enable them to obtain sharing resources and ZPT support through launching project crowd funding in the community which will get the projects off the ground and cut down the initial cost expenditure Project Supporters In the Zeepin community holders of ZPT may support and crowd fund projects which are appealing in order to speed up their development 17 \x0cOther Participants Zeepin Chain can bring convenience to anyone For example in the community media / authors / artists may source for publishers and distributors set up economic partnerships and raise ZPT for publishing projects through worldwide crowd funding As an highly inclusive decentralised community Zeepin Chain enables the maximum sharing of excess capacity and surplus value 18 \x0c6 Why Blockchain 6 1 Decentralised Security Assurance and Credible Traceability In a traditional centralised network the launch of effective attacks on a central node e g thirdparty payment intermediaries will damage the entire system whereas in a decentralised blockchain network attacks on a single node are unable to control or damage the entire system Differing from the centralised platform each node on the blockchain must comply with the same set of account keeping and transaction trade rules which are based on an encryption algorithm instead of credit standing At the same time each transaction needs to get the consensus reached by most nodes on the network for final confirmation thus evading the dark force of a supreme administrator behind a centralised platform It is the technological cause for the blockchain\ s ability of offering timestamp and tamper proof transaction record 6 2 Assets Digitisation and Right Confirmation Helping global innovators in assets digitisation and rights confirmation is an important mission of the Foundation All digital assets launched by innovators on Zeepin Platform are endorsed by innovators\ identity and works Connecting the blockchain with real economy via Zeepin Chain can improve the efficiency of economic life and reduce credit cost 6 3 Decentralised Transaction Platform Zeepin Platform helps to handle the digitisation of copyright assets in a low cost and credible way It also manages copyright assets and authorise circulation and utilisation in an effective and convenient manner so as to benefit the parties on the copyright value chain Building decentralised transaction platforms based on the blockchain technology and understanding the credible and tamper resistant transaction records and the digital copyrights helps to reduce the tedious and repeated processes in copyright transactions This would ensure the trust between participating parties and support the idea of one click automatic and commercialised copyright transactions 6 4 Realisation of Smart Economy Promote assets digitisation based on the blockchain technology and digital identity and carry out automatic management on digital assets through the smart contract to form a distributed network for \xe2\x80\x9csmart economy Realise the smart economy of the global creative industry by integrating digital assets digital identity and smart contracts 6 5 Global Value Transfer The Foundation will work with NEO and Onchain team to deploy and operate an independent blockchain exclusive to the Zeepin project based on DNAProject underlying technology and build 19 \x0cthe bottom blockchain infrastructure and business framework that would be more suitable for Zeepin Platform the community and future DApps and applications thereon In this way the blockchain database will be more applicable to develop applications based on the consistency of massive data covering credit investigation digital copyright anti counterfeiting etc In addition atomic transactions on the blockchains can support assets digitisation asset swaps payment and other functions and realise Zeepin\ s DAO and dApp applications so as to fulfill the seamless connection and transfer of global values 20 \x0c7 ZPT Purpose 7 1 Establishing a Consistent Community Incentive Mechanism The cultural and creative industries consist of creators manufacturers and consumers each of which supports the development of the whole platform but there was no method or incentive mechanism for all these stakeholders to co exist harmoniously In the ecosystem on Zeepin Platform users may choose and participate in every link such as crowd funding in projects and purchasing more ZPT for more rights in voting 7 2 Establishing a Disintermediated Service System The traditional cultural and creative industries are complicated with a great number of intermediary agents each striving to increase their own profits This model is not transparent \xe2\x80\x93 the Zeepin Platform is designed to eliminate intermediary agents and distribute value from creative products to the key stakeholders in a transparent and efficient manner through the usage of ZPT and smart contract based automatic handling 7 3 Establishing a Safe and Efficient Crowd funding Environment Based on the data evaluation related on ZeeTalent digital identity authentication ZeeRights copyright assets and right infringement and ZeeFund third party project due diligence on Zeepin Chain is planned to be able to develop multi dimensional data about credible identity credible data authorisation and credible project evaluation to significantly improve capital efficiency and reduce risks of crowd funding 21 \x0c8 ZPT Application 8 1 Community Reward 8 1 1 Credit Bounty In order to reward great ideas to encourage behavior which is positive for the development of the community on the Zeepin Platform and to drive the stable and healthy development of the Zeepin community in the long run Zeepin Platform will introduce a Credit Score to incentivise participants for their positive content and behavior (e g generating recommending reviewing and sharing content) These behaviors will be determined through a standard smart procedure to create a fair and transparent incentive mechanism to enable the Zeepin community to have more participants higher quality content and more active participation and to promote the healthy and stable development of both Zeepin Platform and the community thereon Zeepin will assign credit scores for every user and the components which determine a user\ s credit scores would include factors such as (1) Frequency of participation in community activities (2) Quantity of works or copyrights that have a certain like record (3) Transaction volume on ZeeRights (4) Users help promote and sell crowd funding products through the promotion channels for Zeepin crowd funding (5) Innovator or team participate in ZeeCreate creative project and is commended and (6) Other active and positive activities encouraged by the community The Zeepin Platform will include a feature for the exchange between assigned credit scores and ZPT such that credit scores may be exchanged for ZPT at an exchange rate determined by Zeepin Platform These ZPT will come from the pool of additional ZPT issued each year by the Foundation After exchange credit scores can be accumulated and used for credit rating upgrade 8 1 2 Third party evaluation agency and due diligence agency for crowd funding projects Teams intending to launch crowd funding projects on Zeepin Platform will be rated by Zeepin Platform (or its affiliates or third party evaluation agencies) and the ratings are critical to team selection during the pre sales of crowd funding projects These evaluation expenses will be paid with ZPT The teams which pass the evaluation process will be allowed to launch projects on Zeepin Platform which are further evaluated by Zeepin Platform (or its affiliates or third party evaluation agencies) The projects which do not pass the evaluation will not be allowed to launch the project The due diligence expenses will also be paid with ZPT 22 \x0c8 2 Lock up and Utilisation ZPT would be utilised in the following situations 8 2 1 Credit ratings range from v1 v2 v3 When credit scores meet the requirements of the Zeepin Platform a rating upgrade is allowed subject to locking of a certain amount of ZPT 8 2 2 Registration of name of a team or organisation on Zeepin Platform would require payment of ZPT 8 2 3 Storing of copyright source code on ZeeRights would require payment of ZPT 8 2 4 Promotion of a particular project organisation or product to the community on the Zeepin Platform would require payment of ZPT 8 2 5 ZPT would be used as the unit of exchange for valuable services provided in the ecosystem on Zeepin Platform and users may obtain or use innovative tools and resources (e g materials services) by paying ZPT With the continued development of Zeepin Platform it is contemplated that there will be more and more situations in which ZPT may be used in diversified dApps developed 8 3 Crowd funding projects Entities which crowd fund ideas products and copyright derivatives on Zeepin Platform will be required to conduct a pre sale which is only opened for holders of ZPT and entitling these holders of ZPT to additional discount in the crowd funding The ZPT raised for crowd funded projects will also be locked up by smart contract and granted to project teams according to agreed project schedule 23 \x0c9 Zeepin Platform Road Map for development Project Zeepin Chain Progress Estimated For Under development April 2018 ZeeWallet UI design completed and under development April 2018 ZeeRights Function

and under preparation October 2018 ZeeCrew Under planning January 2019 ZeeFund Under planning April 2019 ZeeTalent Under planning October 2019 ZeeProof Under planning December 2019 24 \x0c10 Main Challenges 10 1 Developing Blockchain based Stable and Flexible Applications Applying the principle of agile development Zeepin Platform will adopt a product driven approach to meet users\ needs in a faster and better manner The number of consortium blockchain based applications on Zeepin Platform will gradually increase and the existing applications will also be gradually improved Infrastructure components and core services will bring about risks if they have to face changing demands in an undergoing project It is very challenging to strike a balance between platform stability and change flexibility The Foundation realises and emphasises the significance of platform stability as it serves as the common foundation for many products 10 2 Content Infringement and Plagiarism Copyright protection is a key basic foundation of Zeepin Platform so the rules to avoid content infringement are especially important Zeepin Platform has strict rules to prohibit content plagiarism (whatever the extent) The Foundation has designed the mechanism and procedures for reporting and review of content infringement Users who violate the prescribed rules may be penalised with account and IP suspension and not allowed to log in to our system Depending on the severity of the violation the credit scores and user\ s remaining ZPT may be locked up or destroyed Meanwhile the Foundation will work to protect users who have registered copyright on ZeeRights It will actively cooperate with third party websites to search for information related to the infringement of registered copyright on ZeeRights by other people or organisations The Foundation will also encourage users to buy insurance for copyright protection and assist users in safeguarding their legal rights 10 3 Credit Score Evaluation System for Reward To improve participation in projects on Zeepin Platform and incentive users to submit high quality content Zeepin Platform would be required to incentivise users objectively However the nature of evaluation of content and copyright would be subject to a degree of subjectivity and personal preferences of evaluators Thus Zeepin Platform would incorporate machine learning algorithm which considers the applicant\ s credit scores and calculates incentives based on objective indicators such as credit scores and quantity In addition the participation reward for design project is related to the total project amount When participating in the promotion of crowd funding projects users will get a promotion QR code and the credit scores obtained from efforts in promotion (by scanning the QR code) will be automatically included into that promoter\ s credit scores 10 4 Evaluation Method and Data Authenticity for Crowd funding Project The accuracy of information disclosure for crowd funding projects is critical to the correct judgment and risk analysis of crowd funding projects Zeepin Platform will strive to improve the data 25 \x0cauthenticity and transparency of project teams and information including the team scores and due diligence conducted under the cooperation with third parties The historical records of teams will be recorded on ZeeCrew and cannot be changed In addition Zeepin will codify the crowd funding rules into smart contract and record codes and project status on the blockchain In order to improve credibility of ZeeFund applications funds and fund transfer would be directly controlled by smart contracts Where copyright protection is required project design will be recorded on ZeeSure for protection It is contemplated that product sales data would be traceable via in built chips and blockchains Zeepin Platform will track the project during the whole cycle via blockchains 10 5 Copyright Protection and Crowd funding Platform to Integrate Traditional Ideas Currently there is no global multi functional platform which covers the whole industrial chain from idea production connection protection and crowd funding of creative projects The Foundation intends to be deeply engaged in the vertical fields of the creative industry and develop and expand the new global creative market with the blockchain technology so as to avoid direct competition with traditional single function platforms 26 \x0c11 ZPT Sale Plan The total amount of Zeepin Tokens (ZPT) will be 1 billion Details of the sale of ZPT

The inflation rate will go down year after year Project budget The funds raised through the token sale will be applied towards the objects of the Foundation the development of Zeepin Platform and activities promoting the development of the Zeepin Community The amount of the funds raised through the token sale will affect or determine the allocation percentages of the funds The following is a allocation scenario where the amount of the funds raised is above the minimum amount needed and is relatively ideal 28 \x0c50% for the development and improvement of the core features This includes the development and integration of the Zeepin Community\ s applications At the same time new features will be added to Zeepin Platform and iterative improvements and upgrades of user experience will be carried out Another very important part is to increase the security of the Zeepin Community on an ongoing basis 20% for project operation In order to ensure the smooth development and operation of Zeepin Platform and applications thereon the Foundation will hire an operation team matching the development of the community 15% for marketing As there are an existing 1 20 million mature users and professional media platforms the Foundation will require less funds to achieve a better marketing result This budget will be used to promote the Zeepin Community as a whole and its applications The

carefully read through this Whitepaper the Token Purchase Agreement and all relevant information at the official website to have a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks associated with participating in the token sale of ZPT and make a well thought out decision whether to purchase ZPT Buyers should be fully aware that the Foundation (or its affiliates) will not provide any refund of purchase of ZPT under any circumstance The Foundation will apply the proceeds of the digital assets raised through the token sale of ZPT to manage the project to develop Zeepin Platform and Zeepin Chain and use reasonable efforts to ensure that the project proceeds in the general direction as that discussed in the Whitepaper However buyers may still face various risks of incurring losses (as more particularly described in the Token Purchase Agreement) The risks include compliance/operation risk risk on the token market risk in digital wallet management technical risk systematic risk risk of vulnerabilities or hacking risk associated with the development of cryptography and other risks not listed here Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions The regulatory status of ZPT and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions It is impossible to predict how when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications including ZPT and/or Zeepin Platform Regulatory actions could negatively impact ZPT and/or Zeepin Platform in various ways The Foundation (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions or changes to law or regulation make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies the Foundation will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of ZPT Therefore for the crowdsale the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible For the crowdsale the Foundation is working with Tzedek Law LLC a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore active in the blockchain space Risks associated with markets for ZPT ZPT are designed to be used solely on Zeepin Platform hence there may be illiquidity risk with respect to ZPT The value of ZPT may be extreme volatile and diminish to zero because ZPT is not accepted by the market the market as a whole is weak there are not enough users using them development of Zeepin Platform is stagnant or there are rumors or other uncontrollable factors 35 \x0cRisk in digital wallet management Buyers may receive ZPT only after installing the Zeepin Wallet and obtaining the digital wallet address Individual users are responsible for protecting their private key (i e the password for their wallet) which is used to sign transactions proving their ownership of the assets involved The users should be fully aware that because of the decentralised transaction style of the blockchain if their private key or password is lost or stolen the tokens on their account (the wallet address or the public key) will be lost forever and cannot be recovered The best way to avoid the risk or the safest way to put their private key is to securely save their private key in one or several places For this reason do not store it on a public computer You can also write it down and physically keep it Technical risk Technical risk refers to major issues with the underlying technologies and as a result Zeepin Platform cannot perform its expected functions and critical data is falsified or lost Systemic risk Systemic risk refers to the risk caused by the large scale faults of the global network infrastructure such as force majeures like wars and natural disasters that may cause the partial or total interruption of the global Internet Risk of vulnerabilities or hacking The risk of vulnerabilities or hacking refers to the possibility that hackers or other organisations may find the possible vulnerabilities using any method and try to attack Zeepin Platforms (or DApps and applications thereon) or ZPT including but not limited to denial of service attacks (DoS attacks) Sybil attacks malware attacks or consistency attacks Risk associated with the development of cryptography Cryptography is developing and cannot absolutely ensure security The development of cryptography such as the progress in code breaking technologies or the development of quantum computers can pose risks to all encryption based systems including Zeepin Chain This may lead to ZPT held by everyone being stolen lost missing damaged or depreciated Failure to develop There is the risk that the development of Zeepin Platform and Zeepin Chain will not be executed or implemented as planned for a variety of reasons including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset virtual currency or ZPT unforeseen technical difficulties and shortage of development funds for activities 36 \x0cOther risks In addition to the aforementioned risks there are other risks associated with your purchase holding and use of ZPT including those that the Foundation cannot anticipate Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks You should conduct full due diligence on the Foundation (and its affiliates) the Zeepin team understand the overall framework and vision for Zeepin Platform and Zeepin Chain prior to purchasing ZPT Follow us Website https //www zeepin io/ Telegram https //t
