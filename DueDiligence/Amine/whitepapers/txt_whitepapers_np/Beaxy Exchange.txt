billion 2 to over $600 billion The meteoric rise of the cryptocurrency market was bolstered by the introduction of hundreds of coins trading across many exchanges as well as substantial hype and media coverage surrounding Bitcoin Innovation and new technology helped continue the upward momentum and despite regulatory concerns among traditional investors and government officials the market\xe2\x80\x99s sustained growth proves that cryptocurrencies are here to stay The daily cryptocurrency trading volume averaged $12 Billion in Q4 of 2017 suggesting that despite all this early success there is substantial room for growth when compared to volume in traditional markets Experts speculate that initial coin offerings (ICOs) will disrupt many industries and be a 3 primary means to raise capital in the new digital age Whereas traditional fundraising methods require individuals or institutions to meet certain standards regarding net worth or income ICOs are establishing a new

exchange to another Securing wallets from hackers Offering a variety of tokens and coins Portfolio monitoring and maintenance Reliable customer support Engaging exchange users for feedback Trading &

it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to see why Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s poor customer support confusing UI lack of trading tools or security issues there was and is clearly a need for something new Who better to design an improved exchange than traders The idea of Beaxy was thus born as a ready to go all in one exchange which will be \xe2\x97\x8f Easy to use\xe2\x80\x8b for all newcomers to the world of cryptocurrencies \xe2\x97\x8f A \xe2\x80\x8bsmart platform\xe2\x80\x8b for professional investors with high end financial features \xe2\x97\x8f Developed with \xe2\x80\x8bsecurity\xe2\x80\x8b in mind The Company will invite our users to be a part of our demo during our ICO in order to further Beaxy\xe2\x80\x99s mission of transparency We will also use the demo period to take feedback from the community and solve any problems prior to a full launch \x0c2 Market and Beaxy 2 1\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bMarket Shortcomings and How Beaxy Looks to Fill Those Gaps Current Problems Beaxy\xe2\x80\x99s Solutions Very little fiat to cryptocurrency conversion available All in one platform able to convert fiat to all major cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x8b Instant deposit of fiat currencies will also be available Unsustainable and unreliable performance A horizontal scalable low latency platform able to expand and accommodate unlimited coins and high transaction speeds Complicated and costly portfolio management and usually not available within the exchanges themselves Built in portfolio interface\xe2\x80\x8b automatic transaction records as well as import/export features from many other platforms or wallets No charting tools on exchange Advanced chart types chart analysis volume analysis drawing tools etc No price monitoring built in to trading Custom coin price alerts Poor to non existent customer support 24/7 customer support \xe2\x80\x8bincluding live chat No mobile trading supported Exchange features \xe2\x80\x8bon the go\xe2\x80\x8b through unique mobile app platform Zero user input Polling users about new coins and features to include Major problems securing user assets Our platform was developed with security in mind Our proprietary system would make it incredibly difficult for would be hackers to ever gain access to your funds \x0c2 2 How Beaxy Tokens (BXY & PLS) Work on the Beaxy Exchange Users of the Beaxy Exchange will be able to trade simultaneously in a wide range of crypto and fiat currencies through a straightforward intuitive online platform The Company will earn a commission on each completed transaction with no charges or fees for deposits or withdrawals Trades executed on the exchange will be charged a 0 20% fee The Company will issue two separate tokens for use on the platform BXY\xe2\x80\x8b Beaxy Standard Token

discounts and for buying different features in the future when they are released BXY will be the token distributed by the Company through the ICO The PLUS Token (PLS) \xe2\x80\x8bon the other hand

on some of these features and highlight the differences between BXY and PLS in their respective sections \xe2\x80\x8b2 3 and \xe2\x80\x8b2 4\xe2\x80\x8b From a technical standpoint the Beaxy Exchange
