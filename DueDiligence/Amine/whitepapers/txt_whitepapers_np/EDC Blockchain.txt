productivity which performance is enough for large socio economic systems This is the fastest blockchain existing at the moment When applying optimization Bitshares is able to process up to 100 000 transactions per second which is several times faster than in the Visa system which is the largest \xef\xac\x81nancial provider 4 The technical characteristics of this platform involve the formation of a new block every 3 seconds support for payments with zero commission as well as the ability to work with several tokens at the same time and much more \x0cBitShares 2 0 Graphene Up to 100 000

Practical use Usage coin 1 Creating individual tokens using the EDC Blockchain coin constructor 2 Remuneration in loyalty and cashback systems A bonus can be used when exchanging for additional

entire commission from transactions with EDC within the EDC Blockchain is automatically burned within the blockchain at the time of the operations 9 2 The EDC commission on operations with subsidiary coins is burned within the blockchain at the time of the operations \x0cEDC Blockchain is one of the few pioneers which is switching its mining algorithm to the LPoS algorithm LPoS is a mechanism of consensus which has its signi\xef\xac\x81cant advantages for example it attracts all users regardless of their stack to work on protecting and securing the network and distributes the reward fairly as each participant receives their share in proportion to the contribution This is an excellent opportunity even for owners of a small number of coins to receive a stable bonus The essence of the algorithm is that owners of smaller amounts of cryptocurrency rent their coins to full \xef\xac\x82edged nodes while the nodes form a block therefore the owners receive their share of the total reward Due to the initiation and stimulation of network members with smaller amounts the level of its security is also increased 10 All coin holders are merged into masternodes in which users donate their coins thereby allowing the node to mine EDC and distributing bonus to all participants In order for a node to become a masternode you need to collect a certain amount of coins (100 million) on it which will be captured for a certain period of time to start a mining process to create new coins Masternode is a networked computer with an EDC wallet running on it that captures the number of coins and provides network security when implementing important functions such as instant con\xef\xac\x81rmation of InstantSend transactions as well as network voting \x0cNew advanced mining algorithm Easy mining Built in Coin Constructor Masternodes 11 Instant Send transaction Security \x0cEDC Blockchain Coin Constructor Users of the EDC Blockchain platform can create their custom tokens for startups

developers of EDC have already begun to perform is the creation of its own decentralized exchange The exchange will not rely on its own servers but will give access to assets only to the users themselves using private keys Therefore users will control their personal assets which makes hacker attacks meaningless At the centralized exchanges there is a \xef\xac\x81nancial center that provides the relationship between buyers and sellers It receives assets allows you to exchange them and processes orders thereby creating counterparty risks The EDC Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized exchange distributes these functions and does not allow any risks Therefore this exchange will be one of the safest at the moment 17 \x0cThe EDC Blockchain community consists of over 1 000 000 users
