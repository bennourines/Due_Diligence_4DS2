b ICO Process White Paper by AMPLE Group Promoting Cosplayer Professionalism Whitepaper version 1 4 Last Updated 2017/12/3 \x0cBackground The animation market in Japan exceeded 1 8 trillion yen in 2015 amidst a record breaking pace of sales over three consecutive years The expanding market trend continues putting annual value within reach of 2 trillion yen Through the rapid penetration of VOD and other services future forward the distribution of Japanese animation content abroad is expected to increase in turn this growth will fuel the population growth of cosplayers around the globe The cosplay and associated markets (enthusiasts\xca\xbc groups cosplay apparel maid and cosplay services) have actually grown year on year to comprise a market today of 130 billion yen The portrait lighting function implemented on the iPhone8 (announced on September 13 2017) and other advances to mobile cameras as of late suggest that the creative activities of cosplayers will occur more and more within an immediate arm\xca\xbc s reach Alongside these recent trends described above the cosplay platform AMPLE launched in 2012 under the mantle of bringing people all around the world together through cosplay and has grown to host 70 000 photos posted by subscribers in 70 countries With the goal of evolving AMPLE beyond a global cosplayer community through the introduction of AMPLE Coin (ACO) a proprietary cryptocurrency funding will be instituted through an initial coin o\xef\xac\x80ering (ICO) About this ICO ICO (Initial Coin O\xef\xac\x80ering) is a method for procuring funds via the issuing and selling of original digital tokens It is a di\xef\xac\x80erent form of transferring equity than that of stocks and is more similar to crowd funding in that you are simply purchasing tokens At the time of sale for this token it will not be recognized as Cryptcurrency In order for it to be recognized as Cryptcurrency you must \xef\xac\x81rst circulate the token through a Cryptcurrency exchange for it to become recognized as a Cryptcurrency In other words strictly speaking ICO is not a method of raising funds but is a sales method for cryptocurrency As for the buyers instead of an investor investing in a project they are a buyer of the token 2 \x0cTable of Contents AMPLE Ecosystem Structure 4 Overview of AMPLE Vision of AMPLE Stage Progression of Taking Vision to

[AMPLE O\xef\xac\x83cial site] http //ample cosplay com/ 4 \x0cVision of AMPLE Turning\xe2\x80\x9cCosplayer\xe2\x80\x9d into a profession To date AMPLE has operated its mission under the mantle of bringing people all around the world together through cosplay The e\xef\xac\x80ort for the next few years will be to develop professional cosplayers Some cosplayers in fact have successfully turned their activities into a professional occupation however we believe there is considerable room for growth across the entire industry in this regard As Youtubers have gained professional status the entire cosplay market domain can be ampli\xef\xac\x81ed to create a system to pay su\xef\xac\x83cient recompense that will lead to as many occupational cosplayers as possible 5 \x0cStage Progression of Taking Vision to Fruition STAGE 1 Provisioning a platform to create an economy around cosplayers globally STAGE 2 Cosplayers transform into content and go global STAGE 3 Mainstreaming professional cosplayers STAGE 1 Provisioning a platform to create an economy around cosplayers globally The \xef\xac\x81rst course of action will be to provide tools that enable the 7 000 cosplayers currently registered to respectively procure funds Fans will discover their favorite cosplayers located throughout the world and lend support with ACO an easy wayto become a patron (supporter) of a particular cosplayer Cosplayers and fans connect virtually online as cosplayers express themselves freely on their own individual stage Patrons can spend ACO to support their favorite cosplayers in real time Plans call for active patrons to obtain exclusive o\xef\xac\x80ers from such cosplayers ACO A \xe3\x83\xbbInvitations to events Cosplayer \xe3\x83\xbbMerchandise \xe3\x83\xbbDiscount of products Sponsor 6 \x0cAMPLE has previously instituted a loyalty program called AMPLE Point System whereby fans can send gifts to their favorite cosplayers The points in circulation through this loyalty program however have been limited in usage for securing preferred publication space on AMPLE The limitation has proven to be a bottleneck and a challenge that has thwarted circulation growth What happened In the past monetary and legal hurdles impeded our desires to achieve a world that could uphold our ideals This ICO process will enable funding to clear these hurdles As we learn from past mistakes the circulation of cryptocurrency ACO will support global supportive transactions that will generate diverse expression Moreover as we strive to provide a world to enable free expression among cosplayers those with particularly individualistic expression will be provided with a system to facilitate funding that will generate even more diverse expression When our ideal world is created AMPLE will have become the platform representing cosplayers in such a way as to create an economy around cosplayers STAGE 2 Cosplayers transform into content and go global Registered cosplayers will provide live commerce services that enable a straight forward global development of their own content Fans from around the world will gain convenient access to information about their favorite cosplayers and AMPLE will spawn numerous small economies around such cosplayers with this service The platform exploiting the latest technology will allow cosplayers to be their own curator and introduce various content and product as live video and VR video to their fans Cosplayers to date have primarily performed in physical space but with the latest technology the breadth of expression and means of delivering the art have enlarged Consequently cosplayers who couldn\xca\xbc t gain exposure previously have an opportunity to portray their distinctive world and gain support from many more fans The real time connection a\xef\xac\x80orded between adoring fans and their favorite cosplayers will enable fans to purchase such content with ACO Provisioning a system to deliver content expediently and globally for all cosplayers wherever they reside in the world will seed small economies centered on those cosplayers around the globe We foresee communities emerging with distinctive character tuned to each cosplayer in these economies a world where cosplayers and fans mutually support each other This is the world we currently are contemplating Support & Purchasingoods ACO A Sponsorship Limited Cosplayer Live video Sponsor 7 \x0cThis process will solidify the status of AMPLE as a platform that can generate cosplayer economies STAGE 3 Mainstreaming professional cosplayers AMPLE intends to provide comprehensive support to cosplayers active on the platform Funds procured for operations with take the form all e\xef\xac\x80orts required in enhancing promotional activities and values for the entire cosplay industry In the process of cosplayers engaging in activities on the platform described above support functions will become necessary Consequently AMPLE intends to

activities beyond the con\xef\xac\x81nes of particular technologies will produce a stage integrated with the countries audience\xcc\xb6more than merely a platform The support described provides a lineup approximating the function of a production company engaged across various domains The function as production company as well as the following business development will enable AMPLE to contribute to further awareness and enhancement for the cosplay industry \xe2\x97\x8f Large scale events \xe2\x97\x8f Alliance with events in other domains Several renowned cosplay events exist around the Events like e Sports not necessarily events familiar world plans here call for large scale events with to the fan segments and fashion events supported slightly changes in orientation to be held by teen subscribers will be targetted for on site assignment of cosplayers \xe2\x97\x8f School established to support cosplayers In order to raise the bar across the entire industry we will open a special school to support cosplayers Currently predecessors in the industry have achieved high standards in cosplay through individual trial and error Structuring this expertise will lead to learning content available online and o\xef\xac\x84ine to people around the world Instruction curricula at this school include makeup clothing and accessories photography space design song dance voice talent performance programming video production music composition and writing\xcc\xb6a diverse range The purpose is to enable acquisition of professional skills associated with cosplay anime \xe2\x97\x8f Supplier of video anime and manga content with free copyrights Cosplay typically involves a subject a primary creative work from which the individual work is created Depending on circumstances of the rights owner however some works do not allow the desired cosplay activity AMPLE is considering production in the future of content like videos anime and manga that cosplayers can use freely By generating primary creative works with free copyrights AMPLE can further support cosplayer activitites and portray the world being promoted and manga ACO can be used for receiving the education The opportunity to learn is provided not only to cosplayers but others with interests in peripheral disciplines The bar will rise for the cosplay industry and the ACO economy will expand to peripheral domains All of the processes above enable AMPLE to mainstream occupational cosplayers 9 \x0cUsage of Cryptocurrency The cryptocurrency AMPLE coin (ACO) to be issued at this time will undergo circulation along the entire stream provided in the Stage Progression of Taking Vision to Fruition set forth above ACO will be tendered across all layers worldwide for direct support product sales and admissions to exclusive events and applied to diverse payment means in this space AMPLE as production ACO ETH Training / Producing ACO Exclusive o\xef\xac\x80ers Cosplayer Merchandise Sponsor ACO Merchandise ACO External e commerce site / Cosplay event As shown in the \xef\xac\x81gure ACO is used chie\xef\xac\x82y among cosplayers and their supporting fans We wish to enable ubiquitous usage of ACO in the space as currency For this to happen technical integration with other companies\xca\xbc services without limitation to the AMPLE platform will take place while an enormous application array will be provided to cosplayers and fans on the AMPLE platform As cosplayers circulate ACO across the platform that enables unfettered expressions of their own worlds they will enhance the quality of their creative activity while strong ties between fans and their favorite cosplayers become possible By connecting cosplayers and fans spread out globally through cryptocurrency unconstrained by national borders the issuance of this cryptocurrency should contribute to enhancing the entire market in our assessment 10 \x0c\xe2\x85\xa1 Markets Animation Market As stated in the Background the
