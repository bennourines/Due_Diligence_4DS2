At present blockchain assets are trapped in their own systems without inter chain division of work and collaboration BTC has established the most widely accepted coins One Coin One Vote where Coin refers to consensus but its transaction e\xef\xac\x83ciency is low the stock after the initial release of Coin PoW\ s ZEC has enabled privacy protection but smart CPU can continue to \xef\xac\x82ood into the mining but contract is not incorporated ETH has smart con PoS\ s Coin is not generated in a consistent and tract but it cannot migrate to the PoS system fair manner thus too many centralized factors ChainX can transfer all assets across chains in a can a\xef\xac\x80ect the process decentralized way Chains that have connected with ChainX can enjoy asset connectivity with all EOS is the new representative of the PoS chain chains It does not adopt the one time pre mining method in a private o\xef\xac\x80ering instead a public The PoW algorithm issuing new cryptocurrencies ICO that lasts for one year will be launched based on the mining power is considered to be a before the chain goes live The EOS is generated relatively decentralized and fair distribution based on the value of ETH but when the chain is model but it is still prone to be monopolized by actually live the additional issuance of new big miners leaving ordinary users no choice but coins has been monopolized by the nodes elect to buy mining machine at high prices The PoS ed by the deposit coins thus the new ones to chain generally has a large private o\xef\xac\x80ering or counterbalance the old cannot \xef\xac\x82ow in and the setting up a fund to issue cryptocurrencies After concept of decentralization is not achieved the launch it only issues additional tokens to There is still a bumpy road ahead before reach users with voting power resulting in new users ing decentralization and a one year public o\xef\xac\x80er resorting to the secondary market ing is far from enough to set record straight Bitcoin promotes free and fair competition that The measure of PoW\ s mining power is comput lasts for hundreds of years Only by adopting ing power One CPU One Vote The traditional that can we see a promising future PoS mining power is measured by the amount of 03 \x0cOverview ChainX\xef\xb9\x82 s PoS Consensus pioneers the asset mining model One Asset One Vote which measures the mining power based on the market value of BTC ETH EOS and other assets from users\xef\xb9\x82 inter chain deposits and uses Bitcoin\xef\xb9\x82 s model to gradually halve the output to distribute PCX fairly Users can connect all kinds of digital assets they build the upper tier facilities for inter chain hold with ChainX DApp within the system ex assets while Polkadot will focus on inter chain change can meet the trading needs of these communication assets on the one hand and also generate fair ChainX is launched \xef\xac\x81rst to integrate existing digi value for mining market tal assets across the chains to warm up the Polk and the underlying facilities adot ecosystem and when Polkadot goes live Polkadot is a project initiated by the Web3 Foun ChainX will be able to transfer existing assets to dation and designed and developed by the Parity the Polkadot network while providing various team led by Ethereum\ s former CTO Gavin Wood services to new assets in the Polkadot network Polkadot is committed to enable communication among chains to achieve blockchain connectivity ChainX will try to adopt the most decentralized multi chain coexistence and to solve the prob light node method to integrate mainstream digital lems of scalability and diversity Polkadot has de assets including BTC ETH ERC20 EOS ADA veloped a chain framework Substrate which en ZEC ables hybrid PoS consensus on chain parliament inter chain asset transfer and good developer governance Wasm virtual machine smart con atmosphere and incubating DApp based on the tract execution and e\xef\xac\x83cient light client proto latest smart contract technology Substrate only cols Many chains including Ethereum 2 0 provides the most basic chain framework and a Shasper are operating on this framework great amount of improvements need to be made to etc cultivating community habits of achieve the above features including multi chain The Web3 Foundation and ChainX are strategic light node bridge witness bridge special incentive partners which will allow ChainX to use Polkadot\ s models multi chain asset trust tools multi plat PoS Consensus and Contracting Technology to form wallets and blockchain browser 04 \x0cEconomic system Issuance model ChainX will issue cryptocurrency PCX (P stands for Polkadot) with a total of 21 million and the amount released halved every two years 20% of the issuance in the \xef\xac\x81rst two years is distributed to the founding team for ongoing development After two years all new issuance will be distributed to the community Asset mining All participants of the asset mining compete discount given to each asset Every inter chain against each other with PCX as the unit to cal asset has a di\xef\xac\x80erent discount rate which could culate the computing power which is divided into be adjusted through community voting The virtual computing power inter chain mining and reason why assets are discounted in value en real computing power voting mining tering the chain is because PCX as the system\ s internal currency should enjoy greater mining Inter chain mining refers to all kinds of assets power than other inter chain assets to encour outside the chain like BTC and ETH that users age users to hold more PCX transfer into the system through depositing mapping or locking up are automatically con Voting mining means users that hold real PCX verted into virtual PCX inter chain mining power participate in the election of the PoS system and according to the price of the asset and the manually vote for certain nodes The total mining power of a user is equal to the inter chain mining power of virtual PCX plus the voting power of the real PCX For example one user 05 \x0cDynamic mining ChainX as a PoS system its security depends on the PCX collateralized by users The more PCX pledged as collaterals the more secure the system is Meanwhile ChainX is also committed to becoming an inter chain asset gateway with an aim to attract more inter chain assets The more assets it attracts the higher the value stays deposits one BTC two ETHs into ChainX and holds 700 PCXs among which 300 PCXs partici However both the internal asset and inter chain pate in the election and 400 PCXs do not At the assets participate in asset mining so the two are time the exchange price in ChainX stands at interdependent and competing In order to avoid 1BTC 10000PCX 1ETH 1000PCX and the user the impact of sudden in\xef\xac\x82ux of inter chain assets will automatically obtain the mining power of (1 * in the beginning the dynamic mining model is 10000 + 2 * 1000) * 10% + 300 = 1500PCX All adopted When inter chain assets grow too fast users have access to PCX mining revenue in the system deploys a \xef\xac\x81xed dividend ratio for the each reward cycle according to the mining two kinds of assets power they have Users can use the PCX obtained through revenue to participate in elections The current ratio of inter chain assets to PCX or wait for the value of the inter chain assets to voting and mining power is 1 1 which can be ad go up to claim more mining power justed by community voting that is the upper limit of mining power of all inter chain assets is Although extra chain assets held by users can set to 50% to ensure PCX voting mining power gain equal right to mining the market value of is equal to or more than 50% so that at least these assets is constantly \xef\xac\x82uctuating and only half of PCX will be issued to PCX holders every the number of PCX generated by mining stands day stable so only PCX can be used as the benchmark for node election and chain governance 06 \x0c07 \x0cCalculation formula of computing power For c \xe2\x88\x88 { S DOT } The total computing power is equal to the real PriceS DOT is \xef\xac\x81xed at 0 1PCX computing power plus the virtual computing power Powertotal = Powerreal + Powervirtual The total real computing power is equal to the total number of votes Powerreal = Staked The total virtual computing power is the sum of the virtual computing power of all inter chain DiscountS DOT is 10%\xe3\x80\x82 Distribution of issuance to the total computing power for each dividend cycle Rtotal = Rreal + Rvirtual The \xef\xac\x81nal power discount of the inter chain asset c based on its market value FinalDiscountc = Discountc * UbiquitousDiscount assets Powervirtual = sum ( Powerc ) c \xe2\x88\x88 { X BTC L BTC S DOT } The virtual power of the inter chain asset c is equal to the market value of the asset in PCX multiplied by the initial mining discount rate Powerc = Amountc * Pricec * Discountc For c \xe2\x88\x88 { X BTC L BTC } PriceX BTC is based on the average trading price of the last hour in DEX on the chain DiscountX BTC is currently 10% L BTC has no trading pairs and the current computing power is the same as X BTC 08 \x0cDynamic power competition The current mining upper limit of all inter chain assets is 50% Powervirtual Powerreal = 1 1 Powervirtual > Powerreal the upper limit mining rule takes e\xef\xac\x80ect When Powervirtual <= Powerreal When Powervirtual > Powerreal Rreal = Powerreal / Powertotal * Rtotal Rreal = 1/(1+1) * Rtotal = 50% * Rtotal Rvirtual = Powervirtual / Powertotal * Rtotal Rvirtual = 1/(1+1) * Rtotal = 50% * Rtotal UbiquitousDiscount = 1 UbiquitousDiscount = Powerreal / Powervirtual After dynamically calculating the total rewards of DOT investors can\ t transfer their assets on Polk both inter chain assets and voting assets the re adot Assets that enter the ChainX system by wards of each individual node are calculated ac inter chain mapping only have PCX mining right cording to the ratio of real and virtual nodes and and are not real DOT To distinguish it is called then individual user \xe2\x80\x98s revenue is calculated ac S DOT Similarly L BTC which enters the system cording to their voting age When the total through lock up also only has mining right and number of inter chain assets surges to the upper cannot be transferred limit an additional discount rate on all assets will be applied with di\xef\xac\x80erent discount rates for each The decentralized exchange DApp has trading asset also in place pairs PCX/X BTC and S DOT/PCX where X BTC stands for true BTC which has enough reserves in ChainX main network was o\xef\xac\x83cially launched on the multi signed trust nodes for withdrawal at any May 25 2019 currently supporting BTC deposits time SDOT represents the estimated value of DOT (X BTC) lock up mining (L BTC) and DOT map before DOT goes live and the power of inter chain ping mining (S DOT) Other mainstream assets mining within ChainX DOT investors can show will be taken onboard when transfer bridges are their investment through inter chain mapping at ready any time The asset does not need to be withdrawn and it can participate in mining before Polkadot goes live 09 \x0cConsensus algorithm ChainX will use PoS consensus algorithm to establish the largest PoS node network in history capable of supporting 1000 consensus nodes 2s block generation time and less than 10s latency In the traditional PoW algorithm the mining Anyone can register a node and start participating power of a single machine is very weak not able in elections after the node is installed ChainX to generate blocks independently and it has to adopts a one cast one vote model to eliminate join a mining pool or a self built mining pool re node conspiracy Any user can use PCX for node sulting in only 10 mining pool nodes per chain elections and it is recommended to select nodes The initial PoS chain usually has about 7 nodes that are self collateralized stable in operation and the later PoS chain has only dozens of nodes and fully disclosed The decentralization of the blockchain network has not been shown at all because ordinary users The pro\xef\xac\x81t model of the node is getting 10% mining cannot directly become consensus nodes instead revenues of the user and the speci\xef\xac\x81c proportion they have to rely on large organizations can be modi\xef\xac\x81ed by the follow up referendums Node dropout or other malicious behavior will be The number of Consensus nodes in ChainX will punished by reducing daily user rewards The elec start from a few dozen and will gradually grow tion cycle for each consensus node is one hour and after the community matures In the initial stage nodes will be ranked according to the number of the cloud servers are needed to build consensus votes If a node fails to be selected as a validator nodes Later users only need to download the node and becomes a candidate node heartbeat desktop wallet to generate blocks but good in transactions also need to be initiated with a real ternet environment and computing power are re node and empty nodes are not allowed Votes from quired or punishment may be incurred if any both consensus nodes and candidate nodes block is delayed The punishment funds will be participate in the mining reward distribution and transferred to the council fund and future ref users will enjoy the same bene\xef\xac\x81t without a\xef\xac\x80ecting erendums will be held to decide how to use it the advancement of the candidate nodes 10 \x0cTransfer bridge Asset crossing chains is a process in which a user locks the asset in the original chain maps asset onto the target chain where withdrawal is available and \xef\xac\x81nally unlocks the asset in the original chain Assets do not disappear in the original chain but original chain which assures the highest level of instead are transferred to the decentralized trust security If the original chain cannot integrate with of Light Node Protocol or to a centralized trust the light nodes of the target chain the assets will managed by an individual or individuals Asset in be managed by individual or multi signed trusts If ter chain mapping generally has three models it can the asset will be managed by the light node witnesses hash lock and light node model Wit protocol on the original chain ness model needs some semi centralized trust institutions to guarantee hash lock directly trans For chains with e\xef\xac\x83cient light nodes ChainX will fers asset ownership and fails in inter chain map use the light node protocol to complete the asset ping what\xe2\x80\x99 s worse transactions may be inter mapping to the ChainX chain However the exist rupted The most practical and secure decentral ing mainstream chains generally cannot integrate ized inter chain mapping model is the light node with the light nodes of the ChainX chain so model The security of inter chain mapping is users\xe2\x80\x99 assets will be managed by multi signed guaranteed by the consensus algorithm of the addresses or multi signed contracts joint trusts 11 \x0cThe election cycle of trustee nodes which are At present we have developed the BTC light ranked according to the number of votes to client bridge which can completely map BTC select the top 15 from the consensus nodes is 10 onto ChainX in a decentralized way ETH\ s light days The trustee nodes automatically generate client bridge is under development Light client two cold and hot multi signed addresses or con bridges of other chains are also being studied tracts After each cycle assets on the old ad and the connection with the Polkadot eco chain dress will be transferred to the new address will use a two way light client protocol which is Users can monitor the system\ s inter chain asset more e\xef\xac\x83cient and does not require trustee issuance and reserves in real time and no trustee nodes node can be unilaterally misappropriated 12 \x0cInter chain mapping Inter chain asset transfer requires a mapping relationship to be established between the user two addresses on two chains so that the system can issue the mapped assets on the account in ChainX Speci\xef\xac\x81c inter chain binding method The user needs to initiate a transfer transaction The dawn of asset crossing chains has arrived to the escrow address from his original address and sooner or later BTC wallets will have to enable and \xef\xac\x81ll in the Note the address of his ChainX ac inter chain binding for users In the incentive rules count This transaction secured by the original of ChainX if ChainX nodes are added by a user in private key signature can ensure that the user\ s the Note to identify the inter chain binding chan assets are still in full control of himself after nel the user will get 10% reward to his binding crossing chains inter chain binding once done channel account when he withdraws deposits you will be able to transfer directly without having mining reward if the user does not have a binding to add new Notes If you need to change the ad channel 10% will be sent to the parliamentary dress you can add new Note and the binding fund The \xef\xac\x81nal proportion will be modi\xef\xac\x81ed by the with the original address will be updated follow up referendums Speci\xef\xac\x81c to Bitcoin\ s inter chain binding the Note ChainX will arrange connection schedules with refers to the OP_RETURN function in the trans di\xef\xac\x80erent chains according to the number of users action Ethereum\ s inter chain binding Data in each chain and the light client protocol and function EOS inter chain binding Memo func provide the coin services free of charge We tion At present only few Bitcoin wallets support welcome chains with complete light client protocol OP_RETURN but ChainX has developed an of to actively develop ChainX\ s transfer bridge and \xef\xac\x82ine binding tool and many Bitcoin wallets are build access to the ChainX system as well as entire able to add inter chain binding tools Ethereum inter chain ecosystem wallets have perfect support for Data and EOS supports Memo well 13 \x0cAccount system In order to prevent DDOS users need to pay transactions fees to miners and the system will charge the corresponding fees according to the complexity of di\xef\xac\x80erent operations Users also have di\xef\xac\x80erent acceleration options according to network congestion to achieve \xef\xac\x82exible control It seems that users need to pay fees but they can balance out by obtaining a large amount of mining revenue which is enough to meet the trading needs of non frequent users in the early stage of network development as long as they participate in voting or own assets on the chain And when some block is packed the fees will be collected into the validator\xe2\x80\x99s reward pool and replenished to voting users Therefore voting users can still use the blockchain free in this closed system and most of the mining users will be pro\xef\xac\x81ting with only some high frequent users needing to pay additional fees Traditional miner fees are criticized because they are too expensive not for the sake of the cost but because of the low throughput of the chain EOS does not require miner fees but the actual capital cost is higher and the risk of being attacked is also higher ChainX currently charges only 0 0001PCX as transaction fee As ChainX\ s performance and throughput gradually improves the fee for each transaction can be neglected In the late stage of development the chain\ s additional issuance will gradually slow down and the main source of users\xe2\x80\x99 mining revenue is all sorts of service fees and various types of punishment \xef\xac\x81nes 14 \x0cPCX is used in the following ways Miner fees Used to pay miners similar to BTC Market value unit Used as the market capitalization unit of the asset all assets are converted into voting power according to the price of PCX similar to ETH/ERC20 Collateral Used as collateral for trustee nodes and consensus nodes to enhance their credit the more collateral binding to nodes the easier it is to win user votes Standard PoS Consensus election standard the higher the number of votes the greater responsibility in generating blocks and safeguarding consensus also used as collateral and voting tools for chain governance similar to EOS Exchange medium Used as the base currency and exchange medium for certain non mainstream assets in the system exchange DApp similar to BNB 15 \x0cCommunity governance In order to promote the decentralized governance Bribery and kickbacks seriously undermine voting of the community the ChainX parliament will be credibility allowing ill intended nodes to wreak expanded to include nodes that are considered havoc what\xe2\x80\x99s worse winning the parliamentary matured One seat is reserved for the PolkaX seats through improper means will seriously team for the role it plays in developing and up damage the overall interests of the community grading the system Another 10 seats will be Therefore the parliamentary fund has set up the added The 10 new seats will be held by credible anti bribery and anti \xef\xac\x81shing rewards pool with nodes with intention to run for the parliament clear cut rules no rebates Community users can that have secured the top 10 spots in terms of anonymously votes Nodes that intent on bribing their way records of bribery and rebates of a certain node If through the election will be disquali\xef\xac\x81ed more than half of the parliament members validate submit screenshots or transfer the evidence (more than or equal to 6) the node is Given the fact that the total number of votes a disquali\xef\xac\x81ed for the next election and the whistle node receives changes all the time but the par blowers will be rewarded In addition the parlia liament seats should be held by a \xef\xac\x81xed group for ment maintains discretion over the collaterals of a certain period of time so each parliament term the bribery node Nodes claiming not to participate only lasts one month After one month elections in the parliamentary elections are not in the will be held to select new nodes with high ratings purview of reporting but we still hope that all and credibility All 11 members of the parliament nodes adhere to fair and open election rules opti can submit any proposals to the parliament based mizing the community by votings based on contri on the information they glean from the communi bution ty The proposal is voted by members of the par short sighted rebates rather than vicious competition for liament with one member one vote If more than half of the members agree (more than or equal to 6) the proposal is approved in the preliminary vote After the preliminary vote comes the referendum The proposal needs to receive more than 2/3 of all the votes(more than or equal to 66 67%) to pass and then the PolkaX team will implement it For more information on the community referendum https //scan chainx org/referendum/underway 16 \x0cRoadmap Polkadot consists of a relay chain and several parachains Parachains can be developed using di\xef\xac\x80erent types of blockchain underlying technologies The relay chain is responsible for the shared security consensus across the network and the inter chain transaction of parachains The relay chain itself does not have any applications and applications are developed and deployed on parachains Polkadot will push the entire blockchain world forward onto a new dimension marching towards blockchain 3 0 Polkadot will be launched at the end of this year focusing on the communication among new chains in the Polkadot ecosystem For the existing blockchains it will build a Ethereum contract bridge to integrate Ethereum into the Polkadot network and others chains will be handled by the community in terms of integration ChainX v1 Goes live before Polkadot launching It will \xef\xac\x81rst operate as an independent chain and issue PCX meanwhile build the transfer bridges with the current mainstream chains and integrate inter chain assets on chains of BTC LTC ZEC ETH ERC20 ERC721 ADA EOS to make it more extensive so that more users can participate in asset mining 17 \x0cChainX v2 Goes live after Polkadot launching v1in 2019 Q4 ChainX will add a new transfer bridge chain as a parallel chain of Polkadot to connect Polkadot assets and will continue to support the community in developing various DApps ChainX v3 Goes live after Polkadot launching v2 in 2020 ChainX will evolve into a multi chain architecture and operate as the second layer relay network of Polkadot 18 \x0cApplication ecosystem ChainX uses a inter chain approach to integrate multi chain assets so they can enjoy the same smart contract services It expands BTC applications because BTC can only perform several transactions per second on the Bitcoin chain but mapping it to ChainX chain transaction throughput and response speed are greatly improved and transaction cost reduced fulling showing its advantages as a base currency by participating in ChainX\ s various DApp services ChainX is built on the new generation of WASM smart contract technology that enables the development and deployment of various DApps Currently runtime contract development is supported and later contract development will be supported Developers can use any language that can be compiled into WASM and the development support for Rust is the best in the early days The current chain performance can reach hundreds of TPS with complete veri\xef\xac\x81cation system The system exchange DApp will adopt a free matching model without charging any matching fee Traditional exchanges charge about 0 1% matching fee Users pay a lot of fees for many transactions which is much higher than the miner\ s fees on the chain ChainX\ s completely decentralized community business model will not be bene\xef\xac\x81ting any centralized party and truly enables it to become user\ s own system 19 \x0cCommunity developers can design di\xef\xac\x80erent economic models and application scenarios in various upcoming applications For example stablecoins backed by BTC ZEC based privacy payment system and various games or high end \xef\xac\x81nancial derivatives and services 20 \x0chttps //chainx org \x0c
