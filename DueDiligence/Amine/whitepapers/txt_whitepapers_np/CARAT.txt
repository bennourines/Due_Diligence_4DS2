diamonds have held a special significance in societies around the globe They\xe2\x80\x99re a symbol of beauty and strength a metaphor for the tangible benefits of pressure and an outward display of status and wealth Nonetheless diamonds have played a complicated role as investment purchases Multiple shortlived attempts to construct a secondary market around diamonds experienced only fleeting success Unlike gold silver oil and other established commodities the exchange of contracts promising delivery of future diamonds poses unique challenges to its own standardization and execution ultimately hamstringing each and every implementation attempt to date Historically a secondary market for diamonds has been rife with abuse In 1972 short selling dealers capriciously manipulated the price of one exchange by exploiting arbitrary factors of diamond valuation Contract fulfillment demanded an extraordinary level of fidelity as diamonds hold extremely high value relative to their ease of loss theft or fraud Moreover contract fulfillment is further complicated by a lack of spot pricing and homogenized purchasing due to the highly individualistic nature of each diamond Not to mention if any monopolistic player should find a fulfillment unfavorable that player could easily and unfairly thwart delivery of the diamonds promised in a seller\xe2\x80\x99s contract In each iteration of the secondary diamond market we\xe2\x80\x99ve inched closer to finding a functional path forward Every misstep reveals a blind spot and each obstacle presents a challenge to overcome As desirability of diamonds continues to soar the need for a viable secondary market is all the more evident New diamond discoveries are projected to dwindle between 2018 20201 exposing an increasingly untapped investment potential Thus far proposed solutions have been neither resilient nor cost effective enough to attract investors However as we witness technological advancements in price discovery and transaction speed as well as the advent of the blockchain we find ourselves at a critical junction favoring the future of the secondary diamond market Now is the time to proceed past the tipping point and successfully commoditize diamonds 1a The Current Diamond Marketplace In today\xe2\x80\x99s diamond marketplace diamonds face a long arduous and risky journey from diamond mines into the hands of consumers Miners unearth diamonds from their natural habitat then sell them to diamond dealers Next those stones pass from the diamond dealers to the jewelry dealers who finally find a final home for that diamond This long supply chain leads to multiple price markups unnecessary risk and financial limitations Moreover banks do not finance diamond businesses Due to the history of bad actors using diamonds to launder money diamonds are considered to be high risk assets making it complicated for diamond dealers to acquire the funds needed to run their businesses 1 Diamond market fragile but dearth of new supply by 2018 Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 5 \x0cTo top it all off a common USD 250 000 minimum entry fee makes it expensive to invest in the diamond industry Those who do possess the necessary capital must buy from diamond dealers pay for shipping shell out for safekeeping purchase insurance and sell it back to a diamond dealer at below market rates For those without the necessary capital to spare getting into the diamond market is simply not an option As it currently stands the diamond market is overly complicated inaccessible and expensive The Ecosystem

may seem simple but as any seller knows it can take a good deal of trial and error before finding the sweet spot After a successful pilot with a leading industry members the DPA has proven itself to be one of the most accurate data driven fully automated pricing algorithms Our Diamond Pricing Algorithm helps alleviate any price related anxiety from both the seller\xe2\x80\x99s and buyer\xe2\x80\x99s sides By tracking daily purchase prices and movement of the Diamond Financial Index we provide a reliable data driven benchmark of any diamond\xe2\x80\x99s perfect price point an unprecedented level of transparency that assures fairness on all ends The Carats io DPA for the first time allows diamond dealers to use a sophisticated machine learning based to accurately assess the value of their inventory Standardization algorithmically discover the true market value of any diamond Tokenization redeem usable tokens based on its market value Commoditization use tokens to get a first time exposure to the diamond industry The Carats io system incorporates the following components Carats io streamlines price discovery by restricting inventory to diamonds certified by Gemological Institute of America Parameters of Pricing Up until the 1920s even those working in the jewelry industry had only a rudimentary understanding of precious stones In 1931 to remedy this pervasive problem the GIA was established as a nonprofit to train and certify jewelers formulating the first set of modern standards for diamond grading Today the institute serves to protect both buyers and sellers of gemstones with an agreed upon set of standards and GIA certificates maintain their decades old reputation as the most highly regarded qualification for diamond pricing Unlike grading systems devised by active gemstone suppliers GIA certification is entirely impartial and uninfluenced by market forces GIA certificates evaluate the 4Cs of traditional price list metrics (carats clarity color and cut) as 3 4 For a sample GIA certificate please refer to Appendix B For a full glossary of parameters and diamond characteristics please refer to Appendix C Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 10 \x0cwell as aspects such as girdle fluorescence polish and symmetry The Carats io algorithm parses all grade parameters against well known economic measures using sophisticated tools of statistical analysis creating the most advanced and precise pricing methodology to date Our 14 pricing parameters are Certificate Grading certification from the Gemological Institute of America Carat Weight measurement One carat is the equivalent of 0 2 grams Color Color grading White diamonds are given high ratings for colorlessness while colorful diamonds are rated based on intensity and purity Clarity Imperfection grading A high clarity or \xe2\x80\x98flawless\xe2\x80\x99 diamond won\xe2\x80\x99t have blemishes or inclusions that disrupt the flow of light Cut Design grading The man made aspect of a polished diamond is graded for its proportions and design finish Symmetry Symmetry measurement A grading subsection of a diamond\xe2\x80\x99s cut which refers to the alignment of its facets to one another and to its girdle Shape Diamonds have both traditional and innovative styles and the value of a diamond is influenced by its relation to conventional shapes Polish Polish grading When cut diamonds are polished smooth to varying levels of quality Over time this smoothness can be further diminished by wear and transport Fluorescence Ultraviolet glow Certain high quality diamonds may emit a soft glow under black light This unique aspect can influence a diamond\xe2\x80\x99s value Girdle The outer edge of a diamond The girdle can range from thin to thick and the valuation effect of a girdle\xe2\x80\x99s thickness exists in relation to the diamond\xe2\x80\x99s overall shape Culet A small facet on the bottom of the diamond that protects the stone from chipping Modern diamonds tend towards smaller culets or having no culets at all Depth Refers to the height of a diamond along with the ratio of height to diameter Certain shapes differ in their desirable depth ratios Table Refers to the width of the top area of a diamond along with a ratio of the top area to the total diameter Certain shapes differ in their desirable table ratios Country The diamond\xe2\x80\x99s country of origin Regional rarity and history can affect diamond pricing Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 11 \x0cHedonic Regression Hedonic regression breaks down a given good or service according to its individual components and allows us to assign value to each disparate part and provide a well rounded assessment of the actual market price of that good or service By definition the word \xe2\x80\x9chedonic\xe2\x80\x9d refers to pleasure with hedonic regression economists estimate the perceived pleasure derived from any one aspect of that good or service Particularly because diamonds are a popular consumer jewelry the hedonic pricing method is wellsuited to successfully assess their aesthetic value Diamonds are priced according to numerous value affecting qualities and the aggregate value of a stone is set based on each individual quality as well as the relationality of those qualities For instance certain shapes are more desirable in certain colors With Carats io each of these various characteristics is traceable with data readily supplied by our strategic partners We begin by analyzing data on more than 250 000 unique GIA certified diamonds then continuously monitor the daily breadth of market transactions i e what diamonds with what grade parameters sell for what amount We then use regression analysis to determine not only how these relational diamond qualities affect price but furthermore to assess the positive or negative effects on price by pair dynamics of grouped characteristics We use this sophisticated system to understand the relationship between diamond qualities \xe2\x80\x94 for example when a price boosting characteristic shows no positive pricing effects when co present with another particular parameter In this respect Carats io demystifies relationships between grade and demand a complicated correlation currently only understood by experienced appraisers or market analysts By formulaically unraveling these knotty connections our algorithm can uncover new and emerging correlations between diamond qualities While initial Carats io training data consistently outputs accurate pricing our system is built for improvement Our machine learning algorithm updates itself as it gathers new data allowing it to produce increasingly accurate price outputs The Carats io Diamond Pricing Algorithm is among the most advanced pricing algorithms currently on the market It has been assessed by industry experts and approved by a special examination committee Modeling Parameters for Regression Despite its name achieving linear pricing isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly straightforward In fact it takes a decent amount of mathematical adjustment to properly price the precious stones The Carats io Diamond Pricing Algorithm uses a Taylor series to transform the complex regressions described above into a linear pricing structure This way we\xe2\x80\x99re able to define these complicated nonlinear relationships between diamond qualities with an easier to understand polynomial based price Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 12 \x0c4 The Diamond Financial Index (DFX) Measure the Value of Diamonds The Diamond Financial Index (DFX) is the index to help investors diamond dealers or end users gauge the health of the overall diamond market Like a stock index each diamond index outputs one number to reflect the performance of the diamond market at large It\xe2\x80\x99s built on the solid foundation of more than 250 000 stones To construct the index we look at the total value of these stones based on the Carats io DPA Algorithm then standardize that number to obtain a value of 10 000 As the price of those stones fluctuate the index follows For instance if the value of all measured diamonds rises by 10 percent our index will move upward to 11 000 Every six months we recalibrate the system once again standardizing it to keep our index in equilibrium To ensure continuity across recalibration segments we standardize according to the most recent index value Carats io uses five different indices which cumulatively cover the entire diamond market Index Ticker Index Name Initial Value DFX General Index 10 000 DFX I Diamonds for Investment 2 000 DFX J Diamonds for Jewelry 3 000 DFX D Diamonds Smaller Than One Carat 6 000 DFX 1+ Diamonds Larger Than One Carat 4 000 Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 13 \x0cCARAT Public Token Rock Solid Token The relationships between the various components of Carats io provide a uniquely transparent informative and empowering environment for token holders The Diamond Financial Index allows users to conceptualize the performance of the diamond industry Additionally it informs the Carats io DPA Algorithm which allows for greater pricing transparency fostering trust throughout Carats io Indexing certified diamonds from authorized diamond dealers means that after years of repetitive failures diamonds can finally be commoditized 5 Stability One common criticism of the cryptocurrency market is its wild volatility Coin prices rapidly fluctuate sometimes hitting both their highest highs and lowest lows within a 24 hour period In recent months the crypto market has been especially roller coaster like in December 2017 Bitcoin steadily climbed to an all time high of nearly $20 000 USD per coin before freefalling to $6 000 USD It experienced months worth of peaks and valleys before dipping to its three month low in February 2018 Likewise Ethereum hit a high of over $1 400 USD per coin in early January Less than one month later it lost more than 50 percent of its value falling to below $700 USD per coin These major coins are not the exception to the rule Rather they abide by the laws of the crypto universe extreme volatility and frustrating unpredictability Between January 6 2018 and February 5 2018 the cryptocurrency market dropped by more than $460 B USD a loss of more than 60 percent of its total value Volatility isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an abstract concept We can measure it by looking at a currency\xe2\x80\x99s standard deviation or the amount that any one data point varies from the mean In the stock market we use the standard deviation to measure risk with a wider range indicating greater risk For instance a typical currency yields a standard deviation well below 1 percent The standard deviation of the bitcoin on the other hand sits at 2 76 percent \xe2\x80\x94 nearly six times higher than that of the EUR \xe2\x80\x94 showing that BTC is much more volatile and therefore a much riskier investment Risk is an integral aspect of cryptocurrency and an essential piece of the conversation surrounding digital currency Measuring that risk is an important consideration when investing in cryptocurrency and understanding the ebbs and flows in the market can help manage investments Thus the volatility of cryptocurrency introduces significant risk into the cryptomarket A single second can cost token holders hundreds of thousands of dollars as the prices experience sharp and unforeseeable change It causes anxiety for those who invest in crypto leaving them in a constant state of worry about their financial holdings On the opposite end of the volatility spectrum lies the diamond Diamonds have been considered valuable for thousands of years from their early history as important religious items in ancient India to their emerging significance in the jewelry market in 18th century France to today If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing we can count on it\xe2\x80\x99s that diamonds won\xe2\x80\x99t go out of fashion and hence value holds steady Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 14 \x0cHowever wonderful their stable attributes diamonds are nonetheless difficult to trade and transport making them a tricky asset to take advantage of At Carats io we\xe2\x80\x99re combining the stability of the diamond market with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency market Our CARAT Token is linked to our reserves by the Carats io Diamond Pricing Algorithm Our proprietary formula uses our reserve of actual diamonds and their cash equivalents to calculate the Theoretical Value of the CARAT Token linking the entire Carats io economy to a stable physical asset Additionally our formula accounts for both the issuance and redemption of CARAT Token scenarios protecting the token from sudden price shifts Each and every day we take the prices of tens of thousands of diamonds and input them into our system eliminating the residual errors built into most pricing systems For instance when there is a particularly high demand for tokens the price may rise in turn However in the case of Carat Token buyers will have the option to buy tokens directly from Carats io according to the Theoretical Value When tokens are in low demand they may be sold for a low price However this scenario provides an incentive for users to redeem their tokens according to the Theoretical Value These will provide the crypto world a whole new dimension of stability a safe haven in times of high uncertainty which is backed by the diamond industry Thus adding the dimension of governance to the ungoverned market To efficiently increase the control and manage the risks involved with being part of the crypto world Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 15 \x0c6 Barriers to a Secondary Market Thus far the secondary market for diamonds has been a story of failed attempt after failed attempt But failure does not imply impossibility In fact it\xe2\x80\x99s just the opposite While we as human beings tend to be discouraged by our mistakes it\xe2\x80\x99s important to realize that each failed attempt reveals a new hole in the system presenting us with an opportunity to close that gap and do better next time In our analysis of past failures and current shortcomings in the secondary diamond market we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified two key points of resistance \xe2\x80\x94 apart from regulatory and corporate caprice \xe2\x80\x94 that consistently and categorically dampen attempts to successfully establish this market Diamonds are difficult to commoditize While metals like gold and silver retain value regardless of size or shape the nearly infinite variability of diamonds means their worth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t correlate with their weight Rather the price of each stone must be assessed on a diamond to diamond basis Diamonds resist standardized pricing By and large attempts to establish universal price lists for diamonds have been unsuccessful Traditional models grade diamonds based on the 4Cs \xe2\x80\x94 Carats Clarity Color and Cut \xe2\x80\x94 establishing a baseline for objectivity and efficiency However expert graders consider a number of other distinguishing features that will typically bump up the price of each stone 7 The Carats io Solution How then would one bypass these barriers and what would it take to implement a functional secondary diamond market At Carats io we believe that the ideal secondary diamond market should offer functionality and appeal on par with or better than the traditional commodities like oil and gold Thus we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed Carats io around these goals We\xe2\x80\x99ve carefully studied each past barrier to success and we\xe2\x80\x99ve broken down said barriers to successfully standardize diamond trading 7a Commoditization Ultimately using our state of the art technology coupled with our diamonds indices we strive to help the diamond world to achieve full commoditization of the diamond market With Carats io diamond prices at our Carats io vault will be linked to the diamond market using our Diamond Pricing Algorith (DPA) using the same technology running the Diamond Financial Index (DFX) our proprietary index measuring the performance of the diamond market This establishes Carats io as a capable provider of indices which together cover the entire diamond market by 1 Allowing suppliers to get an educated decision when purchasing diamonds and 2 Allowing buyers to redeem their tokens for fairly priced diamonds We believe that by doing so we would be able to achieve this high liquidity feature rich system Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 16 \x0c7b Tokenization Historically diamond exchanges have posed a challenge in terms of fulfillment logistics We\xe2\x80\x99ve developed a way to circumvent these complications by trading digital tokens that represent a significant range of the polished diamond industry rather than trading the stones themselves By applying blockchain technology based on the revolutionary DPA and the DFX Carats io creates a state of the art system to tokenize the diamond industry Tokenizing diamonds allows us to sidestep the inherent individuality of each diamond thus breaking down the homogeneity barrier It acts as a type of \xe2\x80\x98second stage processing \xe2\x80\x99 converting the value assigned to a physical diamonds into a generic divisible diamonds backed token Not only are these digital tokens be effortlessly transferred upon contract fulfillment but they also eliminate the traditional geographic or temporal limitations of diamond industry While tokens create fungibility by allowing for easy and exact contract fulfillment they do not inherently standardize the diamond market All out standardization requires a diamonds to token conversion system Users of this prospective token must be confident that (1) they are exchanging their diamonds for token amounts of equal value based on our DPA (2) all stones are set against the same standard and (3) said standard requires little to no subjectivity Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 17 \x0c7c Standardization Carats io aims to solve this tricky question of standardization with the most advanced and automated pricing method available in the market Our innovative self learning DPA assesses 14 unique parameters comparing all meritorious aspects of a diamond\xe2\x80\x99s grading against current market conditions to output a fair and objective price value While cryptocurrency a rather recent innovation is a foreign concept to many diamantaires standardization of stones has long been an elusive goal for the industry In the absence of a standard metric for value jewelry traders have found themselves struggling to verify the validity of any given gem the Carats io algorithm incorporates continuous and constant validation We leverage our strategic alliance with market leaders to directly access their daily rates ensuring that the output value of each grade based token precisely correlates to a verifiably accurate price of the diamond input Diamond dealer uploads diamonds to Carats io\xe2\x80\x99s calculator The algorithm scans 14 parameters based on the entire database Calculating value based on each parameter Calculating recommended price Since traditional pricing methods grade stones according to only four parameters (the 4Cs \xe2\x80\x94 Carats Clarity Color and Cut) they output a mere 50 000 possible permutations Carats io on the other hand incorporates 14 different metrics of evaluation yielding over 1 trillion unique price points Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 18 \x0c8 The Carats io Markets By allowing for the commoditization of diamonds we\xe2\x80\x99re transforming the diamond trade and opening doors that were previously padlocked No longer will diamonds hold their unenvied status as an uncommodizible good We use our proprietary Carats io Diamond Pricing Algorithm (Carats io DPA) to price all diamonds then digitally homogenize each stone \xe2\x80\x94 forming a strong base for commoditization How does Carats io change the diamond trade On the supply side Buyers need not depend on their gut feeling and intuition when making a purchase and must no longer rely on contradicting confusing and/or biased supplier pricing Rather they\xe2\x80\x99ll have access to Carats io Diamond Financial Indices which accounts for all variables affecting value assessment Suppliers typically combine personal experience and market comparison to triangulate their own diamond sale prices We\xe2\x80\x99re swapping these imprecise and outdated methods for a reliable algorithmic index price estimator Banks using diamonds as collateral can steer clear of the arbitrary price ranges that follow reliance on gemologists and the 4Cs Carats io\xe2\x80\x99s automated pricing reduces man hours spent communicated with biased appraisers On the demand side Buyers can use CARAT Tokens to store diamond backed value Suppliers can use Diamond Financial Indices to better decide how to make their purchases The new secondary market opens up the diamond industry to users with low capital Where previously involvement in the industry was restricted to those with enough expendable funds to buy expensive physical diamonds Carats io allows users to allocate small amounts in the diamond market without purchasing stones With daily adjusted pricing users requiring liquidity can treat diamonds as a commodity parallel to CARAT Tokens This way their assets experience unlimited liquidity Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 19 \x0c9 The Diamond as a Token Standardizing All Stones To solve the homogeneity barrier we digitally melt down diamonds in our blockchain furnace then reconstitute them as tokens The blockchain forms the foundation of our diamond exchange The records known as blocks build upon each other in an ever expanding list or chain (hence the blockchain) These blocks are distributed among all users establishing an efficient trustless system that is largely invulnerable to attack Blocks contain encrypted records of all accounts and transactions \xe2\x80\x94 as with other cryptocurrencies public users remain entirely encrypted 9a Blockchain Infrastructure There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that banks and governments have traditionally been the arbiters of currency Up until this point in history technology wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t permit a widespread system of commerce without a governing third party Unsupervised marketplaces were limited and success required (1) a small group of traders (2) who were personally connected to some degree (3) engaging only in low value transactions In other words it had to be high trust and low stakes Most of us are so accustomed to third party currency systems that we overlook and even forget its many drawbacks It requires immense and constant data collection requires fees to sustain operating costs and is bogged down by bureaucracy A trustless system on the other hand sustains reliable and desired outputs without the requirement of trust By using blockchain technology we\xe2\x80\x99ve established a trustless scalable system that allows us to transform slow moving retail broker arrangements into a globally accessible diamond exchange The blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s distributed ledger authenticates logs and secures all transactions within Carats io That means that Carats io as an administrative body does not oversee or validate transactions within the token based economy This way we\xe2\x80\x99re able to preserve both the security and confidentiality \xe2\x80\x94 the two pillars of the diamond trade \xe2\x80\x94 of all Carats io users Every transaction is associated with a pair of encryption keys the initiating user\xe2\x80\x99s private authentication key and the transaction\xe2\x80\x99s public key As humans we tend to love what we know and fear what we don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 causing many to worry that old school diamond vendors may not take to the latest technology However blockchain implementation is largely invisible providing protection on the backend that benefits users without burdening them with the trouble of learning new software The more obvious innovation will be Carats io token itself 9b Changeover and Token Creation In the case of Bitcoin new coins are created by computerized mining This process uses excessive amounts of energy from millions of computers rewarding successful miners for their efforts and energy with Bitcoins themselves By incentivizing users to devote their CPU power to mining Bitcoins Bitcoin increases their supply by engaging the community without ever asking them to reveal their identities Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 20 \x0cOur tokens on the other hand represent real diamonds and our system depends on transparency accountability and proper vetting procedures Much like the U S dollar was once backed by a supply of gold stored in Fort Knox CARAT Tokens are secured by real diamonds stored in audited safes A \xe2\x80\x98Big Four\xe2\x80\x99 accounting firm will be auditing the deposit system To track our stones each and every diamond on Carats io will have the standard of GIA certification Additionally as a company that is dedicated to social responsibility Carats io ensures that all of their diamonds are conflict free In order to maintain full and complete transparency we\xe2\x80\x99ll share the results of the periodic audits on our website 9c Using the Token Smart contracts are computer protocols that smooth out and simplify the transaction process Smart contracts use technology to

details of the Carats io environment let\xe2\x80\x99s take look at a broader overview of all how it works Each and every diamond in the Carats io economy is tracked All of a diamonds defining characteristics are encoded in a permanent blockchain record Those defining characteristics include but are not limited to GIA certification # GIA parameters Algorithmic valuation Ownership (Public dealer or private pseudonymous wallet) Sell price (if put out for bid from current owner) History of ownership (Showing authenticity and ethical supply chain) Any attached derivatives Blockchain transactions allow for unprecedented payment flexibility They\xe2\x80\x99re unrestricted by borders fiat control or long settlement processes It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to obtain CARAT Tokens They can be purchased by all major fiat currencies from within the Carats io platform We\xe2\x80\x99ve designed the CARAT Token to be as practical as possible Thus the function of the CARAT Token extends far beyond the simple purchase and sale of diamonds both diamond dealers and end users can use CARAT Tokens for the safekeeping and transportation of their diamonds CARAT Tokens are a key feature in the cryptocurrency world as they allow high liquidity and low volatility Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 22 \x0c10a Redeeming the CARAT Tokens CARAT Tokens can be redeemed Each day Carats io calculates the value of the diamond reserves and cash equivalents then uses that value to issue tokens accordingly A token holder has the option to redeem 100 percent of the amount he holds according to Carats io\xe2\x80\x99s terms of use Carats io maintains its diamond reserve as shown in accordance with the following table CARAT Token Supply Diamond Reserve Ratio Up to 50M 100% 50M 500M 500M 10B 10B and above 80% 51% (MC/109) Reserve ratio = 0 84e 51% 20% (8 1*MC)/1010 Reserve ratio = 0 495e 20% (Value of reserves/reserves ratio)/total tokens in circulation = Redemption value At all times this reserve is used to assure that CARAT Token holders are able to redeem their tokens A token holder can exchange a minimum of $50 000 USD worth of CARAT Tokens per transaction and a maximum of $500 000 USD worth of CARAT Tokens per month for diamonds and cash equivalents With a maximum of 1 transaction a day Redeeming tokens To redeem those tokens the token holder must adhere to Carats io\xe2\x80\x99s compliance process Then Carats io will exchange the CARAT Token for its equal value of diamonds and cash equivalents All diamonds in Carats io Vault are certified GIA (Gemological Institute of America) diamonds Those diamonds are the most tradable diamonds A token holder has the option to redeem up to 100% percent of the amount of the Tokens held according to

blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s distributed ledger technology to the diamond industry we\xe2\x80\x99re combining the reliability of a highly traditional space with the latest 21st century innovations to get the best of both While the diamond industry provides a solid foundation with practices already in place it opens up a new menu of possibilities for token holders Carats io Diamond Pricing Algorithm (Carats io DPA) \xe2\x80\x93 Our proprietary algorithm that takes into account (1) daily purchase prices and (2) the Diamond Index to help sellers find their perfect price point Diamond Financial Index (DFX) \xe2\x80\x93 A single numerical value that helps dealers assess price changes in the diamond market The CARAT Public Token \xe2\x80\x93 The publicly available token The CARAT Token makes Carats io\xe2\x80\x99s secondary marketplace for diamonds function Carats io Environment \xe2\x80\x93 The overall environment where diamond dealers and users can use the most advanced technology to interact transact and trade The Carats io system allows for the exchange CARAT Tokens These four key components form the machine that is Carats io Each component touches the other moving together like an interconnected set of gears The Carats io DPA is derived from the sale prices of gems in our system The extensive data from the Carats io DPA forms the backbone of the Diamond Index providing an easy to understand evaluation of the current state of the diamond industry Additionally Carats io purchases diamonds as a percentage of the CARAT\xe2\x80\x99s fair market value in the form of diamonds and cash reserves Additionally Carats io uses the DPA\xe2\x80\x99s pricing when purchacing new diamonds to maintin our reserve ratio DPA Algorithm Deployed December 2017 Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All

allocate 100% of TGE proceeds towards purchasing diamonds to fill our reserves After that and in order to maintain the operation the spread of the fractional reserves will be allocated towards substaining the Carats io eco system 11b Ongoing Sale As users buy and sell with Carats io it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we maintain the economic equilibrium at all times We start with our \xe2\x80\x9cdiamond\xe2\x80\x9d rule of the Carats io ecosystem \xe2\x80\x94 the total market value of the CARAT Token will be determined by the diamond reserve equation This means that each token\xe2\x80\x99s value is covered by real physical diamonds and cash equivalents Since token holders can purchase the CARAT tokens without an initial diamond deposit coverage will inevitably dip beneath coverage ratio as the diamonds to tokens coverage ratio is a core element of the Carats io guarantee we utilize regulatory mechanisms to insure that the ratio will always be returned Carats io will continuously issue CARAT Tokens to users who have gone through our compliance process The value of those tokens will correlate to the Vault\xe2\x80\x99s Carats io DPA price For each new token created a coverage ratio must be maintained according to the diamond and cash equivalents reserves Baseline In all of our hypothetical scenarios we\xe2\x80\x99re starting with the same baseline In this situation we\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to deal with nice round numbers an initial vault Carats io DPA price of 10 000 and 4 million tokens issued at a price of $1 USD That brings us to a market cap of $4 million USD which will be paralleled by our reserves ratio which must also equal 100% of the USD 4 million value of diamonds Vault initial Carats io DPA price and cash CARAT Tokens Issued Token

algorithm giving the first iteration of its diamond pricing list Next Carats io will build on the original training set by applying the algorithm to the more extensive international diamond database This will produce the final pricing index Diamonds will then be purchased and deposited into the Carats io reserves at the algorithmically assigned market value The Carats io index/indices based around the Vault Carats io DPA price and cash equivalents represents in totality Carats io\xe2\x80\x99s share of base assets within the market Nobody said commoditizing diamonds would be easy In fact history has proven just the opposite time and time again However these historical lessons combined with our partnership in the diamonds industry the support of thousands of diamond dealers and the ingenuity of the blockchain puts Carats io on the shoulders of giants Q4 2016 Q2 2017 The idea was born Released Diamond Pricing Algorithm (DPA) Beta Q4 2017 Q1 2018 DPA officially deployed Q4 2018

rollercoaster of opening a new market Particularly painstaking was the validation process of the pricing algorithm we went through tense deliberations and our excitement was tempered by the caution that came from months of meetings email chains and test runs Nonetheless both the Carats io team and our partners understood that our token heralds a new era for diamond commoditization Though we were obviously eager to release our project we buckled down to ensure that we got everything right Our uniform nonlinear pricing model was a prerequisite to transforming diamonds into a homogenized tradable commodity So we started with homogenizing our pricing by implementing complete objectivity and consistency of automation Only after that could we homogenize the actual material diamonds Where in the past such a market was merely the stuff of fantasies blockchain is allowing us to turn those fantasies into a tangible solution By cutting out the diamond industry\xe2\x80\x99s many middlemen prices are more dynamic storage is safer communication is quicker transactions are faster and costs are fewer at every stage of the process Plus Carats io purchases stores insures and audits the physical commodity for the end user then automatically reprices it daily At its core Carats io is a launchpad for two markets The first a renovated primary market runs smooth and efficiently thanks to smart contracts that foster the exchange of value documentation and ownership The second a finally viable secondary market reimagines old inefficient systems as a next generation global trading environment where a diamond\xe2\x80\x99s value can be remotely traded while the diamond itself safely awaits in a secure deposit box Carats io CONFIDENTIAL All rights reserved v0809 28 \x0cAppendix A
