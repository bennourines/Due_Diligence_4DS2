Angeles California Formed in 2016 and converted into a corporation in early 2017 Vezt has received pre seed funding from Binary Capital and principals of Global Trust Group Vezt has on boarded a local UX/UI team back end engineering and design teams including a blockchain architect and middleware expert and have just created the wireframes UX/UI and design of the platform and are currently building and integrating the back end and blockchain elements We have assembled a talented and competent team and have tapped a number of successful and highlyexperienced advisors for their expertise and input to build the most robust and successful platform possible We expect to have a demonstrable prototype in September of 2017 and a fully functional MVP by the end of Q4 2017 and a public beta launch in Q1 2018 3 \x0cVEZT VEZT 2 0 Our Mission We believe that music is one of the few mediums that can literally transform life It can provide solace and comfort to those hurting or in need joy and excitement to an experience or event and even has the ability to transcend time and space with the emotional nostalgia that hearing a favorite song can trigger in one\xe2\x80\x99s mind It\xe2\x80\x99s powerful and magic and we think it\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of our efforts to provide its creators with the ability to be fairly and transparently compensated for their work and talent Our mission is \xe2\x80\xa2 To provide artists with an equitable and transparent platform to easily and quickly monetize new or existing songs \xe2\x80\xa2 To allow fans friends rights buyers and brands to partner with artists on a song by song basis sharing directly in whole or fractional IP ownership \xe2\x80\xa2 To create a true marketplace for songs where tracking and collection of royalties and licensing income is transparent and in real time \xe2\x80\xa2 To deliver to artists the opportunity to make a living from the fruits of their work without unnecessary impediments that keep them from focusing on what truly matters their music \xe2\x80\xa2 To strengthen the relationship between artists and those that appreciate their music in a meaningful way where a true partnership can be formed and mutual benefits derived 4 \x0cVEZT 3 0 The Problem Artists have limited options available to monetize their songs Typical record label and publishing structures constrain artists to unbalanced deals that rely on antiquated protocols that lack transparency Even established artists may see earnings flatten after years without a record release or concert tour with no way to bring increased value to their songs The music industry is currently fragmented with the major labels and publishers focused on grand slam home runs leaving developing artists as well as successful older artists with few to no options to generate real income growth New artists have a problem with gaining traction and getting the word out about new songs and once they do the current monetization options do not provide enough income for artists to sustain themselves through their art Digital platforms like YouTube and Instagram pay little to nothing and are difficult to find traction even with a growing fanbase as other promotion is often necessary but unaffordable Established artists have seen diminishing advances from record labels and an increase in rights tied to those advances They are beholden to what has basically become a bank that shops out many services (A&R publicity promotion marketing etc ) to third parties leaving the artist with little control or transparency Many have been left with no choice but to take tour sponsorships and sell merchandise liquor jewelry and other ancillary products that have nothing to do with music to support themselves Legacy artists have seen their income streams level out and are often unable to tour (due to illness or death) or secure new record or publishing deals There are very few options to reinvigorate a fanbase and spike monetization They may be sitting on a catalog of hundreds of songs that is earning less and less everyday due to the decreased value of masters and the lack of funds to mount a campaign to promote their songs to music supervisors and brands Individual songwriters often have copyrights in numerous compositions but have no way to directly monetize their rights or to develop new income streams outside the traditional publishing model 5 \x0cVEZT 4 0 The Solution Vezt lets artists choose which portions of their songs to offer for sale to fans friends rights buyers and brands through an app based platform that employs blockchain technology to track and collect royalty income Give artists back the control over their work Let them decide which portions of which songs they wish to market Let them choose a reversion schedule Provide them with a transparent platform where they are funded by real people who believe in them and their music Vezt functions as sort of a micro publisher in that as little as 1% of a song\xe2\x80\x99s rights may be offered to fans and rights buyers This allows artists to use fractions of one song to fund the production of other songs all on their terms New artists need financial resources to write record and promote their work This is critical to the creative process and without it many will devote less time and effort to creating music as they have to find other methods to provide financial sustenance This is one of the reasons that many of today\xe2\x80\x99s top songs sound eerily alike they are products of a risk adverse industry that utilizes the same handful of producers over and over again which is their safe bet as purveyors of the purse strings Once artists have a financial resource that can sustain them there\xe2\x80\x99s no limit to the new and exciting music thewill create Established artists still hold rights that may not be encumbered by labels or publishers More and more frequently there are master reversion and re recording clauses that allow artist to control master rights rights that can be monetized through Vezt The songwriter portion of song copyrights is typically 100% controlled by artists that have existing co publishing deals with major publishers These songwriter rights can be monetized through Vezt as well Legacy artists and individual songwriters can reinvigorate their earnings and fan bases by using Vezt to market portions of songs from their back catalogs Marketing even 10% of a single song from a decades old album can ignite new interest in an artist and raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in a matter of hours All artists can benefit from an easy way to raise money for their favorite cause if a major artist didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to dip into his or her own bank account to make a charitable donation they could easily market a small percentage of an older song and raise a substantial donation very quickly from their fans rights buyers and even brands Vezt provides tracking and collection on all ownership interests through our blockchain smart contract techno ogy which will allow a secure and transparent method for both artists and Vetz Token holders to receive their earnings as quickly as possible 6 \x0cVEZT 5 0 How It Works Artists choose how much they\xe2\x80\x99d like to raise from a fraction of their rights from one of their songs (for example $10 000 for 10% of their songwriter rights) the reversion term (3 5 10 or in perpetuity) and set a date for the ISOTM (Initial Song Offering) Rights buyers on the Vezt platform (including fans music professionals and brands) buy the rights during the ISOTM and the artist receives the funds credited to their account immediately The song rights information is encoded on the Vezt blockchain and royalties are collected from Performing Rights Organizations (\xe2\x80\x9cPROs\xe2\x80\x9d)in 137 countries around the world as well as through STEM is which aggregates digital performance royalties from Spotify iTunes YouTube Pandora etc Vezt registers the rights with PROs and digital platforms and pays them through to artists and rights buyers 7 \x0cVEZT 6 0 Platform Features \xe2\x80\xa2 Fractional song monetization for artists through Initial Song Offerings (ISOTM) We\xe2\x80\x99re making it easy for artists to market as little as 1% of their song to rights buyers It\xe2\x80\x99s not a catalog or an album or even a song it\xe2\x80\x99s a fraction of a song and artist can even choose reversion terms if they like We\xe2\x80\x99re also bringing back excitement and anticipation to a song release We call it an \xe2\x80\x9cISOTM\xe2\x80\x9d or Initial Song Offering where artists can select the date and time they want their song offered which focuses promotional and marketing efforts on a particular moment increasing impact and urgency which drives more interest and rights purchasing Just like a ticket on sale (\xe2\x80\x9cJay Z tickets go on sale Monday at 10 00AM \xe2\x80\x9d) popular song offerings may sell out in a matter minutes \xe2\x80\xa2 Social media sharing of both artist and rights buyers\xe2\x80\x99 activity and playlists We know that social networks amplify interest and results Artists have thousands or even millions of fans rights buyers and brands do too We will boost demand by making sure news of offerings and rights purchases hit both artist and rights buyers\xe2\x80\x99 social networks to maximize potential awareness and demand We expect the emergence of tastemakers who will understand how to identify potential hit songs and know how to drive right buyer\xe2\x80\x99s interest behind em A \xe2\x80\x9cWarren Buffet\xe2\x80\x9d of music will emerge and benefit from those that follow a successful track record on the platform by bringing financial interest to new and established songs \xe2\x80\xa2 Royalty tracking and collection in 137 countries around the world As important as it is to get the funds to the artists once an initial song offering is complete it\xe2\x80\x99s equally important to provide secure and transparent royalty tracking and collections once a song is released Our platform incorporates blockchain \xe2\x80\x9csmart contract\xe2\x80\x9d technology to provide rights holders with the best possible tools for royalty administration around the world We utilize STEM is as our digital tracking and collections partner with capabilities to track and collect from digital platforms such as YouTube Spotify Pandora SoundExchange etc We also will utilize the traditional performing rights organizations to track and collect from international usages in 137 countries around the world Our hope is that at some point our blockchain capabilities will allow more direct tracking and collection in the near future 8 \x0cVEZT \xe2\x80\xa2 Allows fans rights buyers and brands to participate across a wide variety of songs and playlists Never before has there been the opportunity for individuals or rights buyers to literally buy directly into the music In the film industry it\xe2\x80\x99s common (and necessary) for institutions like JP Morgan Chase put together a $300M fund to purchase across a tranche of film projects $10M in this one $25M in that one etc to diversify their risk and broaden their base Nothing like this exists for music There is currently no way for individuals institutions or brands to buy directly into music We seek to change this and thereby open the floodgates to potentially billions of dollars that has been heretofore unavailable to artists The best analogy is to what occurred in the financial industry the late 1980s where before it was impossible for someone to buy a single share of stock you had to be an \xe2\x80\x9caccredited\xe2\x80\x9d investor have a large deposit in a brokerage account and could only by in blocks of shares Once eTrade and Charles Schwab opened up electronic trading accounts to the public market demand grew exponentially to where we are today where you can buy any single share of stock directly from your mobile device at almost no cost \xe2\x80\xa2 Technical Details 9 \x0cVEZT Vezt blockchain framework uses enabling technologies in the cloud to store keys and manage identities combined with emerging secure confidential execution environments (enclaves) providing a better wallet management The platform is a compliant confidential consortium of certified members and participants This framework will be the environment where blockchain based smart contracts are constructed and executed The Vezt marketplace is designed for fast high volume transactions 1 An active song contract is initialized on the Vezt platform from a user touch point or calling application 2 Authorization keys required and defined in the smart song contract are requested and are securely retrieved from key vault to form a unique keychain 3 The runtime requests an enclave be created as defined in the smart song contract A smart song contract can specify ownership rights royalty calculations payments business logic and more 4 A user or a counter party sends a message that is authenticated with the keychain These serve as identity tokens and are embedded into the messages for verification 5 The message is then routed to an enclave performing the smart song contract logic execution A new message based on the previous logic output is then persisted to the next block in the contract\xe2\x80\x99s evolution and so on until completion 6 A signed message is attested by the secure runtime environment (SRE) and sent to the Transaction Builder and Router 7 The Vezt cloud chain accepts and processes the transaction and returns that transaction\xe2\x80\x99s receipt to participants and the Vezt datacenter for verification and audit 8 In future releases interoperability between private/consortium and public networks to verify Vezt transactions will be possible 10 \x0cVEZT 7 0 Vezt Token (VZT) Usage \xe2\x80\xa2 Funds the buildout of the platform including UX UI design API and node builds and integration including all blockchain components We are working to complete our integration of the UX/UI (front end) with the middleware (blockchain) components and back end admin structure of our platform We will also tie in with STEM is\xe2\x80\x99s platform and will build the necessary APIs to accomplish that as well as other nodes for additional royalty providers to access our platform \xe2\x80\xa2 Funds the marketing of the platform including global rollout and the on boarding of key mainstream and developing artists and their fans as well as members of the global brand and purchaser market Our platform is nothing without artists and to that end our goal is to onboard key artists as launch partners into beta and then quickly open up the platform to domestic and international artists once we work through the beta period Scaling is critical and as this is a new and disruptive global concept we seek to roll out in as many countries as possible in a short timeframe We\xe2\x80\x99ve had artist and rights buyer interest across the globe and realize that music\xe2\x80\x99s vast international appeal and audience must be addressed along with brands and rights buyers in each territory that are interested in both local and international artists and songs The marketing and execution of our platform in these areas will require an execution strategy and structure that has a presence in key markets along with a customer service base that insures a smooth introduction of our platform \xe2\x80\xa2 VZT tokens can be used on the platform to purchase song IP after the launch of the platform After the Token Generating Event is closed the token audit is complete and the platform is launched 100% of each TGE
