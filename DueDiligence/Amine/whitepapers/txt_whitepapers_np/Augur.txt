 (Dated November 1 2019)
 Augur is a trustless decentralized oracle and platform for prediction markets The outcomes of
 Augur s prediction markets are chosen by users that hold Augur s native Reputation token who
 stake their tokens on the actual observed outcome and in return receive settlement fees from
 the markets Augur s incentive structure is designed to ensure that honest accurate reporting of
 outcomes is always the most profitable option for Reputation token holders Token holders can post
 progressively larger Reputation bonds to dispute proposed market outcomes If the size of these
 bonds reaches a certain threshold Reputation splits into multiple versions one for each possible
 outcome of the disputed market token holders must then exchange their Reputation tokens for one
 of these versions Versions of Reputation which do not correspond to the real world outcome will
 become worthless as no one will participate in prediction markets unless they are confident that the
 markets will resolve correctly Therefore token holders will select the only version of Reputation
 which they know will continue to have value the version that corresponds to reality 
 Augur is a trustless decentralized oracle and predic 
 tion market platform In a prediction market individuals
 can speculate on the outcomes of future events those who
 forecast the outcome correctly win money and those who
 forecast incorrectly lose money [1{3] The price of a pre 
 diction market can serve as a precise and well calibrated
 indicator of how likely an event is to occur [4{7] 
 Using Augur people will have the ability to trade in
 prediction markets at very low cost The only significant
 expenses participants assume is compensation to mar 
 ket creators and to users that report on the outcomes of
 markets once the event has taken place The result is
 a prediction market where trust requirements friction 
 and fees will be as low as competitive market forces can
 drive them 
 Historically prediction markets have been centralized 
 The simplest way to aggregate trades in a prediction mar 
 ket is for a trustworthy entity to maintain a ledger sim 
 ilarly the simplest way to determine the outcome of an
 event and distribute payouts to traders is for an impar 
 tial trusted judge to determine the outcomes of the mar 
 kets However centralized prediction markets have many
 risks and limitations they do not allow global participa 
 tion they limit what types of markets can be created or
 traded and they require traders to trust the market op 
 erator to not steal funds and to resolve markets correctly 
 Augur aims to resolve markets in a fully decentralized
 way Decentralized trustless networks such as Bitcoin[8]
 and Ethereum[9] eliminate the risk that self interest will
 turn into corruption or theft The only role of the Augur
 developers is to publish smart contracts to the Ethereum
 network The Augur contracts are totally automated 
 the developers do not have the ability to spend funds
 that are held in escrow on contract do not control how
 markets resolve do not approve or reject trades or other
 transactions on the network cannot undo trades can 
 not modify or cancel orders etc The Augur oracle al 
 lows information to be migrated from the real world to
 a blockchain without relying on a trusted intermediary 
 Augur will be the world s first decentralized oracle 
 I HOW AUGUR WORKS
 Augur markets follow a four stage progression cre 
 ation trading reporting and settlement Anyone can
 create a market based on any real world event Trading
 begins immediately after market creation and all users
 are free to trade on any market After the event on which
 the market is based has occurred the outcome of the
 event is determined by Augur s oracle Once the out 
 come is determined traders can close out their positions
 and collect their payouts 
 Augur has a native token Reputation (REP)1 REP is
 needed by market creators and by reporters when they
 report on the outcome of markets created on the Augur
 platform Reporters report on a market by staking their
 REP on one of the market s possible outcomes By do 
 ing this the reporter declares that the outcome on which
 the stake was placed matches the real world outcome of
 the market s underlying event The consensus of a mar 
 ket s reporters is considered the \truth for the purpose
 of determining the market s outcome If a reporter s re 
 port of a market s outcome does not match the consensus
 reached by the other reporters Augur redistributes the
 REP staked on the non consensus outcome by this re 
 porter to the reporters that reported with the consensus 
 By owning REP and participating in the accurate re 
 porting on the outcomes of events token holders are enti 
 tled to a portion of the fees on the platform Each staked
 REP token entitles its holder to an equal portion of Au 
 gur s market fees The more REP a reporter owns and
 reports correctly with the more fees they will earn for
 their work in keeping the platform secure 
 Although REP plays a central role in Augur s opera 
 tions it is not used to trade in Augur s markets Traders
 will never need to own or use REP as they are not re 
 quired to participate in the reporting process 
 1REP is an ERC777 token on the Ethereum network

 A Market Creation
 Augur allows anyone to create a market about any up 
 coming event The market creator sets the event end time
 and chooses a designated reporter to report the outcome
 of the event The designated reporter does not unilat 
 erally decide the outcome of the market the community
 always has an opportunity to dispute and correct the
 designated reporter s report 
 Next the market creator chooses a resolution source
 that reporters should use to determine the outcome The
 resolution source may simply be \common knowledge 
 or it may be a specific source such as \The United States
 Department of Energy bbc com or the address of a
 particular API endpoint 2 They also set a creator fee 
 which is the fee paid to the market creator by traders
 who settle with the market contract (see Section ID for
 details on fees) Finally the market creator posts two
 bonds the validity bond and the creator bond 
 The validity bond is paid in DAI and is returned to
 the market creator if the market resolves to any out 
 come other than invalid 3 The validity bond incentivizes
 market creators to create markets based on well defined
 events with objective unambiguous outcomes The size
 of the validity bond is set dynamically based on the pro 
 portion of invalid outcomes in recent markets 4
 The creator bond paid in REP is returned to the mar 
 ket creator if and only if the market s designated reporter
 actually reports during the first 24 hours after the mar 
 ket s event end time and if the market ends up resolving
 to the same outcome that the designated reporter re 
 ported If the designated reporter does not submit their
 report during the allotted 3 day window then the market
 creator forfeits the no show bond and it is given to the
 first public reporter who reports on the market (see Sec 
 tion IC6) This incentivizes the market creator to choose
 a reliable designated reporter who will report truthfully
 { which should help markets resolve quickly 
 2For example if a market on \The high tempera 
 ture (in degrees Fahrenheit) on April 10 2018 at the
 San Francisco International Airport as reported by
 Weather Underground specifies a resolution source of
 https //www wunderground com/history/airport/KSFO/2018/4/10/
 DailyHistory html reporters would simply go to that URL and
 enter the high temperature displayed there as their report 
 3An invalid market is a market determined to be invalid by reporters
 because none of the outcomes listed by the market creator is cor 
 rect or because the market wording is ambiguous or subjective see
 Section IIIG for discussion 
 4See Appendix B1 for details 
 In the event that the designated reporter fails to re 
 port the creator bond is given to the first public reporter
 in the form of stake on their reported outcome so that
 the first public reporter receives the creator bond if and
 only if they report correctly As with the validity bond 
 the creator bond is adjusted dynamically based on the
 proportion of designated reporters who failed to report
 on time during the previous fee window and the propor 
 tion of markets that resolve to some outcome other than
 the one reported by the designated reporter 5
 The market creator creates the market and posts all
 required bonds via a single Ethereum transaction Once
 the transaction is confirmed the market is live and trad 
 ing begins 
 B Trading
 Market participants forecast the outcomes of events by
 trading shares of those market outcomes A complete set
 of shares is a collection of shares that consists of one share
 of each possible valid outcome of the event [10] Complete
 sets are created by Augur s on contract matching engine
 as needed to complete trades6 
 For example consider a market that has two possible
 outcomes A and B Alice is willing to pay 0 7 DAI for a
 share of A and Bob is willing to pay 0 3 DAI for a share
 of B First Augur matches these orders and collects a
 total of 1 DAI from Alice and Bob 7 Then Augur creates
 a complete set of shares giving Alice the share of A and
 Bob the share of B This is how shares of outcomes come
 into existence Once the shares are created they can be
 traded freely 
 The Augur trading contracts maintain an order book
 for every market created on the platform Anybody can
 create a new order or fill an existing order at any time 
 Orders are filled by an automated matching engine that
 exists within Augur s smart contracts Requests to buy
 or sell shares are fulfilled immediately if there is a match 
 ing order already on the order book It may be filled
 by buying shares from or selling shares to other partic 
 ipants which may involve issuing new complete sets or
 5See Appendix B2 for details 
 6In practice each share in a complete set is an ERC777 token on
 the Ethereum network 
 7The 1 DAI figure is used here for ease of discussion The actual
 cost of a complete set of shares is much smaller than this see
 docs augur net/#number of ticks for details 
 3
 closing out existing complete sets Augur s matching en 
 gine always sequesters the minimum amount of shares
 and/or cash needed to cover the value at risk If there is
 no matching order or the request can be only partially
 filled the remainder is placed on the order book as a new
 order 
 Orders are never executed at a worse price than the
 limit price set by the trader but may be executed at a
 better price Unfilled and partially filled orders can be
 removed from the order book by the order s creator at
 any time Fees are paid by traders only when complete
 sets of shares are sold settlement fees are discussed in
 more detail in Section I D 
 While most trading of shares is expected to happen
 before market settlement shares can be traded any time
 after market creation All Augur assets { including shares
 in market outcomes participation tokens shares in dis 
 pute bonds and even ownership of the markets them 
 selves { are transferable at all times In practice all of
 these assets take the form of ERC777 tokens 
 C Reporting
 Once a market s underlying event occurs the outcome
 must be determined in order for the market to finalize
 and begin settlement Outcomes are determined by Au 
 gur s oracle which consists of profit motivated reporters 
 who simply report the actual real world outcome of the
 event Anyone who owns REP may participate in the re 
 porting and disputing of outcomes Reporters whose re 
 ports are consistent with objective reality are financially
 rewarded while those whose reports are not consistent
 with objective reality are financially penalized (see Sec 
 tion ID2) 
 1 Fee Windows
 Augur s reporting system runs on a cycle of consecu 
 tive 7 day long fee windows All fees collected by Augur
 during a given fee window are added to the reporting fee
 pool for that fee window At the end of the fee window 
 the reporting fee pool is paid out to REP holders who
 participated in the reporting process Reporters receive
 rewards in proportion to the amount of REP they staked
 during that fee window Participation includes staking
 during an initial report disputing a tentative outcome 
 or purchasing participation tokens 
 2 Participation Tokens
 During any fee window REP holders may purchase any
 number of participation tokens8 for one attorep9 each 
 At the end of the fee window they may redeem their
 participation tokens for one attorep each in addition to
 a proportional share of the fee window s reporting fee
 pool If there were no actions (e g submitting a report or
 disputing a report submitted by another user) needed of a
 reporter the reporter may purchase participation tokens
 to indicate that they showed up for the fee window Just
 like staked REP participation tokens may be redeemed
 by their owners for a pro rata portion of fees in this fee
 window 
 Participation tokens are primarily the means by which
 Augur pays fees to repholders but they may also serve
 as an additional incentive for repholders to monitor the
 platform at least once per week Even REP holders who
 do not want to participate in the reporting process may
 be incentivized to check in with Augur once per 7 day fee
 window in order to buy participation tokens and collect
 fees This regular active checking in will ensure that
 they are familiar with how to use Augur will be aware
 of forks when they occur and thus should be more ready
 to participate in forks when they happen 
 3 Market State Progression
 Augur markets can be in seven dierent states after
 creation The potential states or \phases of an Augur
 market are as follows 
 • Pre reporting
 • Designated Reporting
 • Open Reporting
 • Dispute Round
 • Waiting for the Next Fee Window to Begin
 • Fork
 • Finalized
 The relationship between these states can be seen in
 Fig 2 
 4 Pre reporting
 The pre reporting or trading phase (Fig 1) is the time
 period that begins after trading has begun in the market 
 8Participation tokens are ERC777 tokens on the Ethereum network 
 9One attorep is 10􀀀18 REP 
 4
 Figure 2 Reporting 
 owchart 
 but before the market s event has come to pass Gener 
 ally this is the most active trading period for any given
 Augur market Once the event end date has passed the
 market enters the designated reporting phase (Fig 2a) 
 5 Designated Reporting
 When creating a market market creators are required
 to choose a designated reporter and post a creator bond 
 During the designated reporting phase (Fig 2a) the mar 
 ket s designated reporter has up to 24 hours to report on
 the outcome of the event If the designated reporter fails
 to report within the allotted 24 hours the market creator
 forfeits the creator bond and the market automatically
 enters the open reporting phase (Fig 2b) 
 If the designated reporter submits a report on time
 then the creator bond is placed as stake on the reported
 outcome which will be forfeited if the market finalizes to
 any outcome other than the one they reported 10 As soon
 as the designated reporter submits its report the market
 enters the dipsute round phase (Fig 2c) and the reported
 outcome becomes the market s tentative outcome 
 6 Open Reporting
 If the designated reporter fails to report within the al 
 lotted 24 hours the market creator forfeits the creator
 bond and the market immediately enters the open re 
 porting phase (Fig 2b) As soon as the market enters
 the open reporting phase anyone can report the out 
 come of the market When the designated reporter fails
 10Forfeited stake is added to the reporting fee pool of the market s
 assigned fee window and is used to reward honest reporters and
 disputers see Section ID2 for details 
 5
 to report the first reporter who reports on the outcome
 of a market is called the market s first public reporter 
 The market s first public reporter receives the forfeited
 creator bond in the form of stake on their chosen out 
 come so they may claim the no show bond only if their
 reported outcome agrees with the market s final outcome 
 The first public reporter does not need to stake any of
 their own REP when reporting the outcome of the mar 
 ket In this way any market whose designated reporter
 fails to report is expected to have its outcome reported
 by someone very soon after entering the open reporting
 phase 
 Once an initial report has been received by the ini 
 tial reporter (whether it was the designated reporter or
 first public reporter) the reported outcome becomes the
 market s tentative outcome and the market enters the
 dispute round phase (Fig 2c) 
 7 Dispute Round
 The dispute round (Fig 2d) is a phase during which
 any REP holder has the opportunity to dispute the mar 
 ket s tentative outcome A dispute round may last up
 to 7 days (with the exception of the very first dispute
 round which may last up to 24 hours) At the begin 
 ning of a dispute round a market s tentative outcome
 is the outcome that will become the market s final out 
 come if it is not successfully disputed by REP holders 
 A dispute consists of staking REP (referred to as dispute
 stake in this context) on an outcome other than the mar 
 ket s current tentative outcome A dispute is successful if
 the total amount of dispute stake on some outcome meets
 the dispute bond size required for the current round The
 dispute bond size is computed as follows 
 Let An denote the total stake over all of this market s
 outcomes at the beginning of dispute round n Let 
 be any market outcome other than the market s tenta 
 tive outcome at the beginning of this dispute round Let
 S( n) denote the total amount of stake on outcome 
 at the beginning of dispute round n Then the size of the
 dispute bond needed to successfully dispute the current
 tentative outcome in favor of the new outcome during
 round n is denoted B( n) and is given by 
 B( n) = 2An 􀀀 3S( n) (1)
 The bond sizes are chosen this way to ensure a fixed
 ROI for reporters who successfully dispute false outcomes
 (see Section II D) 
 The dispute bonds need not be paid in their entirety
 by a single user The Augur platform allows participants
 to crowdsource dispute bonds Any user who sees an in 
 correct tentative outcome can dispute that outcome by
 staking REP on an outcome other than the tentative out 
 come If any outcome (other than the tentative outcome)
 accumulates enough dispute stake to fill its dispute bond 
 the current tentative outcome will be successfully dis 
 puted 
 In the case of a successful dispute One of three things
 will happen the market will either undergo another
 dispute round immediately the market will wait until
 the next fee window to begin before undergoing another
 dispute round or the market will enter the fork state
 (Fig 2e) If the size of the filled dispute bond is greater
 than 2 5% of all REP then the market will enter the
 fork state If the size of the filled dispute bond is less
 than 2 5% of all REP but greater than 0 02% of all REP 
 then the newly chosen outcome becomes the market s
 new tentative outcome and the market enters the wait 
 ing for next fee window to begin phase (Fig 2d) If the
 size of the filled dispute bond is less than 0 02% of all
 REP then the newly chosen outcome becomes the mar 
 ket s new tentative outcome and the market immediately
 enters another dispute round 
 All dispute stake is held in escrow during the dispute
 round If a dispute bond is unsuccessful then the dispute
 stake is returned to its owners at the end of the dispute
 round If no dispute is successful for 7 days during the
 dispute round then the market enters the finalized state
 (Fig 2f) and its tentative outcome is accepted as its
 final outcome A market s final outcome is the tentative
 outcome that passes through a dispute round without
 being successfully disputed or is determined via a fork 
 Augur s contracts treat final outcomes as truth and pay
 out accordingly 
 All unsuccessful dispute stake is returned to the origi 
 nal owners at the end of every dispute round All success 
 ful dispute stake is applied to the outcome it championed 
 and remains there until the market is finalized (or until
 a fork occurs in some other Augur market) All dispute
 stake (whether successful or unsuccessful) will receive a
 portion of the reporting fee pool 11 from the current fee
 window 
 8 Waiting for Next Fee Window to Begin
 If a market s tentative outcome is disputed with a bond
 greater than 0 02% of all REP but less than 2 5% of all
 REP then the market enters the waiting for next fee
 window to begin phase (Fig 2c) before undergoing an 
 other dispute round The purpose of this is simply to
 slow down the dispute process as the bonds get larger {
 giving honest participants more time to crowdfund the
 larger dispute bond This reduces the risk of a critical
 failure mode one where the oracle resolves incorrectly
 because honest participants didn t have time to raise the
 funds needed to dispute a false tentative outcome 
 During this phase reporting for the market is on hold
 until end of the current fee window Once the next
 11Any reporting fees and validity bonds collected during a fee window
 get added to that fee window s reporting fee pool At the end of the
 fee window the reporting fee pool is paid out to users in proportion
 to the amount of REP they staked during that fee window 
 6
 fee window begins the market enters the dispute round
 phase 
 9 Fork
 The fork state (Fig 2e) is a special state that lasts up
 to 60 days Forking is the market resolution method of
 last resort it is a very disruptive process and is intended
 to be a rare occurrence A fork is caused when there is a
 market with an outcome with a successfully filled dispute
 bond of at least 2 5% of all REP This market is referred
 to as the forking market 
 When a fork is initiated a 60 day12 forking period be 
 gins Disputing for all other non finalized markets is put
 on hold until the end of this forking period The forking
 period is much longer than the usual fee window because
 the platform needs to provide ample time for REP hold 
 ers and service providers (such as wallets and exchanges)
 to prepare A fork s final outcome cannot be disputed 
 Every Augur market and all REP tokens exist in some
 universe REP tokens can be used to report on outcomes
 (and thus earn fees) only for markets that exist in the
 same universe as the REP tokens When Augur first
 launches all markets and all REP will exist together in
 the genesis universe 
 When a market forks new universes are created Fork 
 ing creates a new child universe for each possible outcome
 of the forking market (including Invalid For example a
 \Yes/No market has 3 possible outcomes Yes No and
 Invalid Thus a \Yes/No forking market will create
 three new child universes universe Yes universe No and
 universe Invalid Initially these newly created universes
 are empty they contain no markets or REP tokens 
 When a fork is initiated the parent universe becomes
 permanently locked In a locked universe no new mar 
 kets may be created Users may continue trading shares
 in markets in locked universes and markets in a locked
 universe may still receive their initial reports However 
 no reporting rewards are paid out there and markets in
 locked universes cannot be finalized In order for markets
 or REP tokens in the locked universe to be useful they
 must first be migrated to a child universe 
 During the forking period holders of REP tokens in
 the parent universe may migrate their tokens to a child
 universe of their choice This choice should be considered
 carefully because migration is one way it cannot be re 
 versed Tokens cannot be sent from one sibling universe
 to another Migration is a permanent commitment of
 REP tokens to a particular outcome of the forking mar 
 ket REP tokens that migrate to dierent child universes
 ought to be considered entirely separate tokens and ser 
 12Forking periods can be less than 60 days a forking period ends
 when either 60 days have passed or more than 50% of all genesis
 REP is migrated to some child universe 
 vice providers like wallets and exchanges ought to list
 them as such 
 Any REP tokens that have not been migrated out of
 the parent universe when the forking period ends will be
 permanently locked in the parent universe Such tokens
 are expected to lose all value so it is of paramount im 
 portance that repholders migrate their tokens anytime a
 fork happens 
 When a fork is initiated all REP staked on all non 
 forking markets is unstaked so that it is free to be mi 
 grated to a child universe during the forking period 13
 Whichever child universe receives the most migrated
 REP by the end of the forking period becomes the win 
 ning universe and its corresponding outcome becomes
 the final outcome of the forking market Un finalized
 markets in the parent universe may be migrated only to
 the winning universe and if they have received an initial
 report are reset back to the waiting for next fee window 
 to begin phase 
 Reporters that have staked REP on one of the forking
 market s outcomes cannot change their position during a
 fork REP that was staked on a forking market s out 
 come in the parent universe can be migrated only to the
 child universe that corresponds to that outcome For
 example if a reporter helped fulfill a successful dispute
 bond in favor of outcome A during some dispute round 
 then the REP they have staked on outcome A can only
 be migrated to universe A during a fork 
 Sibling universes are entirely disjoint REP tokens
 that exist in one universe cannot be used to report on
 events or earn rewards from markets in another universe 
 Since users presumably will not want to create or trade on
 markets in a universe whose oracle is untrustworthy REP
 that exists in a universe that does not correspond to ob 
 jective reality is unlikely to earn its owner any fees and
 therefore should not hold any significant market value 
 Therefore REP tokens migrated to a universe which does
 not correspond to objective reality should hold no mar 
 ket value regardless of whether or not the objectively
 false universe ends up being the winning universe after
 a fork This has important security consequences which
 we discuss in Section II 
 10 Finalized
 A market enters the finalized state (Fig 2f) if it passes
 through a 7 day dispute round without having its tenta 
 tive outcome successfully disputed or after completion of
 a fork The outcome of a fork cannot be disputed and is
 always considered final at the end of the forking period 
 13The only exception is the REP staked by the initial reporter when
 they made the initial report That REP remains staked on the
 initial reported outcome and is automatically migrated to the child
 universe that wins the fork This happens for technical reasons
 unrelated to the mechanism design 
 7
 Once a market is finalized traders can settle their po 
 sitions directly with the market When a market enters
 the finalized state we refer to its chosen outcome as the
 final outcome 
 D Market Settlement
 A trader can close their position in one of two ways by
 selling the shares they hold to another trader in exchange
 for currency or by settling their shares with the market 
 Recall that every share comes into existence as part of
 a complete set when a total of 1 DAI has been escrowed
 with Augur 7 To get that 1 DAI out of escrow traders
 must give Augur either a complete set or if the market
 has finalized a share of the winning outcome When this
 exchange happens we say traders are settling with the
 market contract 
 For example consider a non finalized market with pos 
 sible outcomes A and B Suppose Alice has a share of out 
 come A that she wants to sell for 0 7 DAI and Bob has
 a share of outcome B that he wants to sell for 0 3 DAI 
 First Augur matches these orders and collects the A and
 B shares from the participants Then Augur gives 0 7
 DAI (minus fees) to Alice and 0 3 DAI (minus fees) to
 Bob 
 As a second example consider a finalized market whose
 winning outcome is A Alice has a share of A and wants
 to cash it in She sends her share of A to Augur and in
 return receives 1 DAI (minus fees) 
 1 Settlement Fees
 The only time Augur levies fees is when market par 
 ticipants are settling with the market contract Augur
 levies two fees during settlement the creator fee and
 the reporting fee Both of these fees are proportional to
 the amount being paid out So in the pre finalized set 
 tlement example above where Alice receives 0 7 DAI and
 Bob receives 0 3 DAI Alice would pay 70% of the fees
 while Bob would pay 30% 
 The creator fee is set by the market creator during
 market creation and is paid to the market creator upon
 settlement The reporting fee is set dynamically (see Sec 
 tion II C) and is paid to reporters who participate in the
 reporting process 
 2 Reputation Redistribution
 If a market finalizes without initiating a fork all REP
 staked on any outcome other than the market s final out 
 come is forfeited Twenty percent of the forfeited stake
 is burned and the remainder is distributed to the users
 who staked on the market s final outcome in proportion
 to the amount of REP they staked The dispute bond
 sizes and the amount burned are chosen such that any 
 one who successfully disputes an outcome in favor of the
 market s final outcome is rewarded with a 40% ROI on
 their dispute stake 14 This is a strong incentive for re 
 porters to dispute false tentative outcomes 
 II INCENTIVES AND SECURITY
 There is a strong relationship between the market cap
 of REP and the trustworthiness of Augur s forking proto 
 col If the market cap of REP is large enough15 and at 
 tackers are economically rational then the outcome that
 wins the fork should correspond to objective reality In
 fact it would be possible for Augur to function properly
 without using designated reporters and dispute rounds 
 Using only the forking process the oracle would report
 truthfully 
 However forks are disruptive and time consuming A
 fork takes up to 60 days to resolve a single market and
 can resolve only one market at a time During the 60
 days in which the forking market is being resolved all
 other non finalized markets are put on hold 16 Service
 providers have to update and REP holders have to mi 
 grate their REP to one of the new child universes There 
 fore forks should be used only when they are absolutely
 necessary Forking is the nuclear option 
 Fortunately once it has been established that forks can
 be trusted to determine truth incentives can be used to
 encourage participants to behave honestly without hav 
 ing to actually initiate a fork It is the credible threat of
 a fork and the belief that the fork will resolve correctly 
 that are the cornerstones of Augur s incentive system 
 Next we discuss the conditions under which the fork 
 ing system can be trusted to determine truth We then
 discuss the incentive system and how it encourages quick
 and correct resolution of all markets 
 A Integrity of the Forking Protocol
 Here we discuss the reliability of the forking process
 and the conditions under which it can be trusted For
 ease of discussion when referring to forks we will refer
 to the child universe that corresponds to objective reality
 as the True universe and any other child universe as a
 False universe We will refer to the child universe which
 receives the most REP migration during the forking pe 
 riod as the winning universe and all other child universes
 as losing universes 
 Naturally we always want the True universe to be the
 winning universe and the False universes to be the losing
 14See Theorem 3 in Appendix A 
 15See Section IIA for details 
 16Traders can continue trading on those markets but those markets
 cannot finalize until after the forking period 
 8
 universes We say that the forking protocol has been suc 
 cessfully attacked whenever a False universe ends up be 
 ing the winning universe of a fork { thus resulting in the
 forking market (and potentially all non finalized mar 
 kets) being paid out incorrectly 
 Our approach to securing the oracle is to arrange mat 
 ters such that the maximum benefit to a successful at 
 tacker is less than the minimum cost of performing the
 attack We formalize this below 
 1 Maximum Benefit to an Attacker
 An attacker who successfully attacks the oracle would
 cause all non finalized Augur markets to migrate to a
 False universe If the attacker controls the majority of
 REP in the False universe the attacker can then force all
 non finalized markets to resolve however she wants In
 the most extreme case she would also be able to capture
 all funds escrowed in all of those markets 17
 Definition 1 We define and denote by Ia Augur s na 
 tive open interest as the value of the sum of all funds
 escrowed in unfinalized Augur markets 18
 Definition 2 We define a parasitic market as any mar 
 ket that does not pay reporting fees to Augur but does
 resolve in accordance with the resolution of a native Au 
 gur market 
 Definition 3 We define and denote by Ip the parasitic
 open interest as the value of the sum of all funds escrowed
 in all parasitic markets that resolve in accordance to non 
 finalized native Augur markets 
 In the most extreme case an attacker would also be
 able to capture all funds in all parasitic markets which
 resolve in accordance to non finalized native Augur mar 
 kets 
 Observation 1 The maximum (gross) benefit to an at 
 tacker who successfully attacks the oracle is Ia + Ip 
 2 Parasitic Open Interest is Unknowable
 Augur can accurately and eciently measure Ia How 
 ever Ip cannot be known in general as there may exist
 arbitrarily many oine parasitic markets each with arbi 
 trarily large open interest Since the maximum possible
 benefit to an attacker includes the unknowable quantity
 Ip one can never be objectively certain that the oracle
 is secure against economically rational attackers 19
 However if we are willing to assert that Ip is reason 
 ably bounded in practice then we can define conditions
 under which we may assert that the oracle is secure 
 17This would require the attacker to capture all shares of some given
 outcome and then force the market to finalize to that outcome 
 18This includes external markets that pay reporting fees to Augur 
 19This is true of all public oracles even centralized ones 
 3 Minimum Cost of a Successful Attack
 Next consider the cost of attacking the oracle Let
 P denote the price of REP Let  denote one attorep20 
 Let M denote the total amount of REP in existence (the
 \money supply of REP) Let S denote the proportion
 of M that will be migrated to the True universe during
 the forking period of a fork 
 Thus the product SM represents the absolute amount
 of REP migrated to the True universe during the forking
 period of a fork and the product PM is the market cap
 of REP 
 Let Pf denote the price of REP migrated to a False
 universe of the attacker s choosing Note that if P  Pf
 then the oracle would not be secure against economically
 rational attackers because it would be at least as prof 
 itable to migrate REP to the False universe as it would
 be to not migrate at all 
 4 Integrity
 Assumption 1 Reporters that are not attackers will
 never migrate REP to a False universe during a fork 21
 By design a successful attack on the oracle requires
 more REP to be migrated to some False universe than
 to the True universe during the forking period of a fork 
 By assumption only the attacker will migrate REP to
 a False universe The amount of REP migrated to the
 True universe during the forking period is denoted by
 SM Thus for an attacker to be successful they must
 migrate at least SM +  REP For simplicity we will
 ignore the negligible  and say that a successful attack
 requires migrating at least SM REP which has a value
 of SMP before the migration to some False universe 
 If an attacker migrates SM REP during the forking
 period of a fork they will receive SM REP on the child
 universe to which they migrate If the attacker migrates
 to a False universe then the value of those coins becomes
 SMPf Thus the minimum cost to the attacker is (P 􀀀
 Pf )SM 
 Observation 2 The minimum amount of REP a suc 
 cessful attacker must migrate to a False universe during
 a fork is SM which costs the attacker (P 􀀀 Pf )SM 
 Note that if S > 1
 2 then an attack is impossible because
 there does not exist enough REP outside of the True
 universe for any False universe to become the winning
 universe 
 20One attorep is 10􀀀18 REP 
 21There may be cases where some non malicious reporters do migrate
 REP to a False universe accidentally or carelessly However such
 behavior is in practice indistinguishable from collaborating with
 an attacker 
 9
 Pitted against economically rational attackers the or 
 acle will resolve to outcomes that correspond to objec 
 tive reality if the maximum benefit to an attacker is less
 than the minimum cost of attack By observations 1
 & 2 we can see that this occurs whenever S > 1
 2 or
 Ia + Ip < (P 􀀀 Pf )SM This gives us our formal def 
 inition of integrity 
 Definition 4 (Integrity Property) The forking protocol
 has integrity whenever S > 1
 2 or whenever Ia + Ip <
 (P 􀀀 Pf )SM 
 The above inequality can be solved for PM to see the
 relationship between forking protocol integrity and the
 market cap of REP 
 Theorem 1 (Market Cap Security Theorem) The fork 
 ing protocol has integrity if and only if 
 1 S > 1
 2 or
 2 Pf < P and the market cap of REP is greater than
 (Ia+Ip)P
 (P􀀀Pf )S 
 Proof Suppose the forking protocol has integrity Then 
 by definition S > 1
 2 or Ia + Ip < (P 􀀀 Pf )SM Suppose
 Ia+Ip < (P 􀀀Pf )SM Since Ia+Ip  0 and SM > 0 we
 know that Pf < P Then solving Ia+Ip < (P 􀀀Pf )SM
 for PM we see that (Ia+Ip)P
 (P􀀀Pf )S < PM Thus the first
 direction is proved 
 Now suppose that S > 1
 2 or that Pf < P and
 (Ia+Ip)P
 (P􀀀Pf )S < PM If S > 1
 2 then the forking protocol has
 integrity by definition If Pf < P and (Ia+Ip)P
 (P􀀀Pf )S < PM 
 then solving the inequality for Ia + Ip we see that
 Ia + Ip < (P 􀀀 Pf )SM and the forking protocol has
 integrity 
 B Our Assumptions and Their Consequences
 We believe traders will not want to trade on Augur in a
 universe where reporters have lied We also believe that
 market creators will not pay to create Augur markets
 in a universe where there are no traders In a universe
 without markets or trading REP does not provide any
 dividends to those holding it Therefore we believe REP
 sent to a False universe will hold no non negligible mar 
 ket value and we model this by letting Pf = 0 
 An attacker should never migrate more than 50% of all
 REP (plus on attorep) to a false universe22 We believe
 that approximately all REP will be migrated out of the
 parent universe during a forking period because failure
 to do so is expected to result in loss of token value for
 no benefit Therefore we think it is reasonable to expect
 22Doing so unnecessarily increases the cost of attack 
 at least 50% of REP (minus one attorep) to be migrated
 to the True outcome during the forking period of a fork 
 and we model this by letting S  1
 2 We are also willing
 to accommodate parasitic open interest as large as 50%
 of the native open interest and so we let Ia  2Ip 
 Under these assumptions Theorem 1 tells us that the
 forking protocol has integrity whenever the market cap
 of REP is at least 3 times the native open interest 
 C Market Cap Nudges
 Augur gets information about the price of REP via
 a collection of trusted third party price oracles23 This
 gives Augur the ability to compute the current market
 cap of REP Augur can also measure the current native
 open interest and can thus determine what market cap
 ought to be targeted in order to meet Augur s integrity
 requirements 
 Every universe begins with a default reporting fee of
 1% If the current market cap is below the target then
 reporting fees are automatically increased (but will never
 be higher than 33 3%) putting upward pressure on the
 price of REP and/or downward pressure on new native
 open interest If the current market cap is above the
 target then reporting fees are automatically decreased
 (but will never be lower than 0 01%) so that traders are
 not paying more than needed to keep the system secure 
 The reporting fees are determined as follows Let r be
 the reporting fee from the previous window let t be the
 target market cap and let c be the current market cap 
 Then the reporting fee for the current fee window is given

 D Leveraging the Threat of a Fork
 As mentioned above forks are a disruptive and slow
 way for markets to reach finalization Rather than using
 the forking process to resolve every market Augur lever 
 ages the threat of a fork to resolve markets eciently 
 Recall that any stake successfully disputing an out 
 come in favor of the market s final outcome will receive
 a 40% ROI on their dispute stake 24 In the event of a
 fork any REP staked on any of the market s false out 
 comes should lose all economic value while any REP
 staked on the market s true outcome is rewarded with
 40% more REP in the child universe that corresponds
 to the market s true outcome (regardless of the outcome
 of the fork) Therefore if pushed to a fork REP holders
 who dispute false outcomes in favor of true outcomes will
 23In the future Augur may be able to learn the price of REP without
 having to trust third parties This is an active area of research 
 24Measured in REP that exists in a universe that corresponds to the
 market s final outcome see Theorem 3 in Appendix A 
 10
 always come out ahead while REP holders who staked
 on false outcomes will see their REP lose all economic
 value 
 We believe this situation is sucient to guarantee that
 all false tentative outcomes will be successfully disputed 
 III POTENTIAL ISSUES & RISKS
 A Parasitic Markets
 Recall that a parasitic market is any market that does
 not pay reporting fees to Augur but does resolve in ac 
 cordance with the resolution of a native Augur market 
 Because parasitic markets do not have any reporters to
 pay they can oer the same service as Augur with lower
 fees This can have serious consequences for the integrity
 of Augur s forking protocol 
 In particular if parasitic markets attract trading inter 
 est away from Augur then Augur s reporters will receive
 less in reporting fees This would put downward pressure
 on the market cap of REP If the market cap of REP
 falls too low the integrity of the forking protocol is put
 in jeopardy (Theorem 1) As a result parasitic markets
 have the potential to threaten the long term viability of
 Augur and should be vehemently opposed 
 The oracle parasite problem has not been solved { and
 may be provably unsolvable { even for centralized sys 
 tems That said at the time of this writing we have
 observed no significant parasitic interest leveraging Au 
 gur s oracle 
 B Volatility of Open Interest
 Large sudden unexpected and short lived increases
 in open interest { like those that may be seen during
 a popular sporting event { result in rapid increases in
 the market cap requirement for forking protocol integrity
 (Theorem 1) When the market cap requirement exceeds
 the market cap there is a risk of economically rational
 attackers causing a fork to resolve incorrectly While Au 
 gur does attempt to nudge the market cap and/or the
 open interest back into a safe ratio during such situa 
 tions (see Section II C) these nudges are reactionary and
 are adjusted only once per 7 day fee window 
 It is worth noting however that speculators who wit 
 ness the sudden increase in open interest may buy REP
 in anticipation of the reactionary market cap nudge thus
 driving the market cap of REP up perhaps to a point
 where the integrity of the forking protocol is no longer
 threatened So the length of time during which the ora 
 cle is vulnerable may not be long enough for an attacker
 to successfully exploit the vulnerability 
 Additionally we have increased the security multiplier
 from the theoretical minimum of 325 to a more com 
 fortable value of 5 This means that the fee adjustment
 algorithm targets a market cap of 5 times the native open
 interest rather than 3 times This should help us absorb
 large (up to a 66 6% increase) sudden unexpected and
 short lived increases in open interest without threatening
 oracle integrity 
 C Inconsistent or Malicious Resolution Sources
 During market creation market creators chose a reso 
 lution source that reporters should use to determine the
 outcome of the event in question If the market creator
 chooses an inconsistent or malicious resolution source 
 honest reporters may lose money 
 For example suppose the market in question has out 
 comes A and B and the market creator Serena has cho 
 sen her own website attacker com as the resolution
 source After the market s event end time Serena { who
 is also the designated reporter for the market { reports
 outcome A and updates attacker com to indicate that
 outcome B is the correct outcome Honest reporters who
 check attacker com will see that the initial report is in 
 correct and during the first dispute round should suc 
 cessfully dispute the tentative outcome in favor of out 
 come B Serena would update attacker com to indicate
 that outcome A is the correct outcome and the market
 would then enter its second dispute round Again re 
 porters who check attacker com will see that the tenta 
 tive outcome (outcome B) is incorrect and may success 
 fully dispute it Serena can repeat this behavior until
 the market resolves No matter how the market resolves 
 some honest reporters will lose money 
 D Self Referential Oracle Queries
 Markets that trade on the future behavior of Augur s
 oracle may have undesirable eects on the behavior of
 the oracle itself [11] For example consider a market that
 trades on the question \Will any designated reporter fail
 to submit a report during their three day forking period
 before December 31 2018 Bets placed on the No out 
 come of this market may act as a perverse incentive for
 designated reporters to intentionally fail to report If a
 designated reporter can buy up enough Yes shares at a
 low enough price to compensate for the loss of the creator
 bond they may intentionally fail to report 
 If the market cap of REP is large enough (Theorem 1)
 then these self referential oracle queries will not threaten
 the integrity of the forking protocol However they may
 25The theoretical minimum for the security multiplier is 2 when not
 accounting for any parasitic interest When account for parasitic
 interest of up to 50% of the native open interest the theoretical
 minimum for the security multiplier is 3 
 11
 negatively aect the performance of Augur by causing
 delays in market finalizations While markets would still
 finalize correctly this sort of behavior is disruptive and
 undesirable 
 E Uncertain Fork Participation
 We cannot know in advance how much REP will be
 migrated to the True universe during the forking period
 of a fork thus we cannot know in advance whether the
 market cap is large enough for the oracle to have integrity
 (Theorem 1) Our belief in the integrity of the forking
 protocol can be no stronger than our belief in our as 
 sumption that users will behave rationally and in their
 own economic self interest We assume that at least 50%
 (minus one attorep) of all REP will migrate to the True
 child universe during the forking period of a fork because
 that is consistent with self interested rational decision
 making on the behalf of the participants However we
 cannot guarantee this will happen 
 F Responsibility During a Fork
 Augur forks dier from blockchain forks in one impor 
 tant respect after a blockchain fork a user who owned
 a coin on the parent chain will now own a coin on both
 forks Ignoring replay attacks blockchain forks pose lit 
 tle risk to users During an Augur fork however a user
 who owns a REP token in the parent universe can mi 
 grate that coin to only one of the child universes If the
 user migrates their token to any universe other than the
 consensus universe their token may lose all value Thus
 migrating REP during the forking period of a fork before
 it is clear which child universe has achieved consensus 
 exposes the user to risk 
 This risk is an inherent part of REP ownership Ab 
 staining from migration during a fork will result in near 
 certain loss of value for the repholder This is a necessary
 design decision as the integrity of the oracle relies upon
 repholders reporting truthfully during the fork Rephold 
 ers cannot be absolved of this responsibility without
 greatly increasing the cost of system security 
 G Ambiguous or Subjective Markets
 Only events that have objectively knowable outcomes
 are suitable for use in Augur markets If reporters be 
 lieve that a market is not suitable for resolution by the
 platform { for example because it is ambiguous subjec 
 tive or the outcome is not known by the event end date
 { they should report the market as Invalid If a market
 resolves as Invalid traders are paid out at equal values
 for all possible outcomes for scalar markets traders are
 paid out halfway between the market s minimum price
 and maximum price 
 It is possible to imagine markets where some reporters
 are certain that the outcome is A and others are cer 
 tain that the outcome is B For example in 2006 Trade 
 Sports allowed its users to speculate on whether North
 Korea would fire a ballistic missile that would land out 
 side of its airspace before the end of July 2006 On July
 5 2006 North Korea successfully fired a ballistic missile
 that landed outside of its airspace and the event was
 widely reported by the world media and confirmed by
 many U S government sources However the U S De 
 partment of Defense had not confirmed the event as
 was required by TradeSports contract TradeSports con 
 cluded that the contract s conditions had not been met 
 and paid out accordingly 26
 This is a case where the spirit of the market { to predict
 the missile launch { was clearly satisfied but the letter
 of the market { to predict whether the U S Department
 of Defense would confirm the launch { was not Trade 
 Sports being a centralized website was able to unilater 
 ally declare the outcome of the market If such a situa 
 tion arises in an Augur market REP holders may have
 diering opinions about how the market should resolve 
 and stake their REP accordingly In the worst case this
 could result in a fork where REP in more than one child
 universe maintains a non zero market value

 Appendix A Finalization Time & Redistribution
 We begin with some notation definitions and obser 
 vations 
 Definition 5 For a given market M let 
 M be the
 outcome space (or set of outcomes) of M 
 Definition 6 For n  1 and 2 
 M let S( n) denote
 the total amount of stake on outcome at the begin 
 ning of dispute round n This includes all stake from all
 successful dispute bonds in favor of over all previous
 dispute rounds 
 Definition 7 For n  1 and 2 
 M let S( n) denote
 the amount of stake on all outcomes in 
 M except for 
 at the beginning of dispute round n 
 S( n) =
 X
 
 2
 M
 
 6= 
 S(
 n)
 Definition 8 For n  1 let An denote the total stake
 over all outcomes M at the beginning of dispute round
 n 
 An =
 X
 2
 M
 S( n)
 Observation 3 It follows that An 􀀀S( n) = S( n) 
 Definition 9 For n  1 let ^ n denote the tentative out 
 come at the beginning of dispute round n For example 
 ^ 1 is the outcome reported by the initial reporter 
 Definition 10 For n  1 and 6= ^ n let B( n)
 denote the amount of stake required to successfully fill a
 dispute bond in favor of outcome during dispute round
 n 
 Recall that the amount of stake required to successfully
 fill a dispute bond in favor of outcome during dispute
 round n where 6= ^ n is given by Eq 1 B( n) =
 2An 􀀀 3S( n) 
 Observation 4 If a dispute bond is successfully filled in
 favor of outcome during dispute round n then S( n+
 1) = B( n) + S( n) That is the successful dispute
 stake is the only new stake applied to outcome at the
 end of dispute round n 
 Observation 5 For all 6= ^ n S( n 􀀀 1) = S( n) 
 That is if a dispute bond is not entirely filled in favor of
 outcome then no additional stake is added to outcome
 at the beginning of the next dispute round This is due
 to the fact that all unsuccessful dispute stake is returned
 to the users at the end of the dispute round 
 Observation 6 For all n  2 An = An􀀀1 + B(^ n n 􀀀
 1) That is the total stake over all outcomes at the
 beginning of a dispute round is simply the total stake
 from the beginning of the previous dispute round plus
 the successful dispute stake from the previous dispute
 round All other stake is returned to users at the end of
 the previous dispute round 
 Lemma 2 S(^ n n) = 2S(^ n n) for n  2 
 Proof Suppose a market enters dispute round n where
 n  2 During dispute round n 􀀀 1 the outcome ^ n􀀀1
 must have been successfully disputed in favor of outcome
 ^ n According to Eq 1 the size of that dispute bond is
 B(^ n n􀀀1) = 2An􀀀1􀀀3S(^ n n􀀀1) Using observation
 3 this can be rewritten as
 B(^ n n 􀀀 1) + S(^ n n 􀀀 1) = 2S(^ n n 􀀀 1) (A1)
 We know the dispute bond was successfully filled dur 
 ing round n 􀀀 1 Using observation 4 we see that
 B(^ n n 􀀀 1) + S(^ n n 􀀀 1) = S(^ n n) Observation 5
 tells us that the total amount staked on ^ n is unchanged
 from round n􀀀1 to n 2S(^ n n􀀀1) = 2S(^ n n) Thus 
 Eq A1 reduces to S(^ n n) = 2S(^ n n) 
 Theorem 3 Any REP holders successfully disputing an
 outcome in favor of a market s final outcome will receive
 a 40% ROI on their dispute stake (measured in REP that
 exists in a universe that corresponds to the market s final
 outcome) unless the market is interrupted by some other
 market causing a fork 
 Proof During a fork all users who successfully filled dis 
 pute bonds in favor of the forking market s final outcome
 are given (via coins minted during the fork) a 40% return
 on their dispute stake when they migrate their dispute
 stake to the corresponding child universe Thus in the
 case where the market in question has caused a fork the
 theorem is immediately true 
 Now consider the case where the market in question
 resolves without causing a fork and reporting is not in 
 terrupted by some other market causing a fork 
 Denote the market s final outcome by Final and sup 
 pose the market resolves at the end of dispute round
 n where n  2 That means the tentative outcome
 for round n is Final and that outcome is not success 
 fully disputed during round n In other words ^ n =
 Final Then by Lemma 2 we know that S( Final n) =
 2S( Final n) 
 Since the market resolves at the end of round n with no
 further stake added to any outcome the above equation
 shows the final amount of stake on the market s final
 outcome Final and the sum of all stake on all of the
 market s other outcomes Final Note that there is ex 
 actly twice as much stake on the market s final outcome
 as there is on all other outcomes combined 
 Augur burns 20% of the all stake on the non final out 
 comes and redistributes the rest to users who staked on
 Final in proportion to the amount of REP they staked 
 Therefore the users who successfully filled a dispute bond
 in favor of Final get a 40% ROI on their staked REP 
 Next consider the maximum number of dispute rounds
 required to resolve a market Eq 1 is minimized when 
 is chosen to be the non tentative outcome that begins the
 dispute round with the greatest amount of stake Lemma
 14
 2 implies that the non tentative outcome with the great 
 est amount of stake is the previous dispute round s ten 
 tative outcome Therefore the smallest possible dispute
 bond size that can be successfully filled during dispute
 round n where n  2 is B(^ n􀀀1 n) 
 In other words the dispute bond size grows slowest
 when the same two outcomes are repeatedly disputed in
 favor of one another It follows that the number of dis 
 pute rounds required for a market to initiate a fork is
 maximized when the same two outcomes are repeatedly
 disputed in favor of one another Therefore we can deter 
 mine the maximum number of dispute rounds that any
 market may undergo before initiating a fork by finding
 the maximum number of dispute rounds that can occur
 in the particular case where the same two market out 
 comes are repeatedly disputed in favor of one another 
 We examine that case now 
 Suppose that every successful dispute bond is filled in
 favor of the previous dispute round s tentative outcome 
 Then the two tentative outcomes that are iteratively dis 
 puted in favor of one another other are ^ 1 and ^ 2 
 Observation 7 In the case where the same two ten 
 tative outcomes are repeatedly disputed in favor of one
 another ^ n = ^ n􀀀2 for all n  3 
 Definition 11 Let d denote the amount of stake placed
 on ^ 1 during the initial report Because the tentative
 outcome for each round is known in this situation we can
 simplify our notation for the dispute bond sizes Define a
 shorthand Bn to denote the bond size required for round
 n so that B1 = 2d and Bn = B(^ n􀀀1 n) for all n  2 
 This will make for easier reading and comprehension 
 Observation 8 In the case where the same two ten 
 tative outcomes are repeatedly disputed in favor of one
 another S(^ n􀀀1 n) = S(^ n􀀀1 n 􀀀 2) + Bn􀀀2 for n  3 
 (That is every other successful dispute bond is added to
 the same outcome )
 Lemma 4 If the same two tentative outcomes are re 
 peatedly disputed in favor of one another then for all n
 where n  3 
 1 S(^ n􀀀1 n) = 2
 3Bn􀀀1
 2 An = 2Bn􀀀1 and
 3 Bn = 3d2n􀀀2
 Proof (By induction on n)
 Suppose the same two tentative outcomes are repeat 
 edly disputed in favor of one another 
 (Base Case) By definition and Eq 1 we make the fol 
 lowing observations 
 • S(^ 1 1) = d S(^ 2 1) = 0 A1 = d and B1 = 2d
 • S(^ 1 2) = d S(^ 2 2) = 2d A2 = 3d and B2 = 3d
 • S(^ 1 3) = 4d S(^ 2 3) = 2d A3 = 6d and B3 =
 6d
 S(^ 3􀀀1 3) = S(^ 2 3) = 2d = 2
 3 (3d) = 2
 3B2 = 2
 3B3􀀀1 
 so part 1 of the lemma holds for n = 3 
 A3 = 6d = 2(3d) = 2B2 = 2B3􀀀1 so part 2 of the
 lemma holds for n = 3 
 B3 = 6d = 3d23􀀀2 so part 3 of the lemma holds for
 n = 3 
 Therefore the lemma in its entirety holds true for the
 base case of n = 3 
 (Induction) Suppose the lemma is true for all n such
 that 3  n  k We want to show that the lemma holds
 for n = k + 1 That is we want to show that 
 (a) S(^ k k + 1) = 2
 3Bk
 (b) Ak+1 = 2Bk and
 (c) Bk+1 = 3d2k􀀀1
 First we prove part (a) By observation 8 
 S(^ k k + 1) = S(^ k k 􀀀 1) + Bk􀀀1
 By observation 7 we can rewrite the above as 
 S(^ k􀀀2 k + 1) = S(^ k􀀀2 k 􀀀 1) + Bk􀀀1
 By the induction hypothesis we can rewrite
 S(^ k􀀀2 k 􀀀 1) as 2
 3Bk􀀀2 on the right hand side to get 
 S(^ k􀀀2 k + 1) = 2
 3Bk􀀀2 + Bk􀀀1
 By the induction hypothesis we can write Bk􀀀2 as
 3d2k􀀀4 and Bk􀀀1 as 3d2k􀀀3 
 S(^ k􀀀2 k + 1) = d2k􀀀1
 Applying observation 7 to the left hand side we get 
 S(^ k k + 1) = d2k􀀀1
 Finally note that by the above equation and the in 
 duction hypothesis S(^ k k+1) = d2k􀀀1 = 2
 3 (3d2k􀀀2) =
 2
 3Bk This proves part (a) 
 Next we prove part (b) By observation 6 
 Ak+1 = Ak + Bk
 By the induction hypothesis Ak = 2Bk􀀀1 
 Ak+1 = 2Bk􀀀1 + Bk
 By the induction hypothesis Bk􀀀1 = 3d2k􀀀3 so the
 right hand side can be simplified to
 Ak+1 = 3d2k􀀀2 + Bk
 By the induction hypothesis Bk = 3d2k􀀀2 to rewrite
 the right hand side as
 Ak+1 = 2Bk 
 15
 and part (b) is proved 
 Finally we prove part (c) By Eq 1 
 Bk+1 = 2Ak+1 􀀀 3S(^ k k + 1)
 By observation 8 we can write S(^ k k+1) as S(^ k k􀀀
 1) + Bk􀀀1 
 Bk+1 = 2Ak+1 􀀀 3 (S(^ k k 􀀀 1) + Bk􀀀1)
 By observation 7 ^ k = ^ k􀀀2 
 Bk+1 = 2Ak+1 􀀀 3 (S(^ k􀀀2 k 􀀀 1) + Bk􀀀1)
 By observation 6 Ak+1 = Ak + Bk 
 Bk+1 = 2 (Ak + Bk) 􀀀 3 (S(^ k􀀀2 k 􀀀 1) + Bk􀀀1)
 By the induction hypothesis Ak = 2Bk􀀀1 and
 S(^ k􀀀2 k 􀀀 1) = 2
 3Bk􀀀2 
 Bk+1 = 2 (2Bk􀀀1 + Bk) 􀀀 3
 􀀀 2
 3Bk􀀀2 + Bk􀀀1
 
 By the induction hypothesis Bk = 3d2k􀀀2 Bk􀀀1 =
 3d2k􀀀3 and Bk􀀀2 = 3d2k􀀀4 Making these substitutions
 and simplifying yields 
 Bk+1 = 3d2k􀀀1
 This proves part (c) and concludes the proof of the
 lemma 
 Theorem 5 If not interrupted by some other market
 causing a fork a given market may undergo at most 20
 dispute rounds before finalizing or causing a fork 
 Proof Suppose that a given market is not interrupted by
 some other market causing a fork Then as shown above 
 we know that the number of dispute rounds required for a
 market to initiate a fork is maximized when the same two
 outcomes are repeatedly disputed in favor of one another 
 Part 3 of Lemma 4 tells us that in this situation the
 dispute bond size required for successfully disputing the
 tentative outcome during round n is given by 3d2n􀀀2 
 where d is the amount of the stake placed during the
 initial report 
 We know that forks are initiated after the successful
 fulfillment of a dispute bond with size at least 2 5% of
 all existing REP and we know that there are 11 million
 REP in existence Thus a fork is initiated when a dispute
 bond of size 275 000 REP is filled We also know that
 d  0 35 REP because the minimum amount of stake on
 the initial report is 0 35 REP27 
 Solving 3(0 35)2n􀀀2 > 275 000 for n 2 Z yields n  20 
 Thus we can guarantee that a market will resolve or
 cause a fork after at most 20 dispute rounds

 Appendix B Bond Size Adjustments
 The validity bond and the creator bond are dynami 
 cally adjusted based on the behavior of participants dur 
 ing the previous fee window The creator bond is the
 maximum of the no show bond and the designated re 
 porter bond { two values that the system tracks in order
 to compute the creator bond but does not expose to users 
 Here we describe how we adjust these bonds 
 We define the function f [0 1] [ 1
 2 2] by 28
 f(x) =
 (
 100
 99 x + 98
 99 for x > 1
 100
 50x + 1
 2 for x  1
 100
 (B1)
 The function f is used to determine the multiple used
 in these adjustments as described in the subsections be 
 low In brief if the undesirable behavior occurred exactly
 1% of the time during the previous fee window then the
 bond size remains the same If it was less frequent then
 the bond size will be reduced by as much as half If it
 was more frequent then the bond size will be increased
 by as much as a factor of 2 
 1 Validity Bond
 During the very first fee window after launch the va 
 lidity bond will be set at 0 01 ETH Then if more than
 1% of the finalized markets in the previous fee window
 were invalid the validity bond will be increased If less
 than 1% of the finalized markets in the previous fee win 
 dow were invalid then the validity bond will be decreased
 (but will never be lower than 0 01 ETH) 
 In particular we let  be the proportion of finalized
 markets in the previous fee window that were invalid 
 and bv be the amount of the validity bond from the pre 
 vious fee window Then the validity bond for the current
 window is max
  1
 100 bvf()
 	
 
 2 No Show Bond
 During the very first fee window after launch the no 
 show bond will be set at 0 35 REP As with the validity
 bond the no show bond is adjusted up or down targeting
 a 1% no show rate with a 
 oor of 0 35 REP 
 Specifically we let  be the proportion of markets
 in the previous fee window whose designated reporters
 failed to report on time and we let br be amount of the
 no show bond from the previous fee window The the
 amount of the no show bond for the current fee window
 is max f0 35 brf()g 
 28This formula may change once empirical data from live markets is
 obtained

 3 Designated Reporter Bond
 During the very first fee window after launch the
 amount of the designated reporter bond will be set at
 0 35 REP The amount of the designated reporter bond
 is dynamically adjusted according to how many desig 
 nated reports were incorrect (failed to concur with the
 final market outcome) during the previous fee window 
 In particular we let  be the proportion of designated
 reports that were incorrect during the previous fee win 
 dow and we let bd be the amount of the designated re 
 porter stake during the previous fee window then the
 amount of the designated reporter bond for the current
 window is max f0 35 bdf()g
