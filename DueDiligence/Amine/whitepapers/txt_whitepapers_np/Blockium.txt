to penetrate the mass investor audiences due to barriers of entry that exist These barriers range from excessive regulation big investment requirements higher foreign exchange rates to the fragility of existing centralized implementations The maturity of blockchain technology is poised to change that as decentralized implementations for scalable trading competitions are within the reach of individuals with all pocket sizes Blockium is a platform that offers financial competitions to investors of any size and grade based on real time prices of financial instruments such as Stocks Crypto Foreign Exchange (FX) Indices and Commodities The platform targets mainstream audiences and provides a haven for investors to find refuge from traditional financial instruments and participate in trading competitions with the purpose of making multiple returns and leveraging their trading knowledge in almost any asset class Blockium has tied up with top global exchanges all around the world such as Nasdaq NYSE London Stock Exchange Shanghai Hitbtc (crypto) and Okex (crypto) which allows live market data to be integrated on Blockium platform Investors can then place their bets based on the real time data and execute their positions to gain a return on their portfolios In traditional markets returns range between 5 15% while Blockium gives an opportunity to earn as high as 1000% returns Blockium was designed by veterans of the online trading industry using the knowledge and experience acquired by Blockium Technologies limited com Blockium Technologies limited is an established online financial company which has been operating in the investment field since 2016 Blockium is Blockium Technologies limited\xe2\x80\x99s go to market product which allows investors with a budget as low as $10 to participate in real time trading of financial assets Blockium is a peer to peer trading competition platform which allows users to create a competition between family and friends The creator of the competition or the admin invites one or more people to join the competition and creates the rules of the competition such as defining the asset class (Stock 5 \x0ccrypto FX) benchmark exchange prize money number of assets to pick from that exchange time period of the competition and the entry fee Once users join the competition by paying the entry fee using the native token of Blockium(BOK) they create their portfolios by choosing the appropriate assets within the confines of the defined rules and the competition begins The prices of the assets are tracked real time and users are competing to gain the highest return on their portfolios The returns offered on Blockium are huge as compared to traditional trading and gives an opportunity to investors to make returns which are 10X or even more in a very short span of time Combining expertise in regulated markets together with blockchain technology creates a unique solution for skill based trading competitions that is tailored for the masses Blockium is creating a robust business model that incentivizes other providers and industry leaders with existing customer bases such as Blockium Technologies limited com itself to join the Blockium network and drive traffic to the network Event syndication between providers carries this traffic beyond the confines of a single provider Providers are motivated to cooperate as part of a larger network On the other side users will enjoy a well rounded array of option to trade accommodating their diversified interests and increasing their overall engagement The simplest contest is a head to head contest wherein you are competing against a single person and the chances are that you win a 100% return on your bets The other one is where a competition creator creates an event and you play by the rules of the creator and compete against many players with a chance of winning massive prize money Moreover if you are a creator you get an opportunity to take a large chunk of the total entry fees and the rest is given in the prize money and 5 10% is taken in the form of Blockium commission Blockium is powered by its native digital token the BOK All activity in the network revolves around BOK from serving as the primary form for fees and collaterals to serving as the main currency used for predicting event outcomes BOK is the driver of a sustainable economy where demand grows as more users and providers join the ecosystem 6 \x0cInitial Exchange Offering (IEO) Blockium has signed with Coineal exchange (coineal com) to launch an initial exchange offering (IEO) on their platform including a listing of Blockium (BOK) in the exchange In the past Initial Coin Offering was the means for blockchain projects to raise funds But a lack of regulations and increasing governance led to other means of crowdfunding emerging such as the security token offering (STO) and the IEO In order to tokenize a growing ecosystem of thousands of users who are active on a P2P financial gaming platform which perfectly fits the blockchain environment as well as the IEO\ s added value IEO is a fundraising mechanism where project developers create their native tokens and then get them listed on cryptocurrency exchanges An agreement between project developers and exchanges it is a safer alternative to ICOs as cryptocurrency exchanges offer higher security and lower the price manipulation issue There are certain advantages to using IEOs as compared to ICOs \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Developers can benefit from the existing user base of an exchange thus making it easier for people to take part in the crowdfunding process When a project is introduced through an exchange it gives higher credibility to the project and thus listing it on exchanges become easier and less tedious Scams can be eliminated in the funding process through an IEO as the chances of investors losing funds are lower When the exchange offers the coin to sell (IEO) investors can be guaranteed the listing of the coin opposed to the insecurity that comes with an ICO Blockium is doing an IEO on Coineal as IEOs on Coineal have proven to be very successful in the past \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cTOOL\xe2\x80\x9d an IEO on Coineal increased by 140% from the IEO price on the first day of trading \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cXcon\xe2\x80\x9d increased by 120% from the IEO price on the first day of trading 7 \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Another IEO on Coineal IZICHAIN finished its IEO in 8 minutes The objective is to complete the IEO on Coineal by May 15th with a raise of USD $1 2 million In this round of the IEO the company will only release 8% of its total coins issued for sale and will have the option to launch more rounds in the future Participation instructions will be published on the ieo blockium io website and on Coineal com IEO website BOK price will be fixed (in USD) throughout the IEO The BOK price will be $0 023 on during the IEO Token Distribution Within 15 days after the token sale ends (on coineal com) Blockium is also in talks with other three exchanges to list its token and the names of the exchanges will be announced shortly 8 \x0cPartnerships Microsoft BizSpark+ sponsorship (azure) Blockium was one of the 10 Israeli projects to be accepted to Microsoft Sponsorship program in 2017

are preventing the existing trading platforms from scaling up activities and increasing their user base An alternate that we are providing to these traditional markets are a skillbased trading competitions which will address the following existing issues in the traditional markets High entry Cost The costs to enter the traditional markets are high and there are intermediaries that exist which take away a major chunk of the returns on investments Huge financial investments People with access to financial means are the only ones who can enter the markets Small investors often find it difficult to enter the markets High risk low return Often the stakes involved are very high but the returns are low The rule \xe2\x80\x9chigh risks high returns\xe2\x80\x9d is not so applicable in traditional financial markets as markets do not necessarily offer very high returns for high risks Stock market unpredictability Every day the stocks market traders are under high risks and returns are less predictable with many regulatory uncertainties Volatile Markets The history has proved that even the world\ s top traders are not protected from the market\xe2\x80\x99s fluctuations 10 \x0cFewer platforms to trade The platforms available for the users are not so exciting and they often lack an enhanced user experience with fewer trading options higher risks limited assets and higher costs to trading Often the other gamification platforms do not allow real time tracking of the asset prices and do not give an opportunity for users to make high returns by creating their own gamification and competition rules 11 \x0cCore Objectives We at Blockium are providing solutions to all the above stated problems as we have created a platform for skill based trading competitions a

the partipants can track their performance by following the competition\xe2\x80\x99s live chart located at the competition profile Achieving a higher percentage return as compared to their competitors at the end of the competition will win them BOK tokens (or in specific occasions with foreign crypto tokens on the basis of partnership promotion with third parties The steps are as follows Figure 2 Blockium Competition Comptition Creation Defining Rules Inviting Peers Portfolio Creation Real Time Tracking Portfolio Settlement Winner 1 Enter the competition without barriers There are no barriers to enter a competition no minimum investment required Users only need to pay the entry fee 2 Follow the rules of the competition There are certain pre defined rules such as the entry fee asset class (Stocks Crypto FX) benchmark exchange (Nasdaq NYSE London Stock Exchange Hitbtc Okex etc ) no of assets in that exchange prize money and duration of the competition as shown on the left 16 \x0c3 Create your portfolio Once you have registered on the Blockium platform you can see your balance on the top right ($6100 for example on the screenshot on the left of Blockium app) This balance will be determined in the BOK which is Blockium\xe2\x80\x99s native coin You can use this balance to enter the competition by paying the entry fee and selecting assets from the pre determined exchange Going forward users will also be able to add weights to their portfolios Along with choosing the number of assets they can determine the individual weight to those assets 4 Compete against your peers in real time Once you have picked your assets you place your bets whether the price of each individual asset will go up or down Live competitions are created with real time data The percentage change of your portfolio is calculated and ranked against your competitors and the best portfolios win Moreover in every competition the user can see their opponents and learn about their portfolios 5 Portfolio Settlement For each asset in the portfolio you have the option to choose whether you believe its price will go up and you take a long (Buy) position or will go down and you take a short (Sell) position The portfolio percentage return is the sum of the price percentage change of the coins in the portfolio where the change is calculated from the price at the start of the competition to the price at the end of the competition We will calculate the percentage change of the portfolio while taking into consideration the directions you chose Competition can also be created on sectors (automobiles pharma etc ) as shown in the image taken from the Blockium app on the left 17 \x0cCompetition creation by users The Blockium platform is a decentralized system which allows events to be created by anyone including users The steps are as follows 1) Create a new competition 2) Define the rules of the game (i) set time frame with the start and finish time/date pre determined b (ii) size of stock portfolio \xe2\x80\x93 this is predetermined by the application\xe2\x80\x99s contests and involves 1 \xe2\x80\x93 20 stocks at any given contest (iii) entry fee for each player to enter each contest \xe2\x80\x93 BOK 50 to thousands of BOK (iv) number of participants in each contest \xe2\x80\x93 between 2 to thousands of users with a minimum/maximum amount of participants per contest pre determined by the application (v) Prizes \xe2\x80\x93 pre determined by the application per amount of participants and entry fee The prize (predetermined in advance by the application) will always be around 90% of the total entry fee collected per contest but will be divided (as pre determined by the application) per contest in accordance with the specific contest rules 3) Invite friends and family on the platform using WhatsApp Facebook Telegram etc 4) Users pick the assets they want to track in the exchange 5) Race to win the highest returns in real time against each other All Stocks FX Cryptocurrencies etc in the pre determined group will be calculated in real time from the start of the contest to the end of the contest based upon the relevant exchanges Users can track their portfolios in real time against other participants and race to win the highest returns They can even change their positions anytime in the middle of the competition The options available currently are edit portfolio and freeze where your initial position is your final position The five stages are depicted in the diagram below 18 \x0cCompetition Creation 19 \x0cParticipation fee The event creator defines the fee charged from users for participating in competitions The event creators are free to make the fee as high or low as they want as fees are ultimately paid to them 5% 10% of the fees are retained by the application and the rest is given out in the form of prize money to the winners as set by the competition creator Part of the fee can be reserved for event syndication by other providers bringing traffic to this event As a result of the economy that we are creating there is a possibility for other users to make money The advantage Blockium offer to the competition creator is that there is an opportunity to make a commission and earn the exact same amount that he/she decides before the competition begins As Uber & Bird create a sharing economy for the automobile industry we will do the same for the financial world 20 \x0cTypes of Competitions At Blockium we have three kinds of Contests Percentage Competition This is the simplest form of competition which is the 50 50 competition or the Double Out competition In this type of competition competitors with the best 50 per cent of the rankings win and get to double their buy ins while the lowest 50 per cent lose the game There is also something called as the Provider Reward in which if the provider reward is set to 10 per cent then instead of the top 50 per cent the top 45 per cent will double their buy ins and it is funded by the lowest 55 per cent of the users which also includes the provider compensation This setup has a variable which can be further extended to all the possible combinations such as Top 20 per cent with 20/80 or \xe2\x80\x9ctriple Out\xe2\x80\x9d or 40/60 etc Fixed Winner Competition In this competition there will be a fixed number of winners unlike the Percentage Competition One such example is the \xe2\x80\x9cwinner takes it all\xe2\x80\x9d wherein the person with the highest return on his/her portfolio takes away all the winning prize All possible combinations of the \xe2\x80\x9cFixed Winner Contest\xe2\x80\x9d is included in this type of competition wherein the number of winners is the variable and competitions such as \xe2\x80\x9cTop 5 wins\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cTop 25 wins\xe2\x80\x9d can be used as a template Private Competition On Blockium private competitions by the Providers (such as the Developer) will be offered In these competitions players have the power to create and innovate their own competitions based on their own rules offered by the Provider Economies may be different in these private contests as opposed to the ones which are open for the whole community and have different rules of the game 21 \x0cHead to Head competition There is another feature on the platform which allows individuals to trade directly with another user called head to head competition In this competition all the rules are predefined and all you got to do is enter the competition and wait for your match Once your competitor is selected automatically you can start trading as shown below Head to Head competition 22 \x0cAirdrops Blockium is committed to giving back to its community and frequently (weekly or monthly) will be creating free competitions for its dedicated users Blockium is committed to investing up to 25% of its commissions back to its users in the form of prize money for its free competition In the free competition a user does not have to pay an entry fee and the reward for these competitions are huge These competitions can be in partnerships with other exchanges/crypto companies as well and the rewards can be in the form of airdrops of other coins apart from BOK The unique platform that we have developed over the last 2 years allows us to use Blockium for all kinds of Blockchain Airdrop Till today and even before the tokenization of Blockium we have already managed 10 different Airdrops such as ANBI exchange Omni Coin Airdrop Alert Sonata ai ThoreNext etc Blockium technology integrates and supports all stages of the crypto industry such as early stages of ICO a listed company Security Token Offering (STO) tokens that are built on ERC 20 Bitcoin EOS and TRX and all the other existing Blockchain 23 \x0cLeaderboard There is also a Leaderboard on the platform which ranks the highest gainers The gainers are ranked daily weekly monthly and on an all time high basis These gainers are often rewarded further through airdrops and the winners of airdrops are announced on the leaderboard Leaderboard via a smart contract receives winner\xe2\x80\x99s address and the positions and the user\xe2\x80\x99s address is rewarded with the winning prize making it secure so that only the Blockium server will be able to report winners 24 \x0cThe Blockium Ecosystem The Blockium Ecosystem will seek to establish a global decentralized network centered around a trading competition where users are able to discover and participate in events created by providers and operators The ecosystem builds a long term cooperative operating model where providers enjoy the opportunity to innovate and compete for compensation and users enjoy the diversity of experiences and the ability to profit from participating in a wide variety of trading competition events Providers and operators Providers develop the trading competition client apps based on the open source implementation provided by Blockium (the reference implementation) Providers may customize the app to create a user experience according to their best practice The roles of a provider include \xe2\x80\xa2 Provide users with access to the network through the original Blockium app \xe2\x80\xa2 Bring traffic into the Blockium network by promoting the app to its customers Operators create trading competitions and at the right time resolve their realworld outcome Upon creating an event the operator determines the participation fee in that event out of which the syndication fee will be paid to the provider Any entity individual or organization can become an operator in the Blockium network As a result of the sharing economy that we are creating there is a possibility for other users to make money The advantage Blockium offer to the competition creator is that there is an opportunity to make a commission and earn the exact same amount that he/she decides before the competition begins The roles of an Admin include \xe2\x80\xa2 Create a trading competition that users will be interested in \xe2\x80\xa2 Act as a centralized reputable oracle for these events 25 \x0cIt is possible for a single entity to act both as a provider and an operator Blockium It is the official entity that creates the Blockium token (BOK) model and technology Blockium is focused on releasing open source cryptographic technologies that enable the decentralized operation of the Blockium network The roles of Blockium include \xe2\x80\xa2 Create the Blockium token (BOK) and execute its token event to fund the development and operation of the network \xe2\x80\xa2 Define the model for executing trading competitions over the Blockium network in a secure fair and decentralized manner \xe2\x80\xa2 Create incentives for providers to join the Blockium network adopt BOK and introduce their customer base to prediction markets on Blockium \xe2\x80\xa2 Develop the technology required for running the network such as Ethereum smart contracts that run prediction events \xe2\x80\xa2 Release the Blockium app as an open source reference implementation for allowing users to participate in the Blockium network \xe2\x80\xa2 Promote the Blockium network by forming partnerships and marketing to bootstrap activity \xe2\x80\xa2 Dealing with regulatory aspects of the ecosystem Blockium is incorporated as a for profit company in Saint Vincent The revenues of Blockium will come from consulting services to companies that are using the BOK platform and from its assets Blockium Technologies limited does not operate events but may curate them in the apps it distributes From individuals to an ecosystem The power of the Blockium network comes from creating a whole that is larger than the sum of its parts Basing operation on a common currency BOK will generate trust for users and mainstream audiences as well as provide a liquidity pool required for frictionless operation Basing execution of events on 26 \x0ca common technology will ensure interoperability between providers and a standard level of security and fairness throughout the network A decentralized ecosystem provides a robust model of operation While specific nodes can always be shut down without a centralized point of failure new ones will emerge as the ecosystem keeps growing The infrastructure is separate from the entities that act as providers and operators minimizing the exposure to regulatory scrutiny and related costs Tools for growth Providers are incentivized to bring traffic into the network and share their customers with other operators for fair compensation A provider\xe2\x80\x99s app may display events operated by the same provider and may choose to display events they operate alongside other operators\xe2\x80\x99 events in order to provide a broader selection of events Some providers may be white label curators bringing valuable events operated by third party to their users The syndication fee mechanism assures that such models are beneficial to both the provider and operator since the cross promotion of events is not a hard requirement of the network The diversity across a broad range of categories will guarantee users enjoy a larger variety of events in their app and find engaging matches for their personal interests and passions Multilingual Support We will support English Chinese Japanese and Korean on all of our user interfaces (The very initial release will be in English and only ) More languages will be added over time 27 \x0cThe Blockium APP Blockium will develop and publish a client for the Blockium platform in the form of a fully functional trading competition app The app is aimed to run on the following platforms Desktop Via Mac Windows Linux Android Mobile application available on Google Play & Apple Store Once users download the app successfully they will be able to run it locally on their computer The app will provide a fully functional P2P trading competition client Anyone will be able to use the app to place actual BOK on competitions outcome and use the product in real life since the app is designed completely peer to peer Future versions and features will be uploaded constantly to the website and application in the future Currently accessible via https //bit ly/2L0uOS6 https //apple co/2IV1KsC https //www Blockium io 28 \x0cCompetition creation This feature is currently not active (as of May 2019) but is intended to be implemented in the future The Blockium platform is a decentralized system which allows events to be created by anyone including users A new event is created by publishing a smart contract to the blockchain To create a smart contract the operator determines the rules of the competition \xe2\x80\xa2 Asset class benchmark index and no of assets which asset class whether stocks crypto or FX which exchange whether NASDAQ FTSE etc and the no of assets within the exchange are determined \xe2\x80\xa2 Oracle Identity and characterization of the entity or process that will declare the official outcome of the event at the point of resolution \xe2\x80\xa2 Participation fee The event creator defines the fee charged from users for participating in competitions The event creator is free to make the entry fee as high or low as they want as fees are ultimately paid to them Part of the fee can be reserved for event syndication by other providers bringing traffic to this event The size of this part is also defined by the game creator \xe2\x80\xa2 Collateral To protect users from fraud and make sure deliberate false reporting by an oracle cannot be profitable operators need to provide collateral securing the event Collateral can be put per event as collateral in BOK which is locked in a smart contract for 24 hours\xe2\x80\x99 past event resolution by the oracle or by linking the event to the operator\xe2\x80\x99s CR collateral Depending on the collateral type its amount must surpass a defined proportion to the total amount of active investments in all outcomes If a user disputes the oracle\xe2\x80\x99s report on the event and wins this dispute part of the collateral will be lost The exact amount lost is proportional to the total investment amount on losing outcomes and divided between all users that have suffered a loss However all disputes are made public and we expect operators to strive to eliminate false reporting on both small and big events for risk of affecting their reputation \xe2\x80\xa2 Market maker reserve The event creator acts as a market maker for the event by providing a reserve in BOK towards bootstrapping prediction as the counterparty for the first investments The reserve size affects the rate at which 29 \x0cthe LMSR market maker adjusts the prediction ratios of the different outcomes This reserve is expected to return to the operator although it may diminish or grow as a result of the actual distribution of user speculations 30 \x0cCompetitions on the blockchain Blockchain oracles A special type of contracts on the blockchain which allow other smart contracts to access any external API They provide additional functionality to smart contracts as they provide a means through which smart contracts can communicate outside of a decentralized blockchain network Chainlink is one such solution which is a platform that allows interaction of smart contracts on the blockchain with a real world application which is generally off the blockchain Oracles are used by the platform to find and verify the real world data and integrate into smart contracts by bringing it on chain Oraclize is another solution which ensures that the data obtained from the original data source such as price feeds for assets and financial application is genuine and tamper free Blockchain Competitions Blockchain competitions are a potential future development which can be applicable to put our technology inside Ethereum smart contracts Competitions will be smart Ethereum contracts Users entering competitions will be entering a smart contract by sending the entrance fees to the competitions smart contract The smart contract code will be verified and secured and give full trust to the user that the winners will get the competition winnings The competition smart contract will use oracles to calculate and update the portfolio performance of the users and to calculate the winner when the competition ends Blockchain maintains the credibility of the platform as it is immutable and transparent and provides reliable results which cannot be corrupted or modified Moreover oracles solve the inherent problem of blockchain protocols which is the inability of decentralized networks in interacting with external sources 31 \x0cFigure 3 Blockchain Competitions Blockium refactoring To support the blockchain competitions the Blockium system will be refactored to use the decentralized blockchain contracts instead of using a centralized database for competitions storage and calculations The Blockium UI will be refactored into dApps working with the blockchain instead of the servers This will not only add trust but will also make the system infinitely scalable and provide users with great system performance while preserving and improving the Blockium UX and UI 32 \x0cHow are the rewards calculated In simulated contests involving financial assets (Stocks FX cryptocurrencies other) users pick virtual assets to be a part of their portfolio No actual assets are ever purchased or sold and are chosen from a pre determined group of assets offered by the platform which is divided into categories and tied to realtime exchanges In each competition participants are creating their competition portfolio We calculate the total portfolio percentage change by summing up the price percentage change of the assets in the portfolio where the change is calculated from the price at the start of the competition to the price at the end of the competition All the prices are based on the real percentage changes of the asset\xe2\x80\x99s prices in the relevant exchanges tracked in real time Then the total percentage change of each participant will be compared to those of the other participants of the competition The winners are the participants with the highest total percentage changes on their portfolio at the end of the competition For each asset in the portfolio you have the option to choose whether you believe its price will go up or down (Buy/Sell) We will calculate the percentage change of the portfolio while taking into consideration the directions you chose Example 1 You have entered a 3 coins 20 minutes\xe2\x80\x99 competition You have picked TRX \xe2\x80\x93 buy (up) EOS buy and XTZ \xe2\x80\x93 sell (down) The changes to each of your coins from the competition start to its end were TRX +1% EOS +4 5% XTZ 0 5% Your portfolio total percentage change in this competition is the sum of all coins\xe2\x80\x99 percentages changes for the coins for which you chose \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d (TRX EOS) minus the sum of all the coins for which you chose \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d (XTZ) 33 \x0c% change= (+1% + 4 5%) ( 0 5%) = +6% This result will be compared to those of the other participants to decide if you are one of the winners of the competition The participant\ s total stock group percentage change (the return) from the beginning of the contest and up to its end must be higher than the total stock group percentage of the other participants in the same contest Example 2 User entered a 3 stocks 1 day competition User picked Google \xe2\x80\x93 buy (up) Facebook (FB) buy and Microsoft \xe2\x80\x93 sell (down) At the end of the contest the participant\ s contest ranking will be determined by the total stock returns for such a contest If Google and FB went up and Microsoft also went up ten percent per stock the participant wins a percentage of the return of the entire contest stock group The changes to each of your stocks from the competition start to its end are as follows Google + 10% FB +10% Microsoft +10% % change= (+10% + 10%) (+10%) = +10% This total percentage per participant will be compared to the other participants\ total percentage within the same contest and will determine the participants\ ranking to pay out the prize amount per contest The higher the participant\ s total percentage the higher his/her ranking status per contest 34 \x0cThe Blockium Token The Blockium ecosystem is based on an open source cryptographic token named BOK (the Blockium Token) Like other cryptocurrencies BOK is fractionally divisible transferable and fungible Blockium coin We will issue our token coin called the Blockium Coin A strict limit of 650 000 000 BOK will be created never to be increased BOK will run natively on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC20 Activity in the Blockium ecosystem is performed primarily using BOK making the token an integral part of the Blockium platform and the driver for its economy This includes \xe2\x80\xa2Users apply BOK in the trading competition outcomes and accordingly profits over successful predictions are collected in BOK Users are required to purchase BOK in order to participate in trading competitions running over the Blockium network \xe2\x80\xa2 Fees for participating in trading competitions and investing in event outcomes are collected in BOK This fee is the primary channel of revenue for event creators and market makers \xe2\x80\xa2 Syndication fees for promoting events between apps of different providers in the Blockium ecosystem is paid between providers in BOK 35 \x0cMarket size Decentralized finance can make investing in financial markets more accessible to the general public as a majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population still remains untouched by financial assets or markets1 There are many barriers to entry which include income costs geopolitics and financial literacy and as a result wealth has been concentrated in the hands of a few With decentralized solutions on the blockchain more people can access global financial markets Currently the crypto market has a 24 trading volume worth USD $38 trillion as of April 15 2019 and Asia leads the market in terms of crypto volumes as well as the market of the gaming industry The world\xe2\x80\x99s stock market capitalization is USD $40 6 trillion as of end 2018 and has shown impressive growth in FY 2018 and the global FX trading volume is USD $21 trillion as of Q3 2018 as shown in the diagrams below Figure 4 Crypto market 24h total market Capitalization Source

concentrated in the minor section of society Sometimes even external factors such as the economic condition of a country prevent investors from entering the markets So if an investor is based out of the country whose economic condition is deteriorating is often prevented from gaining advantages and opportunities based outside his/her country Moreover the cost of investing in the FX markets are huge As the digital decentralized infrastructure is evolving more are more people are turning towards digital trading to take advantage of the massive financial markets all around the world Blockium on the blockchain is providing solutions to the previously untapped customers to enter financial markets through the follows developments 1 Peer to Peer trading Blockium is an innovative platform that

markets just by the click of a smartphone 5 Smart Contracts Intermediaries such as banks and brokerage firms are removed as smart contracts are self executed codes and this reduces transaction costs and makes it much faster to create deals 39 \x0cConcept validation In May 2018 we launched our first application Blockium Trading competitions and our results are indicative of our success Figure 9 Blockium Concept Validation Blockium Demographics \xe2\x80\xa2 65% of the users are of the age 20 40 \xe2\x80\xa2 More than 15% of the users are active users visiting Blockium more than 3 times a week \xe2\x80\xa2 90% are men \xe2\x80\xa2 On average the user participates in 8 competitions \xe2\x80\xa2 Almost 75% of the new users have come from strategic partnerships such as the Airdrop campaigns and other innovative initiatives and partnerships using our social media such as Facebook and Twitter campaigns \xe2\x80\xa2 Since September 2018 until March 2019 we have experienced a user growth of 1200% (from 2500 users to 30 000 users) 40 \x0cFigure 10 Blockium User Demographics 41 \x0cMarketing dominance The combination of our innovative concept wide range of technical capabilities integrations and advertising channels and a talented team of strategy analysts and creative managers together with optimal accessibility including money prizes application approved by Apple and Google allowed us to grow Blockium quickly with a limited budget implement optimizations on a daily basis and break records of marketing costs in the financial marketplace This mechanism is the key asset for the company\xe2\x80\x99s monetization which will allow us to execute our business models with a promising prediction of gross profit Figure 11 Blockium Marketing Statistics Traffic from Canada 42 \x0cTechnology The Blockium token (BOK) is implemented as an ERC20 compatible token over the public Ethereum blockchain Ethereum is the natural fit for Blockium as it is quickly becoming the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets Compatibility with the ERC20 standard leverages the rich existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem such as development tools wallets and exchanges The ability to program trustless smart contracts over Ethereum with a Turing complete language allows for robust and secure customization of the cryptocurrency to the domain specific requirements of the Blockium network in a fully decentralized manner Our wide range of technical capabilities and knowledge allow us to release features to our products which were previously unseen in the industry and to integrate our products in the future with various abilities such as the Internet of Things (IoT) & Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advanced peer to peer technology is at the core of all of our products With multi channel accessibility and built in integrations our technology is designed to drive the bottom line The architecture of our code and the variety of libraries and integrations allow us unlimited possibilities of user experience marketing channels and business development opportunities Our expertise in cybersecurity made us integrate information security into the core of our systems and products making our products a fortress compared to those of our current and future competitors In reality where thousands of companies get hacked daily and lose their credibility and data our superior security is of great importance ensuring your data is protected from cyber attacks and leaks The core code of the Application is built from the most popular and secure technology languages javascript typescript CSS scss c# PoweShell batch java objective C HTML razor SQL PLpgSQL 43 \x0cThe Security In order to ensure the security of smart contracts the Blockium coin will develop relevant contract templates according to the business needs The developers can make calls according to the interface parameters of the contract or directly reject calls for requests that do not meet the requirements of the interface The security of the contract will be greatly improved on the basis of abandoning a certain degree of flexibility In addition in terms of smart contract security testing Blockium will develop a smart contract verification platform specifically so as to automatically detect common vulnerabilities and quickly and accurately find the general security problems of smart contracts At the implementation level the security test for smart contracts includes 2 parts 1 Before and during the event The Blockium coin encourages the community to develop a standardized IDE that automates code completion and syntax cues and automatically integrates discovered security vulnerabilities and checks code and identifies possible security risks 2 After the event Through automatic scanning of all DApps\xe2\x80\x99 contract codes the Blockium coin uses automated testing to match the vulnerability of library rules and DApps\xe2\x80\x99 contract code The vulnerabilities will be published in time 44 \x0cDigital Currency Transaction Settlement There are several problems with existing digital asset exchanges Transparency Exchanges are presently unable to prove the credibility of the trading data The holding of the asset is not public and the security of users\xe2\x80\x99 asset in the exchange is not guaranteed as well Compliance To achieve the compliance of a transaction it is necessary to ensure the transaction can be regulated In order to address the above mentioned issues Blockium coin will implant transactions On Chain technically to increase the transparency of transactions to reduce the cost of trust for users and will add regulatory nodes for transaction tracking and asset traceability to prevent illegal transactions Meanwhile in order to ensure the transaction speed Blockium coin also uses a unique double chain structure employing an exchange chain with high TPS to process transactions 45 \x0cRegulatory Strategy Skill based prediction market platform utilize a large set of activities that may be subject to regulatory scrutiny in various territories This large and varied set may need to comply with the regulation on securities trading on financial institutions and money services businesses on gaming and on gambling Complying with each of these regulations and sometimes in each jurisdiction requires experience and comes at a great cost In decentralized applications no single entity has control over the infrastructure required for its operation This allows separating the infrastructure from the app content The resulting structure has the advantage of modular isolation separate functions in the system can operate in isolation from one another and possibly be provided by different vendors 46 \x0cA sustainable economy For a cryptocurrency to be successful over time it must become the driver for a sustainable economy As BOK is utilized by more users and adopted by more providers the network effect of the Blockium ecosystem will grow building the value of the ecosystem for the benefit of long time holders and token sale participants A successful economy requires BOK to have growing demand within the Blockium network Since participation in trading competitions (Blockium app) requires users to acquire BOK demand for the token will grow in proportion to the number of active users and the number of active events they invest in Demand will also grow in proportion to the number of active providers who rely on BOK to create events Providers are incentivized to hold significant reserves of BOK in order to provide the required collaterals and market making reserves for running many events concurrently Aside from spending BOK the model also provides a means of earning BOK as a reward for services given Event providers in the Blockium ecosystem such as invest com are compensated in fees for the work they put towards operating events acting as oracles and assuming the risks of functioning as market makers 47 \x0cLiquidity and Volatility BOK will be a single currency used both for the operation of the Blockium network (transaction fees syndicate payments oracle payments) and as the functional currency for trading competition events Unlike other proposals for investment currencies it is a flexible exchange rate currency making it less exposed to liquidity and volatility risks Liquidity the risk of investors unable to acquire tokens when they want to speculate on the outcome of an event and of users unable to sell tokens when they want to cash out Volatility the risk of currency fluctuations between the time an investor entered the action and purchased tokens of an event outcome and the time the user wants to cash out These risks are a big concern for most bootstrapping markets when the proposed service launches together with the currency and in the subsequent period of no or little growth of the service This is typical because peer to peer markets tend to follow an exponential growth pattern due to the network externalities inherent to peer to peer services Several techniques are being used to mitigate these risks mainly the usage of secondary currencies or an introduction of a pegged currency/stablecoins to be used by consumers In the case of trading competition this comes at the price of separating the currency used for operational mechanisms from the investment currency Such separation has adverse effects in thinning out the market for the operational currency in addition to the missing out on the advantages that flexible exchange rate currencies have against monetary shocks 48 \x0cCompetitor\xe2\x80\x99s Analysis Figure 12 Blockium Competitor\xe2\x80\x99s Analysis 49 \x0cBusiness model Blockium\xe2\x80\x99s revenue will come from the following sources 1) Commission through the entry fees \xe2\x80\xa2 B2C The platform charges between 5% 10% commission from each contest\xe2\x80\x99s total entry fee \xe2\x80\xa2 Withdrawal Fee Blockium may charge a small fee for withdrawals \xe2\x80\xa2 Listing Fee (assets available to be picked to the virtual potfolios Blockium will select innovative coins and other assets to be listed on the exchange and there may be a fee associated with those listings \xe2\x80\xa2 Other Fees There may be other fees the platform may collect for various services such as automated algorithmic order etc 2) Big Data Predictions for the Financial Markets At Blockium by using smart tracking and analysing tools and mechanisms the selected financial data generated on our platform including markets and assets dynamics will be an asset to monetize by trading with third parties such as large organizations Figure 13 Blockium Business Model \xe2\x80\xa2 B2C The platform charges 5% 10% commission from each contest\xe2\x80\x99s total entry fee \xe2\x80\xa2 Data Monetization through predictive analysis on Big Data 50 \x0cRevenue Generation Scenario The company spends $100K marketing budget on paid social media campaigns The result (based on the statistics that we have generated over the last 8 months since Blockium launch) The average price per new user (from some countries) is $2 5 Thus the $100K marketing budget will bring 40K users to the platform As we know that 25% of the 40K (10K users) will remain active users that spend around $500 (each) on entry fees for competitions the result will be 10K active users * $500 entry fee = $5M total entry fee (turnover) Turnover = $5M total entry free on Blockium As Blockium commission is 5% 10% of the total entry fees paid for competitions the result would be 10% commission scenario $5M *10%= $500K 7 5% commission scenario $5M *7 5%= $375K 5% commission scenario $5M *5%= $250 Bottom line 100K marketing budget would bring up to 500K revenues for Blockium (depending on the commission rate) as shown in the diagram below 51 \x0cFigure 14 Blockium Revenue Model 52 \x0cBenefits to Token Holders Token Holder There will be a wealth accumulation possibility as Blockium holders are entitled to 25% of Blockium profits by participating in a FREE trading competition with BOK token for prizes that will be
