listing or valuation of Jesus Coin in terms of any real world assets including \xef\xac\x81at currencies or other blockchain tokens/coins represented or guaranteed 2 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Introducing Jesus Coin For the past 2 000 years the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ have transformed from being bound by the faith of his followers into highly centralized and pro\xef\xac\x81t driven bodies What was once purely about faith and devotion has become big business under powerful \xef\xac\x81gureheads Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Pope for Catholicism the Queen for the Church of England or Thomas S Monson for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints no longer is Jesus Christ about its followers IT\xe2\x80\x99S TIME TO DECENTRALIZE JESUS Using the cryptographic breakthrough of the blockchain ledger and anonymous cryptocurrencies Jesus Coin has been developed as THE currency of God\xe2\x80\x99s Son Christianity is the largest grouping in the world with over 2 billion followers and we deserve our own currency As predicted by John (Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s dad the one with the limp) 33 12 \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there would be a cryptocurrency and it would be wondrous and the Lord would say unto thee followers \xe2\x80\x98buy thee Jesus Coin at the highest possible bonus structure\xe2\x80\x9d Jesus Coin aims to become the de facto currency for all good Christians In fact Jesus Coin may even become the de facto currency for all bad Christians too For millennia Christian churches have taught that the way to heaven is through centralized giving whether to churches pastors or those weird advertorials We say enough as we proudly bring forth the currency of tomorrow (well of 2000 years ago) Jesus Coin We project that Jesus Coin will overtake the Mormon church\xe2\x80\x99s $40 billion* valuation to become the second most powerful Christian institution by 2030 and surpass the Catholic Church\xe2\x80\x99s $1 trillion valuation by 2050 thereby becoming the most powerful Christian institution in the world ** While we do truly believe Jesus Coin could reach a market cap higher than the US national debt *** we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to keep our investors grounded (but seriously it might) If you don\xe2\x80\x99t use Jesus Coin as your primary digital currency you\xe2\x80\x99re barely even Christian * Probably impossible ** De\xef\xac\x81nitely impossible *** Unambiguously impossible 3 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Why is Jesus Coin So Necessary For too long money grabbing churches have attempted to \xe2\x80\x98own\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98sell\xe2\x80\x99 Jesus It\xe2\x80\x99s time that someone took back Jesus for all of us and Jesus Coin is our way of bringing back Jesus to the masses The blockchain has fundamentally changed the landscape of business culture and society democratizing what was once controlled by the few into the hands of everyone If we can democratize banking insurance gaming and more than together we can decentralize Jesus The time has come to do democratize our Lord and Saviour The time has come to stop funding the few that already live in palaces and luxury The time has come for our own currency in the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s image Unlike other cryptocurrencies Jesus Coin has the unique advantage of providing global access to Jesus as it makes getting closer to Jesus safer and faster due to the use of blockchain technology somehow Jesus Coin investors can gain from the competitive advantage of being closer to God all while bene\xef\xac\x81ting from low transaction costs and maximum transparency and security Additionally Jesus Coin helps in the war against corruption within the Christian faith by making all transactions anonymous on the blockchain It is estimated that billions of dollars of funds currently laundered and plundered would be saved due to the global usage of Jesus Coin within Christianity * BUT MOST OF ALL JESUS WOULD BE PUMPED ABOUT HAVING HIS OWN COIN For the \xef\xac\x81rst time there really will be a picture of Jesus on a coin ** Jesus has reached a point of development where it is no longer compatible with \xe2\x80\x98ownership\xe2\x80\x99 by churches and pastors Using blockchain technology Jesus Coin endeavors to empower every Christian to own Jesus together In the way that Bitcoin revolutionized commerce on the internet Jesus Coin will permanently change the face of Jesus no longer to be controlled by an outmoded central source * No such guarantee can be made bad people do bad things even if they love Jesus ** It\xe2\x80\x99s digital so there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a literal coin with His face on it come on 4 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Value Proposition \xe2\x80\xa0 Existing market (3 3 billion followers) \xe2\x80\xa0 Consumer base accustomed to having faith in improbable projects \xe2\x80\xa0 Not the most unusual Christian project (Mormonism) Jesus Coin is expected to place among the highest volume cryptocurrencies* as it places cutting edge Ethereum based blockchain technology alongside one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest markets While the Catholic Church has had almost a 2 000 year head start on Jesus Coin for market volume we do expect to at least overtake the Church of England (after all Jesus Coin is available for the whole WORLD) The expectation of the Jesus Coin team is that by 2020 the landscape of wealth within the Christian church will look like this (maybe we don\xe2\x80\x99t really know) $1 Trillion $ 40 Billion Catholic Church Mormon Church $ 13 Billion** Jesus Coin $ 7 7 Billion Church of England Sources https //www dailydot com/debug/apple highest valuation ever/ https //www bloomberg com/news/articles/2012 07 18/how the mormons make money http //www ft com/cms/s/0/9659eefa 4e86 11e1 8670 00144feabdc0 html#axzz43pZvqI00 * We cannot guarantee this happening whatsoever in fact if it does then let\xe2\x80\x99s consider it the second coming ** This is am ambitious target that almost de\xef\xac\x81nitely won\xe2\x80\x99t happen 5 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Frequently Asked Questions Q This all sounds ridiculous is it a scam A The church is not a scam Jesus Coin will ful\xef\xac\x81l all of the functions on this whitepaper (which is not very many functions) It is a fully traceable asset on cryptocurrency exchanges * Q Is this whole thing a joke A Christianity has survived 2000 years so if it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke it\xe2\x80\x99s a good one The Jesus Coin itself is totally real though up there on Etherscan and Coin Market Cap and ERC20 compatible wallets and all that stu\xef\xac\x80 Q Can Jesus Coin actually make miracles A We\xe2\x80\x99re in early talks with churches to provide miracles exclusively to Jesus Coin owners ** Q Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it highly unlikely that Jesus Coin can gain a $5bn market cap and become a top 10 digital currency A Yes but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it highly unlikely that Jesus would be resurrected Q Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be illegal to crowdfund an actual Crusade using Jesus Coin A Almost de\xef\xac\x81nitely Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it * We cannot guarantee listings on any exchanges whatsoever and this is simply an aspiration of the Jesus Coin team If you pray hard enough maybe it will happen maybe it will not happen ** We are not in any talks with any churches Churches may not be too fond of us disrupting their business with decentralised ledgers and blockchain technology Just like banks aren\xe2\x80\x99t too fond of Bitcoin 6 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Use Cases Jonathan a Catholic raises Jesus Coin to carry out a new Crusade * Jonathan a devote Catholic from Mobile Alabama has been desperately attempting to organize a modern day Crusade to retake Jerusalem for over ten years but has had limited success due to the advanced weaponry required for the task Considering that the reason for the lack of donations for his praiseworthy project was due to a reluctance to hand over green for his idea he \xef\xac\x81nally attempts to raise the money from among his fellow followers in Jesus Coin Jonathan raises 1 200 JC in only 3 days equivalent to 100 ETH or ~$30 000 Using this money Jonathan is able to purchase various weapons from his local Walmart and book plane tickets to the Middle East Two days later Jonathan is arrested and charged with multiple felonies related to attempting to invade a foreign nation imprisoned for four years Emma a Mormon buys Jesus Coin to miraculously cure her mother\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x82at feet Emma\xe2\x80\x99s mother Brianna has su\xef\xac\x80ered from terrible \xef\xac\x82at feet her entire life an ailment hat every podiatrist in Canada has been unable to solve Tired of hearing her mother endlessly complain about feet pain Emma decided to take matters into her own hands First she tried writing to the Pope and asking him to perform a miracle but he decided that feet issues don\xe2\x80\x99t generate enough media buzz Frustrated she bought 12 Jesus coins on impulse Suddenly Brianna\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x82at feet were cured and despite her doctor\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on it being a purely placebic e\xef\xac\x80ect they\xe2\x80\x99re both sure the Jesus Coins performed a miracle ** *From history class you learnt that the crusades were historic events of invasion murder plunder and pillage (etc) As such they are against the law Jonathan is also a made up person and this also is a made up event please understand this do not crowdfund a crusade **The coins did not perform a miracle but who\xe2\x80\x99s to say they can\xe2\x80\x99t 7 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Use Cases Gary a Jew buys Jesus Coin due to confusion Hearing about the exciting new world of cryptocurrency Gary decided to invest in his \xef\xac\x81rst ICO While scanning through options he saw one he believed promising related to insurance on the blockchain Unfortunately he got distracted and accidentally bought Jesus Coin instead One year later he sold them for an enormous pro\xef\xac\x81t as Jesus Coin\xe2\x80\x99s market cap his $13 billion * Greedy bastard Wall Street trader Adam buys Jesus Coin to pump and dump After spending a day ripping o\xef\xac\x80 investors on Wall Street Adam wanted to \xef\xac\x81nd a new way to manipulate a market before his evening bottle of 1986 Chateauneuf du Pape Reading about cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\x98pump and dump\xe2\x80\x99 schemes he thought it would be a great idea to buy $10 000 worth of Jesus Coin during the 40% bonus structure and dump it at market value immediately after the end of the crowdsale Immediately after he sold the price crashed** what timing Adam successfully made a 75% pro\xef\xac\x81t in just one month *** Sadly for Adam however within 6 months religious fervor drove the price of Jesus Coin back up 15 000% meaning if he\xe2\x80\x99d have shown patience he\xe2\x80\x99d have made $1 5m Adam never forgave himself and while vulnerable and dealing with his loss he was recruited to become a Catholic priest With Jesus Coin everyone wins *Reminder that this is false ** Reminder prices can crash you should all know this by now *** Reminder that this is also false Jesus Coin and its creators promise absolutely no earthly functionality or bene\xef\xac\x81ts through the use or holding of Jesus Coin beyond that of a durable transferrable blockchain digital token or coin nor is any valuation of Jesus Coin in terms of any real world assets including \xef\xac\x81at currencies or other blockchain tokens/coins represented or guaranteed 8 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Team* Jesus Christ Founder and CEO After a few years napping in heaven Jesus got tired of seeing the \xef\xac\x81nancial injustice created by the banks and decided to resurrect once more in order bring forth his own cryptocurrency and solve all of earth\xe2\x80\x99s ills Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 Donkey Customer Service After \xef\xac\x81nding horse meat in his lasagna during the European horseman scandal Jesus decided to bring down his personal donkey with him in case IKEA tried to turn him into a meatball while unattended Judas Iscariot Trustee In order to allay any fears about transparency concerning the Jesus Coin project Jesus decided to entrust the role of the trustee to a colleague who will not hesitate to denounce all dubious acts that do not conform with the law Bartholomew Business Development Following his numerous journeys to the four corners of the world Jesus considers him as a true traveling companion and decided to make him continue his travels in order to develop this project John Son of Zebedee Content Writer After being bored into submission while writing the Gospel Of John and four other boring books in the New Testament John is happier than ever to write a whitepaper for a project that is \xef\xac\x81nally

has proved in the past his know how as a manager Augustus will not hesitate to restore the whip system for the smooth running of a blockchain project Herode CFO For many years beside Jesus in paradise Herode manages all his accounting including Prayers answered Prayers not answered Prayers being processed In addition all newly minted coins will go through Herode for his blessing Saint Peter Public Relations As spokesperson of the apostles Saint Peter is considered by Jesus to be the best suited person to ful\xef\xac\x81ll this role It seems that after his comeback on earth he fell in love with McDonalds and passes his time there James Son of Zebedee Customer Service Veterinarian in the past Jesus puts him at the service of his donkey Philip Blockchain Developer Philip who used to manage the

job *Reminder that this is not actually the team These people passed long ago and may peace be upon them 12 \x0cWhitepaper 1 o Conclusion If you don\xe2\x80\x99t immediately buy Jesus Coin after reading this whitepaper you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hell If you think that good deeds charity and living in God\xe2\x80\x99s image is the way to heaven you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong it is only by holding Jesus Coin Jesus Coin is guaranteed to overtake Ether as the 2nd most valuable cryptocurrency by 2020 and Bitcoin as the most valuable by 2030 * Seriously ask yourself how it\xe2\x80\x99s viable that JESUS COIN could not be the most valuable cryptocurrency it\xe2\x80\x99s basically blasphemy Finally the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest demographic of consumers devotees have their own cryptocurrency Join us as we use the cryptographic breakthroughs of the blockchain to win back Jesus for all of us *Won\xe2\x80\x99t actually happen Again Jesus Coin and its creators promise absolutely no earthly
