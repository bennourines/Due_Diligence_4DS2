get us to the moon yet the way we govern our societies and organisations remains the equivalent of a pocket calculator Existing models for collaborative decision making obstacles have prevented us from achieving this thus once served our growing democracies well yet today far but do not have to hinder us any more they are increasingly slow expensive and ineffectual Public trust in their outcomes is eroding and results in voter apathy Campaign promises are regularly broken and major decisions are taken without consultation or transparency Our society is hurtling into the future but our democratic processes are stuck in the past failing to advance at the same pace Democracy is much more than our electorates our representative models or our boards and management teams Democracy is the opportunity to participate in the decision making processes that relate to the shared matters which affect us Democracy is about reaching consensus on how to best use our shared resources Democracy is about advancing our collective well being providing opportunities to those who have while protecting those who do not These tools are now available Thanks to the distributed ledger technology we can create systems that directly engage and empower constituencies employing mechanisms enabling them to vote smartly and efficiently giving them confidence that their voices will be heard and allowing them to see first hand the results of their voting activities Horizon State has built this Our platform is soon to be extended and used by political independents publicly listed companies and communities within developing nations We are looking toward brighter horizons to a place where our countries and organisations conduct themselves with accountability and efficiency a place where voices can be heard securely and simply We are taking our technology to a global audience and it will underpin the process of opinion and vote solicitation We need better shared decision
