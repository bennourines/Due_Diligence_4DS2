revolutionary as cryptocurrencies are most of them come with two big issues PRIVACY & USABILITY The transparent and public ledger is an amazing construct solving many problems and providing support in various scenarios But what this construct also does is that it makes your financial transactions public and visible for everybody Every transaction can be precisely traced This means means that anyone can look into your public wallets your balance as well as all incoming and outgoing transactions This lack of privacy is affecting both private people and large companies X12 is a highly community driven project with a dedicated development team behind it that works hard at providing the basic conditions and general setup for the X12 community As a result the X12 community has managed to create a secure private and untraceable privacy coin user optimized due to its simple user friendly X12 ecosystem By using X12 you are sure that every transaction is completely anonymous and cannot be traced by anyone Sending and receiving coins is not traceable This enhances independence freedom and offers protection from surveillance and suppression Usually privacy coins are quite complicated and difficult to use especially for non tech savvy users there is no easy and simple way to store use and spend their coins This is due to the lack of an ecosystem which is essential for mainstream accessibility to a cryptocurrency X12 welcomes anyone who provides solutions that make using it easy and simple X12 already has an extensive ecosystem built around it by 3rd parties that includes mobile wallets ATMs and debit cards making it really simple to use for anyone while still protecting the privacy characteristics of the coin (storage and transactions) We as the developers and the X12 community believe that a successful cryptocurrency must be secure simple untraceable and should offer a proper ecosystem which makes it extremely user friendly for everyone That is why we are working hard and are doing our best at encouraging the community in multiple ways and are supportive of any tools created by the community or 3rd parties that can add value to the coin X12 is the first cryptocurrency which solves all these issues and fulfills all the important requirements X12 Coin Whitepaper 3 / 22 \x0cThe X12 Community The X12 coin is an independent open source privacy coin with a big and enthusiastic community Many volunteers are working very hard to take the X12 coin to the next level We are witnessing an increasing interest from independent companies in different industries \xe2\x80\x93 who are building X12 online shops mining pools wallet solutions etc We support the X12 community and any 3rd party that shares our enthusiasm in the coin by providing information to create the basic conditions and general environment for further developments of X12 ecosystem ATM A cryptocurrency ATM provider/operator has signaled serious interest in listing X12 on their machines

mobile wallet It is currently being tested and will be launched once it has been ensured to be 100% ready Unfortunately we do not yet have a date by when this Android app will be launched but we expect this to be within 3 to 4 months so most likely by Q4 of 2018 This mobile wallet is intended to be very simple and user friendly and to have QR code functionalities This means that it can be used for purchasing merchandise or for cryptocurrency ATMs that support X12 You start your mobile wallet scan the QR code at the merchant shop or from the merchant website to conduct a payment The same applies for crypto ATMs that use QR codes for making payments and withdrawals Merchants Enabling X12 to be accepted by merchants as payment for goods brings real value to the coin It is therefore essential to build a global network of merchants who accept X12 We thank the many motivated volunteers who are contributing to this Smart developers from our community created the WooCommerce integration Skypayment so that online shops can easily integrate X12 coin Payments in shops (online and offline) will be conducted via SkyWallet by scanning a QR code or by using the wallet address to initiate transactions in the easiest and fastest manner possible We are pleased to hear from the SkyWallet team that already numerous merchants (online as well as offline) have expressed a willingness to accept X12 as payment through \xe2\x80\x9cSkyWallet Business\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 solution Parallel to this we have received a request from a licensed financial firm to list X12Coin in their merchant payment gateway solution This solution is different in that it allows the merchant to accept X12Coin which upon his choice can be converted into fiat This would be a great step since the licensed firm offers its users Android & iOS apps to easily conduct crypto transactions X12 Coin Whitepaper 10 / 22 \x0cWe are proud to see that numerous merchants have already expressed their willingness for accepting X12Coin as payment You can check out the complete list of these merchants here http //x12coin com/x12 map/ ATM Although there is a lot of excitement around crypto ATMs and terminals are popping up in all regions there are specific challenges in operating 2 way crypto ATMs These challenges are 2fold in nature On the one hand there are legal and regulatory aspects that have to be respected These have to be taken care of by the provider On the other hand there are technical challenges where we try to be supportive in working out solutions together with the provider/operator which are to be implemented by the provider/operator In regards to legal and regulatory matters X12 team does not advise the ATM operator and assumes that the operator respects the rulings and laws of the jurisdiction(s) where the machines are operated or will be operated Just as it is applicable for any 3rd party providers X12 does not take any liability whatsoever in such matters We only point out that this is up to the 3rd party to ensure it is not in violation of any laws and rules and that monitoring regulatory changes likewise falls in the responsibility of 3rd party providers X12 Coin Whitepaper 11 / 22 \x0cWe have acquired a 2 way ATM for analyzing and testing purposes We have successfully solved the technicalities of conducting payments and withdrawals to send and receive coins After extensive exchange of technical information with a cryptocurrency ATM service provider/operator in Europe we can hopefully expect to have the 1st ATM operational by Q4 of 2018 We would be delighted to see X12Coin available on cryptocurrency ATMs This would add tremendously to the economic value of X12 and be of great benefit to the X12 community Payment Plugin The

is a cryptocurrency that relies on Proof of Work mining to secure the network The X12 coin project does not endorse any particular pool software or hardware and is independent from the existing mining pools Mining is the process of verifying transactions and of adding them to the public ledger Mining has several functions \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 verifying transactions bundling transactions in a block getting the hash that was assigned to the previous block solving the mathematical puzzle/proof of work problem The first participant to solve the puzzle gets to place the next block on the blockchain and receives the commission payment You can check out the current hashrate and all other X12 blockchain parameters here http //explorer x12coin com/charts Setting up and running your own mining rig is highly complicated and complex since you have to acquire the right hardware assemble and configure it It is much easier to join a mining pool pay for the already existing computing power and receive X12 coins Fortunately already big mining pools like X12pool com miningpool ch hash to coins com easyhash pro and xpro service com/en are supporting the X12 coin and are helping to stabilize and secure the network Specialized X12 mining companies such as XPRO are offering mining packages so everyone can participate easily in mining the X12 coin Debitcard We have received a few requests from financially licensed firms who are in the business of providing debit card solutions for crypto to fiat transactions We are currently evaluating these requests to identify the most suitable provider A debit card solution would be of great benefit since it allows connecting the X12 community with the real world of utilizing \xe2\x80\x9cplastic\xe2\x80\x9d money but in the crypto sense and being one step ahead of other cryptocurrencies X12 Coin Whitepaper 14 / 22 \x0cX12 users can quickly and easily transfer fiat money to their debit card which will automatically be converted into X12 coins at the current rateto be used from practically anywhere and at anytime X12 Coin Whitepaper 15 / 22 \x0cX12 Coin X12Coin is an open source decentralized digital currency that is not owned by anyone other than by its users We the X12 developer team are extremely pleased to be witnessing a strong and accelerating growth of the X12 community The coin is drawing more enthusiastic users who are contributing their skills for developing the ecosystem surrounding it X12Coin is also becoming increasingly of interest to 3rd parties who see synergies between the coin and the services they provide These developments based on the open source nature of X12Coin are succeeding in creating a multifacetd interconnected and functioning ecosystem that adds tremendous benefits to X12 users that is making the coin more popular as a secure private and untraceable privacy coin that can be trusted and is easy for everyone to use The X12Coin is a Monero (XMR) fork that aims at delivering all the benefits of a privacy coin without the draw downs of having in depth technical knowledge to use such a coin As the developers of X12Coin we the developer team uphold privacy as one of the most important principles of human interaction and society and are committed through our work to enable privacy payments via X12 and its surrounding ecosystem X12Coin community can rest assured that every X12Coin transaction is completely anonymous sender and receiver of a transaction cannot be traced This enhances independence protection from surveillance & suppression and offers people more freedom With the well built ecosystem you will be able to use a web based wallet and a mobile wallet on your smartphone buy goods from numerous shops with a debit card and exchange your X12 for cash via ATMs that support the X12Coin Additionally a payment plugin for the very popular e commerce Wordpress plugin Woocommerce was developed which makes it easy for shop owners to integrate X12 payments The X12 team premined 2 7 million coins to fund the whole project This covers the personnel costs as well as the development of the amazing X12 ecosystem which will drastically makes using the coin easier Only 15% pre mining was conducted that is not much compared to other coins Many of them have been pre mined by 20% or more Pre mining was done to have coins to interact We spend them as needed or give them to employees as an incentive or they have been distributed to early adopters and developers who create value from day one Startups do this with equity we do it with pre mined coins It\xe2\x80\x99s a strong incentive for new employees to bind and motivate them Dash founder Evan Duffield has been supportive of pre mining Another benefit of pre mined coins is that a vast amount of the coins can be on the market immediately Cryptocurrencies are at the end of the day currencies and you can\xe2\x80\x99t spend a token if no one is buying and selling it DogeCoin initially started as a joke mined 100 billion coins inside two years which contributed to the buzz around the token We look at what helped others in establishing a cryptocurrency and what method they used to give traction to it Pre mining is a tool for the above reasons However the dosage of pre mining is key and we believe that 15% premining is the correct amount To see
