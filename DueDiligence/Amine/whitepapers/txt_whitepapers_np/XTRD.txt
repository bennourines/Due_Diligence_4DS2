FIX API XTRD Pro SPA via Joint Venture 2/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Abstract As of January 2018 there are over 120 standalone cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating trading in more than 1000 individual markets Daily trading volume for cryptocurrencies is now equivalent to 20 billion USD with a total market cap of over $700 billion The majority of the trading is concentrated among the top 20 exchanges denominated in multiple currencies ranging from crypto ones including Bitcoin and Ethereum to sovereign ones such as USD GBP JPY CNY and KRW among others Predictions point to growth toward a $1 2 trillion market capitalization in 2018 and a corresponding 3% average daily trading volume of $50 billion or more 1 Asset managers are beginning to see increased demand for cryptocurrency exposure in their portfolios over 500 active funds are being created to enter the market in 2018 and the regulatory climate is warming However the market is nascent and large spreads are common between exchanges on the same crypto pairs allowing for ample arbitrage opportunities that don\xe2\x80\x99t exist in more efficient markets The inefficiency is a product of cryptocurrency trading markets being highly fractured in terms of execution account setup automated access liquidity execution speed pricing and security XTRD was created by finance and trading professionals to solve those problems by both improving on and consolidating current trading practices Crypto Exchange by Daily Dollar Volume Top 40 Worldcoinindex com 12/10/2017 Bitfinex Coincheck GDAX Bittrex Binance OKEX

Craze Fuels Fund Launches 4 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Issues in the Crypto Space COMPLEX WEB OF EXCHANGES A combination of differing KYC policies means of funding interfaces and APIs results in a fragmented patchwork of liquidity for cryptocurrencies Trading in an automated fashion with full awareness of best pricing and current liquidity necessitates the opening and use of accounts on multiple exchanges coding to multiple API\xe2\x80\x99s following varying funding and withdrawal procedures Once those hurdles are cleared market participants must convert fiat currency to BTC or ETH and then forward the ETH on to an exchange that may not accept fiat necessitating yet another transaction to convert back to fiat Major concerns for market participants range from unmitigated slippage3 and counterparty risk to hacking prevention and liquidity HIGH FEES Execution costs are even more of a factor Typical exchange commissions are in the 0 1% \xe2\x80\x93 0 25% range per transaction (10 to 25 basis points) but the effective fees are much higher when taking into bid and ask spreads maintained by the exchanges As most exchanges are unregulated there is generally no central authority or regulator to examine internal exchange orders that separate proprietary activity from customer activity and ensure fair pricing We can simulate slippage using a volume slippage model Let\xe2\x80\x99s say we have an $1 000 000 order bitcoin is trading at $4 000 at the one exchange where 25 bitcoin are traded per minute The model calculates slippage(S) by comparing order volume (Ov) to total volume(Tv) S = 0 1* 0v Tv 2 The higher percent of the total volume that we order the higher the slippage There is only $100 000 of bitcoin available to trade per minute If want to fill our order quickly in 10 minutes by executing $100 000 worth of bitcoin per minute that will fill 100% of the volume traded in that time period and create 10% slippage That will cost $100 000 for an effective fill cost of $1 100 000 or 10% net cost THIN LIQUIDITY A large institutional order representing a sizable percentage of daily volume can move the market for a product and related products in an exchange by a factor of 5 10% That means a single order to buy $1 000 000 worth of bitcoin can cost an extra $50 000 $100 000 per transaction given a lack of liquidity if not managed correctly and executed on only one exchange By way of comparison similar trades on FX exchanges barely move markets a fraction of a percent those price changes cost traders money and deter investment Slippage is the difference between the price that the trader expects to pay for a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed 3 5 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Issues in the Crypto Space To reduce costs at one exchange we can try to spread the order out over time But since the price of bitcoin can vary significantly throughout the day simply delaying execution time doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve the price change problem TIME VS SLIPPAGE COST Slippage Cost $100 000 $80 000 $60 000 $40 000 $20 000 $0 20 40 60 80 100 Minutes to fill order FIGURE 1 TIME VS SLIPPAGE COST Instead by simultaneously routing an order to multiple exchanges XTRD can increase the total volume that trade is executing against in a short period of time and decrease its slippage This is done by splitting the \xe2\x80\x9cparent\xe2\x80\x9d order into smaller \xe2\x80\x9cchild\xe2\x80\x9d orders If we still want to execute our order in 10 minutes to take advantage of current bitcoin pricing we can reduce the slippage from 10% to 0 4% by routing our order simultaneously to 5 different exchanges This will reduce our slippage cost from $100 000 to $4 000 a 96% cost reduction The execution net cost is now $1 004 000 NUMBER OF EXCHANGES VS SLIPPAGE COST Slippage Cost $100 000 $80 000 $60 000 $40 000 $20 000 $0 1 2 3 4 5 Exchanges FIGURE 2 NUMBER OF EXCHANGES VERSUS SLIPPAGE COST 6 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 4 XTRD Solution XTRD IS LAUNCHING THREE SEPARATE PRODUCTS IN SEQUENTIAL STAGES TO SOLVE THE ONGOING PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAVING SO MANY DISPARATE MARKETS LOW PER MARKET LIQUIDITY UNFAMILIAR INTERFACES THAT LAG BEHIND FINANCIAL INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND DECENTRALIZED EXECUTION IN CRYPTO STAGE 1 \xe2\x80\x93 IMPLEMENTATION OF A MULTI EXCHANGE FIX API What is FIX The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol was created in 1992 to serve as the \xe2\x80\x9cuniversal\xe2\x80\x9d communication language for international financial transactions Since all order systems are different there was a strong need to communicate all executions between brokers exchanges mutual funds investment banks and direct market access participants using a universal format FIX is the standard means of communication for trading in global equity markets and is also heavily used in currencies bonds and derivatives Every large institutional and professional market participant uses FIX to trade and has been doing so for over 25 years FIX works by defining preset \xe2\x80\x9ctags\xe2\x80\x9d as value placeholders Orders are entered by defining variables in the tags \xe2\x80\x93 for example the value for \xe2\x80\x9cside\xe2\x80\x9d of the trade can be a 1 for Buy or 2 for Sell in Tag 54 There is currently no universal FIX interface to connect to crypto exchanges \xe2\x80\x93 each crypto exchange has its own though not necessarily proprietary communication standard Lack of a standard communication protocol hinders participants\xe2\x80\x99 ability to easily access multiple exchanges XTRD will launch a universal low latency FIX based API connecting to all crypto exchanges to make it easy for major institutions hedge funds and algorithmic traders to access all cryptocurrency markets by coding to just one FIX application in one format with which they are already intimately familiar This communications bridge will allow large market participants to easily add multi exchange crypto execution to their existing transaction systems jumpstarting universal crypto trading adoption among the institutional sector 7 2/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Solution Here is a FIX table to

Message Sample 8 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Solution STAGE 2 \xe2\x80\x93 LAUNCHING THE XTRD PRO TRADING PLATFORM Most finance professionals and active traders don\xe2\x80\x99t use web based trading platforms to consume market data and trade Instead they use robust secure standalone downloadable applications that allow for fast order entry immediate execution advanced charting and custom order types Those applications provide customer support including feature development tailored to their customers\xe2\x80\x99 demands The most successful of these applications become platforms that are used to manage trading across multiple systems and asset classes In the crypto space such a platform does not yet exist Currently there are only web based systems on each exchange that are slow and difficult to use A few aggregation platforms exist that do feature trading across exchanges but those aggregators too are web based and lack the low latency security and functionality that institutional and professional users would demand XTRD will launch XTRD Pro in 2018 a highly robust multi exchange standalone trading platform for active traders The platform will include among other features advanced consolidated order books hotkey order entry and custom order types with 24x7 uptime 4 9 STAGE 3 \xe2\x80\x93 SPA (SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS) LIQUIDITY AGGREGATION/CROSS EXCHANGE EXECUTION XTRD creates a single unified point of access to aggregate liquidity across exchanges for traders This aggregation allows traders to clear at the best possible prices while delivering the lowest possible transaction costs as well as atomic swap capability4 all with just one client side account XTRD SPA will be facilitated via Joint Venture (JV) partnerships with existing exchanges to minimize the regulatory hurdles as XTRD will function purely as a technology provider Exchanges will fulfill the custodial function while XTRD will clear balances from its inventory accounts at other exchanges to close the trades made by clients within the JV exchange XTRD has already secured a partnership with a major active exchange that facilitates trading in primary currencies and will soon do the same for alternative ERC20 tokens XTRD is focused on becoming the de facto trusted US based technology platform for large financial players to easily execute on crypto XTRD will generate revenues via execution fees market data sales VPS services software licensing and other ancillary income streams Operational funds for creating the platform and the balance sheet required to execute across multiple exchanges will be raised via a token generation event Atomic Swaps the ability to instantly exchange one cryptocurrency for another 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 4 XTRD TOKENS Trading fees will be collected through the cryptographic economy facilitated by the XTRD token XTRD is an ERC20 compliant utility token generated on the Ethereum blockchain and will be used as a means of payment by trading participants for services provided by XTRD XTRD tokens will be created via a token generation event scheduled for Q1 of 2018 Staking As XTRD tokens are used to pay for services on the XTRD trading network line tokens will be cycled back into the network Discounts of 25% on XTRD services (execution colocation market data software licensing) will be available for token holders in general and discounts of 40% on XTRD services will be available for token holders who maintain an average monthly stake of at least 50 000 XTRD tokens XTRD will utilize the funds generated form the token generation event to \xe2\x80\xa2 Facilitate the creation of the FIX API and XTRD GUI platforms \xe2\x80\xa2 Maintain a large balance sheet allowing for cross exchange execution with XTRD SPA \xe2\x80\xa2 Make markets in multiple crypto currencies to minimize spreads and increase liquidity for market participants \xe2\x80\xa2 Employ legal and compliance teams to ensure regulatory compliance and proactively engage with regulators \xe2\x80\xa2 Onboard sales and marketing teams to develop a client base and \xe2\x80\xa2 Create a venture arm to seed emerging trading technologies in the crypto execution space deemed complementary to XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s mission 10 2/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Team THE TEAM BEHIND XTRD IS BASED ON WALL STREET IN NYC AND HAS OVER 30 YEARS OF EXTENSIVE

to the exchanges to minimize latency in market data and order execution In short a client \xe2\x80\x9cloads\xe2\x80\x9d his strategy coded to our FIX API into our server close to the exchange matching engine We anticipate a surging demand for this service in 2018 as crypto trading becomes more universally accepted INTERNET LATENCY VPS LATENCY 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Milliseconds Figure 4 Internet vs VPS Latency \xe2\x80\x93 lower is faster Currently internet latency for order entry and execution is around 150 ms over the internet from a home or office that is not in a datacenter XTRD will cut that down by 100x through a VPS solution with an average latency of 1 5 ms and engage emerging high frequency traders across the crypto spectrum Liquidity will in turn deepen and spreads will narrow for the benefit of all market participants \xe2\x80\x93 resulting in a virtuous cycle of increasing liquidity and participation in the crypto space Utilizing current virtualization technologies one physical server can be converted to 10 15 servers Virtual servers will use the same physical network switch connection which will be linked to XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s trading platform VPS services will serve to popularize our execution services and execution services will concurrently serve to popularize VPS services The presence of this infrastructure allows us to serve as a \xe2\x80\x9cone stop shop\xe2\x80\x9d where one can provide all the required services for fullyfeatured cryptocurrency trading namely connection to all exchanges via one FIX API low transaction costs best price hosting and minimization of counterparty risk once the SPA gateway is developed From a technical standpoint XTRD will place our market data aggregation machines as close as possible to exchange colocations collect data on the spot and relay it in optimal binary format via a high speed link to the client\xe2\x80\x99s order management module 18 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Project VPS LOCATION EXAMPLE Looking at three major US crypto markets the Gemini exchange trading infrastructure is in Virginia GDAX and Bitfinex are in California Ping times from our Kiev office are as follows \xe2\x80\x93 a millisecond or \xe2\x80\x9cms\xe2\x80\x9d is 1/1000 of a second GDAX 17 5 GEMINI BITFINEX 22MS GEMINI 130 MS GDAX BITFINEX GEMINI 130 MS GDAX 17 5 MS BITFINEX 22 MS Average ping from Missouri (another colocation we have) looks like this 0 5 ms GDAX 0 5 ms 32 ms GEMINI BITFINEX GEMINI 32 MS GDAX 0 5 MS BITFINEX 0 5 MS 19 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Project Average ping from our colocation at Equinix NY4 major NJ datacenter housing financial networks 1 9ms GDAX BITFINEX 1 9ms 1 9ms GEMINI GEMINI 1 9 MS GDAX 1 9 MS BITFINEX 1 9 MS Based on this we can select an optimal geographic server location for the order management module which will allow for minimal latency both for market data aggregation and order execution \xe2\x80\x93 the optimal virtual solution for these 3 exchanges being NY4 if you are trading all 3 Missouri if only GDAX and Bitfinex and so on XTRD will select the optimal virtual location \xe2\x80\x93 or multiple \xe2\x80\x93 for all client algorithms depending on their required trading pairs and markets they participate in as well as the preferred equidistant location of their trading logic engine CYBERSECURITY Currently all exchanges have public internet connectivity Even with 2FA authentication and complex passwords there is still a constant threat of hacking ranging from simple password phishing to more sophisticated intrusions such as MITM (man in the middle) attacks where network traffic is intercepted between two parties or where entire websites are cloned with fake SSL certificates for the express purpose of collecting logon information A bad actor can gain access to a crypto trading account with an obfuscated IP and simply move all funds to an encrypted untraceable wallet on the blockchain XTRD will not allow public internet connectivity to the XTRD Private Network All market participants will connect via IPSec VPN with hardware based IP whitelisted end to end encoded communications for both FIX and XTRD PRO that encrypt all data packets All VPS and cross connects will be on our private network not accessible to the outside internet This is necessary to ensure safety of funds and to abide by cybersecurity compliance protocols already established in the institutional and professional trading space 20 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Roadmap FIX API \xe2\x80\x93 Q1 2018 Currently most cryptocurrency exchanges offer an http based REST API/Web socket for execution and market data Even though these APIs are mostly similar they are still heavily fragmented requiring many resources to unify into a single trading application FIX is widely adopted and much faster Therefore the first step for XTRD to develop a unified FIX API for market data order entry and funds movement When the FIX API is implemented XTRD will not act as a custodian of funds or execute from an inventory account but will instead facilitate trading for clients who have existing accounts at the most liquid exchanges by utilizing the FIX API to seamlessly place orders across the optimal mix of exchanges on which they have accounts \xe2\x80\x90 \xe2\x80\x90 \xe2\x80\x90 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 market and limit stop and stop limit trailing stop contingent multi contingent OCO (one cancels the other) and OTO (one triggers the other) Perform SMART routing \xe2\x80\x93 the execution engine will automatically choose the best execution path based on previous trading history and current market conditions (liquidity price slippage) Spread one large order across multiple exchanges \xe2\x80\x90Perform pre trade risk management \xe2\x80\x90Drop copy all executions to clients over a FIX API \xe2\x80\x90Handle up to 20 000 orders per second XTRD anticipates completion of a production multi market FIX API for crypto execution market data and fund movement by Q4 of 2017 We already have a FIX product (built originally for FX and Equity markets) with the capability to \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 21 Aggregate liquidity across different exchanges Manage orders books consistently in real time Build custom single order books based on an account\xe2\x80\x99s unique needs (e g I want to see quotes from Exchange A and B but not from C) Stream normalized market data to subscribers utilizing the FIX protocol Provide single trading interface over the FIX API to all connected exchanges Right now we support the following orders types 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Roadmap XTRD Pro Q2 to Q3 2018 XTRD is an advanced multi exchange manual crypto trading platform built by traders for traders XTRD principals have a combined 30 years of experience developing and administering front end systems for active traders in FX and equity as well as creating and maintaining the back end systems required to support front end trading This involves a combination of extensive knowledge in market data handlers and data feed parsing low latency execution engines ticker plants on site colocation infrastructure with exchanges advanced order types execution reporting database administration and other operational requirements as well as implementation of industry best practices CURRENT DIFFICULTIES WITH CRYPTO EXCHANGE GUIS AND SYSTEMS Most cryptocurrency exchanges have an antiquated bare bones system that is accessed through a webpage with limited functionality It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to engage in high speed multiexchange execution given the necessity of clicking scrolling and typing in updated pricing as the order books continually change For comparison most manual high speed trading systems utilize keyboard shortcuts and programmed functions as well as initial pricing for order entry automatically pegged to bid/ ask or +/ a certain liquidity threshold to cross the inside quote The order book representation is also quite antiquated with little to define individual market participants incomplete representations of liquidity and constant \xe2\x80\x9cbursts\xe2\x80\x9d of executions that come through in the aggregate because the exchange systems are too slow to pass through executions as they occur This creates a \xe2\x80\x9cdam\xe2\x80\x9d effect where there is a burst of orders which lag by hundreds of 22 milliseconds and sometimes whole seconds \xe2\x80\x93 a length of time that would be considered unworkable in any other active trading space Current crypto exchange systems are not robust enough to handle large traffic and varying order types As an example in late August 2017 a large crypto exchange had to disable all advanced order types for two months including stop losses and trailing stops to mitigate strain on their platform XTRD PRO IN DEPTH \xe2\x80\x93 FASTEXECUTION AGGREGATED MARKET DATA CUSTOMIZABILITY ADVANCED SCANNERS i Fast Execution Speed is key XTRD will keep all orders resident on our servers and pass executions to exchanges using our FIX API allowing for faster and more advanced order types that are currently either execute too slowly due to internal network latency or don\xe2\x80\x99t exist natively on exchanges or both Orders can be routed to one or multiple exchanges to take immediate advantage of price discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities If a client wants to place an order to buy 100 ETH/USD depending on his selected execution strategy XTRD will split the order into several pieces and execute them on multiple exchanges The client can then utilize different order types and Time In Force (FillOrKill ImmediateOrCancel GoodTillCancel) commands will work on a custom basis depending on available liquidity Advanced order types such as contigent and OCO as well as the usual Stop/Limit/ Market will be fully availabe XTRD Pro is being constructed for traders by traders with traders\xe2\x80\x99 feedback being the main driving catalyst for new features and advanced platform functionality 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Roadmap LP 1 LP 2 LP N PUB PUB NEW/UPDATE/ SUB DELETE PUB POP Commands get snapshot Figure 5 XTRD Order Book Composition and Market Data Management ii Aggregated Market Data XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s advanced FIX API and robust market data handlers combined with collocated hardware at exchange data centers will ensure fast reliable data delivery to XTRD Pro clients XTRD servers will receive raw market data feeds directly from exchange matching engines and therefore quote packet loss will be minimal once rebroadcast over the Internet greatly minimizing stale and crossed/locked quotes All data quotes for the same currency pairs (BTC/USD or ETH/BTC for example) will be aggregated to one order book from multiple exchanges Therefore the end user will have access to a much more liquid market in a unified fashion across multiple exchanges where he has accounts For example let\xe2\x80\x99s assume the volume for the ask price of ETH/USD at a price of $726 75 is as follows Gemini 51 45 ETH @ $726 75 GDAX 25 71 ETH @ $726 75 Bitfinex 72 13 ETH @ $726 75 XTRD can display this as ONE order for 149 28 ETH @ $726 75 or multiple orders broken down by exchange aggregated by price level similar to ECN structure in the equity markets 23 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Roadmap iii Customizability XTRD Pro will be fully customizable All time and sale watch lists position data pending orders layouts hotkey settings and the general look and feel can be modified and saved freely by individual traders based on their own unique trading demands All layouts can be saved on the cloud so that trading can seamlessly transition from the office to the beach and beyond The platform will cater primarily to institutional and active traders but can easily be used by less demanding clientele through simple point and click interfaces and beginnerfriendly preset layouts iv Advanced Scanners Traders are always on the lookout for opportunities XTRD Pro will provide a first look to the most viable and profitable trades Our scanners will focus on calculating immediate spreads across multiple exchanges for the same currency pairs spreads net of commission volumes at different exchanges \xe2\x80\x9cbreakout\xe2\x80\x9d currencies with new highs and lows and other proprietary filters Charting and studies will integrate all popular indicators ranging from moving averages and RSI to sector analysis volume filters and technical indicator scanners All opportunities can be easily acted upon from the execution windows with advanced global linking and multi exchange PNL analysis 24 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Roadmap SPA VIA JV \xe2\x80\x93 Q4 2018 SPA or Single Point of Access will allow XTRD to facilitate execution across multiple exchanges by opening just one account SPA will be facilitated via a JV agreement with existing cryptocurrency exchanges The first exchange to participate as a JV partner with XTRD is CEX IO with over $400 million USD daily volume 1 2 million active traders and 7 million unique visitors per month The JV agreement structure will allow XTRD to act as a technology provider/execution broker without having to assume the duties of fund custody and the requisite exchange regulatory and compliance overhead The exchange will take custody of client funds and maintain KYC while XTRD will act as the execution venue for the client\xe2\x80\x99s orders If an order needs to be filled outside the JV exchange XTRD will execute that transaction using our inventory account at another exchange and move the position over to the JV exchange where the customer\xe2\x80\x99s account is resident The customer will be debited for the transaction at the JV exchange and settlement will occur there XTRD will internalize client orders via the XTRD Dark Pool \xe2\x80\x93 if two orders match we will not need to go out to other exchanges to fill them but will instead match the market participants internally XTRD will employ Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) to settle trades CNS is similar to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) settlement system in the sense that there is an automated book entry accounting system in place except that XTRD will actually settle the trades much more quickly than T+2 or T+35 by continuously sweeping the positions between various exchanges This system will shield market participants from counterparty risk by maintaining multiple accounts across a swath of exchanges XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s centralized order management system will manage all positions for clients with a global position management system including risk management PNL and market exposure calculation mark to market performance in real time master/subaccount allocation and other advanced features Holding accounts on multiple exchanges will in addition to facilitating better price execution allow traders to specify a wider range of counterparties they wish to trade with In a sense this will create a wider range of entities with which each trader may decide to establish a credit like facility XTRD is filing for a patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office for the execution and settlement system logic XTRD DARK POOL Q4 2018 Cut out the middlemen We match sellers with institutional buyers for enormous crypto to fiat trades Decentralized dark pools can\xe2\x80\x99t take fiat or complete KYC Through our banking partners in the US the UK and in Hong Kong we do KYC and enable fiat to crypto Instead of paying the standard 12% commission you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay less than 1% when working through XTRD Dark You\xe2\x80\x99ll save millions 5 In securities markets trades settle T+3 or 3 days after the transaction takes place (now being shortened by the SEC to 2 days) although customers generally see the positions right away in their accounts as their clearing firm normally holds positions in \xe2\x80\x9cstreet name\xe2\x80\x9d or the clearing firm\xe2\x80\x99s account 25 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Top Level Architecture FIX Gateway Exchange A

2018 The XTRD utility token will be utilized on the XTRD network by market participants to pay for execution VPS market data software licensing and other fees Market participants will be able to purchase XTRD tokens directly from XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity pool The TGE will be preceded by a private institutional sale and a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Token) Platform based presale The XTRD token will be fully ERC20 compliant to ensure that it functions properly on the Ethereum blockchain similarly to other ERC20 tokens XTRD TOKEN LIQUIDITY AGGREGATION The XTRD token will be used to create liquidity in the overall cryptocurrency market Along with the utility of the XTRD token to pay for fees on the XTRD platform of products most of the XTRD token revenue will be used to increase the inventory of other cryptocurrencies that are in demand by our customers This will create points of liquidity for our customers to access across the worldwide crypto exchange ecosystem These liquidity points will be created using XTRD tokens that are paid back into the system for fees 70% of funds raised in the token sale will be used for liquidity aggregation XTRD STAKING Discounts of 25% on XTRD services (execution colocation market data software licensing) will be available for token holders in general and discounts of 40% on XTRD services will be available for token holders who maintain an average monthly stake of at least 50 000 XTRD tokens Fiat will be accepted at no discount to par Execution fees will generally be set as a percentage of the gross trade amount based on a combination of factors such as liquidity the pair being traded market conditions at the time of the trade and so on All charges will be marked to market and remain constant no matter the value of the XTRD token (a $10 charge will be 2 XTRD if $5 each or 0 5 XTRD if $20 each) TOKEN LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS XTRD tokens are ERC20 compliant utility tokens functioning on the Ethereum blockchain The value of XTRD is derived purely from serving as a medium of payment for services by market participants in the XTRD trading ecosystem XTRD tokens confer no voting rights profit participation equity ownership of intellectual property revenue sharing rights to dividends transfer of ownership upon company sale control of company assets or any decision making ability regarding XTRD or its\xe2\x80\x99 operations XTRD tokens are not designed for speculation In summary XTRD tokens are not securities XTRD Digital Assets Inc has obtained a qualified legal opinion concurring that XTRD tokens are not to be considered \xe2\x80\x9csecurities\xe2\x80\x9d under applicable U S securities laws given their failure to meet all prongs of the Howey Test 1 In what has become known as the \xe2\x80\x9cHowey Test\xe2\x80\x9d the U S Supreme Court specified that an investment contract for the purposes of the Securities Act means a contract transaction or scheme whereby a person (i) invests his/her money in a (ii) common enterprise and is led to (iii) expect profits (iv) solely from the efforts of the promoter or third party (i e \xe2\x80\x9cefforts of others\xe2\x80\x9d) All four of the above elements must be met for a contract to be considered a security within the meaning of the Securities Act 1 31 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Token Generation SAFT COMPLIANT PRESALE TO ACCREDITED INVESTORS or Simple Agreement for Future Tokens is an agreement being utilized by XTRD to allow accredited investors and institutions to participate in a future Token Generation Event It is a token presale open to accredited investors or those with an annual income of least $200 000 or net assets of $1 000 0000 exclusive of their primary residence The SAFT is modeled after the Simple Agreement for Future Equity or SAFE which originated out of Y Combinator and when used properly is fully compliant with the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D promulgated thereunder As the SEC has confirmed that the federal securities laws apply to token sales per its\xe2\x80\x99 recent SEC investigative report on DAO Tokens XTRD is taking a proactive approach to the XTRD token sale by properly utilizing the SAFT and ensuring that the risks which come with early stage investment opportunities are made clear to those accredited individuals or institutions that participate TOKEN GENERATION EVENT Following the SAFT presale if necessary XTRD will conduct a crowd sale of the XTRD token to accredited investors under Reg D and non US investors under Reg S Non accredited US investors will not be allowed to participate in the Token Generation Event to ensure proactive compliance with current US securities laws and regulations 32 TOKEN SALE TERMS XTRD TOKEN GENERATION EVENT (TGE) Instead of generating a sum of XTRD tokens in a pool prior to the TGE XTRD will generate tokens only as funds arrive For example if 10 ETH ($10 000 @ $1000/ ETH) arrives and generates 100 000 XTRD @ $ 10/XTRD during the public sale XTRD will generate another 50% of XTRD on that transaction for internal use or 100 000 XTRD for a total generation of 200 000 XTRD resulting from the 10 ETH received Timeline \xe2\x80\x93 Q1 2018 Institutional Private Sale \xe2\x80\x90 SAFT Platform Accredited Presale \xe2\x80\x90 Public Pre Sale \xe2\x80\x90 TGE/Public Sale Institutional Private sales SAFT Platform sales and Public Presale will take place at discounts tokens will be generated and sent to whitelisted participants at preagreed discounts as the TGE occurs As funds arrive during the TGE tokens will be generated continuously until either 1) the hard cap is reached (hard cap amount TBA) or 2) the final sale date is reached (final sale date TBA) No additional XTRD tokens will ever be created after the final sale date Token Par Value $0 10 per token pegged to USD 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Token Generation Token Allocation 50% 29% XTRD Reserve 10% Team 10% Advisor pool Figure 6 Token Allocation 50% Token Generation Event Token Generation Event Token Generation Event tokens will be sold via SAFT followed by a crowd sale if necessary This will be the primary liquidity pool for XTRD tokens 29% XTRD Reserve These tokens will be held in reserve by XTRD Reserve tokens will be allocated to incentivize partnerships between XTRD and cryptocurrency exchanges and to provide an additional pool of liquidity for tokens to be purchased by users in the XTRD ecosystem 10% Team Team tokens will be issued to XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s founding team and will also be subject to a 180 day vesting period from the date of the Token Generation Event 33 10% Advisor Pool Advisor pool tokens will be issued to current and future advisors XTRD advisors will consult on all facets of the XTRD project such as market structure cryptocurrency space developments execution systems regulations business development legal and other vital matters 1% Bounty Bounty tokens held in reserve to incentivize bug bounties for the XTRD smart contract to find potential bugs related to stealing or locking user funds stealing the bounty causing the \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d function to be uncallable and other smaller bugs Bug bounties will also apply to public Github repositories and coding projects/challenges XTRD will publicly release to the algo trading and crypto community 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 XTRD Token Generation Use of Funds 70% Balance Sheet for SPA 15% Platform Developments and Operations 5% Tech Acquisition Figure 7 Use of Funds 70% Balance Sheet for SPA In order to facilitate the SPA structure XTRD will need to allocate funds across inventory accounts in a spectrum of crypto exchanges This will be vital to ensuring speedy crossexecution for client orders and ensuring there is enough net capital to facilitate daily trades in between cross exchange position and currency sweeps \xe2\x80\x93 and to provide clients peace of mind regarding XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s net capitalization Accordingly most of the funds raised from the token sale will be used to maintain this balance sheet for trading capital The balance sheet will also serve to mitigate counterparty risk for clients while trading with multiple exchanges facilitated by just one trusted account 5% Sales and Marketing While the absence of any service comparable the XTRD is likely to lower the bar for customer acquisition costs XTRD will leverage traditional sales techniques as well as the principals\xe2\x80\x99 internal network to grow the business quickly through 2018 and beyond A sales and marketing budget is necessary to further this goal 5% Tech Acquisition Harnessing emerging technologies in the crypto execution space is vital to XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s business model Accordingly XTRD will allocate funds towards acquiring promising tech deemed complementary to XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s core mission of delivering robust innovative technologies and creating a higher standard of service and functionality in the cryptocurrency space\xe2\x80\x9d 15% Platform Development and Operations Funds allocated here will be used for salaries office space sub contractor software development work travel and other operational expenses 5% Legal and Compliance As the regulatory framework around cryptocurrency coalesces in multiple jurisdictions XTRD expects to work hand in hand with regulators and be ahead of the curve in terms of regulatory adherence rule drafting necessary registrations and preemptive legal analysis These are funds well spent 34 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 4 Revenue Generation Models EXECUTION FEES XTRD will charge execution fees for transactions effected via the XTRD platform These fees will generally be a percentage of the dollar volume of the trade in line with prevailing exchange charges XTRD tokens will be accepted as a means of payment As economies of scale increase under the SPA model and more volume is done across all exchanges XTRD anticipates passing through the savings of low execution fees to our clients Trade costs will vary depending on several factors including but not limited to trade volume if the order needs to be rerouted to another exchange or can be filled inside the XTRD Dark Pool and complexity of the execution MARKET MAKING Given XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet and a presence at multiple cryptocurrency exchanges XTRD anticipates acting in a market making capacity across numerous crypto currency pairs in different markets Market making involves maintaining a continuous bid and ask quote within a pre defined spread for a trading pair and then buying and selling simultaneously by taking the other side of buy and sell orders that enter the system Given the 24x7 nature of cryptocurrency markets and XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s principals\xe2\x80\x99 experience in algorithmic trading strategies we anticipate market making activity to serve as a continuous and sizeable revenue stream By acting as a market maker XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet will serve to stabilize sharp fluctuations in price caused by a lack of liquidity If competition develops for the inside quote among other prospective 35 market making entities this will only serve to increase the stability and execution quality in cryptocurrency markets and therefore benefit the community as a whole by catalyzing maturation of and growing confidence in the crypto trading space XTRD VPS VPS or Virtual Private Server is a service whereby a client can upload their coded trading strategy to our servers at a datacenter close to cryptocurrency exchanges and reduce their execution time by a factor of over 100x compared to trading via public internet lines By leveraging current virtualization technologies many clients can utilize the same physical server while managing their strategies securely and remotely This service is particularly attractive to hedge funds and institutions who will code to XTRD\xe2\x80\x99s universal FIX spec as it will eliminate the need cost and time investment to establish a point of presence directly at the datacenter XTRD VPS is a one stop solution \xe2\x80\x93 financial developers will be able to write to our API and co locate with us for industry leading speed VPS services are typically charged on a recurring monthly basis with longer term agreements and we expect exponential growth in managed services MRR for VPS beginning in 2018 XTRD anticipates production for VPS beginning in January of 2018 2/07/2018 \x0cVersion 1 5 Revenue Generation Models MARKET DATA Market data is generally free over the internet from multiple crypto exchanges but the data is 1) slow and 2) not coded to the same universal format As a result of those two current deficiencies to internalize multiple market data streams from multiple exchanges one would need to code to each exchange spec within their own application and then establish multiple physical locations at multiple data centers to collect this data quickly for example in a simple latency arbitrage6 trading application XTRD will obtain market data and build low latency infrastructure so that high frequency and automated trading clients can leverage our existing systems immediately In this scenario with market data feeds being unified and distributed in a low latency application XTRD anticipates that the feeds also can be monetized on an MRR basis as with VPS services As crypto markets evolve market data will begin to be sold as a commodity like market data at all other exchanges At that juncture XTRD anticipates becoming a licensed data vendor in the space as we will already have an existing client base and hardware infrastructure at all relevant data centers XTRD principals have extensive experience administering market data vendor relationships with NYSE NASDAQ CME OPRA Direct Edge BATS and other market data centers in the US securities space Current profits for established latency arbitrage players on US securities markets total in the billions of dollars per year As crypto markets mature we will begin to see a movement toward increased liquidity lower fees lower spreads and an increase in automated trading i e the same characteristics that define the securities latency arbitrage market XTRD is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this enormous opportunity by establishing the infrastructure now ahead of the curve SOFTWARE LICENSING Professional market data and trading platforms such as Bloomberg typically charge a monthly software fee for utilizing the platform especially if the platform is licensed across a spectrum of users in an organization Pricing gradients differ based on the functionality and type of user ranging from free basic versions to high end heavy duty platforms with all the bells and whistles XTRD anticipates leveraging the professional user adoption of XTRD FIX and XTRD Pro with a subscription software model also on an MRR basis CREDIT SLEEVE Market participants often have credit relationships with other specific counterparties but not with all For instance trader A may only want to trade with traders C and D but not B and E XTRD anticipates performing in a credit sleeve7 capacity for multi counterparty and multi leg cryptocurrency transactions For example if trader A has credit with XTRD and XTRD has credit with counterparty B but A does not have credit with counterparty B XTRD can act as a sleeve provider by crossguaranteeing execution to trader A with counterparty B in exchange for taking a small percentage of the trade as compensation Credit sleeves will allow XTRD to leverage our balance sheet and act as an intermarket mediator to create liquidity in the cryptocurrency space Latency arbitrage is the practice of trading the same asset for example BTC/USD across multiple exchanges to take advantage of different prices The most important components here are low execution fees to ensure the trade is profitable and high speed market data and order entry to allow a market participant to profit from the difference in price before prices converge and the opportunity is eliminated 6 A credit sleeve cross guarantees a transaction between two parties who do not have a credit relationship by utilizing a third party which has a credit relationship with both initial parties 7 36 3/07/2018 \x0cVersion
