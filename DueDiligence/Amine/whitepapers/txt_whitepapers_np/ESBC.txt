Software with an open source code is so valuable because the product can be improved and updated thanks to innovations of new active users Consequently developers encourage any initiative fight for transparency and freedom of information and believe that open codes are highly efficient We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re thankful to our predecessors for an opportunity to contribute to this growing ecosystem and to develop it in a new way for society 3 \x0cReliable algorithm Every modern project needs a trustful source code ESBC is based on the XDNA source code It is also a child of the popular cryptocurrency PIVX which is a fork of the cryptocurrency that created masternode system \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c DASH While the origin can be traced back to Bitcoin source code each project has chosen a particular direction with aims and ideals needed by the community which the project ESBC was created for We are going to expand and pay special attention to the confidential features of our predecessors\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 coin by the means of learning new technologies and meanwhile creating instruments and possibilities for integration of ESBC into modern

\x0cESBC Betting Platform The main product inside of ESBC ecosystem is a platform for bets in (betting on) popular sport(s) including cybersport(s) The main features of the platform are \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Registration without identity verification Guarantee of players\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 anonymity Absence of a third party during financial operations Loyal attitude to professional cappers Preferential terms if cryptocurrency ESBC is used \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Registration without identity verification For convenient use of the platform esbc pro possibility of registration and logging in with the help of social networks accounts such as Discord Facebook was implemented Identity verification on our platform is not required in contrary to the other popular Online betting companies (Players\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 personal data is not stored on the platform and that is why it cannot be transferred to 3d parties) \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Anonymity In accordance with the main cryptocurrency\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s principle \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c opportunity to stay anonymous platform\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s esbc pro developers implemented these ideals in the basics of platform\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s policy Already now you can make anonymous bets using ESBC without login and registration not need to verify your identity 6 \x0c\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Loyalty to professional cappers We have analyzed the problem of classical betting companies and their methods of fighting against professional gamblers (forkers statistics analysis supporters bets on the corridors etc ) and our team has chosen a concept of maximum loyalty to any betting methods on the base of platform esbc pro to attract as much audience as possible \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Absence of third parties In order to provide anonymity convenience and reduced player\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s expenses we paid special attention to the absence of third parties in all cryptocurrency operations on the platform The use of cryptocurrencies prevents possible leakage of the information about users\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 activity \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Margin and commission One of the methods to improve the competitive characteristics is reducing of bookmaker\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s margin and commissions for deposit and withdrawal of cryptocurrencies The use of cryptocurrencies allows to deposit bet withdraw coins from the platform and get the winning within less than a minute Low commission rates provide better coefficients in comparison with the old platforms using the old financial system \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Betting exchange (in progress) Betting exchange is a platform for betting between players on sports events There a player can suggest betting \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c choosing a particular event then offer his/her coefficient and the sum of bet on a particular result (in this case you sell the bet acting like a bookmaker) Or you can accept the betting conditions offered by other players \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c to buy the betting This way a player becomes a participant of the purchase process where betting odds are goods Consequently sports betting exchange is a mediator providing the players with a service for such purchase All deals are performed on the betting exchange without commissions 7 \x0cDescription of anonymous betting process When creating betting odds a separate address for every possible odds is generated (first team\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s victory second team\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s victory draw totals etc ) After that a user choses anonymity option and gets a wallet address where he is required to send coins to bet After the match reward will be sent to that address For the most anonymous coins (cryptonight) the system works differently a user designates an address for getting the winning then a unique address for determination and an identifier of the payment are generated to check if the bet was really sent from this user If the team being bet wins winning will be sent to an address indicated by a user Anonymous betting will be available for the huge number of cryptocurrencies 8 \x0cThe economic system ESBC presents a 4 tier masternode system \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Bronze 5 000 ESBC \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Silver 25 000 ESBC \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Gold 50 000 ESBC \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa2 Platinum 250 000 ESBC The difference in sizes of rewards is dynamic about 4% The four tier masternode deposit system simplifies the own node\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s launch for the users minimizing expenses for extra resources and time during launches of further nodes Stable growth of ESBC One of the most criticized objects in sports gambling with the use of cryptocurrencies is exactly the volatility cryptocurrencies Focusing on this problem as the prior one during the development of the economic scheme drastic deflation of the coins was planned as it will positively influence their price ensuring the stability of the platform\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s players\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 deposits On April 2019 block time in blockchain will be changed from 60 to 120 sec to increase stability and decrease emission every 6 months thereafter the reward will be halved The total amount of coins released by 2022 will be 25 481 245 To add other betting coins to the platform you will have to pay commission in ESBC \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c this way the developers who would like to see their coins will be required to buy the ESBC on Exchanges 9 \x0cDesign and visualization Through research and development we aim to create a visual design for ESBC that distinguishes it from competitors in the cryptographic market Our development team plans to innovate and experiment with the current UI / UX / Branding to eventually achieve excellence that will set an example for other projects It is made from the research of our competitors we use modern technological trends and standards constantly applying new and exciting visual effects to our project ESBC Wallet 2 design templates 10 \x0cSocial networks and feedback At the moment the main platform for our community is Discord You can join our Discord server and communicate with the members of community find out their opinion about the project Also there\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s a bot with a wallet function integrated into Discord
