to introduce you to the Skychain project Skychain is an infrastructure blockchain project aimed to host train and use artificial neural networks (ANNs) by market participants The first years of Skychain development will be devoted only to medicines that will help doctors and patients have accurate diagnoses by using this system Skychain is a sharing economy project which means that each member of the Skychain ecosystem provides resources and thus creates a product that is ahead of any competitor The system will reward each participant with lucrative benefits Skychain is a project that will uberize artificial neural networks with developers of individual ANNs rather than taxi drivers with consumers of ANNs (doctors and patients) rather than passengers and with miners\xe2\x80\x99 computers and servers rather than cars IBM estimates that the artificial intelligence market in healthcare will be $200 billion per year within a few years The goal of Skychain is to take a 70% share of this market It will achieve this goal by creating the best open infrastructure that will gather the resources of the majority of participants in this industry and surpass any closed corporate product In the future Skychain could expand beyond medicine and be used for building fast distributed training and a wide range of neural networks Problems in the Field of Medicine Hundreds of thousands of misdiagnosed patients die every year in the United States and the European Union alone Economic costs arising from complications caused by misappropriation of medicines total more than $100 billion per year Below are some of the main causes of incorrect diagnoses \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Doctors have a narrow view of the problem typically specializing in individual organs or body systems and often not seeing the picture as a whole Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 lack of experience and gaps in knowledge often result in their inability to diagnose rare diseases Doctors often do not have enough time to analyze anamneses due to a high utilization of methods and a lot of time spent on documentation Doctors may find it difficult to determine a disease just by X rays CT scans MRIs and histological tests for a non standard course of a disease and they may have a high dependence on their subjective experiences Artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks will completely change these scenarios in the field of medical diagnostics Medical Artificial Neural Networks Today Today artificial neural networks demonstrate their ability to diagnose more accurately than most doctors 1 Besides diagnosing ANNs can prescribe treatment and adjust it upon receiving new data and a patient treatment dynamic ANNs use large arrays of disease records from hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 patient records reference data and medical research data Many companies and laboratories are already successfully doing this Key participants in this market include the following 1 Creators of neural networks o Small laboratories that have trained one or two neural networks to solve a certain diagnostic problem For example a network may detect a specific type of oncology on a radiograph https //www newyorker com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai versus md https //www extremetech com/extreme/233746 ai beats doctors at visual diagnosis observes manytimes more lung cancer signals 2 \x0co 2 3 4 Large corporations such as IBM that create neural networks for a wide range of diagnostic tasks Medical data providers o Hospitals and state structures create their own medical data sets investing a significant amount of money into creating them These are disparate data sets and their owners do not want to share them since they prefer to receive a return on investment and income from the data o The current state of the market basically does not allow providers of medical data to earn money from the data since the creators of artificial medical neural networks are not ready to buy the data at a high cost Infrastructure providers o The current leader of manufacturers of equipment for training and using neural networks is Nvidia which provides specialized GPU processors with tensor cores that increase the performances of computing neural networks up to 10 times Other market participants include AMD Intel and a few others o Cloud services such as Amazon Google and Microsoft provide high processing power to ANN developers o Developers of libraries for building neural networks allow programmers and other specialists to quickly design and launch their own neural networks Consumers of neural networks o Today doctors do not have available access to external neural networks Individual neural networks are tested by individual clinics but widespread use is limited by the lack of public infrastructure o Patients are interested not only in more accurate and well founded diagnoses that could be obtained with the use of neural networks but also in self diagnosis For example a patient could photograph a mole to determine the risk of melanoma and so on These types of neural networks are not available today to ordinary citizens The medical neural networks market is still in its initial stage Here are some of the current problems \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Laboratories creators of ANNs find it difficult to provide access to end users (doctors) due to the lack of a single infrastructure Skychain will provide an analogue of an AppStore that will let any doctor use a certain neural network Experienced specialists in the field of artificial neural networks do not have access to medical data due to the large number of possible data providers and the high cost of the data Skychain contains a data marketplace that provides the possibility of training neural networks for a fee using a large number of data sets created by independent providers It offers the possibility to train the deepest and most accurate neural networks while paying the royalty to data providers Large corporations such as IBM cannot on its own train thousands of ANNs that are required to fully cover all areas of medical diagnostics Skychain will host thousands or even tens of thousands of highly specialized neural networks created by hundreds of laboratories and corporations The market of neural network development is constrained by the high cost of equipment for effective learning and the complexity of tools for building and training ANNs Skychain will provide convenient tools for building ANNs as well as inexpensive and fast learning with the help of Skychain\xe2\x80\x99s distributed computing resources that will surpass the computing power of large corporations\xe2\x80\x99 data centers Skychain will change the ecosystem of ANNs making them publicly available to all market participants Each participant will benefit from participating in the Skychain community About Skychain Skychain is a distributed open network project designed to accurately diagnose patients and prescribe an effective treatment Skychain has the following advantages 3 \x0c\xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Uploading any ANNs trained by laboratories or specialists to Skychain and receiving payment from ANN end users A data marketplace of Service for Deep Learning where medical data suppliers will be able to offer their data sets as a service for AAN training Effective use of miners\xe2\x80\x99 computing resources to ensure the smooth operation of a neural network Public pay per use access to neural network capabilities Open distributed storage of all ANNs within Skychain and its settings stored in a distributed chain of blocks according to blockchain principles Constant learning from a neural network upon adding new information and experiences Public Encrypted Distributed Storage of Author\xe2\x80\x99s ANNs Skychain stores all information about all ANNs in Skychain in an encrypted form Any specialist or company will be able to upload its neural network to Skychain designed and trained to effectively solve a particular task Then an author of the uploaded neural network will be remunerated by Skychain participants for each access to the service of his or her ANN Skychain for medical data providers is a data marketplace where they can provide their data as a service for training third party neural networks \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Trained neural networks on the supplier data sets can only be used with Skychain so the data set that providers will receive includes a guaranteed share of revenue from all neural networks trained based on their data The preparation of medical data sets will be beneficial for market participants who own this data Skychain takes care of the intellectual property of developers of neural networks and data owners A developed and trained neural network as well as the data set with which it was trained are protected from outside participants Effective Use of Miners\xe2\x80\x99 Computing Powers Today cryptocurrency mining has brought unprecedented computing power to miners in a single network Mining of modern cryptocurrencies has no value except for proof of performed work that serves as a basis for a cryptocurrency issuance and blockchain protection Skychain will change this Miners will perform useful work providing computing capabilities for a neural network Upon the completion of performed work (analysis of anamnesis referral to an additional examination diagnosis creation of a treatment record as well as learning ANNs) a miner will get a share of the cost of the provided service Thus miners will not only generate cryptocurrency emissions but will also perform a socially useful function of high economic value Public Pay per Use Access to Neural Network Capabilities Skychain is a project of a public ANN to which any participant or organization can connect Miners will provide their computing powers and receive the inner cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x94Skychain Global Coin\xe2\x80\x94as a reward Patients doctors medical institutions and online services will be able to use the Skychain capabilities by paying for each use of a neural network with Skychain Global Coin Creators of ANNs will be rewarded for each use of the ANNs they develop and train 4 \x0cConstant Learning of the Artificial Neural Network For each requested session of an artificial neural network Skychain will get feedback in the form of patient test results symptoms and recovery dynamics This feedback will constantly train the neural network making it more accurate and efficient In the future that should make Skychain the most accurate and trained therapist in the world Structure of Skychain Modules The Skychain project consists of several interconnected modules \xef\x82\xb7 SkyUI \xe2\x80\x93 Module for conducting an interactive dialogue with a doctor or patient o o \xef\x82\xb7 The module also recognizes test results in the form of structured documents SkyEngine \xe2\x80\x93 Core of the artificial neural network o o o o \xef\x82\xb7 The dialogue is conducted in an interactive form Besides text information the module can download images and graphic files with medical test results (MRI CT scan X ray histology endoscopy etc ) SkyEngine analyzes all information about the patient and gives a diagnosis or possible diagnoses and any medical tests and studies required for an accurate diagnosis It is a set of trained ANNs The input neural network classifies all the information received determining areas for a detailed analysis Then the input neural network sends all patient information to specialized ANNs checking for the presence or absence of certain diagnoses or problems In the case of severe diseases specialized ANNs will perform differential diagnostics of diseases and confirm or reject diseases that threaten the life or health of a patient SkyLearningZone \xe2\x80\x93 Closed area for neural networks training o o o o o o The SkyLearningZone is the data marketplace where medical data providers can provide their data sets as a service for the training of third party neural networks Trained neural networks on the supplier data sets can only be used with Skychain so data set providers will receive a guaranteed share of revenue from all neural networks that are trained based on their data One neural network can be trained using several data sets of a single medical area thereby achieving significant depth and accuracy Neural networks that were trained in SkyLearningZone cannot leave this zone Their authors will not be able to copy their neural networks but can only provide paid access to their functions That ensures that the owner of the data will receive a royalty from all neural networks trained on the basis of the data It also guarantees the preservation of the value of the supplier\xe2\x80\x99s data When training neural networks in SkyLearningZone the structure and code of the neural network cannot be downloaded from SkyLearningZone so the author of the neural network guarantees the safety of its own developments and know how All the neural networks trained in SkyLearningZone are automatically ranked because in addition to training the neural networks are tested and their accuracy and quality determined automatically 5 \x0c\xef\x82\xb7 SkyConstructor \xe2\x80\x93 An interactive environment for building and training ANNs o o o \xef\x82\xb7 The module provides ready made patterns of ANNs in order to quickly build a neural network An ANN author creates a description of the neural network and uploads it to Skychain paying a reward to the system (miners) for adding the neural network to the blockchain SkyTherapist \xe2\x80\x93 Module for creating treatment protocols o o \xef\x82\xb7 An ANN author builds te structure of an ANN in a visual editor and selects its learning mechanism A specialized module consisting of a database of scientific researches and recommendations trained on patient records by a neural network The module generates the most effective treatment protocol according to the patient diagnosis test results and general information (growth age drug tolerance medical history etc ) SkyMobile \xe2\x80\x93 A mobile application that allows patients to get independent service by using Skychain on their own Tasks solved at the first stage include the following o o o Diagnosis of melanoma according to a photo from a mobile phone Analysis of symptoms of a patient who does not require emergency hospitalization and recommending medicines that do not require a prescription Detection of risks and threats to the patient\xe2\x80\x99s health and a recommendation to contact the nearest doctor if detected Road Map 01/2017\xe2\x80\x9311/2017 Research and development works carried out in key areas of the project The working capacity of all key technologies and algorithms of Skychain confirmed Thus Skychain is based on a fully developed architecture algorithms protocols and approaches Pre ICO \xe2\x80\x93 December 2017 The fundraising plan

Skychain will demonstrate its usefulness and vitality to the medical community and continue developing Sky\xd1\x81hain Beta \xe2\x80\x93 December 2018 Skychain keeps developing with additional opportunities for test analyses being added SkyTherapist is trained on the basis of scientific research and analyses of case histories SkyTherapist is launched in a limited mode \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Creation of an effective protocol for the treatment of the most common diseases (infectious chronic etc ) with out patient treatment Generating an effective protocol of treatment of some common cancers Doctors will independently enter a patient\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis and information about the patient analyzes into SkyTherapist which offers a doctor several effective treatments according to the accumulated knowledge Sky\xd1\x81hain Release \xe2\x80\x93 June 2019 Launch Skychain in full scale including the SkyUI module for interaction with a doctor and a patient SkyEngine trained to diagnose diseases and SkyTherapist providing treatment protocols for most diseases The further development of Skychain will be evolutionary\xe2\x80\x94the neural network will be trained identifying diseases with ever increasing accuracy and providing more effective treatment protocols 2025 By 2025 we expect that Skychain\ s capabilities in the field of hosting any ANNs as well as the huge computing resources of Skychain miners will be in demand by specialists in a wide range of areas not just medicine Skychain Usage Scenario Building and Training an Artificial Neural Network Laboratory staff at a medical clinic with a large array of patient data decided to design and train their own neural network not only to improve their clinic\xe2\x80\x99s performance but also to provide outside doctors with access to their neural network Building an artificial neural network Bill a laboratory analyst created a new neural network using the SkyConstructor tools on the basis of a publicly available neural network pattern\xe2\x80\x94an analyzer of graphic images Using the visual builder SkyConstructor Bill made changes to the neural network structure by adding additional layers and blocks to best configure the neural network to solve his application problem Preparation for learning Bill\xe2\x80\x99s assistant Tom prepared an array of data for training in the form of a specially structured data set The system will be trained according to this data set Training an artificial neural network 7 \x0cBill added the prepared data set using the SkyConstructor tools indicating a neural network training budget of 150 Skychain Global Coins provided by his company These 150 coins will go to miners who will perform calculations necessary for training a neural network according to the specified data set Thousands of miners\xe2\x80\x99 computers downloaded this neural network to their memories and trained Bill\xe2\x80\x99s network in several iterations The final neural network was on Bill\ s computer and the miners were rewarded Distributed training reduced the training time to tens of minutes instead of days or weeks that would be required for training on one server Testing an artificial neural network Bill tested the trained neural network through SkyConstructor on an additional (testing) data set The network operated correctly with high accuracy Publishing an artificial neural network Bill entered the registration information about his neural network (class description of input data result cost of access to the neural network author etc ) using SkyConstructor signed a manifesto with a laboratory certificate and executed the command \xe2\x80\x9cUpload a neural network in the blockchain \xe2\x80\x9d Bill set the transaction reward of 20 Skychain Global Coins for a miner who creates another block In about 10 minutes a new block was created in the Skychain blockchain and Bill\ s neural network became available to any doctor anywhere in the world Bill set a reward of one Skychain Global Coin that each consumer must transfer to Bill\ s (or his laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s) digital wallet for each inference operation (using a neural network for diagnosis) Alternative learning scenario using the Skychain data marketplace ANN lab specialists are experienced professionals in the field of neural networks but they do not have the necessary medical data to create neural networks in the field of medicine In the SkyLearningZone interface in the Data Marketplace section these specialists selected the data sets that contained information on the diagnosis of diseases by MRIs and received sample data for each data set Using these examples ANN lab specialists developed a neural network tested its training on open examples and decided to conduct its training The ANN lab uploaded its neural network to SkyLearningZone and trained its neural network using all selected data sets paying only the cost of computing resources needed for training\xe2\x80\x94450 Skychain Global Coin After training SkyLearningZone automatically checked the accuracy and quality of the neural network The accuracy was 99 98% which is higher than any neural network currently in the market The ANN lab published its neural network in the Skychain registry while the neural network (its trained state) remained in SkyLearningZone and is available for use only within Skychain Use of Neural Networks by Consumers For clarity in this section we will provide a short example of using Skychain in a fully completed form The clinic where therapist Tom works purchased Skychain Global Coins at the price of $1 50 for one Skychain Global Coin to use Skychain and transferred the coins to Tom\ s wallet All fees for operations are approximate Initial treatment Patient Mike contacts therapist Tom Mike has symptoms that have been haunting him for the last month and now have escalated Tom opens the SkyUI interface and enters Mike\ s symptoms and complaints into the program online in a dialog mode SkyUI asks a few clarifying questions about the illness and tolerability which Tom answers using the interface After that all received information is sent to the distributed neural network SkyEngine and a system charges a commission of 10 Skychain Global Coins from Tom\ s wallet In response Skychain gives the following information \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 List of possible diagnoses with their probability coefficients Request for additional medical tests for Mike to clarify a diagnosis 8 \x0c\xef\x82\xb7 Protocol of symptomatic treatment to alleviate symptoms and protect Tom from the development of the most dangerous probable diagnosis Ten Skychain Global Coins which are sent to the system will be credited to the accounts of Skychain miners who provided their computing resources in order to process this request Entering additional information Mike does additional tests recommended by Skychain and starts treatment according to the protocol recommended by Skychain Mike comes to the second appointment with therapist Tom Tom enters the results of Mike\ s analysis and treatment dynamics in the form of Mike\ s current symptoms blood pressure temperature and so on into the SkyUI interface All the information is then sent to the SkyEngine distributed neural network and the system charges a fee of 10 Skychain Global Coins from Tom\ s wallet In response Skychain provides the following information \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Two possible diagnoses for Mike* Request for an additional test for differential diagnostics and the final diagnosis Updated treatment protocol to protect Mike from the negative development of any of the two diagnoses The protocol of treatment also takes into account individual indicators of Mike\ s tests tolerability of medicines and their interaction *Skychain determined that one of the possible diagnoses was missed in the initial selection That information was sent back to the neural network so it learned to recognize it Final diagnosis Mike did an additional test to exclude one of the two diagnoses and came to Tom with the test results Tom entered the results into SkyUI After that all received information was sent to the distributed neural network SkyEngine and the system charged 10 Skychain Global Coins from Tom\ s wallet In response Skychain provided the following information \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Mike\ s final diagnosis Treatment protocol Prognosis full recovery in three months Course of treatment During treatment patient Mike visits therapist Tom every week and Tom enters Mike\ s symptoms and new test results into SkyUI After that all received information is sent to the distributed neural network SkyEngine and Skychain transfers a reward of 0 1 Skychain Global Coins to Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wallet The reward motivates Tom to continue entering information about Mike allowing Skychain to learn monitor the treatment\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness and confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis Treatment adjustment During the treatment Mike has two problems \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 He poorly tolerates one of the prescribed medicines He has a sore throat resulting in the need to adjust the treatment Therapist Tom enters into SkyUI the information about the poor tolerability of one of the medicines as well as information about the sore throat After that all received information is sent to the distributed neural network Skychain and the system charges a commission of 10 Skychain Global Coins from Tom\ s wallet In response Skychain provides the following information \xef\x82\xb7 Changed treatment protocol and recommendations for the period of the sore throat Expected treatment period Since Skychain gave a prognosis of full recovery in three months then three months after the start of treatment Skychain will ask Tom to provide information about Mike\ s health 9 \x0cTom can do one of the following \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Enter information about Mike\ s recovery and Skychain will transfer Tom a reward of 1 Skychain Global Coin Enter detailed information according to the information requested by Skychain\xe2\x80\x94results of new tests based on the results of recovery and a detailed description of the recovery progress After that Skychain will transfer Tom a reward of five Skychain Global Coins Uploading Storage and Execution of Private ANNs and Payment for Them The basis of SkyEngine is a large stack of ANNs capable of performing specific tasks to diagnose symptoms analyze medical images differentiate diagnoses and so on Before launching the project the Skychain project team will fill Skychain with a certain number But the main strength of Skychain is its distribution and openness Any specialist in a particular disease a medical institution with a lot of case histories a scientific laboratory and more will be able to create their own neural networks and upload them to Skychain SkyEngine will provide tools that will allow independent professionals to design their own ANNs and train them on real data using Skychain computing resources Then these ANNs will be uploaded to Skychain in an encrypted form After that the creators of the ANNs will get a reward for each use of their neutral network by a doctor Medical specialists will evaluate the quality of the neural network by raising or lowering its rating on a public list For example the Institute of Intestinal Diseases can build train and upload a neural network that will detect and carry out various diagnoses of Crohn\ s disease ulcerative colitis IBS and other specific intestinal diseases according to medical tests histology and endoscopy images It can then enter them into Skychain and be remunerated for every use of its neural network by doctors around the world Skychain will protect the intellectual property of the ANN\xe2\x80\x99s authors Nobody can use a neural network uploaded to the public blockchain Skychain by its author without paying a fee set by its author How will that be implemented When building a neural network it will automatically include encryption of the output signal In fact anyone will be able to perform calculations on a network uploaded by its author and read its structure and parameters from the public blockchain But to get the correct result of calculations and the result of the neural network calculations an incoming signal must be sent to the computer/server of the ANN\xe2\x80\x99s author Then a specially created neural network will quickly decrypt the signal on the author\xe2\x80\x99s computer and return the final correct calculation result An ANN decrypting a signal will also be stored in a public block but it will be encrypted with an author\ s key so only the author can decrypt it and run it About 99 9% of computing costs for performing a neural network will be distributed on the basis of an open part of the author\ s neural network Then 0 1% of computing costs generated on the author\ s computer to secure storage of configured and trained ANNs in Skychain will allow using Skychain to publish any ANNs Skychain will provide paid access to these ANNs with unprecedented computing resources to perform calculations and it will protect the intellectual property of the authors of the ANNs 10 \x0cSkychain Architecture Blockchain Network The central element of the Skychain ecosystem is the blockchain network that provides interaction among network participants A block whose size is limited to 10 MB includes confirmation of the execution of the following operations (transactions) \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Skychain Global Coin transactions Requests for an inference using a

block) Updating a neural network (10 per block) The service charges a fee for each transaction The fee is set by the authors of the transactions A large fee increases the chance for a transaction to be included in a block A block includes only a neural network manifest (description) value and its hash value A neural network is included in a separate P2P storage The network operation is ensured by the proof of stake concept Data Storage To prevent excessive growth of the Skychain blockchain network the configuration of neural networks as well as training data sets are published and stored in a separate P2P network The hash of the recorded data is stored in the blockchain network Creating an Artificial Neural Network Using the SkyConstructor toolkit Skychain users create and customize layers of the neural network indicating the algorithms for its learning and sets of test data Upon completing the configuration the creator of the neural network pays for its training with Skychain Global Coin coins Distributed Training Skychain will provide an opportunity for distributed training A server that controls the training process will attract additional network servers to training Then the controlling server will distribute an artificial neural network module and its initial parameters to training servers After that training servers will perform the following iterative training 1 repeat a) Send a unique part of the data set to each server b) Get updated neural network parameters received through training from each trained server on the forwarded data set \xef\x83\x91\xef\x81\xb7\xef\x81\xa9 c) Calculate updated neural network parameters \xef\x81\xb7\xef\x80\xa0 based on all\xef\x80\xa0\xef\x83\x91\xef\x81\xb7\xef\x81\xa9 d) Send updated neural network

corporations to Skychain In that case all calculations are performed on the neural network owner\xe2\x80\x99s server and Skychain is used as an infrastructure providing access to this neural network for consumers and rewarding its owner Encrypted publishing \xe2\x80\x93 SkyConstructor provides tools for building a neural network and those results can be obtained only with the use of several layers in an enclosed part of the neural network located on its author\xe2\x80\x99s computer A neural network\xe2\x80\x99s author completes the calculation A neural network\xe2\x80\x99s author and the

information about the IS (incoming signal) patient and giving the result of OS (resulting signal) calculations NN consists of PubNN an unencrypted public part of the neural network in the blockchain Any Skychain member can run PubNN 12 \x0cfor calculations Priv1NN and Priv2NN are encrypted decoding neural networks within NN They are encrypted in the blockchain with the NN author\xe2\x80\x99s key Priv1NN and Priv2NN are executed on the author\ s computer These neural networks do not require significant computing resources for operation but they are an integral part of the NN artificial neural network The result of PubNN calculations is inaccurate without them So the incoming signal is first processed with PubNN on a miner\xe2\x80\x99s computer or server and takes 99% of computing resources Then the PubNN calculation result and incoming IS signal are transmitted to the NN author\xe2\x80\x99s computer/server where the final result OS is calculated with Priv1NN and Priv2NN neural networks OS is sent to the user directly from the author\ s server How are Priv1NN and Priv2NN created They are small neural networks generated automatically by Skychain tools when building a neural network Priv1NN and Priv2NN take part in the NN training and become its integral part The result of PubNN calculations is inaccurate without them This has the following advantages \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 99% of computing costs are performed on any free Skychain server That maximizes the distribution and utilization of network servers Authors of neural networks are protected from users copying or using it without their permission They also have guaranteed remuneration in the amount set by each author for each operation that uses the author\xe2\x80\x99s neural network The author can always restore the encrypted decoding neural networks from the block if the author knows the private key (password) Mining and Monetization At the launch of the Skychain project all SCH tokens will be exchanged for a similar amount of Skychain Global Coin Global Coins One token is equal to one coin The release of additional coins is impossible Miners creating new blocks in the chain will have the following rewards \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 \xef\x82\xb7 Reward for each operation that includes a new artificial neural network in the system (one operation per unit) Reward for each operation that changes a neural network\xe2\x80\x99s owner (lot sale transaction) Reward for each operation that changes a neural network\xe2\x80\x99s content by the developer (uploading a new neural network version to the blockchain) Reward for transfers of Skychain Global Coins within the network The core of the network will be the master nodes Each master node must have a deposit of 100 000 SGC High performance servers such as Nvidia DGX 1 that specialize in artificial intelligence calculations contain many GPUs and tensor cores that are often required for training and calculating deep neural networks Therefore the management company Skychain Global will approve only the master nodes that correspond to the performance of at least 50% of the performance of the average network master node We also expect that as Skychain penetrates the work of medical personnel Skychain Global Coins will become a convenient and widespread means of payment That will increase a demand for Skychain Global Coins for the income of Skychain participants and system token (coin) holders Distribution of Tokens at the ICO A total of 14 400 000 Skychain tokens will be issued \xef\x82\xb7 Up to 12 000

higher exclusion of implied warranties may not apply to you personally Prohibition of ICO in some countries Legislation in your country may explicitly prohibit you from participating in an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) If that is the case you cannot participate in the Skychain ICO 22 \x0cFAQs You are talking about diagnosing using medical test results and test images Can this even be implemented Yes Several dozen neural networks have already been implemented and trained by specialists around the world solving these tasks as the best specialists in their fields This area is developing dynamically In 10 years most diagnoses will be made by neural networks probably under the supervision of a living doctor Then what is the use of Skychain if all this is developing fine without it The problem is that these neural networks function within laboratories and institutions and there is no mechanism for the unified use of neural networks by doctors Skychain will unify all these distributed neural networks and provide doctors with a single window for their use Skychain\ s data marketplace will allow the best specialists in the field of artificial intelligence to quickly develop and teach neural networks using the amount of medical data which no organization or state can ever collect in one place The number and quality of Skychain\ s neural networks will thus be unattainable for any private or public project In addition by uploading information about a patient into Skychain a doctor can analyze it in dozens (or even hundreds) of different neural networks and get the most complete state of a patient What market share does Skychain claim IBM estimates the artificial intelligence market in medicine at $200 billion a year in a few years The goal of Skychain is to gain more than a 70% share of this market The way to achieve this goal is to create the best open infrastructure that will accumulate the resources of the majority of participants of this industry and surpass any closed corporate product What does blockchain have to do with it Blockchain will store all neural networks developed by hundreds of laboratories and organizations in a single registry so any neural network can be calculated on any server connected to Skychain In addition storing neural networks in a single registry is safe for the author since no one except the author can get a reward for the use of the neural network and it cannot be unloaded and launched outside Skychain because the calculation result is decoded in the author\xe2\x80\x99s neural network computer with the author\xe2\x80\x99s private key What are the advantages of Skychain for developers of neural networks Today developers of neural networks must purchase expensive equipment to train their artificial neural networks experiment with various neural network structures and select the best structure to solve their problems With Skychain any researcher can build their own artificial neural network using SkyConstrucor builder tools pay for renting the required computing resources with Skychain Global Coins and train their neural network The developer will also be able to train the neural network using a large number of data sets provided by independent suppliers which will make it possible to train the deepest and most accurate neural networks Then Skychain will allow an author to get remuneration from the neural network\xe2\x80\x99s end users That will motivate developers of neural networks to upload their neural networks to Skychain and thus develop the Skychain ecosystem Will calculations and training of neural networks be distributed 23 \x0cYes When a doctor sends information about a patient and the test results this information is distributed to many neural networks and executed on a variety of servers at the same time Neural networks can also be trained in parallel For example one server (e g of a neural network\xe2\x80\x99s developer) controls the training process and plenty of servers of miners consistently train it on individual examples and send the neural network parameters to the controlling server to combine them The calculation of neural networks (inference) will be performed on a miner\xe2\x80\x99s server and decrypted on the neural network owner\xe2\x80\x99s server But an inference is not a costly operation and is effectively performed even on one server What are the advantages of Skychain for miners Skychain miners can provide their computing resources and get paid not only for mining cryptocurrency coins but also for providing a requested service which is a solvent demand This fundamentally sets Skychain mining apart from the mining of classic cryptocurrencies (BTC ETC etc ) where miners perform useless calculations only for proof of work What are the advantages of Skychain for doctors and patients Skychain will be able to analyze information about a patient according to medical tests history symptoms and research results Moreover this analysis can be performed with hundreds of different neural networks at once that will not miss any important detail and can effectively diagnose rare diseases and improve the quality of diagnostics A doctor and a patient will be able to get a reliable second opinion from Skychain Can Skychain be used for other tasks that are not in the medical neural network Yes Skychain architecture allows the storing and processing of any neural network We are focusing on medicine at this stage since there is a very urgent need and the project organizers have rich experience in that field Some large companies (IBM Google) design and provide their neural networks for rent including for medical purposes Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they will monopolize this market and leave no room for Skychain These companies\xe2\x80\x99 developments are interesting but training even one artificial neural network for the diagnosis of a single disease is a complex task that requires painstaking work to design a neural network and prepare a large data set for its training A neural network often must be redesigned and retrained after the training In Skychain developers will be able to train their neural networks using a large number of data sets provided by independent suppliers for reward which will make it possible to train the deepest and most accurate neural networks Thousands of independent laboratories will be able to place their neural networks on Skychain and no corporation in the world can spend that much intellectual and human resources to create that product Just like no taxi company can compete with the Uber drivers network in the number of cars no software developer can compete with the App Store in the number and coverage of applications Some companies such as Amazon provide computing resources of their data centers for rent to neural network developers for training and calculations These centers are very efficient Will the use of Skychain computing resources for training neural networks be in demand Yes Data centers of large corporations are extremely big But if you look at the current blockchain networks such as Ethereum you can see that these networks combine huge computing resources of miners that are more superior in their processing powers than any centralized data center That\xe2\x80\x99s why Skychain will provide more computing power and at a better price than any corporation 24 \x0cHow do you assess a chance of project failure We admit that at the pre ICO or ICO stage there may be a situation where the project\ s tokens will not be redeemed and we will not be able to develop the project without this support Project failure is possible in this case But we are 100% sure that a platform with principles outlined in our white paper will be created and universally recognized Modern technologies allow for the creation of such a system which means it will definitely happen since its high value for people is obvious If the ICO is successful we are confident that we will implement Skychain and that it will be universally recognized Ok this project is really interesting but why do you think it is your team that should implement it The Skychain project is at the intersection of five fields 1 Blockchain 2 Artificial neural networks 3 IT in medicine 4 Sharing economy 5 Cryptography The founders of Skychain have deep knowledge and extensive experience in all these fields In addition it is extremely important that they have decided to devote their lives to the Skychain project Why did you choose ICO and not attract venture investment The attraction of classical investors reduces the level of independence of the team and the project We want to remain independent and not rely on investors\xe2\x80\x99 opinions and their short term goals to develop Skychain Therefore we chose an ICO model and hope for community confidence in our project team and goals What equipment do I need for Skychain Global Coin mining Skychain Global Coins can be mined with computers that have 4\xe2\x80\x938 powerful video cards Algorithms of artificial intelligence use matrix multiplication operations (BLAS GEMM) which is most efficiently computed on tensor cores such as Nvidia\xe2\x80\x99s Tesla V100 The use of tensor cores allows the training and calculation of Skychain neural networks to speed up by 12 times The field of artificial neural networks is rapidly developing and new architectures libraries and approaches to training are emerging What if Skychain lags behind Skychain is an infrastructure We will be adding support for all widespread libraries and tools For example if a new library for artificial neural networks that solves problems well appears tomorrow we will test it and include its support in our core Skychain will thus speed up the progress in this area and the use of the latest developments and libraries by a wide array of specialists and consumers Participation in Skychain Participation in
