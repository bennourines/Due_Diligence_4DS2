\x0cOmnitude will make the online retail marketplace more transparent more profitable and more secure Omnitude is a blockchain smart platform that connects blockchain technologies eCommerce platforms and enterprise systems involved in building end to end supply chains Utilising Omnitude as an integration layer between existing systems enables rapid deployment of blockchain technology without the need to replace current systems Page | 4 \x0cOmnitude enables businesses to solve problems in ways that were not previously possible without the rise of blockchain technology Omnitude can help achieve \xe2\x80\xa2 The creation of transparent and accountable manufacturing and supply chains \xe2\x80\xa2 A significant reduction in eCommerce fraud \xe2\x80\xa2 The enablement of a single customer identity for use across any Omnitude connected eCommerce site \xe2\x80\xa2 Blockchain integration between enterprise systems such as ERP & WMS \xe2\x80\xa6 and many more solutions from Omnitude and the community built as Omnitude Apps Page | 5 \x0cThe Omnitude platform will itself be open and transparent enabling anyone to design and build Omnitude applications to integrate with existing solutions in eCommerce supply chain and enterprise systems We aim to revolutionise eCommerce and supply chains with blockchain technologies Page | 6 \x0cWhat is Omnitude Omnitude is a pioneering project to revolutionise connectivity between blockchain technologies and eCommerce platforms & enterprise systems The Omnitude platform will act as middleware enabling simple integration of blockchain technology into existing systems and in doing so transforming their capabilities It will do this in two phases Page | 7 \x0cPhase One The first phase of Omnitude will launch the Omnitude platform this will enable connectivity between numerous technologies and platforms and allow them to take advantage of blockchain technology quickly and efficiently Phase Two During the second phase both the community and the Omnitude team will build Omnitude apps to solve specific use cases There are already several Omnitude Apps designed for launch that are detailed in the use cases section Page | 8 \x0cOmnitude technology will enable a wide variety of different applications to be built The Omnitude team will build its own whilst supporting the community to develop their own through open documentation example code and support Page | 9 \x0cTo help fund these initiatives we are launching our ECOM utility token As well as offering an opportunity to be an integral part of the Omnitude community the ECOM token presents a robust option to realise the potential rewards that groundfloor involvement means for this pioneering project Page | 10 \x0cWhat is the ECOM token An ECOM token will be launched alongside the Omnitude platform Merchants customers and suppliers will require ECOM crypto currency or FIAT to participate in the Omnitude ecosystem The initial ECOM tokens issued will be used to fund the development of the Omnitude platform and ecosystem incentivise participants to operate and secure this ecosystem and create a common settlement method for people to participate in the Omnitude ecosystem Page | 11 \x0cThe State of eCommerce Page | 12 \x0cIn terms of volume and value global eCommerce sales in 2016 were estimated to be worth $1 86 trillion and are projected to grow to $4 48 trillion by 2021 That is big business by any measure Of this China and the US will combine for $1 584 trillion in eCommerce sales in 2017 representing 69 1% of global eCommerce revenue In 2017 mobile commerce will account for more than 70% of eCommerce sales in both China and India and 59 0% in South Korea In Germany the UK and US mCommerce will comprise at least one third of total retail eCommerce sales https //www emarketer com/Report/Worldwide Retail Ecommerce Sales eMarketersEstimates 20162021/2002090 but as this market grows so does the potential for fraud and the imperative for transparency for everyone Page | 13 \x0ceCommerce Fraud This booming online industry is facing some serious challenges In fact 45 percent of merchants and suppliers have lost more than $1 million in revenue due to challenges faced when integrating cross channel capabilities into their commerce strategy according to 1WorldSync\xe2\x80\x99s recently released study Charting Course for llGlobal Commerce Online payment fraud is set to not only keep the pace but grow to an even bigger problem for eCommerce merchants Card not present (CNP) accounts for 60% to 70% of all card fraud in many developed countries according to Juniper Research and it\xe2\x80\x99s increasing In 2016 for every $100 spent through eCommerce fraudsters stole 5 65 cents Part of the problem is that customers must use either a slow bank transfer or a credit card mechanisms that expose customer and merchant to the risk of \xe2\x80\x98phishing\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98pharming\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98man in the middle\xe2\x80\x99 attacks The misuse of chargeback rights either friendly fraud or chargeback fraud are the methods by which the majority of fraud losses are surrendered According to The Nilson Report $31 billion will be lost to chargebacks by 2020 70 percent of customer disputes involve fraudulent/mistaken or unfounded product/servicerelated chargebacks Page | 14 \x0cThe Omnitude Solution to eCommerce Fraud In this turbulent environment the need for an effective state of the art solution prevails Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Single Identity and Single Reputation will provide the means to help merchants reduce the most usual form of eCommerce fraud Identity Theft whereby fraudulent transactions are undertaken using a different identity typically spending on someone else\xe2\x80\x99s credit card or account The Omnitude solution addresses all the major forms of fraud by using Blockchain technology In providing users with a Single Identity on the blockchain Omnitude will relieve merchants from the need to keep and secure extensive local databases containing sensitive personal data about their customers Such databases are at risk of being compromised by \xe2\x80\x98hacking\xe2\x80\x99 The risk of Chargeback Fraud is also minimised by reducing the use of credit cards Omnitude will also reduce Merchant Fraud (i e the collecting of payment upfront but with subsequent failure to deliver) Omnitude will facilitate staged release of payments depending on stage of delivery Page | 15 \x0cSupply chain Supply chains are made up of physical and financial supply chains The former consist of the physical movement of goods from supplier to customer the later run in the reverse direction and consist of financial flows from customer to supplier Supply chain finance is big business with $2 trillion in financeable highly secure payables globally and overall supply chain effectiveness is impacted significantly by inefficiencies on the financial side In particular manual reconciliation between payment orders and invoices is time consuming costly vulnerable to errors and subject to delays arising from differences between clearing systems Simultaneously imports of counterfeit and pirated goods are worth nearly half a trillion dollars a year or around 2 5% of global imports 86% of retailers say their sales are hurt by phony goods Up to 5% of goods imported into the European Union are fakes these substandard faulty and often dangerous Goods can include foods machine and auto parts chemicals medicines toys baby formula medical instruments perfumes and handbags Page | 16 \x0cSupply chain Increasingly customers demand real time knowledge of the location of their packages in the delivery cycle In 2015/16 over two billion items were delivered to households across the UK an increase of 12% on the previous year A recent survey* of online delivery showed that both customers and e tailers want more updates from delivery companies on the location and status of their order 43% of customers stated they did not receive dispatch and delivery date notifications 46% of e tailers that they did not receive a delivery confirmation *\xe2\x80\x98Supply chain finance the emergence of a new competitive landcape\xe2\x80\x99 McKinsey & Company October 2015 Page | 17 \x0cThe Omnitude Solution to Supply Chain Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Supply Chain solution will allow individual items or shipments tagged with identifiers to be tracked as they move along the supply chain for example from raw materials to components to assembled goods to finished products to final customer delivery Whilst travelling through the Supply Chain at key points an item\xe2\x80\x99s location will be recorded by trusted \xe2\x80\x98witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 and written immutably to Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain Smart contracts running at each Omnitude node will track the item\xe2\x80\x99s progress and release payments to shippers or suppliers as milestones are reached without the need for manual reconciliation and regardless of how many different parties are involved in the supply chain Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s supply chain blockchain will create a real time auditable tamper proof record of a product\xe2\x80\x99s full journey from \xe2\x80\x98first mile\xe2\x80\x99 to customer Omnitude will allow individual items tagged with unforgeable crytographic identifiers (e g painted 2 D graphene security tags quickly and easily readable by smartphone) or identified by serial number to be tracked to establish provenance and authenticity At key points during an item\xe2\x80\x99s journey from first mile to customer its location will be recorded by trusted \xe2\x80\x98witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 and written immutably to Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain Later using just a smartphone a customer purchasing the item or retailer receiving the item from a supplier can verify the item\xe2\x80\x99s history matches the seller\xe2\x80\x99s claims The Omnitude Tracker App will show the route to market traced by the item or whether it was recorded as stolen or lost Omnitude will allow retailers to better match payment with progress through supply chain Merchants will have an improved ability to make staged payments (\xe2\x80\x98micropayments\xe2\x80\x99) to counterparties as their products move along the supply chain Page | 18 \x0cIdentity Confirmation Customers must usually provide details about their identity (e g name email phone address and payment details) and about their preference information (e g style sizing delivery times) when transacting online with a merchant Usually this information must be provided every time they transact with a new merchant even though the same information is being provided each time Additionally each merchant must expend effort and incur costs to record this data and safeguard it properly Buyers depend heavily on online customer reviews for their buying decisions even when these reviews are written by complete strangers Evidence suggests online customer reviews are now more important than TV ads branded websites print ads and media Businesses are under increasing pressure to show positive reviews However researchers now estimate that up to one third of online reviews are phony and posted falsely either by the merchant itself to boost or by a competitor to damage the business involved https //smallbiztrends com/2017/04/importance of online reviews Page | 19 \x0cThe Omnitude Solution to Identity Confirmation Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Single Identity will reduce effort required by merchants to establish customer identity and provide a simplified quicker onboarding experience for customers Customers with an Omnitude Identity (OID) will enter their own identity and preference data once which will be verified by the merchant and then encrypted and recorded on the Omnitude blockchain Each time they transact with a merchant the customer will be able to submit from the Omnitude ClientApp the identity and preference information already verified by the first merchant in order to complete the transaction This will accelerate and ease the purchasing process increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty In turn merchants will need to expend less effort in verifying customer identities as they will be able to check the provided data against its hash on the Omnitude blockchain If a participant is the first to build a new complete Omnitude Single Identity for a given customer that participant will earn ECOM from merchants each time those other merchants make use of that customer\xe2\x80\x99s Omnitude Single Identity A merchant will pay ECOM \xe2\x80\xa2 to a participant\xe2\x80\x99s OW if they make use of a Single Identity built initially by that participant \xe2\x80\xa2 to a customer\xe2\x80\x99s OW if they make use of that customer\xe2\x80\x99s Single Identity Page | 20 \x0cThe Omnitude Solution to Identity Confirmation Proof of Interaction (POI) Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Interaction will provide the means to establish that a reviewer has a verifiable history of interaction with the merchant they are reviewing Each time a customer with an Omnitude ID (\xe2\x80\x98OID\xe2\x80\x99) transacts with a merchant with an OID a record will be encrypted and written to the Omnitude blockchain by the merchant When the customer elects to submit a review of the online merchant the OIDs and private keys of both customer and merchant will be used first to verify from the Omnitude blockchain that the customer has transacted with that merchant If they have the customer will be allowed to submit a review While certain personal details identifying the reviewer could be hidden other details could be shown to help other customers validate the review e g where the reviewer was based how many transactions the reviewer had with that merchant and over what period and the total value of goods or services purchased across all the reviewer\xe2\x80\x99s interactions with that merchant Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Interaction will also reduce Affiliate Fraud (i e the manipulation of traffic or signup statistics to glean more money from an affiliate program) If all parties have an OID parties to the affiliate program will be able to specify a required minimum level of interaction or minimum transaction history \xe2\x80\x93 between the referrer and the referree signups for the signups to be included into the program Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Proof ofInteraction will provide the basis for establishing compliance with these terms Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Proof of Interaction will also enhance loyalty programmes providing immediate data about a customer\xe2\x80\x99s purchases from a given merchant A merchant will pay ECOM \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 to a customer\xe2\x80\x99s Omnitude Wallet (\xe2\x80\x98OW\xe2\x80\x99) if that customer submits a review to a customer\xe2\x80\x99s OW in relation to that customer\xe2\x80\x99s points earned in a loyalty program to an affiliate\xe2\x80\x99s or referrer\xe2\x80\x99s OW whenever the conditions for doing so under the respective program have been fulfilled A customer will pay ECOM \xe2\x80\xa2 Page | 21 to a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s OW if that merchant writes encrypted proof of interaction specific data about the transaction to the Omnitude blockchain \x0cThe Omnitude Solution to Identity Confirmation Single Reputation Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Single Reputation will build trust between merchants customers and suppliers With an OID whenever a customer and merchant (or merchant and supplier) transact their reputation is legitimate and known by the blockchain Single Reputation will allow tracking automatically and objectively of whether goods are shipped promptly and whether payments are made on time and in full Transactions recording completion of shipping and payment milestones will be written to the Omnitude blockchain Whenever any two parties with OIDs interact subsequently their OIDs and private keys can be used to unlock data from the blockchain to confirm the \xe2\x80\x98good standing\xe2\x80\x99 (in shipping delivery and payment terms) of each party across the Omnitude ecosystem A participant will pay ECOM \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Page | 22 to another participant\xe2\x80\x99s OW any time they make use of that participant\xe2\x80\x99s Single Reputation to another participant\xe2\x80\x99s OW if that other party writes encrypted single reputation \t\t specific data to the Omnitude blockchain about a transaction involving them \x0cThe Cost of Doing Business Currently to collect online payments merchants must use a payment gateway and pay fees to the gateway provider Usually these fees are both monthly and per transaction (typically in the range of 2 9% of transaction size) The Cost of Doing Business Gateway Monthly Fee Per Transaction Fee Merchant Account Included Multi currency Support

cryptocurrency based payment mechanism that eliminates gateway provider fees and replaces them with lower blockchain transaction fees Omnitude will allow ECOM payments between ecosystem participants to be \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 made and settled instantly through the Omnitude network recorded on the Omnitude blockchain ECOM transactions will be aggregated and \xe2\x80\x98anchored\xe2\x80\x99 periodically through \xe2\x80\x98anchoring transactions\xe2\x80\x99 on the Bitcoin blockchain In this way payments on the Omnitude network will benefit from the immutability provided by the Proof of Work consensus mechanism of the most secure of blockchains i e Bitcoin A buyer will pay ECOM \xe2\x80\xa2 Page | 24 to a seller\xe2\x80\x99s OW each time a buyer purchases from a seller These payments will be made by buying and selling ECOM at prevailing fiat/ECOM exchange rates in back to back buy/sell transactions \x0cAbout Omnitude Page | 25 \x0cThe Omnitude Ecosystem Omnitude will be built on top of Hyperledger the open source global collaborative project hosted by The Linux Foundation Hyperledger is a permissioned blockchain protocol which enables business to consumer and business to business transactions The Hyperledger architecture provides core blockchain services on which the Omnitude ecosystem is built The Omnitude ecosystem will be made up of a variety of entities including those mentioned above (i e merchants customers suppliers couriers and affiliates/referrers) Page | 26 \x0cThe ECOM token in the Omnitude Ecosystem A ECOM token will be launched with Omnitude on the Omnilayer platform Merchants customers and suppliers will require ECOM to participate in the Omnitude ecosystem The ECOM token will serve several primary functions 1) A native method of settlement between parties to access ecosystem resources a Merchants will make payments in ECOM to other ecosystem participants to use the on ledger Omnitude solutions for Supply Chain Provenance Delivery Cycle Transparency Data Single ID Single Reputation and Proof of Interaction b Customers will make payments to merchants using ECOM crypto currencies and FIAT 2) An incentive for ecosystem participants to operate and secure the ecosystem a The consistency of Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s immutable blockchain will be guaranteed by a distributed peer to peer network of validating nodes running the Omnitude Core client application In return for enforcing Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s Delegated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPBFT) consensus algorithm validating nodes will share in ECOM block rewards 3) A means to raise funds for long term development of Omnitude a Through the crowdfunding the Omnitude Foundation is raising funds for the initial issuance of ECOM and for the development and launch of the Omnitude ecosystem b The ECOM coins issued during the crowdfunding will be the initial float to bootstrap the ecosystem Any party will be able to join the Omnitude ecosystem and earn ECOM It will also be possible to purchase ECOM in return for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies on the exchanges where ECOM are listed Page | 27 \x0cToken sale structure & distribution Proposed structure Ticker

Cybersecurity Advisor Sahil Gupta Advisor Blockchain Mob Antony Welfare Michael Donald The Omnitude Foundation Omnitude is an open source project being developed by the Omnitude Foundation a UK based organisation whose mission is to develop and grow the Omnitude ecosystem The Omnitude Foundation is the Issuing Authority that grants Omnitude IDs to any party wishing to participate in the Omnitude ecosystem The Omnitude ecosystem codebase will be released under the MIT License to ensure any network participant can extend and adapt the platform for its specific use cases The Omnitude Foundation will be governed by a board of directors composed of no less than 5 and no more than 10 individuals who are either investors founders partners advisors or team members of Omnitude Page | 32 \x0cAdoption Integration & Collaboration Adoption Plugins will be developed to integrate most major eCommerce platforms into the Omnitude blockchain platform\xe2\x80\x99s technology ensuring adoption is easy Integrations and Collaborations The key to this technology will be to provide a wide ecosystem of systems functionality and options to eCommerce store owners Therefore collaborations with other blockchain technologies will be explored Page | 33 \x0cCore Principles Open Any entity participating in eCommerce (e g merchant customer supplier courier affiliate/ referrer or Omnitude specialist) will be able to join the Omnitude ecosystem They will be granted an OID by the Omnitude Foundation and will run a full or partial node Depending on their role the Omnitude Foundation will assign the appropriate level of access required to transact in the ecosystem Each new full node will improve the security and reliability of the Omnitude ecosystem ECOM tokens will provide an economic incentive to secure ecosystem infrastructure and serve as the method of settlement between participants to access ecosystem resources Omnitude will be a permissioned network where nodes are run by known whitelisted organizations or individuals Depending on the role of the participant the Omnitude Foundation will assign to that OID the appropriate level of access required to transact in the ecosystem Secure Additionally Omnitude will prevent unauthorised parties from ascertaining the identity and patterns of behaviour of any other participant by inspecting the ledger Omnitude will allow ecosystem participants to make certain details of a transaction confidential so that they cannot be accessed by anyone other than the stakeholders in the transaction Periodically the Omnitude blockchain will also anchor to transactions on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains This will allow Omnitude\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain to benefit from the added security provided by Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s and Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s consensus algorithms and blockchains Transparent Omnitude will provide deep searchability backwards in time through many transaction layers to fulfil the requirements of retrieving data stored on its blockchain Omnitude will use \xe2\x80\x98anchoring\xe2\x80\x99 i e creation of a proof linking off ledger data to a Omnitude blockchain transaction Through anchoring this proof can be used to verify data integrity and timestamp without relying on a trusted authority Page | 34 \x0cCore Features Hyperledger Omnitude will be built on top of Hyperledger the open source global collaborative project hosted by The Linux Foundation Hyperledger is a permissioned blockchain protocol which enables business to consumer and business to business transactions The Hyperledger project has been created to advance cross industry blockchain technologies and is supported by dozens of well known leading companies in multiple sectors The choice to use Hyperledger will provide the fully vetted open source architecture and transparency longevity interoperability and support needed to bring Omnitude to mainstream commercial adoption Hyperledger allows for many blockchain networks and for many network ledgers each serving a different goal and without a need for any one network ledger to rely upon any other network for its core functionality This level of network independence requires an addressing system allowing transactions on one ledger to discover and utilize appropriate transactions and smart contracts on other ledgers Identity and auditability The Omnitude Foundation will manage user OIDs and authenticate all participants on the network It will be possible to use access control lists to provide further layers of permission through authorization of specific network operations For example a specific user ID could be permitted to invoke a smart contract application but blocked from deploying a new smart contract Omnitude will use a cryptographic certificate to encapsulate a participant\xe2\x80\x99s confidential data (e g Single Identity Single Reputation Proof of Interaction and Delivery Cycle Data) This certificate will be registered with the Omnitude Foundation which will be able to issue and revoke OIDs From each OID the protocol will be able to generate security keys for participants to transact on the network concealing the identities of the transacting parties and providing privacy support to the network Private transactions and confidential contracts If transaction patterns can be observed and interpreted shared ledgers risk disclosing confidential details about business relationships that should not be revealed to competitors Even a given participant\xe2\x80\x99s relative volume of trade is commercial information that should not be revealed by a system supporting trade between parties Omnitude will conceal identity transaction patterns and terms of confidential contacts from unauthorized third parties by encrypting transactions so only the stakeholders can decrypt and execute them In this way Omnitude will allow for competing business interests (or participants requiring private confidential transactions) to exist on the same permissioned network Page | 35 \x0cPage | 36 \x0cThe End of The Beginning Please note This document is strictly private confidential and personal to its
