middlemen and access restrictions altogether 3 \x0cEvery day around the world people are watching billions of videos most of them hosted by major video platforms such as Youtube VIULY The first decentralized video sharing platform This video content is often accompanied by Answer the question \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready to get interesting videos for free you are interested in\xe2\x80\x9d Are you ready to get ads \xe2\x80\x93 a nuisance which allows us to watch Currently the owners of these video platforms earn about 50 60% of the advertising revenue This inequitable distribution of advertising funds is also accepted by both advertisers and viewers In other words we feel very a reward just for watching the video content paid for what you used to do for free You can withdraw and spend the funds received Or you can support video creators directly on the platform or pay to access premium content training courses etc annoyed while watching ads while the Yes that\xe2\x80\x99s right No more compromises and most of the money sharing economy Each of the 3 billion people faceless centralized video platform makes tricks This is a huge new market for the watching a video should be rewarded in exchange for their attention and time given AND NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION \xe2\x80\x9cWHY\xe2\x80\x9d to ads in the video And every author who creates videos should get more money than they get now on other platforms We eliminate this great injustice once and for all How to achieve this By using a blockchain based decentralized video sharing platform Each of you can participate and receive rewards both for creating and watching video content VIULY COM 4 \x0cThe Alpha version of the Viuly video platform is released on October 10th By visiting the alpha version of the video platform you will be able to Sign up and get 10 VIU tokens to your user account Get 10 VIU tokens for each new referred user who confirmed email address VIULY ALPHA VERSION LINK VIULY IO VIULY COM 5 \x0cViuly is a video sharing platform where authors are paid for their content and users are rewarded for watching free videos The functionality of the platform Here are a few of Viuly\xe2\x80\x99s key features Upload free videos and create channels Sell access to your premium content All payments on the platform are carried out automatically in VIU tokens and stored on the blockchain VIU tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain smart contract and Support and donate to content creators Be rewarded for watching free videos represent the main tool for transferring the value between advertisers content creators and users VIU tokens can easily be purchased or sold on any of the world s crypto currency exchanges Buy premium content with VIU tokens Advertise and pay directly to our users VIULY COM immediately after the token sale is finished 6 \x0cDecentralized storage of videos uploaded on the platform is built on top of the IPFS protocol which allows storing files in a distributed network without a shared control center Practically anyone in the world can use the extra space on their hard disk to store videos uploaded to the Viuly and be rewarded for this We use so called cyclic codes to make sure uploaded files don\xe2\x80\x99t get lost due to various faults They split stored videos into many segments so that only a small part is needed for recovery of the original file In other words by splitting a video of 100 megabytes into 1000 parts we need only one of them for a full recovery Full data encryption helps prevent their theft in cases where a video is not intended for public viewing or is shown only for a fee And no one will be able to determine which files and on what computer they are stored There will not even be information on their size This will prevent unauthorized blocking of individual videos and channels VIULY COM 100% anonymity autonomy and safety of the users is due to the complete decentralization and the blockchain technology However in order to avoid the upload of video content that are an affront to common sense and standards we are creating an automatic pre moderation system of all video files uploaded on the platform When violations occur the system will automatically detect it and send the information about the video to moderators If the violation is confirmed the video will be deleted and the user\xe2\x80\x99s rating who tried to upload this video will automatically be downgraded The moderators are users with the highest rating on the platform who have been randomly selected by the automatic system 7 \x0cTHE MAIN PROBLEMS Of Video Platform Users Today Users do not receive any reward for watching videos Advertisers\xe2\x80\x99 expenses are increased due to intermediaries and fraud User attention is the most valuable resource Intermediaries represented by the centralized Many of you watch dozens of videos on costs and profits in advertising costs thus for which any and every advertiser competes different video platforms every day whose owners earn on advertising hundreds of billions of dollars a year Being a valuable resource user attention is exploited without proper compensation video platforms include their operating advertising costs grow by an average of 15 20% Also a large part of advertising budgets is wasted due to various bots and other methods of click fraud which also leads to a cost increase for real views Video creators receive less profit The video platforms existing today take the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the money received from advertisers and video creators only receive about 40% 50% of it depending on their home country and the total number of subscribers/ viewers they have Many people would like to earn by creating high quality video content (for example to create a vlog or to host a show) but they don\xe2\x80\x99t as centralized platforms take up to 60% of the profits and it is simply not profitable to create high quality video content VIULY COM 8 \x0cHOW WE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS The decentralized blockchain based video platform completely eliminates all the above problems All mutual settlements are carried out directly between advertisers content creators and users since intermediaries are excluded Users are rewarded for viewing videos User attention is the most valuable resource on the Viuly video platform and it is rewarded Any registered user who has watched a video will get from 25% to 95% of the funds allocated by advertisers Advertisers save on the costs of intermediaries and always have accurate and transparent statistics Viuly provides advertisers with accurate statistics for each ad view All data is recorded on the blockchain and can be checked by both advertisers and third party Video creators earn from 65% to 90% Creators who upload their video content on the platform receive 65% of the funds spent auditors The payments for user\xe2\x80\x99s attention are made directly without intermediaries and is completely transparent Advertising costs are 20% lower than on centralized video platforms by advertisers and 90% of the funds received as payment from users who watch their premium content VIULY COM 9 \x0cHOW IT WORKS ADVERTISERS Advertisers may upload on the platform their advertising video that promotes an event a website a product or a service by indicating in the settings a cost per view and by targeting based on audience country city gender age and interests The video will only be shown to those users who are in the selected targeting group A reward specified by an advertiser in the settings will be added automatically to users\xe2\x80\x99 wallets for each unique viewing of the video Advertisers may add their banner or a short promotional video for up to 30 seconds to appear in the videos that are listed as free to view by their uploaders It is possible to choose targeting based on audience country city gender age and interests Both the author of the video where the ad is displayed and the user who watches the video will automatically receive a reward specified by the advertiser for each unique ad view Advertisers may add a video that promotes a specific product or a service to the Viuly marketplace along with a text description technical characteristics and price Users can buy the product or the service advertised in the video by clicking the \xe2\x80\x9cBuy\xe2\x80\x9d button and paying VIU tokens directly from their wallets to the wallet of the advertiser The author receives 65% of a costper view and the user receives 25% VIULY COM 10 \x0cHOW IT WORKS CONTENT CREATORS Video creators can upload their video and specify the price on a per view basis Users who are interested to watch premium content pay the indicated cost and automatically get access to the video For example the author may sell a video lesson on a per view basis Video creators can create a paid channel for which users pay a daily weekly monthly or yearly subscription fee For example the creator of a unique forex trading course can upload on their paid channel one video lesson per week Subscribers can also view all the videos uploaded to that channel VIULY COM Video creators can upload their video and specify them as free to watch In this case advertising may be embedded in these videos and they will automatically receive in their wallet 65% of the cost specified by the advertiser for each unique ad view Video creators can upload their video and specify that users can watch the video for free and that the video is adfree In this case users can find the \xe2\x80\x9cDonate\xe2\x80\x9d button below the video and if they liked it they can support the author by sending any amount of VIU tokens 11 \x0cHOW IT WORKS USERS Users can watch free videos without ads with the option to support content creators by donating some VIU tokens if they liked the video Users can watch free videos with ads embedded in them and automatically receive in their wallets 25% of the cost per view specified by the advertiser Users can watch promotional videos uploaded by advertisers and automatically receive in their wallets 90% of the cost per view specified by an advertiser Important Users never know for which video they will receive a reward Therefore it cannot be considered as a reward based view Users can watch premium content on a pay per view basis or pay a subscription fee for a daily weekly monthly or yearly access Users can buy the goods and services advertised in the videos and pay sellers with VIU tokens directly from their wallet VIULY COM 12 \x0cVIU tokens represent the main tool for transferring value between advertisers content creators and users on the Viuly platform VIU TOKENS VIU tokens are based on Viuly\xe2\x80\x99s Ethereum smart contract (ERC20) All transactions on the platform are transparently recorded and stored in the blockchain where they can always be checked Blockchain and tokens are necessary to achieve full transparency of payments anonymity and for reaching the full decentralization of the video platform both in terms of video storage and mutual settlements between users THE FUTURE OF VIU TOKENS Primarily the prospects for the VIU token are associated with the growth of the user base of the Viuly platform The more users and video views the more advertisers will advertise their products Due to this the turnover and demand for tokens will grow Moreover there will be a marketplace on the platform where users can purchase various goods and services and pay for purchases with VIU tokens All mutual settlements between advertisers content creators users sellers and buyers are carried out by VIU tokens this will directly boost demand for VIU tokens The physical quantity of VIU tokens is limited Therefore due to persistent demand for a scarce resource the cost of tokens should constantly increase VIULY COM 13 \x0cMISSION OWNERS OF CENTRALIZED VIDEO PLATFORMS DO WHATEVER THEY PLEASE Currently any video creators\xe2\x80\x99 channels can be closed at any time without explanation The previously accepted content is now blocked or demonetized The rules are applied selectively based on the policies and opinions of a narrow (and what is really important directly concerned) group of people Even though powerful platforms like YouTube are nothing without the millions of content creators who in fact create their growth and drive their advertising revenue This is also the most important ethical and moral issue Money isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything People should be allowed to express their opinions freely without fear that their opinions will be removed The only censorship on the Viuly platform will be users themselves People will decide for themselves which videos should be rewarded and which will be blocked VIULY COM We change the perception of 2 main issues THE COMPANIES THAT OWN CENTRALIZED VIDEO PLATFORMS ARE JUST INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN ADVERTISERS AND VIDEO CREATORS At the moment large centralized video streaming platforms take 50 60% of total advertiser spend Instead the Viuly team will redistribute 95% of advertising budgets from the pockets of intermediaries into the pockets of video creators and users who watch these videos We believe that user attention is the most valuable resource and that it should be rewarded accordingly Due to the inherent benefits in our platform for viewers advertisers and content creators Viuly should take market share away from legacy centralized video platforms We will take away their profit and redistribute it fairly among our users The world is changing rapidly the 5th wave is already underway and it cannot be stopped With your help Viuly will be the main driving force of these changes 14
