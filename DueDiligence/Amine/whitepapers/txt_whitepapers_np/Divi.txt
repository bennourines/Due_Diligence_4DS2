next generation cryptocurrency designed for mass adoption using the world\xe2\x80\x99s first Smart Wallet\xe2\x84\xa2 connected blockchain and tiered masternode system The Divi Project has a novel solution to solve the biggest and most lucrative problem in the crypto world Mass Adoption by ordinary people We seek to bring the power of the blockchain to those who now shun it currently finding it too technical uninteresting and scary There has never been a bigger financial opportunity in history and the Divi Project intends to be first to market with a viable solution Our new blockchain allows us to socialize and humanize financial experiences by hiding the crypto underneath an easy to understand User Interface This Smart Wallet\xe2\x84\xa2 is being designed to remove all the pain points that currently prevent ordinary people from getting excited about cryptocurrencies The Divi Project is building a new blockchain that stores names and meta data along with transactions With these improvements our UX is far easier and simpler to learn and use than other cryptocurrencies allowing us to bring crypto to billions of average users Based on a new type of masternode system with many levels holders of DIVI coins participate in maintaining the network to earn more We are also creating a market place of goods and services that can be purchased with them DIVI\xe2\x80\x99S CORE INNOVATIVE FEATURES Smart Wallet\xe2\x84\xa2 Technology Our blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s ledger will include additional information that allows our wallet to connect and identify the receiver of funds to be sent displaying a photo or logo and other information that adds an additional layer of security and helping to avoid sending funds to the wrong place This addition to the blockchain core also allows for an entirely new set of apps revolving around the smart wallet concept Adoption and Community The \xe2\x80\x9choly grail\xe2\x80\x9d of crypto is to make one that ordinary people want to use For every crypto geek there\xe2\x80\x99s a million more sitting on the side lines We believe that the community support behind a coin is even more important to its value than the technology used We intend to take care of our community of DIVI holders with an enthusiasm beyond every other coin 1 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org We\xe2\x80\x99re putting together an expert panel and launching a forum of CEOs in underrepresented market segments (such as women) to advise us on how to make Divi more usable to non geeks Nearly every aspect of The Divi Project from our innovative social features to our \xe2\x80\x9clottery blocks\xe2\x80\x9d has been designed to encourage Divi coin owners to become long term holders and fanatic fans letting crypto finally reach the masses Next Gen Masternode System We are introducing the world\xe2\x80\x99s fi rst tiered masternode system which encourages people to hoard and buy more DIVI in order to increase their earning rate New Ways to Transact and M anage Money Not just a wallet but an entire system of managing your money we are creating new ways to handle your coins so that they work for you We\xe2\x80\x99ll have vaulting a piggy bank feature multiple \xe2\x80\x9cpockets\xe2\x80\x9d ways to automatically split incoming funds between partners a way to separate taxes for merchants etc Usability The Divi Project aims to make improvements to the blockchain and the way we interact with it so that people enjoy using it and business o wners can more easily integrate it into their websites and fi nancial structure Education This is the key to adoption The Divi Project will o\xef\xac\x80er a web based learning center for complete beginners to advanced users We will incorporate step by step HD video tutorials that will take a complete newbie and progress them through di\xef\xac\x80erent topics and stages This will be accompanied by an active community of other users and designated Divi ambassador s to guide newcomers and troubleshoot questions DIVI\xe2\x80\x99S BASIC STATS The Divi Project is a decentralized cryptocurrency market ecosystem that uses Proof Of Stake (POS) with a masternode protocol and wallet designed for wide adoption The Divi Project\xe2\x80\x99s ICO tokens are ERC20 compliant derivatives of the Ethereum blockchain and will be tradable immediately upon pur chase with ticker DIVX When the Divi blockchain is launched in early Q2 2018 DIVX holders will be able to exchange them for DIVI on a 1 to 1 ratio by sending them from their Ethereum wallet to an address that we will provide An equal number will instantly be sent to their Divi wallet in exchange 2 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org WHAT ARE TOKENS USED FOR The DIVX tokens\xe2\x80\x99 primary use is to hold them until we have the Divi blockchain and network ready to go live at which point you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to exchange them for DIVI DIVI tokens will be able to be used for the following things \xe2\x80\xa2 Earning tokens with masternodes Using the software and resources we will provide you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to earn more tokens The masternode software you install on your computer becomes a useful part of the overall network and performs the important job of maintaining updating and securing the Divi blockchain In addition to your tokens you\xe2\x80\x99ll be using your computer electricity and your time The tokens you earn will be your payment for your work and expenses \xe2\x80\xa2 Earn tokens with a staked wallet If you keep your tokens in the Divi wallet you will earn more of them each week The more DIVI you keep in the wallet the more you earn The wallet also supports the Divi network helping with fast transactions As with masternodes this takes your time and resources and the tokens you earn are to pay you for that \xe2\x80\xa2 Spend them in our Market The Divi Project will set up a proprietary online market and is working to set up other online stores to accept DIVI At these locations you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to spend your DIVI tokens for real world goods INTRODUCTION Our intention is to create the world\xe2\x80\x99s best and most useful cryptocurrency ecosystem We start with three beliefs \xe2\x80\xa2 Decentralized cryptocurrencies are the future of money and financial transactions and will steadily grow to completely replace nationaliz ed fiat currencies within 20 years \xe2\x80\xa2 Proof Of Stake is the best reward system for achieving distributed consensus in a blockchain \xe2\x80\xa2 A combination of Masternodes and POS Wallet Staking is the best POS system offering the most flexibility in the network and encourage coin holders to support the coin in various ways 3 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org This system pioneered by DASH and further improved by PIVX has been time proven but the current existing cryptocurrencies are very constrained in what they can do They are still very cumbersome systems di\xef\xac\x83cult to use for nongeeks and thus self limiting in their potential Because of the very nature of it being decentralized a blockchain and cryp tocurrency ecosystem is very difficult to change once it\xe2\x80\x99s released Therefore The Divi Project will start fresh with an upgraded and modernized blockchain better suited to the future than current ones SMART WALLET\xe2\x84\xa2 TECHNOLOGY The current state of cryptocurrency wallets is still very primitive and not ready for use by masses of people for many reasons On the usability spectrum on the far end of good UX design is Apple and on the bad end is every existing cryptocurrency The Divi Project\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain improvements coupled with its Smart Wallet\xe2\x84\xa2 will change that Public Key Renaming One of the biggest barriers of entry to the world of cryptocurrencies for average people is the way all wallets function using long strings of random characters as a wallet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpublic key \xe2\x80\x9d Many people describe themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cterrifi ed\xe2\x80\x9d whenever they send a transaction because jus t one wrong character in the wallet\xe2\x80\x99s address can result in all the money being sent to the wrong person and there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no recourse The Divi Project intends to solve this by allowing users to associate each wallet\xe2\x80\x99s public key with a unique name of their choice which can be used by others to send funds or connect with them This can help to eliminate mistakes as well as making the entire money sending process more approachable to non geek users Example \xe2\x80\x9cDV jennifer_lee_123\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9c0xc1F9Ca42eBc6611f83d063d74a817aBaFcf1B266\xe2\x80\x9d Benefits \xe2\x80\xa2 Now it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to remember your wallet address \xe2\x80\xa2 Less errors in sending funds \xe2\x80\xa2 Faster and Easier \xe2\x80\xa2 More user friendly \xe2\x80\xa2 Less intimidating for newbies \xe2\x80\xa2 API for new dapps we haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought of yet 4 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org New Search Capabilities User Search Because wallet addresses can now have names made from words instead of random gibberish and can ha ve user metadata we can make a directory so our users and look up their friends or a business to find their address Location Based Product Search Who\xe2\x80\x99s selling something and accepts DIVI as payment We\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to give you a list based on your location We can give merchants new ways to sell and market A Social Wallet Contact and Connect With Divi\xe2\x80\x99s system a user will be able to contact the owner of another wallet (if they have chosen to provide an address for this) if their public address is known That user\xe2\x80\x99s wallet can be set to forward such messages to an email address or they can respond within the wallet\xe2\x80\x99s functions itself We will work on expanding this into a social network allowing wallet holders to post read etc using their wallet\xe2\x80\x99s ID While we recognize that many crypto holders want complete anonymity which we will provide we also know the power of giving tools to people to connect with each other as Facebook so famously proved Oraclet System An oracle is a concept in cryptocurrency that allows smart contract blockchains to communicate with the outside world We\xe2\x80\x99re proposing a simple system of personal oracles called Oraclets using a bit of code added to the blockchain and uniquely connects each wallet address with a \xe2\x80\x9ctinyurl\xe2\x80\x9d directing to the wallet/user\xe2\x80\x99s metadata such as a name pho to video social media links etc Of course the wallet\xe2\x80\x99s owner can choose what information is available to the public We believe that this one improvement to our blockchain is a key technology advancement that can open a world of new opportunities for Divi as well as new dapps Pockets (Multiple Address/Identity Support) Because our system will allow the public to view a wallet\xe2\x80\x99s metadata the wallet will have various \xe2\x80\x9cPockets\xe2\x80\x9d For example a user may have a public wallet that shows very little or no cash inside and then \xe2\x80\x9cdark send\xe2\x80\x9d it to an anonymous pocket Benefits \xe2\x80\xa2 Choose your own level of privacy for each pocket \xe2\x80\xa2 Like having multiple bank accounts \xe2\x80\xa2 Suitable for people with multiple businesses \xe2\x80\xa2 Save money for various projects \xe2\x80\xa2 Separate money for multiple family members \xe2\x80\xa2 Set pockets to pay out or request subscriptions or loans 5 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org Instant Exchange We intend to make our wallet integrate with the user\xe2\x80\x99s cryptocurrency exchange accounts such as Poloniex or Bittrex using their API making it easy to change from DIVI to Bitcoin Ether etc MultiSig Capable This simply means that a wallet or pocket will need two passwords/keys to access it It\xe2\x80\x99s also necessary for advanced technologies such as debit card authorization Divi Debit Card Using the technology from one of many new debit card options for cryptocurrencies Divi users will be able to directly connect a debit card to their Divi wallet to pay for goods and services around the world New Ways to Transact and M anage Money We want our wallet to be able to work with money the way you do After so many year s you\xe2\x80\x99d think wallets could do more than they do now Our new system will allow for a multitude of new types of transactions beyond the quick send and dark send features that are typical of most cryptos Scheduled Payments Want to send money later or on a specifi c date so you don\xe2\x80\x99t forget Schedule a payment using our wallet Subscription Send Our wallet will be able to send a preset amount of Divi on a regular schedule You\xe2\x80\x99ll even be able to create a pocket fi ll it with Divi and send it out daily weekly or monthly to a given address Request Money / Billing Send or schedule messages within the wallet with a link so a contact can easily pay you and e ven pre decide what pocket you want the money deposited into Auto Split When money comes in you can have it automatically re distributed to other wallets or pockets according to preset percentages Great for business partners Taxes Using the Auto Split feature you can have the taxes for the products you sell automatically split o\xef\xac\x80 into a separate pocket Piggy Bank Want to save money for something special Automatically set a small portion of your income into a pocket that even YOU can\xe2\x80\x99t access until a future date 6 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org ADOPTION AND COMMUNITY Timeline of Cryptocurrency Adoption Time Period Basic Description User 2009 2012 Genesis Satoshi and friends give birth to Bitcoin Super Geeks 2013 2014 Moving past Cryptography First Altcoins Geeks 2014 2017 Blockchain Hype & Smart Contracts Bitcoin in news lots of FUD Ethereum Launched ICOs start Geeks Tech Marketers 2017 2018 Beginning of Usability First cryptos launch with average users in mind Chicken/Egg Problem Tech & Business Community 2018 2020 Adoption Goes Mainstream Exponential growth of cryptocurrency user base and coin values Massive FOMO Avg users start adopting 2020+ New Blockchain Genesis Massive disruption and opportunities Blockchain tech becomes invisible Everyone with a device The big challenge with cryptocurrencies is that people are investing in them but hardly anyone is actually using them for anything practical People want something to buy with cryptos but online stores don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take the time to build out their websites to take cryptos if there are few users The classic \xe2\x80\x9cchicken/egg\xe2\x80\x9d dilemma We believe that growing a community and a social presence is equally or more important than the technology itself Many of the Divi team members have extensive experience in the gaming music and YouTube industry and understand the value of building an engaging community and loyal fan base 7 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org Early Adopters Fund for Merchants The Divi Project is tackling this challenge by committing at leas t 10% of its cash and coins to entice online merchants to accept DIVI as payment educational videos and sta\xef\xac\x80 to show them how it works and to provide them with easily embeddable tools to do so We don\xe2\x80\x99t need every store online to accept DIVI but we do need a critical mass of them so that people with DIVI can spend it on something and the store owners themselves can in return spend it again or use it for staking rather than just converting it to bitcoin or dollars Our plan to start is to get at least one good online vendor in every major category in the biggest markets such as the U S and Europe These retailers will discover a new revenue stream with DIVI stick with us and we expand from there Sales and Education Team We are putting together a sales team to approach merchants big and small to educate them about Divi get their feedback on the types of tools they want and get them into our community so they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to go when we have our new blockchain ready We\xe2\x80\x99ll not just target merchants themselves but B2B companies that make products for them such as online store and shopping cart software We can also set up a booth at trade shows that are for online merchants Board of Advisors We\xe2\x80\x99re setting up an ad visory board made up of prominent women entrepreneurs Since so few women are interested in cryptos now (as low as 4% of enthusiasts are women ) we believe that getting this feedback will be invaluable to us when choosing features that have mass appeal Crypto Forums To build our fan base and encour age use especially among gr oups of people who are currently underrepresented in the crypto world we will start various forums to educate people how to use our smart wallet promote the merchants who are selling products answer questions and help make the experience both fun and profitable for them In\xef\xac\x82uencers Campaign The Divi Project is setting up collaborations with influencers celebrities authority figures and experts in various community driven industries to get our message to the people A side by side comparison of our product as compared with others currently out there will be enough to convince people that cryptos can work for them 8 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org Ambassadors Program We\xe2\x80\x99ve already started hiring representatives to represent the Divi brand Talking educating and bringing more people into our social networks to experience Divi for themselves Ambassadors will be chosen among various industries and receive special benefi ts and insight into our plans Education Programs We will be creating an extensive set of follow along videos to teach people how to use Divi the masternodes how to use the smart wallet\xe2\x80\x99s many features and lessons about cryptocurrencies in general such as how to use Coinbase Social Media \xe2\x80\xa2 Youtube Channel Weekly videos in the form of team Vlogs tutorials interviews market news live streams Divi Project monthly and quarterly reports \xe2\x80\xa2 Blogs Weekly written blogs such as Divi Project news relevant articles and developer updates \xe2\x80\xa2 Divi events Divi music events conventions meetups seminars \xe2\x80\xa2 Other Social media Slack Telegram Twitter Facebook Reddit etc Divi Project club services redeemable only with DIVI and DIVX tokens \xe2\x80\xa2 Loyalty building exclusive memberships for crypto newbies developers and traders \xe2\x80\xa2 Divi Project store Crypto apparel shirts hats and accessories e tc NEXT GENERATION MASTERNODE SYSTEM Masternodes replace miners in our blockchain ecosytem They run the network and record transactions in the ledger The current state of masternodes is amazing and has come a long way but there are many features and community requests not yet available in current systems The crypto community is aching for a next gen system and The Divi Project will deliver it as follows Community and Connection Current masternode systems do not allow participan ts to connect in any mean ingful human to human way so as to build community Divi\xe2\x80\x99s Smart Wallet\xe2\x84\xa2 technology will allow masternode holders to easily connect and communicate with other masternode holders (unless they wish to stay anonymou s ) This new type of social network gives our cryptocurrency a big advantage over similar coins because masternode holders can more easily organize themselves because they know who each other are 9 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org Tiered Masternode System Divi is building the world\xe2\x80\x99s first tiered masternode system o\xef\xac\x80ering better rewards to those who accumulate more coins for their nodes More details are below Dynamic IP Address Masternodes Currently existing masternode systems require a Static IP which is di\xef\xac\x83cult and expensive for average users especially outside of the U S We are working on a solution to change this so that more people can set up a node on their home computer Cost of Entry In order to acquire a popular masternode such as Dash or PIVX the cost is around $25k for PIVX or $270k for Dash Divi\xe2\x80\x99s masternodes will start much lower around $600 at the initial coin price \xe2\x80\x9cOne Click\xe2\x80\x9d Masternode Setup Currently it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely complicated to set up a masternode and only computer geeks can do it The Divi team is developing an easy mas ternode installation setup for all common operating systems as well as step by step video tutorials Divi will also create tools to allow our users to easily set up a cloud hosted masternode (VPN) for those that need help or simply wish to outsource the task User Interface All current masternodes use a very similar boring interface that is plain non intuitive and lacking in features Divi\xe2\x80\x99s team includes a world class UX/UI expert and we will design a user friendly interface making the process easy and fun This is probably the most requested feature across all cryptocurrency masternode communities Info and Stats Another one of the most requested masternode features is a user friendly way to view masternode stats from within the masternode and mobile application We are adding easy to view stats such as earnings history current block coins in circulation total global mas ternodes coin value in USD/BTC community proposals voting % approved and more Easier Participation in Governance Currently most masternodes use a rudimentary form of voting that requires inputting programming commands We are creating a go vernance tab where participants can easily view proposals statistics and vote with a simple click Masternode Map We will create a map sho wing all the masternodes and how they\xe2\x80\x99re connected Participants will be able to see basic contact details and a pho to/logo of other node holders if they chose to provide it The goal is connection participation and fun but we realize that many people will prefer to keep their anonymity and that will be an option too 10 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org TIERED MASTERNODE SYSTEM DETAILS One of the reasons that masternode coins are so popular is that they create a community with a shared goal We believe that we can enhance both e\xef\xac\x80ects by creating a s tructure with many tiers to our nodes making it more fun to participate and encouraging our stakers to accumulate more coins and hold onto them according to the following levels 1000 Coins Level 1 Copper 3000 Coins Level 2 Silver +5% 10 000 Coins Level 3 Gold +10% 30 000 Coins Level 4 Platinum +15% 100 000 Coins Level 5 Diamond + 20% The chance of earning coins at each mas ternode level improves linearly with the number of coins For example the Gold Masternode is 10 times more likely to earn coins than copper plus 10% bonus We believe that this leveling system will o\xef\xac\x80er the following benefits to Divi\xe2\x80\x99s coin \xe2\x80\xa2 Increased stakeholding which creates scarcity \xe2\x80\xa2 Discourages holding massi ve numbers of masternodes by single entities \xe2\x80\xa2 Makes masternode system more fun appealing to geeks and gamer s who will always want to get to the next tier LOTTERY BLOCKS REWARD SYSTEM Divi is excited to present a new original feature called \xe2\x80\x9clottery blocks\xe2\x80\x9d The lottery blocks concept is a new way to randomly reward participants that are using their resources to support the network The Lottery Blocks system is designed to increase participation and security in the Divi network by making people want to keep their coins in the ecosystem and off exchanges \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 1/2 coin designated from every block created (one per minute) One big lottery block winner each week awarding 2520 DIVI Ten smaller winners per week awarded 252 DIVI To be eligible to win participants must be actively staking 100 or more coins or have a masternode running \xe2\x80\xa2 Eligible to win unlimited times \xe2\x80\xa2 Owning multiple staked wallets or more than one masternode will increase your odds 11 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org MARKETPLACE After \xe2\x80\x9cease of use\xe2\x80\x9d the second biggest problem in cryptocurrencies is that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to spend them on Divi is taking on this challenge by providing two ways to spend the tokens \xe2\x80\xa2 P2P Decentralized Marketplace Within our Smart Wallet\xe2\x84\xa2 DIVI holders will be able to list their goods and services for sale in our Peer to Peer marketplace and use their DIVI tokens to purchase from others There will be a small fee in DIVI tokens in order to create listings People will be able to look for vendors by product category by geo location and by searching on a map sho wing their location \xe2\x80\xa2 Outside Merchants We will use a sales outreach team and various incentives to convince online stores to allow customers to purchase using DIVI We\xe2\x80\x99ll provide website plugins and other technology to make this easy for them and these embeddable buttons will connect directly to our smart wallet making paymen t as easy as can be We\xe2\x80\x99ll be working hard on many fronts to create a thriving DIVI economy including perhaps working with leading young designer s to create exclusive products that can only be purchased with DIVI The Divi Project\xe2\x80\x99s team includes people with extensive retail and product design experience NEXT GENERATION SECURITY Divi\xe2\x80\x99s team is very paranoid about digital security and you should be too when it comes to cryptocurrencies There are myriad ways to get hacked ripped o\xef\xac\x80 extorted and with digital currencies there\xe2\x80\x99s often no recourse We are going to be researching and implementing every possible new idea regarding security for the Divi network blockchain and wallet We intend to do our best to stay one step ahead of the hackers and scammers Ideas include Password Send Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to send funds to a friend that require a password to unlock it within a preset time period Give it to them by phone which will stop Trojans that change the sendto address to their own Know Your Receiver Before you hit the send button you will now be able to see the photo and details of the wallet you\xe2\x80\x99re sending to Relax because there will be no more send errors Mobile Behavioral Biometrics At the forefront of new ideas in personal data security technology are ideas like \xe2\x80\x9cbehavioral biometrics\xe2\x80\x9d that work by tracking each person\xe2\x80\x99s unique movement signature Thus your wallet could be automatically locked if stolen 12 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org Example https //www callsign com Other PW solutions https //www welivesecurity com/2015/02/05/alternatives passwords Vaulting We will be looking into ways that our users will be able lock their coins into the blockchain for a given period of time to secure them so that even under duress or extortion they will not be able to remove those coins from the wallet Multi Sig Wallets/Pockets A user\xe2\x80\x99s funds will be able to be set into a pocket that requires more than one signature to unlock creating an extra layer of security OTHER TECHNOLOGY Focus on Usability by non geeks With everything we do we\xe2\x80\x99re attempting to make things easier for average people to use DIVI bringing cryptocurrency out of the geek world and into the real world \xe2\x80\xa2 http //www sandiegouniontribune com/news/cyber life/sd me bitcoin currency 20170803 story html \xe2\x80\xa2 https //cryptoinsider com/psychological

between two wallets simply by Clinking them together Another option for phones that have is NFC (Near Field Communication) Tools Library for Merchants and Websites Even after 8+ years very few businesses accept payment in the form of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies We will build tools such as Wordpress and Joomla plugins to make it much easier for people to accept DIVI as paymen t These smart plugins will even be able to shift the DIVI price to continually convert to match that of a fiat currency such as US Dollar s if the merchant desires 13 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org DIVI COIN DETAILED SPECS Divcoin is influenced by the latest Bitcoin core Litecoin Dash and Pivx features The Divi Project will have all the latest masternodes features and more Estimated Genesis block date Early Q2 2018 Starting coin circulation Up to 60 80 million \xe2\x80\xa2 Low transaction Fees \xe2\x80\xa2 Instant send \xe2\x80\xa2 Private send \xe2\x80\xa2 PoS Proof of Stake with Masternodes Reward system payout \xe2\x80\xa2 Staking (45%*) \xe2\x80\xa2 Masternodes (45%*) \xe2\x80\xa2 Treasury (8%) \xe2\x80\xa2 Charities (2%) Required coins to stake for a masternode = 1000 to 100 000 in 5 levels 60 second blocks (10 080 per week) \xe2\x80\xa2 12 \xc2\xbd coins minted per block first 2 years \xe2\x80\xa2 10 \xc2\xbd coins for 2 years \xe2\x80\xa2 8 \xc2\xbd coins for 2 years \xe2\x80\xa2 6 \xc2\xbd coins after that Note 1/2 coin every block goes to the weekly lottery block fund * We are using a \xe2\x80\x9cSee Saw Algorithm\xe2\x80\x9d like PIVX has to balance the payout between Stakers and Masternodes These percentages will shift if coin holders tend to favor one over the other This ensures that there\xe2\x80\x99s a balance between the two types of network participants There are some changes and improvements and other new technologies that we are keeping our eye on as we approach the launch date We intend to roll out great new features on a regular basis which we believe will help constantly keep our community excited loyal growing and participating in the Divi ecosystem DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE The Divi Project is a transparent decentralized community driven project Built into the core app is a governance system that allows all participan ts to view community news submit proposals vote on community proposals and view the voting status of a current proposal 14 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org Features \xe2\x80\xa2 Masternodes will be eligible to vote Votes will be determined directly in proportion to the amount staked \xe2\x80\xa2 The world\ s first Democratic blockchain Because of our one click masternode install anyone can participate Past systems were technocracies because masternodes were so difficult to

all block rewards are reserved in the treasury to fund further development & marketing \xe2\x80\xa2 Charities 2% of all block rewards will go towards non profits & charities \xe2\x80\xa2 Community votes determine how and where funds are allocated Initially the founding partners will each choose a charity of their choice to fund Divicoins (DIVI) versus Divi Project tokens (DIVX) DIVX Divi Project tokens These are ERC20 standard tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain We project that there will be around 60 80 million tokens created through a smart contract during the token sale but this depends on when people buy Divi Project tokens will be automatically issued to participants through a smart c ontract and become tradable as soon as the token sale reaches the cap or the end date whichever comes first Only DIVX will be available during the presale token sale and prior to the launch of the Divi Project blockchain DIVI Divi\xe2\x80\x99s coins will be created and available when the Divi blockchain launches DIVI is the native currency to the Divi Project blockchain and will be required to set up masternodes and qualify for Lottery Block jackpots Redeeming Divicoins DIVI will become available after the Divi Project blockchain launch scheduled for early Q2 2018 There will be a 60 day redemption period where Divi Project token participants can stake their DIVX tokens to receive a 1 to 1 ratio of DIVI Redeeming DIVI is free and DIVX tokens will be burned as part of the process 15 \x0cTHE DIVI PROJECT www diviproject org TOKEN SALE DETAILS The Divi Project will sell

System How much will I earn from Staking This is going to depend on how many people are staking in our o\xef\xac\x83 cial wallet so they can be part of the Divi Network Like PIVX we will have a \xe2\x80\x9cSee Saw Algorithm\xe2\x80\x9d so the staking balances with the masternodes to insure a distribution between the Masternodes and Wallet Nodes that best supports the network (https //steemitimages com/0x0/http //i imgur com/GSBW9IE png) DIVI owners who have their coins stored in other types of wallets won\xe2\x80\x99t be part of the staking network which means they lose out on both staking bonuses and lottery blocks 19 \x0c
