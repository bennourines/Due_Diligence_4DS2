b Stakenet A Peer to Peer Interchain Economy X9 Developers June 2019 Abstract Stakenet is a decentralized platform providing a trustless interchain economy It is powered by a Proof of Stake blockchain with Lightning Network Masternodes and dApps Its use case is to provide a highly secure cross chain platform for cryptocurrencies where individuals can easily operate with any blockchain simply by using Stakenet and its native currency XSN 1 Introduction In the last few years the cryptocurrency community has steadily grown There are now hundreds of cryptocurrencies to choose from with more appearing each passing day It is important to understand which technologies communities and decentralized ledger technologies will separate themselves from the rest pushing through the noise of constant ventures entering the crypto sphere Instead of a one chain rule we believe the future will instead be in the formation of a global backend a blockchain mesh consisting of every chain technology and service created thus far A united network of different chains all communicating with each other through different interfaces This conversation will be completely unbeknownst to end users as swaps between different chains will be done case by case on the backend never seen realized or even chosen by the user 1 1 Purpose of Stakenet While most associate the word stake with staking stake has its roots in the economics of business administration and stands for far more than just passive income Stakenet is more than staking it is a network for stakeholders To create a common understanding we need to define the term network and connect it to the appropriate definition of a stake and a stakeholder 1 \x0c\xe2\x88\x92 A network is defined as a system consisting of many similar parts that are connected \xe2\x88\x92 A stake is defined as a vital interest in a business or its activities \xe2\x88\x92 A stakeholder is any person or society at large that has an internal or external stake in the vision and mission of a business Thus anyone who is actively or passively influenced by the activities of cryptocurrencies becomes a stakeholder of the blockchain economy This includes ownership and holding of coins property and legal interests economic and social dependencies developer and community activity and any other crypto related work or interest That way cryptocurrency stakeholders \xe2\x88\x92 Affect the blockchain economy \xe2\x88\x92 Are affected by the blockchain economy \xe2\x88\x92 Be both affected the blockchain economy and affect the blockchain economy Putting all this together we can start to see the vision Stakenet is pursuing A technical architecture to connect all the stakeholders of the blockchain economy into one giant network the Stakenet 1 2 Plan of action To create a successful interchain solution for the blockchain economy we need to identify the majority of its stakeholders find a way to connect them and ensure that our approach does not harm their integrity Therefore the following three sub items are particularly important for our plan of action 1) Identify the majority The most common stakeholder in the blockchain economy is Bitcoin itself which is a peer to peer version of electronic cash growing stronger day by day Most notably gaining major traction and a wide audience these past few years Nowadays countless people are affected by Bitcoin and in return also affect Bitcoin due to their work and activities This includes the mining industry financial products different wallet solutions and many other Bitcoin related work In addition to Bitcoin blockchains with smart contract capacities are particularly well known too The beauty of their blockchain architecture is that they enable both side and subchain creation This allows for the development of decentralized applications or dApps The best known smart contract blockchain is Ethereum which hosts the largest number of tokens for different blockchain related businesses Another famous blockchain with a similar use case is EOS which is currently the most used blockchain in the space of cryptocurrencies Both blockchains are individually affected by internal and external interests too There is not a single blockchain where the stakeholder approach is not used 2 \x0c2) Connect the majority After finding out who our stakeholders are we need to find a way to connect them Bridging the gap between blockchains will be possible if both chains are using a compatible interface like second layer protocols or are supporting the same cryptographic hash function That given it is possible to execute trustless transactions between different blockchains In Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s case we can utilize the Lightning Network as the default interface for peering two different chains as we have already done with Bitcoin Litecoin and Stakenet Other blockchains such as Ethereum or EOS can be integrated into our stakeholder network via their own smart contract language We will develop XSNETH and XSNEOS tokens to swap trustlessly between our native chain and the opposing chain with the help of hash time locked contracts or HTLCs The usage of hashlocks and timelocks provides us a solution to lock XSN on our native chain while unlocking the corresponding XSN tokens on the smart contract chain and swap these tokens in the opposing side and subchain mesh with other cryptographic currencies Besides the exchange of coins and tokens connecting the stakeholders of blockchains also means that you need to integrate the periphery industries of these blockchains as well Therefore we drafted a solution for decentralized mining pools cross chain staking and the hosting of dApps with interfaces to other chains\xe2\x80\x99 applications too 3) Protect integrity All these ideas would be empty words if we just developed another centralized solution We protect everyone\xe2\x80\x99s integrity by combining the advantages of different blockchains into one interchain management architecture The key pillars are our very own Trustless Proof of Stake consensus an upgraded Masternode layer with watchtower functionality and an upgraded Lightning Network layer with specialized swap resolvers As well as several products one of which is our hardware device XSN Viper used for storing exchanging and utilizing different chains native assets and tools In short Stakenet connects the largest distributed network developments into one decentralized place where individuals can operate with any blockchain simply by using Stakenet as the default interface 2 Blockchain architecture Stakenet is a Proof of Stake blockchain which provides a truly decentralized highly secure and profit driven interchain network for the blockchain economy It is powered by its native coin XSN while being managed by its own network of Masternodes and Lightning Network nodes Stakenet has a one second confirmation time and up to 240 on chain transactions per second It is based on a block size of 1 4 megabyte and a block generation time of 60 seconds Additionally the Stakenet blockchain can infinitely scale off chain with practically zero fee transactions by using Lightning Network 3 \x0c2 1 Credits Stakenet is a modified code fork of Bitcoin Dash and Peercoin It utilizes the same core as Bitcoin an improved Dash Masternode architecture and an adjusted minting Proof of Stake consensus based on Peercoin\xe2\x80\x99s coinage utilization 2 2 Consensus The consensus in a decentralized digital currency is used for the validation of the newly generated blocks of a blockchain Simply expressed it is a software component that the validator uses to vote on whether a story about the past is true or not For this proof Stakenet uses a minting Proof of Stake consensus which is expanded with an offline staking solution called Trustless Proof of Stake 2 2 1 Minting Proof of Stake Unlike Proof of Work where the workers use the hashing power of their hardware to solve cryptographic puzzles the stakers in Minting Proof of Stake use their coinage (up to 24 hours) and wealth to suggest new blocks Here the coinage is defined as the time since the staker\xe2\x80\x99s coins were not moved while the coin wealth is simply the number of coins a staker owns The proof of newly generated blocks is done with a special transaction called coinstake Within this transaction the first input is named kernel To ensure that the creator of a new block is selected by a stochastic process the kernel input must satisfy a specific hash target protocol This hash target is defined as a target per unit coinage that needs to be reached before it is subsequently consumed in the kernel The technical consequences are that the chosen staker has to pay himself a set number of coins thereby consuming the coins coinage to gain the privilege of generating a new block for the network Thanks to the coinage consumption the chance for one staker to validate several blocks in a row decreases quite substantially because their voting power is reset after each successful vote 2 2 2 Trustless Proof of Stake One of the main criticisms of the Proof of Stake protocol has been that it is only maximally safe when all the coins are online and authoritative staking nodes are avoided None of the previous online and offline staking solutions could meet these conditions Normally stakers need to connect their full node wallet to the blockchain to suggest new blocks With our very own consensus upgrade (Trustless Proof of Stake) Stakenet stakers can validate move and secure the blockchain while their coins remain offline in a cold wallet such as Trezor or Ledger Nano Unlike other offline staking solutions the number of our validator nodes is not limited to a few authoritarian delegates known as Delegated Proof of Stake Furthermore our solution does not support that older network nodes get more influence over time like it is in a Leasing Proof of Stake system Solely the coinage and wealth of the staker are crucial 4 \x0cTrustless Proof of Stake essentially allows stakers to use any other node to do the staking for them while not having to share any spendable balance or private keys with the node It is a special agreement made on our blockchain which allows an owner of a given address to give staking permission to a separate merchant address The operator of this merchant address does not have permission to move funds in the address and only has the right to stake the balance of that address The owner can move his funds out of the address at any time giving the owner complete control of their funds during and throughout the execution of this contract The staking contract is signed by a special transaction with OP RETURN that holds data specifying the terms and is created by a user sending 1 XSN to themself To cancel the contract the user simply needs to move all his funds into a new address or just unlock and move the 1 XSN which includes all contract information Required information in the contract is as follows \xe2\x88\x92 tposAddress Address owned by the creator of the contract (this balance will stake) \xe2\x88\x92 merchantAddress The owner of this address will have the ability to stake the balance in it \xe2\x88\x92 commission Tells the protocol how to split staking rewards minted from tposAddress \xe2\x88\x92 signature The 65 bytes signature of the contract creator to prove that they are the owner of the tposAddress Sample contract Out 0 { t p o s A d d r e s s 1 XSN } ( d e p o s i t ) Out 1 { OP RETURN t p o s A d d r e s s merchantAddress commission s i g n a t u r e } Out 2 { changeAddress changeAmount } RPC calls to create a TPoS contract and submit it to the network \xe2\x88\x92 t p o s c o n t r a c t c r e a t e [ t p o s A d d r e s s ] [ merchantAddress ] [ c o m i s s i o n ] \xe2\x88\x92 s e n d r a w t r a n s a c t i o n [ hex encoded c o n t r a c t ] Once the user enables TPoS staking the backend executes these following steps 1 Generates the new tposAddress for the owner 2 Generates the TPoS contract using the entered merchantAddress 3 Broadcasts the contract to the network 4 Sends the amount of XSN to the tposAddress of the owner for staking 5 \x0cAdditionally we will combine our Trustless Proof of Stake innovation with some of our unique Masternode tasks to lay the ground for potential cross chain staking By merging our block reward payouts with our XSN Dex technology users can stake their coins and receive rewards in other currencies directly to cold storage For example you can hold and stake XSN in a hardware wallet and receive Bitcoin or Litecoin directly to it as block rewards 2 3 Encryption algorithm Each information bit within a blockchain has undergone a process known as cryptographic hashing For this purpose Stakenet uses the X11 algorithm This is a cryptographic algorithm which uses a chained combination of eleven hashing functions which differ by their output size The enhanced complexity of such a chained hashing solution provides a higher level of security and longevity for the store of value of a digital currency compared to other single hash solutions all eleven algorithms need to be broken at the same time to threaten the network X11 consists of the following algorithms Keccak which is the winner of the NIST hash function competition and is further known as SHA 3 BLAKE Gr\xc3\xb8stl JH (Hongjun Wu) and Skein which were finalists in the NIST hash function competition Lastly Blue Midnight Wish (BMW) Luffa CubeHash SHAvite SIMD and Echo all of which didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to the final round of the competition but it was noted that \xe2\x80\x9cnone of them was clearly broken\xe2\x80\x9d Consequently X11 has a reasonable security margin because all used algorithms have been thoroughly analyzed and some of the best cryptographers have been involved in the design of these algorithms Note quantum computing is said to be able to break known hash algorithms soon Yet if you take available information on quantum computing into account and according to recent studies SHA 3 256 is quantum resistant as it would take 1032 years to break it So we can safely assume that during the lifetime of SHA 3 256 quantum computers will not pose a real danger to Stakenet 2 4 Supply The initial supply of Stakenet is due to the swap from POSW to XSN Therefore 76 000 000 XSN were created within the genesis block Right after the swap ended 3 500 000 unswapped XSN coins were sent to the following burning address XmPe9BHRsmZeThtYF34YYjdnrjmcAUn8bC 6 \x0c2 4 1 Coin emission The Stakenet blockchain was fairly launched with empty block rewards for the first 10 days respectively for the first 20 000 blocks to avoid asymmetric gains and offering everyone a fair chance to swap their coins and set up their nodes While the block generation time is targeted to 60 seconds the block rewards decreases step by step every 63 200 blocks by 5 XSN each down to 20 XSN Phase Phase Phase Phase Phase Phase Phase Phase 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ 20 63 106 149 192 236

at 20 XSN the supply is theoretically unlimited Therefore Stakenet burns every transaction fee within the network as a counterpart to the increasing supply and adds additional businesses to provide more value to XSN Either by burning the profits of those thus decreasing the supply of the XSN coin or by sending their earnings to the treasury to fund more projects and products So it is ensured that all profits within the Stakenet ecosystem will end up benefiting all XSN coin owners 2 4 2 Coin distribution We believe that network security and network services are equally as important as to have a robust and powerful infrastructure Since the Stakenet blockchain is powered by two types of nodes Staking nodes and Masternodes we do not discriminate between their works That\xe2\x80\x99s why the staking nodes and Masternodes are equally rewarded each with 45% of the block rewards Finally 10% of the block rewards are sent to the treasury The treasury is a cryptographically sealed public address that holds funds allocated to it by the network It is used to fund Stakenet further coin developments and new projects There is also a long term development fund for larger projects partnerships and key developments 2 5 Second layers The Stakenet blockchain uses several second layer solutions for on chain offchain and cross chain features The most important ones are its own Masternode and Lightning Network layer as well as the Tokenization Layer of other blockchains 7 \x0c2 5 1 Masternodes A Masternode is a dedicated fullnode of a blockchain that resides on servers around the world to ensure decentralization and redundancy While a staking node is responsible for the validation of the blockchain a Masternode provides several services for the network To operate a Masternode a valid collateral output of 15 000 coins for each Masternode is required This was made to counter a wild growth of the nodes and to avoid rogue nodes In addition to Masternode default features like instant send and decentralized democracy our Masternodes are aimed to be one of the most powerful stations within the crypto industry and will earn a passive income based on the services they provide They will \xe2\x88\x92 Host and run XSN Dex \xe2\x88\x92 Host all needed blockchain explorers to ensure true decentralization \xe2\x88\x92 Host all blockchains needed to keep XSN Dex decentralized and light \xe2\x88\x92 Handle Lightning Swaps and Tokenized Swaps between different blockchains \xe2\x88\x92 Be used as watchtowers to host and monitor Lightning Channels \xe2\x88\x92 Use their collateral to provide Lightning Network liquidity \xe2\x88\x92 Authorize and secure the transfer of tokenized coins between different blockchains \xe2\x88\x92 Facilitate instant and private on chain transactions \xe2\x88\x92 Provide onion routing and ensure secure exit points for the network \xe2\x88\x92 Host dApps for Stakenet and other blockchains \xe2\x88\x92 Be used for the decentralized democracy of the network \xe2\x88\x92 Offload CPU and database capacities for everyone within the Stakenet mesh Thanks to the Masternodes the Stakenet blockchain becomes an ecosystem in which no single entity can govern and serve the entire network 2 5 2 Lightning Network The Lightning Network is a second layer solution to enable peer to peer off chain transactions within a blockchain or between different blockchains It requires providers to lockup their coins in channels to ensure liquidity and to route payments between different nodes To understand how the Lightning Network works the knowledge of unidirectional and bidirectional payment channels is needed 8 \x0cUnidirectional payment channels Without Lightning the classic payment channel only exists between two parties or peers This technology uses the Multi Signature (MultiSig) feature and a so called locktime With the MultiSig mechanism you can generate a transaction that requires more than one private key to sign this transaction This means that the coins associated with the transaction require both parties\xe2\x80\x99 approval to be sent The locktime ensures that the coins within the MultiSig are non transferable for a certain period Bidirectional payment channels The mechanism described above was called unidirectional channel since only one party could send coins to another party If both parties want to exchange payments with each other they need a bidirectional channel This leads to a dilemma Why should one party wait for the entire locktime instead of claiming the whole stake right away To prevent this Lightning uses a mechanism of mutual protection Here each party think of an individual secure number before setting up the channel and send each other a hash of this number As in the case of a unidirectional payment channel the payment partners generate a MultiSig address Before broadcasting their MultiSig address to the network each party generate a transaction called commitment transaction In this commitment transaction the funds are split up one part goes to the creator of the commitment transaction and the second part goes to a time locked address to which the counterparty has access after a set time Thus both have created contracts that prevent fraud As we now understand how bidirectional payment channels work we need to find a way to connect them into a network Before the Lightning Network all parties would have to create a new channel for each new payment activity So if party A wants to do business with party C both business partners would have to set up a payment channel regardless of whether A and C are already exchanging with party B or not So why should A and C use a new channel when they can use B to bridge between both The only question is can B be trusted What if B is fraudulent claims the money and just does not pass it on So with this in mind how do we ensure that B does not shut down his Lightning node or has technical issues that force him to set his node offline As a solution for these problems the Lightning Network uses hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) to guarantee that these issues cannot happen An example C thinks up a secret which is a specific random number with the usage of cryptographic proof C gives the hash of this secret to A This hash now becomes a pledge B only receives a payment if he knows this secret This can be checked by party A by using the hash B passes the hash through again with the promise to pay if the recipient knows the secret hash too In principle the path between A and C may include other participants all of whom use the hash as a pledge Using HTLCs payment channels can be linked between different parties As you can see participants in the network who build a bridge between A and C as nodes form the backbone of the Lightning Network Their importance can be compared to that of miners or minters on the regular blockchains 9 \x0cStakenet upgrades the current Lightning solution by funding its Lightning channels by default with the Masternode\xe2\x80\x99s collateral and using the Masternodes as bridge nodes between all parties You can imagine this like a pool where different masternodes allocate their funds in a specialized multisignature address while additionally providing the possibility for random wallets to join these channels Now within this master channel all parties can open many 2 of 2 channels concurrently and thanks to Lightning Swaps even between different blockchains This solution does not only benefit Stakenet but it is also an upgrade for every blockchain with a Lightning Network because Stakenet\xe2\x80\x99s currency XSN can be used as a carrier coin for both Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions too Consequently Stakenet wipes out the risk of low funded channels and offers a solution to merge different Lightning Networks into one interchain solution 2 5 3 Tokenization Tokenization is known as a process to convert rights to an asset into a digital token Thus each token represents the underlying asset Using a blockchain for this purpose guarantees that the ownership information is immutable Currently we are developing XSN tokens on the Ethereum and EOS blockchains which represent the native XSN coin and can be converted between Stakenet Ethereum and EOS with the help of a bridging protocol With specialized multisignature addresses hashlocks and timelocks we can lock XSN on our native chain addresses while unlocking the XSNETH and XSNEOS tokens on the opposing smart contract chain Stakenet users do not need to manually transform their coins to the tokens because all is executed by smart contracts on the network and governed by our Masternodes layer It is important to note the number of native XSN coins does not increase The existing amount of all moveable coins and tokens is equal to the total XSN supply and is cryptographical auditable Once the bridge protocol is used to send XSN coin to the Ethereum or EOS network they are locked up and stored in a special smart contract address Thus the sender has no access to the native coins while getting permissions for the opposing tokens By connecting the Stakenet blockchain to the Ethereum and EOS blockchain through tokenization we can integrate every known token of these blockchains into our interchain network This way we will be able to provide an interoperable technology for swapping assets across different networks to allow everyone to freely operate with any coin and token within the blockchain mesh An additional advantage is that this workflow is compatible with any other blockchain which supports tokenization This means that the Stakenet interchain network can easily grow day by day and new achievements of other developers benefit our network as well 10 \x0c2 6 Metrics overview Name Stakenet Ticker XSN Currency type Coin Consensus Minting Proof of Stake Trustless Proof of Stake Coinage Enabled 24 hours Encryption Algorithm X11 Block

for people to deal with different blockchains XSN Products provide software and hardware solutions for daily interactions with Stakenet 3 1 Stakenet Wallet The Stakenet Wallet is a non custodial multi cryptocurrency light wallet and the main interface to interact with for the cryptocurrency world Essentially it is a one stop place for everything in both mobile and desktop versions It is the main product of Stakenet and thus the naming A wallet itself is an important and integral component of the cryptocurrency universe It is a secure digital purse which helps in storing and transacting digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum Most of the coins and tokens have their official core and light wallets but here comes the problem for every cryptocurrency that a user holds he also requires a wallet to store it thus making it cumbersome for the holder to have so many wallets Stakenet provides a solution to this problem as its Masternode network will hold databases and also run full nodes of multiple blockchains allowing for Stakenet to create a wallet that can securely send receive and confirm a transaction on separate blockchains Holding these blockchains in the second layer 11 \x0cprovides us the possibility to develop the Stakenet Wallet truly light without any limitations In contrast to other light wallets the Stakenet Wallet will not be limited to basic blockchain interactions like storing sending and receiving In combination with other XSN Products like the XSN Viper all users within the Stakenet interchain economy can use it as the interface to access additional features like offline staking from a hardware device setting up Masternodes or running hubs for the Lightning Network Additionally the Stakenet Wallet will have an in house over the counter trading engine which will be connected to the XSN Dex where users can swap their assets between different blockchains without revealing their private keys To ensure secure access to our interchain mesh the Stakenet Wallet provides native TOR support This will be managed by our Masternode layer TOR itself is an IP obfuscation service to enable anonymous communication across a layered circuit based network Each Stakenet Masternode will direct the blockchain traffic of our network among thousands of relays to conceal the user\xe2\x80\x99s location In simple words when users connect their wallets to the TOR network their traffic is then routed through a number of global masternode servers each of which removes information of the previous server thus the last exit node server gets no information where the network originated from 3 2 XSN Coin XSN is a state of the art cryptocurrency that allows a peer to peer method of payment It is money with unique properties not achievable by any central bank issued currency as XSN is open permissionless decentralized trustless censorship resistant immutable smart interoperable fungible secure and has a fixed emission rate So it is a medium of exchange used for real world transactions on a global scale including the transactional activities happening within the Stakenet ecosystem Each service that generates fees needs to be paid in XSN one way or another in some cases users won\xe2\x80\x99t even realize they have paid in XSN as it will all be handled by Lightning Swaps in the background All in all XSN is the currency the gas and the foundation of Stakenet as everything runs on top of it It is required for the ecosystem to operate 3 3 XSN Core XSN Core is the open source software component to run a fullnode within the Stakenet blockchain to receive store and send XSN It acts as the core interface for using all the functions of the Stakenet network and is required in order to operate a staking node merchant node lightning node and Masternode These nodes are the core pillars for our blockchain as they allow to connect computers in a peer to peer network to reach agreements over shared data XSN Core is compatible with the most popular operating systems such as Linux macOS Windows and can be accessed through the command line interface or graphical user interface 12 \x0c3 4 XSN Excalibur XSN Excalibur is our open source private key management and storage system auditable by the public It is based on Trezor\xe2\x80\x99s reputable code and uses a mnemonic phrase which is simply a word list also known as seed that generates the private keys for each blockchain wallet within the Stakenet interchain ecosystem Thanks to XSN Excalibur Stakenet users can backup and access all their cryptocurrencies by just knowing one phrase 3 5 XSN Dex Crypto exchanges are the mainstay support for the cryptocurrency market as they allow trading of coins thus providing liquidity to the ecosystem Even after being such an important component of the crypto markets most exchanges are centralized and are operated out of a few servers This makes them dependent on their limited infrastructures and vulnerable to hacking Once a user places a trade with a centralized exchange their coins leave their possession and are stored with the exchange thus making the user lose both the utility and benefits that one receives from these coins These are some of the potential risks which Stakenet aims to solve with its proposed XSN Dex With important components such as Stakenet Wallet Lightning Swaps and Tokenized Swaps in place we are only a few steps away from creating this solution There are some decentralized exchanges which are currently operating but all of them have some vulnerabilities of centralization Stakenet would be the first to operate a completely decentralized solution which would be entirely run by Masternodes and not supported by a centralized entity The coins which the users hold in XSN Dex never leave them unless the transaction is completed allowing for unlimited access With these coins in their own wallets users also benefit from all the utilities features and staking rewards of the coin Furthermore the user remains anonymous as they do not have to provide any Know Your Customer (KYC) details to anyone providing complete anonymity and freedom to trade without worry or fear All transactions are done on a peer to peer basis without the involvement of a central authority making transactions more secure and less expensive as the fees are lower Another key point of the XSN Dex is its ability to aggregate other dex solutions in it As long as the opposing dex is truly decentralized it is possible to add their validation nodes to the Stakenet interchain economy and bridge between different order books The trade between the aggregated dex and the native XSN Dex may take a few seconds longer than the intra XSN Dex trades This is because the bridging protocol needs to swap a tokenized asset between both exchanges first But in the end all Stakenet users can trade with any other compatible dex through one interface 13 \x0c3 6 XSN Viper The XSN Viper is a specialized hardware wallet with integrated basic Lightning Network routing capabilities to provide the ability to run hubs for the Lightning Network and generate fees for Stakenet Bitcoin and Litecoin Upcoming versions will improve the performance and enable multiple hubs and Masternodes to be run on one device That way we can allow users to safely execute higher level functions of various chains XSN Viper stores the user\xe2\x80\x99s coins safely in cold storage by using a separate microcontroller that holds private keys and remains offline all of which is powered by our open source firmware XSN Excalibur This allows Stakenet users to use all supported coins features from one hardware wallet 3 7 XSN Cloud XSN Cloud is a centralized application that offers blockchain services designed to grant a better and easier experience for XSN users thus helping with adoption Please note that XSN Cloud is not based on the Stakenet blockchain and has nothing to do with its decentralized ecosystem and dApps Simply put https //stakenet io is an informational website hosting the XSN Cloud app while Stakenet is the decentralized network built upon the blockchain XSN Cloud features the following \xe2\x88\x92 Staking as a Service (Online staking wallet) Wallets that automatically stake Deposited users\xe2\x80\x99 coins are sent to one main address (called pool) that regularly receives many stakes and are then distributed in real time \xe2\x88\x92 Masternodes as a Service (Masternodes hosting) Our very own trustless Masternode hosting solution It is risk free as you remain in control of your coins at all times in your local wallet \xe2\x88\x92 Monitoring services A real time monitoring service for Masternodes and trustless Proof of Stake contracts Customers will immediately receive e mail alerts if anything goes wrong \xe2\x88\x92 ROI calculator The relation between staking nodes and Masternodes changes daily so the profitability of each changes too The ROI calculator is a tool to find the best choice with more interest for you XSN Cloud collects fees from the users for using some of these services Fees are then sent to the XSN Cloud treasury to cover costs and further development Note you lose ownership of the coins you deposit to XSN Clouds wallets as you do not control the private keys Please do not deposit large amounts of coins but instead stake on your own with Trustless Proof of Stake or common staking solutions XSN Cloud wallets are only suitable for newcomers with no experience and a small coin balance that otherwise would not earn any staking rewards for months The rest of the XSN Cloud services are trustless solutions safe to use by everybody as you do not lose ownership of your coins 14 \x0c4 Summary Stakenet is a distributed network for incentivized stakeholders providing a trustless interchain economy It is based on an enhanced Proof of Stake blockchain with several second layer solutions like the Lightning Network Masternodes and dApps It has one second confirmation time and up to 240 on chain transactions per second Over the Lightning Network where the majority of the transactions will take place the Stakenet blockchain can infinitely scale with instant and practically free transactions Its use case is to provide a cross chain architecture for cryptocurrencies where individuals can easily operate with any blockchain simply by using Stakenet\xe2\x80\x99s native coin XSN as the blockchains are connected to each other through the Lightning Network and other cross chain technologies Stakenet supports the building of code agnostic dApps on top of it such as the XSN Dex All dApps will be powered by XSN Masternodes which charge fees for the services they provide Unlike the vast majority of cryptocurrencies Stakenet does not impose a brand new standard but rather adhere to the existing BTC/LN protocol and existing smart contract solutions which are both the present and future of the blockchain economy Stakenet provides one of the highest levels of security among any Proof of Stake blockchain It allows easy and secure staking of its currency XSN by using its invention Trustless Proof of Stake effectively achieving decentralized cold staking TPoS allows the minters to cold stake their coins through a special agreement on the Stakenet blockchain which means validators can stake their XSN even from a
