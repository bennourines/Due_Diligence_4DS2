b Whitepaper VisionX X industry Collaboration Platform for High Performance AI Solutions September 28 2018 Version 1 0 \x0cVisionX X industry Collaboration Platform for High Performance AI Solutions Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming an integral part of our daily lives and changing the way we do business However industrial AI remains a huge underserved market For example Industry 4 0/intelligent manufacturing represents a $4 trillion opportunity in China alone there are 60 million quality inspectors costing companies $350 billion per year Industrial customers urgently need practical accurate AI solutions that correspond to specific business needs while many of these needs are indeed similar across a single industry or multiple industries with examples such as defect detection visual inspection and predictive maintenance etc The main challenge faced by these customers is that individually they do not possess a good AI solution to begin with nor do they have the capability to gather enough relevant high quality data to further improve their existing solution Furthermore it is very difficult for different companies that operate in the similar or even different industries to collaborate together in the development for AI solutions and data VisionX establishes a vision of \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x9d providing a sustainable and incentive driven blockchainbased ecosystem that serves as a bridge between companies worldwide to boost the best AI and data solutions across each individual industry multiple industries AND with personalized solutions for each customer The tokenized incentive system of VisionX will includes both token incentives and a unique sharing of future related payments to incentivized ecosystem contributors according to the real value of their contributions All the transactions will be monitored and recorded in real time based on Blockchain tehcnology making it possible to control the AI solution development process Based on its unmodifiable characteristic blockchain technology can build the trust among developers contributors and requesters within the VisionX AI solution ecosystem During the process of a transaction all details are publicly visible so the process of developing a AI solution will be 1 \x0cmore transparent and all involved parties can get a clear view of all the status For example contributions such as quality data cleansing annotation data relevancy discovery AI dataset building AI solution building and AI solution sales will all be incentivized through token incentive distribution and recorded on the blockchain Unbiased high quality data can be collected globally via VisionX smart contract Leveraging on this ecosystem companies and organizations can collaborate on AI solutions that address common needs and while obtaining customizable solutions for their own specific use cases VisionX delivers a turn key solution using its patent pending AI and DataonomySM algorithms designed by a team of expert AI engineers and data scientists from Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung Cisco Panasonic Midea Group Microsoft Rakuten etc Starting with an initial focus on visual inspection for abnormity VisionX intends to provide to all potential customers a base AI solution which is more accurate than the current traditional solutions Next a customized solution will be developed for each individual use case with the integrations of additional customer data Collaboration of platforms based on blockchain technology is not limited by any geographic conditions and customers who require artificial intelligence solutions can work with data contributors located anywhere on the planet As customers continue to contribute their data into the ecosystem VisionX will be able to provide AI applications for various industrial functions beyond abnormity inspection and the manufacturing space The data asset pool will grow to include thousands of basic solutions and millions of customized solutions for each industry segment product and use cases in the ecosystem of VisionX VisionX incentivizes participants to collaborate in three major ways 1 Participants will benefit immediately upon joining from receiving superior AI solutions that are projected to cut cost by 30 percent 2 Participants will receive VNX for contributing data to the ecosystem 3 Through secondary smart contracts participants will be able to receive VNX from new sales of AI solutions built with their data contributions gain to the ecosystem 2 \x0cBy incentivizing cross industry collaboration in a revolutionary blockchain based ecosystem VisionX will empower AI solution providers and industry business partners to work together to obtain incentives for their individual contributions and benefit from optimized AI solutions Together the VisionX team and its collaborators will pave the way for the next industrial revolution 3 \x0cTable of Contents VisionX X industry Collaboration Platform for High Performance

Artificial Intelligence is as old as the field of Computer Science itself but as computational power such as parallel and distributed computing has advanced greatly over the last decade the field of AI research and development has grown by leaps and bounds In more recent years AI applications for consumers such as facial recognition technology on the iPhone X voice recognition and natural language processing in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa and real time decision making in the autonomous vehicle industry have gained traction and created an extensive impact in our daily life On the other hand landing AI solutions for various industries has also become a promising business with huge potential opportunities and markets and it still remains underserved Industrial AI is a huge emerging market that is experiencing rapid growth all over the world Many countries such as China France and Japan have announced artificial intelligence as their key technological focus and published comprehensive plans to promote artificial intelligence and research development Britain has announced a \xc2\xa31 billion plus deal that includes public and private funding to \xe2\x80\x9cmake the UK a global leader in AI\xe2\x80\x9d [16] China\xe2\x80\x99s strategic plan \xe2\x80\x9cMade in China 2025\xe2\x80\x9d focuses on high tech fields and aims to increase the Chinese domestic content of core materials to 40 percent by 2020 and 70 percent by 2025[17] The German government has also begun to develop an artificial intelligence strategy and just released the first core themes blueprint in July 2018[18] These declarations all indicate that utilizing artificial intelligence for the evolution of traditional industry is becoming the mainstream trend globally Quality improvement during manufacturing and faster product cycles are key areas in the development of an industry Industrial tasks such as visual defect inspection object pickand place and predictive maintenance are repetitive costly and prone to human error 5 \x0cAutomation of such activities is already disrupting industry leading to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fourth Industrial Revolution \xe2\x80\x9d as described by Klaus Schwab in his 2016 book [2] by the same name Industry 4 0 has created a huge market for AI providers to develop smart solutions for manufacturing companies helping them increase efficiency and decrease cost through cognitive computing cyber physical systems and IoT For example Landing AI [3] provides a corporate level AI marketplace for SaaS solutions to automate processes in industries like manufacturing IBM\xe2\x80\x99s Visual Insights uses cognitive visual inspection [4] for quality control and predictive maintenance Industrial investment in AI has already exceeded $100 billion and is only on the rise Estimates indicate that manufacturing companies adopting AI innovations could see a 38 percent boost in profitability fueling potential growth of a $15 7 trillion market [1] 1 2 Challenges On one hand companies are looking for AI solutions to decrease overheads and improve quality because they can only reach 60 to 70 percent accuracy for commercial off the shelf (COTS) products Since not every company can afford the upfront investment to develop its own high accuracy AI solutions companies hand the data over to AI providers expecting for a turn key solution On the other hand however AI providers are unable to acquire enough data from any single company to provide a satisfactory solution For example if a steel manufacturer wants to use AI to scan for visual defects on the surface of steel sheets their data points would be images scratches dents or pinholes in their products If they see a one percent defect rate they will only obtain a single image of one type of defect out of one hundred of products It will take months for the company to gather enough data points to build a moderately accurate detection model Other industries have similar defect detection needs with a variety of materials as shown in Figure 1 below 6 \x0cFigure 1 defect detection across multiple industries If all of the players in the industry space pool their data resources they will be able to benefit from a more complete less biased training data set If the steel manufacturer shares their data with a plastics manufacturer both of them will contribute images of scratch defects that can improve the accuracy of the defect detection models across both industries If the AI providers enter the same data sharing alliance they will enrich the pool of accessible data for the development of AI applications which in return will benefit both parties involved This is a win win situation Is it possible to bridge the industry users and AI providers in a collaborative mutually beneficial ecosystem Here comes VisionX 2 VisionX Solutions The VisionX team\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to provide a sustainable blockchain based incentivized ecosystem to develop and boost the best AI solutions and datasets across multiple industries By leveraging on a large decentralized dataset that is continuously growing and improving as well as unique technologies developed by AI providers across the world VisionX will pave the way for companies to succeed in the Industry 4 0 era benefitting not only the companies and AI providers in the ecosystem but also by extension the entire industry 7 \x0c2 1 X Industry Base Solution VisionX provides a base AI solution for visual abnormality inspection across industries Currently there are 60 million employees working on visual inspection in China alone which costs $350 billion USD a year [5] The average accuracy rate in visual defect inspection is about 60 to 70 percent with traditional methods The current addressable market for visual abnormality inspection spans a variety of industries including but not limited to consumer electronics mining automobile aviation medical supply steel furniture textiles processed food and so forth The VisonX base dataset for these industries currently contains over a million images to train the algorithm to detect abnormalities like scratches dents pin holes fiber patterns broken seals or aging components By using AI solution with the existing dataset VisionX will decrease the inspection cost significantly and increase the accuracy rate to 95 percent Similar AI solutions will apply to other areas such as robotic pick and place predictive maintenance data curation and eventually to any need serviceable by industrial AI As it has been identified as a common problem across many industries with a huge addressable market the base solution initially provided by VisionX focuses on visual defect inspection Already it has achieved a high level of accuracy in defect detection It consists the following parts 1 DataonomySM fully computational method to extract a large of relevant data 2 Architecture decentralized cloud edge AI computing architecture 3 Hardware solution adoption for any type of specialty or commercially available cameras Invented by a team of AI experts and engineers VisionX implements a world class deep learning solution that delivers accurate results across multiple industries and is further 8 \x0ccustomizable to address specific individual problems Enabled by early supporter DeepBrain Chain (DBC) Foundation the cross industry base dataset and solution are hosted on the decentralized AI Cloud This common data pool already comprises more than a million images including nearly 130 000 visual defect images from 34 classes of six industrial areas (Figure 2 below) used to train automated defect inspection algorithms The base dataset on DBC\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized cloud forms the basis of each customer\xe2\x80\x99s customized solution for faster deployment at a lower cost Figure 2 common data pool across six sectors As there is limited relevant data for each solution VisionX employs a unique patent pending taxonomy algorithm called DataonomySM [20] to pull a huge set of highly relevant images for specific tasks such as abnormality inspection The patent pending DataonomySM algorithm is a fully computational method for quantifying data class relationships and extracting a structure out of them The \xe2\x80\x9cstructure\xe2\x80\x9d means a collection of relations specifying which dataset provides useful information to another and by how much The framework of VisionX approach is shown below in Figure 3 9 \x0cFigure 3 DataonomySM framework The pipeline is outlined in the following steps 1 Use a pre trained model for object classification e g Inception V3 2 Find affinity matrix across dataset as follows The performance of Score is a useful metric as dataset affinity a Directly test the model on the defect dataset T including N = 10 classes of defects across the industries for each class t i = 1 2 \xe2\x8b\xaf N it contains a good set t 2334 and a bad set t 564 b For each image I8 from the defect set (good or bad) the model defined in the step 1 generates the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d for 1000 classes p8 c = 1 2 1000 in a public dataset e g ImageNet c The VisionX team assumes that the possibility reflects the similarity between a class and a specific defect image The similarity between a class and images without defect is Score2334< = \xe2\x89\x9c P2334< = = p8 8\xe2\x88\x88ABCCD = 10 \x0cThe similarity between a class and images with defect is Score564< = \xe2\x89\x9c P564< = p8 8\xe2\x88\x88AEFD = 3 Obtain normalized data augmentation affinities using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) [11] Since the Score from step 2 has different scales a proper normalization is required and AHP is used for normalization For each defect class t we construct a similarity vector MA is constructed between all available data classes from ImageNet as source S for mapping to the target defect class The element at (c i) in matrix is the similarity of each class from source to the target defect class The similarity between the source and target is m = Score2334< = + Score564< = Vector MA is then rescaled to be in the range from 0 + \xcf\xb5 to 1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\xb5 \xcf\xb5 = 0 001 In order to handle the defect images with a large variety of background we define the score of the class containing the defect feature as following MAN = (Score564< = \xe2\x88\x92 Score2334< = )/MA Combining MAN from all the defect classes we create a pairwise matrix MPN is created The transferability of s c = 1 2 \xe2\x80\xa6 1000 to t is then quantified as the corresponding component of the principal eigenvector of MPN The principal eigenvectors of MPN for all t in T are stacked to obtain an affinity matrix P which can be illustrated by the image shown in Figure 4 11 \x0cFigure 4 affinity matrix 4 Find global mapping taxonomy using BIP (Binary Integer Programming) [12] With a normalized affinity matrix the final step is to obtain a global class mapping scheme to maximize the performance across all defect classes while minimizing the supervision The selection problem is defined using Binary Integer Programming (BIP) The parameters of this problem include the supervision budget and a measure of performance on a target defect dataset from each of its mapping Additional parameters can be included as well for example a threshold to terminate the data augmentation from source to target and a relative cost to acquire the label of each dataset etc A canonical form can be expressed as maximize C P x subject to Ax \xe2\x89\xa4 b and x \xe2\x88\x88 0 1 XYZ where C and b are vector A is matrix for constraints each element C is its mapping performance obtained from affinity matrix p x here indicate which nodes are picked to be source and which transfers are selected Several constraints C are added to obtain a feasible solution For instance a constraint to 12 \x0censure the cost does not exceed the budget Figure 5 shows the general structure of this step Figure 5 A sample structure built by DataonomySM As sufficient data is gathered from each use case we build the base model is built after the data is cleansed annotated and certified As the dataset continue to grow the accuracy will be continuously improved The DataonomySM algorithm will pull from an ever increasing pool of information to develop highly specialized solutions for customers Once a company\xe2\x80\x99s own data is added to the pool the model can be fine tuned to exceed 99 97 percent accuracy Customers need not worry about the security of their data as it is homomorphically encrypted in the cloud 13 \x0cFigure 6 competitive advantage VisionX\xe2\x80\x99s base solution is not only more accurate than traditional solutions but also much faster and cost efficient to implement The computational power required to process large amounts of data is very expensive for a single company and traditional solutions cost $40 150k for the initial development plus additional $40k for deployment In most cases the company also needs to invest in specific hardware compatible with the software solution VisionX built upon the patented edge computing architecture on a decentralized AI cloud of the DeepBrain Chain ecosystem [14 15] will significantly reduce the cost by 30 percent because the cost of computational power is shared amongst users in the ecosystem VisionX\xe2\x80\x99s base AI solution is compatible with most of the equipment available on the market and it will shorten the deployment time from months to days Customers will receive a turn key software solution compatible with their chosen hardware to go to market immediately For a visual inspection use case VisionX simply deploys one to two small GPU servers at the customer\xe2\x80\x99s site along with a camera controls and an optional robotic arm Easy to use data annotation tools will enable customers to markup 14 \x0cdefect data In the meantime the building of a specialized AI model begins building for that company\xe2\x80\x99s specific problem will begin optimizing performance for fully deployment in a few days Figure 7 data on the AI cloud VisionX will also serve as a high volume data marketplace and optimized AI training platform The DataonomySM method was created to systemically enlarge a training dataset from public datasets (MIT places ImageNet etc ) and limited samples to create basedatasets and base models [7] for any enterprise AI solution The key aspects are large data collection without bias micropayments for global labor and privacy preservation and the platform provided by DeepBrain Chain to support multi party computation and homomorphic encryption 2 2 Customizable AI Solutions On top of its world leading cross industry base AI solutions VisionX can also provide customized AI solutions for each customer and further improve accuracy up to 99 97 15 \x0cpercent This low cost and high speed solution are hallmarks of an attractive product to customers Already VisionX has leads within multiple global Fortune 500 companies for servicing its initial focus area of visual defect detection The VisionX visual defect detection solution will scale to cover materials like steel wood welding plastic PCB and textiles for industries like electronics mining auto furniture fashion and more an enormous addressable market ready to invest in AI solutions Thus the VisionX team has forecasted very fast growth over the next few years and a 60 to 70 percent gross margin as VisionX focuses on improving accuracy with advanced AI software and economical commercially available hardware VisionX is building a sustainable ecosystem for industry users and AI solution providers in which companies are willing to contribute their data in exchange for world class AI solutions and AI providers are able to develop better solutions with more data On top of this virtuous circle an innovative tokenized marketplace will further incentivize collaboration Through secondary smart contracts customers will also be able to receive VNX payments for their contributions and a share of related payments for future product sales where the products are created from these data contributions 2 3 Sustainable Ecosystem VisionX creates an innovative incentive driven AI and blockchain ecosystem to enable data and AI solution collaboration across industries This tokenized incentive system includes future payment sharing which will incentivize developers and data contributors according to the real value of their contributions For example all contributions such as raw data collection data cleansing and data annotation data relevancy discovery AI dataset building AI solution building and AI solution sales will all be incentivized through VNX token distribution and recorded on the blockchain Together within the sustainable ecosystem of 16 \x0cVisionX companies and organizations across industries can collaborate with benefits for developing AI solutions Furthermore customers will be able to obtain customizable solutions for diverse situations far better than any one of them could achieve alone This incentive system unique among blockchain projects incentivizes collaboration in three major ways \xc2\xb7 Provides a world class AI solution in days instead of months with an estimated 30 percent cost savings \xc2\xb7 Incentivize contributions to the dataset and AI solutions that records on blockchain with its platform VNX token Through secondary smart contracts users will also be able to receive VNX payments for their contributions and a share of related payments for future product sales where the products are created from these data contributions as recorded on blockchain Customers can contribute quality data and the broader community can contribute services such as data cleansing and annotation All efforts are recorded on the blockchain so that fairly incentivizing can be given to all parties in proportion to their contribution to the VisionX ecosystem Incentives come in the form of VNX rebates along with payments for future product sales where the products are created from these data contributions and this can be applied towards software upgrades and annual license renewal The tokenized incentive program is revolutionary among blockchain projects Incentivizing contributions will benefit the customers by saving them money and also benefit the community and the whole industry by growing and improving the datasets and solutions Fueled by these innovative incentives the ecosystem of VisionX will quickly grow to encompass thousands of world class AI models to solve all types of problems across industries As the AI market and ecosystem of VisionX continue to grow so will the incentives for each of its contributors Together we will break through the current barriers that stand in the way of AI adoption and drive the industry to reach its full market potential 17 \x0cFigure 8 growth of VisionX ecosystem Each company\xe2\x80\x99s place in the ecosystem and incentives from it will grow and branch out into further applications For example the steel company seeking a visual defect detection solution will contribute their data images of scratches pinholes dents etc The dataset will be enlarged through the DataonomySM algorithm cleansed and annotated and form the Problem Dataset 1 the basis to build an AI Solution for Problem 1 visual defect detection This data also contributes to Industry Base Dataset 1 for steel manufacturing As the dataset is further enlarged it branches out to encompass an industry wide dataset and AI solution that can be used across manufacturing The steel company receives their world class AI solution right away and enjoys incentive payments related to the valuable data they shared as it becomes part of thousands of industry solutions being rewarded for their contributions through a portion of the payments from each of these other industrial customers 18 \x0c2 3 1 VNX Token Mining for Data Across Industries l AI Solutions token incentive are distributed among data contributors (15%) AI solution/dataset builders (65%) and VisionX (20%) l Customer provides more relevant data for their use case to further improve AI solution accuracy l Data is screened analyzed and validated by our DataonomySM algorithms l Data cleansing annotation processes are performed l VisionX will use profit to burn tokens up to 50% of circulation l If a certain data is included in the base/customer AI dataset(s) which helps improve an existing AI solution or helps build a new AI solution VNX token incentives will be distributed based on o The total estimated value of the specific industry/problem

value of the specific industry/problem dataset improved based on the principle of value discovery o Incentive token amount = \xe2\x80\x9cdata selected in AI dataset/total dataset size\xe2\x80\x9d x \xe2\x80\x9ctotal estimated value of dataset\xe2\x80\x9d Figure 9 VNX token economy All data contributions are recorded on the VisionX blockchain for computing token incentives and future shared payments encouraging the community to share high quality data leading to better AI solutions for their own use as well as for benefiting the industry Blockchain technology is an innovative Internet database technology Based on its characteristics of decentralization transparency and certifiability the blockchain database can be permanently distributed in various places and shared by the community Based on a unique design principle the VisionX AI solution platform that built with blockchain technology has its own ability to prevent data from being tampered with The blockchain itself is an open book within the network all transactions that occur can be seen by everyone on the 20 \x0cblockchain and all parties will be involved in recording each transaction Once the transaction occurs everyone on the blockchain platform will participate in the certification of the transaction Based on the unique characteristics of blockchain all the data in the VisionX ecosystem will be open and transparent and the selection of premium data and shared payments of developers and contributors are fair Customers with AI needs will purchase VNX from a token exchange They will use these tokens to pay developers for their AI solutions and datasets Developers in turn may use VNX to pay for raw data and other third party services Customers will be able to obtain VNX in the form of a rebate when they contribute quality data that improves the AI solutions within the ecosystem Finally individuals are able to buy and sell VNX and obtain it through their own contributions VNX is an integral and indispensable part of the VisionX platform because without VNX there would be no incentive for users to expand resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on the VisionX platform Users of the VisionX platform and/or holders of VNX which did not actively participate will not receive any VNX incentives There are many benefits of this decentralized marketplace First of all it lowers the cost of source data and annotation The cross sector data collected is free of bias leading to higher quality models Meanwhile the growing pool of readily available data enables each new customer to go to market quickly with a reliable solution that outperforms any of the traditional AI options With constant additions of data that can be distilled down into something truly valuable the ecosystem continues to grow and improve attracting more customers who become contributors themselves The result is a flourishing marketplace in which every participant obtains a better solution with less investment of time and money Together the community will tackle the most complex challenges the implementation of industrial AI unlocking the 21 \x0cpotential of this market across industries 2 3 3 Mining Smart Contract 1 Incentive for Data collection In the VisionX system we build a large scale AI social network is built based on a blockchain A decentralized workforce of data collectors can gather data for requesters and data owners can publish their data in the net Accessing this data is projected to be much less expensive than buying data from data companies directly This system provides two main methods of data collection with kinds of three incentives to data providers as shown below and in Figure below i Obtain basic VNX incentive from the VisionX platform if their data published on the platform is verified by the verification system ii Obtain VNX payments from buyers if their data published on the VisionX platform are bought by data requesters Also obtain additional incentive from DBC platform if their data published on the platform are marked as high quality data by the VNX technical team Figure 10 Two main processes of data collection on platform 22 \x0cIncentive for Verification By adding the verification miner role into the system of VisionX a verification miner can either do a random inspection or whole data inspection and a user or user hired third party verifier only needs to perform a random inspection on the verification of verified miners The amount of data to be inspected is reduced by this solution Figure 11 Data Annotation Process i Assign miners to several layers in the verification miner system The first layer of miners verifies and corrects the annotation assignments sent by annotation miners Each layer of miners verifies and corrects the assignments from the previous layer and sends their assignments to the next layer until the last layer which consists of the most qualified miners [Figure 11] Figure 12 random sampling verification 23 \x0cii All the verifiers randomly receive tasks from annotation assignments and verification assignment and receive VNX incentives for completing these tasks [Figure 12] Figure 13 verification and correction iii Set up a verification layer of miners for only verifying the correctness of annotation assignments and set up a correction layer of most qualified miners for verifying and correcting the verification assignments from the verification layer [Figure 13] Figure 14 verification and correction layers 24 \x0c3

China and South Korea The English version of Bishijie has already landed in the European and American markets and products in Southeast Asia and other markets are also in preparation 36 \x0c6 Risk Tips \xef\xbc\x91 Systematic risk The common factor of the global environment may affect VNX just like how it impacts all securities Take policy risk for instance At present the country\ s supervision policy for blockchain projects and Token Sale mode of financing are not clear and there is a possibility of loss of participants caused by policy reasons As for the market risk if the overall value of the digital asset market is overestimated the investment risk of participation will increase and growth expectations may not be realized At the same time systemic risk also includes a series of force majeure factors including but not limited to natural disasters large scale failures of computer networks and political unrest \xef\xbc\x92 Risk of lack of supervision Digital asset trading including VNX is highly uncertain due to the lack of strong supervision in the field Meanwhile the digital currency market has the risk of soaring plunging and being manipulated If an individual lacking experience enters the market it may be difficult to resist the impact of assets and psychological pressure caused by market instability Although academic experts and the media sometimes give cautious participation suggestions there are no written regulatory methods and provisions introduced so the current risk is difficult to effectively circumvent \xef\xbc\x93 Risk of supervision It is undeniable that in the foreseeable future regulations will be introduced to regulate the blockchain economy concerning the electronic token sector If regulatory bodies regulate the sector the tokens purchased during the Token Sale period may be affected leading to fluctuations or limitations in price and marketability \xef\xbc\x94 Team risk At present there are many teams and projects in the blockchain technology field and the competition is very fierce There is a strong market competition and project operation pressure Whether or not the VisionX project can break through many 37 \x0cexcellent projects and become widely recognized is not only linked to its own team capacity and vision planning but also linked to external factors such as competitors and even oligarchs in the market \xef\xbc\x95 Risk within team VisionX brings together a strong team of senior practitioners in the field of blockchain experts in the field of artificial intelligence and experienced technical development personnel VisionX boasts stability and cohesion of the team which are crucial to the overall development of the project In the future development nonetheless note that it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the team would be negatively affected by the departure of the core personnel and conflicts within the team \xef\xbc\x96 Project overall planning and marketing risk The VisionX initiative team will spare no effort to achieve the development goals outlined in the white paper and extend the growth space of the project Because the white paper may be adjusted as the details of the project become updated if the details of the project update are not timely obtained by the Token Sale participants there could be information asymmetry which might negatively affect the subsequent development of the project \xef\xbc\x97 Project technology risk First of all the project is based on cryptographic algorithm and the rapid development of cryptography is bound to bring potential risks to be cracked Secondly while blockchain distributed ledger system decentralization disagreeing with tampering and other technologies support the core business development the VisionX team cannot fully guarantee the landing of all of these technologies Thirdly during the process of project updating and adjustment there may be loopholes which can be remedied through releasing patches but the extent of the impact caused by the vulnerability will be variable \xef\xbc\x98 Hacker attack and crime risk In terms of security the amount of a single supporter is very small but the total number is large which puts forward high requirements for the security of the project Note that electronic tokens are anonymous and difficult to trace 38 \x0cThey could easily be used by criminals be attacked by hackers or be involved in transferring illegal assets \xef\xbc\x99 VisionX just as all digital token projects may face some unexpected risks It is the responsibility of the participant to fully understand the team background know the overall framework and ideas of the project make reasonable conclusions and make their own informed decisions before participating in the token marketplace 39 \x0c7 Disclaimer \xef\xbc\x91 This document is only used for communication of information The content of the document is for reference only and does not constitute any investment

age standard and has a complete capacity for civil conduct so that the contract with VisionX is true and effective All participants sign the contract voluntarily and should have a clear and necessary understanding of VisionX before signing the contract \xef\xbc\x94 VisionX team will continue to make reasonable attempts to ensure that the information in this white paper is true and accurate In the development process the platform may be updated including but not limited to platform mechanisms tokens their mechanisms and token distribution Part of the content of the document may be adjusted in the new white paper as the project progresses The team will update the content by issuing announcements or new white papers on the website Participants must access the latest version of the white paper and timely adjust their decisions according to the updated content The VisionX team clearly indicates that they do not bear the loss of participants due to (I) facts that might depend on the content of the document (II) inaccuracies in the information of this article and (III) any act resulting from this article \xef\xbc\x95 The team will spare no effort to achieve the goals mentioned in the document However given the presence of force majeure the team might not be able to completely 40 \x0caccomplish the commitment \xef\xbc\x96 As an official token of VisionX VNX is an important tool for platform effectiveness not an investment product Owning VNX does not represent the ownership control and decision making power of the VisionX platform granted to its owner VNX as an encrypted token used in the VisionX does not belong to the following categories (a) any kind of currency (b) securities (c) shares of legal entities (d) stocks bonds notes warrants certificates or other instruments granting any rights \xef\xbc\x97 VNX\xe2\x80\x99s value depends on the laws of the market and the demand after landing It may not have any value in which case the team will not make additional commitment to increase its value The team is not responsible for the consequences caused by the increase or decrease in the value of VNX \xef\xbc\x98 Within the maximum extent permitted by applicable law the team is not responsible for damages and risks arising from participation in public offerings including but not limited to direct or indirect personal damage loss of commercial profits loss of commercial information or any other economic loss \xef\xbc\x99 The VisionX platform complies with any regulatory policy that is conducive to the healthy development of the Token Sale industry as well as industry self regulation statements Participant\xe2\x80\x99s participation means that he or she willfully accepts and complies with such inspections At the same time all information disclosed by the participant to complete such inspections must be complete and accurate \xef\xbc\x91\xef\xbc\x90 The VisionX platform clearly communicates the possible risks to the participants Once participants have participated in the Token Sale they have acknowledged to agree with the terms and conditions in detail accept the potential risks of the platform and bear the consequences at their own expense \xef\xbc\x91\xef\xbc\x91 Citizens of nations that have banned Token Sale are not allowed to participate 41 \x0c8 References 1 AI to drive GDP gains of $15 7 trillion
