\xe2\x80\x8bFeatures Technical Considerations Today\ s gamers and website users demand fast and snappy user interfaces The Ethereum network is currently limited in throughput because it has an average block time of 17 seconds (potentially up to 30 seconds) F \xe2\x80\x8b uture updates to Ethereum aim to improve block times to 3 seconds18 (Casper) and allow transfers within milliseconds19 (Raiden) \xe2\x80\x8b Both of these updates are planned for late 2017 to early 2018 As the standard block times may impose some delays we will achieve a modern responsive experience by using off chain notifications Trusted Platforms will send an instant notification to the user\ s Smart Wallet for each Transaction Request When the transaction is accepted by the user and created on the blockchain the wallet will call the Trusted Platform API with the transaction to watch The game or website can then be updated immediately with a placeholder item or non tradeable version of the asset until enough confirmations are reached to allow full ownership of the item In the case of in game currencies the user\ s balance would immediately update in the game but any unconfirmed portions would be locked from spending until the appropriate number of confirmations are reached on the blockchain The Enjin Coin SDK will display confirmed and unconfirmed balances when listing ENJ and custom assets to make implementation easy and clear After Raiden and Casper updates are deployed on the Ethereum Network these safeguard measures will eventually become imperceptible Enjin will be testing the Raiden Network for lightning fast asset confirmation speeds as soon as the Developer and minimum viable product (MVP) releases are completed later this year20 18 19 20 E \xe2\x80\x8b thereum CASPER
