b Seal(Securities Allocation) Wall Street on the Chain A Blockchain Designed for Finance WHITE PAPER Wall Street on the Chain \x0cSeal Financial Public Blockchain Asset Circulation Pubic Chain Wall StreetFinancial on the Chain White Paper of Seal Chain \xc2\xb7Simplified Version\xc2\xb7 In the 2008 Sub Prime Crisis overrated Asset Backed Securities as the inducement had attracted massive amount of money flow to the uncertain assets In the meanwhile the SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) in the industry of financial supply chain were not capable to get loans since the difficulties in proving the authenticity of trade Outside of trading markets assets such as E Commerce inclusive finance ABS etc are difficult to become circulated and exchanged to currency due to the unclear information of the object Uncertainties and risks of these financial transactions had implied the Pain Point TRUST which is hard to establish And this is exactly what blockchain technology is good at Blockchain technology is still not perfect the costs of technology development and operation are high Most cases can\ t afford the high costs of such expensive system However it is affordable to start with financial scenarios due to the sufficient income According to Credit Suisse the total value of global financial assets reached $280 trillion at the end of 2017 which is equivalent to 15 US GDP or 22 Chinese GDP In addition it is not that complicated to have technology transferred in financial scenarios the financial data structure of each industry is homogeneous It would not challenge current blockchain technology much Therefore blockchain technology can be extensively adopted in finance which makes it one of the most suitable scenarios \x0cSeal Financial Public Blockchain Wall Street on the Chain Most of the public blockchain projects are facing trilemma in technology which are Security Fairness and Efficiency Mostly the focus would be on efficiency and fairness However Security has to be the first priority in the financial scenarios Because the general public blockchains are lack of focusing on security issues that made them miss the huge market where blockchain technology could be applied rapidly In fact the current stablecoin in blockchain world cannot be used as a bridge connecting the real economy with the digital economy The reason is unstable value of the cryptocurrency caused by the cryptocurrency supply either too high or not enough Another reason is unreached consensus on the matter of collateral Therefore there are few financial practitioners have ever used stablecoin to transact That has left a market worth billions of U S dollars needs to be discovered and developed Based on the current situation an elite team from Wall Street Seal Chain is determined to use blockchain technology and their decades of financial experiences to create a security oriented public blockchain project especially for the financial industry Seal Chain fully aims to create a secure and reliable freeway for global asset transactions by using consortium chain and gold which is highly trusted Seal Chain is confident in the process of accelerating human society to enter the

financial public blockchain with a stablecoin It transforms the financial assets of the real economy into blockchain assets through blockchain technology Investors can use the stablecoin to purchase blockchain assets and use the SEAL Coin as gas fee to realize free circulation of assets within the Seal Chain ecosystem 1 2 Why Seal Financial Public Blockchain is needed There is a trilemma in technology\xef\xbc\x8cthere are security fairness and efficiency some trade offs in these three dimensions At present the public chain of the blockchain market is mostly for general purpose they don\ t require highest level of security and fairness Most of the general public chain cost as long as they are just good enough to be used in most scenarios However it is obviously not good enough for financial industry The Seal public blockchain focuses on the financial industry is specifically designed for digitization of financial assets so it must have the highest level of security and being highly efficient while pursuing fairness There is no logic for any general public blockchain to do this If it does it would definitely not suitable for most scenarios 01 \x0cIntroduction of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain The highest level of security requirements and extremely high level of fairness needed in the financial industry determine the necessity for developing Seal public blockchain \xe2\x80\x93 a specific blockchain for financial applications 1 3 Features of Seal Chain The Seal Chain is the world\ s first financial public blockchain focusing on blockchain financial asset trading It is created for the fourth generation blockchain Smart Securities Seal aims to build an ecosystem for the next generation of finance Machine Finance Three major business highlights of Seal Chain \xc2\xb7Designed by Wal Street\ s elite team \xc2\xb7Smart Contract Platform Designed to Guarantee Secure and Precise Execution of Smart Contracts and dApps \xc2\xb7Jointly on line with 5 application scenerios 02 \x0cIntroduction of\xe4\xbb\x8b Seal Chain \xef\xbc\x88\xe6\xb5\xb7\xe8\xb1\xb9\xef\xbc\x89\xe7\xae\x80 Wall Street on the Chain Three technical advantages of Seal Chain (1) The highest level of security designed for financial industry expanded UTXO model non Turing complete smart contract (2) Innovative RPOS consensus mechanism with wallet Built in Enhanced Lightning Network Support and distributed exchange (3) High scalability layered structure of the main chain/side chain with technology in integrating Corda into side chain and fourth generation payment Seal chain is guided by actual applications With its core team is rooted in a strong financial and blockchain technology background Seal Chain has a unique approach to ecological planning and technical architecture and is committed to creating a new generation of secure and applicable public blockchain for financial industry 1 4 Token Economy Seal\xe2\x80\x99s Tokenomics can be summarized as a \xe2\x80\x9cThree layer multi token structure\xe2\x80\x9d Multi token refers to multiple tokenized assets supported by Sealchain and the three layer structure consist of SEAL Coin Gas Layer Stablecoin Payment Layer and crypto asset layer which is the Securities Token Layer 03 \x0cIntroduction of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain \xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89SEAL Token Gas layer The SEAL Token is the bottom of the Seal Ecosystem All asset transactions in the Seal Ecosystem require the payment of the SEAL Token as a Gas fee Gas costs will be returned to the Seal\ s Ecosystem 50% of which will be returned to the nodes of the Seal Main Chain (Nodes) and 50% will be returned to all holders in proportion to the Token The total amount of Seal Token is 1 8 billion and it will never be added It can be cut infinitely Price is the most effective means of self regulation of the market economy Only through price adjustment can the free market allocate resources efficiently The blockchain ecosystem is the ecosystem closest to the perfect free market The storage capacity of the blockchain is an invaluable and scarce resource Therefore the Gas fee model must be used for self regulation The blockchain ecosystem exempting the Gas fee is not economically valid (2) Stablecoin Transaction Medium Layer As the transaction medium of the Seal Ecology stablecoin is used for transaction between assets within the ecosystem which is the key to the entire payment system and the hub that supports the flow of assets in the ecosystem Cryptocurrency generally has two functions Store of Value and Transaction Medium The stored value is required to resist inflation and the token value will fluctuate Transaction medium is required to improved transaction efficiency and currency values must be stable Therefore the function of store of value and transaction medium are contradictory 04 \x0cIntroduction of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain and cannot be realized at the same time using only one token This is also why Sealchain must have a stablecoin in addition to the SEAL Coin (store of value) Stablecoin has opened the deposit channel of the cryptocurrency enabling both parties to make payment in fiat currency conveniently at anytime and anywhere \xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89Crypto asset layer Seal\ s original Smart Securities concept advocates the tokenization of financial assets so that it can use the stablecoin for free circulation in Seal\ s ecosystem Essentially the same as the emerging STO concept on the market today STO is more focused on regulatory compliance and Smart Securities is the essence of the CIS economy Only when token is correlated to the entity\ s financial assets the requirements by the regulatory authorities are met Seal\ s ecosystem will support the tokenization of all financial assets including but not limited to personal loan assets that are currently online Seal also support the ABS assets being debugging and Equity blockchain assets that will be launched before the end of the year The Seal Chain is the main chain ecosystem that truly supports the offer of STO 05 \x0cOur Vision Wall Street on the Chain 2 1 Stablecoin Transaction Medium Layer Finance is concerned with accumulation and circulation of currency and funds It refers to the economic activities of financing through the circulation of currency and credit channels The core of finance is currency circulation and credit creation Its carriers are banks insurance companies trust exchanges and other financial institutions The modern financial industry began in 1580 at the bank of Venice Italy And by 1694 the first joint stock bank the Bank of England established the basic organizational form Since then the financial industry has expanded from banks Finance is a virtual economy that serves the real economy Its operation is based on the analysis of real economic information or data Therefore the healthy operation of finance depends on the health of the real economy and the authenticity of the data The risks of the real economy are inherently unpredictable so financial institutions are covered by diversification of investment and risk premiums which is also the reason for the normal functional charges of financial institutions The risk of poor data veracity can be eliminated and this is currently mainly achieved by a large number of offline investigations by financial institution with high cost but low efficiency Blockchain technology provides real non tamperable data that eliminates human interference and the marginal cost of obtaining real data approaches zero which is the best solution for data authenticity Seal Chain created a public chain ecosystem can perfectly map the original data of 06 \x0cOur Vision Wall Street on the Chain the enterprise onto the blockchain adopting the method of off chain data storage and on chain data verification which not only ensures the absolute security and confidentiality of enterprise data but also ensures that the original data cannot be changed Investors can conduct investment analysis and risk control based on the real data of the company completely eliminating the unnecessary risk factors brought about by data fraud essentially reducing the cost of financing and improving the operating efficiency of the entire economy 2 2 Realizing Free Circulation of Blockchain Assets in the Public Chain Ecosystem Seal provides companies with the technical means to independently launch blockchain assets (stocks and bonds) and freely transfer their assets in the ecosystem of the public chain Seal adopts the main/side chain model Any enterprise can build its own side chain by using the functional language provided by the main chain The side chain can be a data node a private chain or a consortium chain and it can adopt its own consensus mechanism The original data of the enterprise is stored off chain and then the blockchain assets are distributed based on that data These blockchain assets can be corporate bonds equity or asset backed securities based on real data of business operations Blockchain assets are released on the main chain and at the same time circulate on the main chain Any investor can make due diligence and purchase of the assets with the approval of the assets owner 07 \x0cOur Vision Wall Street on the Chain 2 3 Providing Investor with Blockchain Investment Products Based on Real Data Seal is committed to providing investors with blockchain investment products based on real data of the enterprise An investor can become a node on the main chain or join a shared node to view the blockchain assets published on the main chain and the data of corresponding assets on the side chain The original operational data of the enterprise is stored in real time and can\ t be tampered with It is the fundamental data for investors to conduct investment analysis 2 4 Creating a New Financial System \xe2\x80\x93 Machine Finance using blockchain Technology Use blockchain technology and AI technology based on blockchain ecosystem to replace most financial intermediaries and create a brand new generation of financial system Machine Finance The business model of financial institutions has two core cornerstones \xe2\x80\xa2Information asymmetry \xe2\x80\xa2Professional analytical skills Blockchain technology can provide real non tamperable data and the data is always online and transparent which solves the information asymmetry problem for ordinary investors Along with the rapid development of AI advanced analysis 08 \x0cOur Vision Wall Street on the Chain capabilities are no longer limited to professional financial institutions ordinary investors can also obtain high quality professional analysis capabilities by using the AI algorithm In fact one of the most popular applications for AI is the professional analysis of financial industry By combining blockchain and AI the future of financial industry is definitely Machine Finance where investors are able to make investment by utilizing AI within the blockchain ecosystem which can greatly improve efficiency without expensive financial intermediary charges The blockchain is to change financial institutions instead of financial functions The demand for financial services will always exist so finance will always exist However the trend of change would largely impact current financial institutions providing financial services 09 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain 3 1 Five Technical Principles of Seal Chain (1) Legal Compliance Comply with relevant national laws regulations and regulatory requirements and provide technical support for regulatory audit (2) Traceability Business and activities are recorded traceable and auditable (3) Highest Security Standard Taking various advanced security measures to ensure the security of assets and transactions on the chain and prevent attacks (4) Privacy Protection Protect the privacy of users on the chain and prevent the disclosure of user information (5) Business Orientation Demand driven technology design and development prioritize applicable business scenarios On one hand utilizing the full extent of the blockchain technological features while maintaining compliance and on the other hand we must also consider how to bring improvements and value creation to businesses 3 2 Seal Chain Technology Architecture On the basis of long term tracking and investigation of various blockchain systems 10 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain combined with the latest research progress in the academic field we have uniquely selected and designed the Seal Chain\ s technology infrastructure in the areas of transaction model smart contract consensus mechanism and layered main/side chain These features are then organically combined to create an efficient and secure financial main chain 3 2 1 Technical Architecture Features (1) Consensus Mechanism With reference to the Ouroboros consensus mechanism Casper consensus and fragmentation mechanism realization Seal Chain designed a POS based consensus mechanism named RPOS (Random POS) to achieve efficient resource conserving and high TPS consensus mechanism (2) Built in Multi currency Support Compatible with UTXO model and Account model achieving free exchange of multiple currencies directly on the chain in the form of atomic trading (3) Expanded Transaction Model The Seal Main Chain has built in support for various financial domain specific data models Users can easily construct existing financial business data into legal chain transactions fully embodying the financial attributes of the main chain (4) Non Turing Completeness Smart Contract Drawing on the code is data concept of Lisp/Clojure language and Corda\ s contract design mechanism To make it simple smart contracts are data no compiler no virtual machine no intermediate 11 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain language representation and no complicated security sandbox mechanism The contract is stored and invoked in source code form It is not complete with Turing It theoretically eliminates various security vulnerabilities brought by Turing completeness contract virtual machine mechanism and provides the highest security guarantee for financial business transactions (5) Layered Architecture design in Main Chain/Side Chain With reference to the settlement layer/computation layer separation design concept and Ardor\ s side chain design concept Seal chain adopts the layered architecture design in main chain/side chain the main chain carries tokens expands UTXO transactions and some smart contracts function the side chain carries business contracts business data and business processes and the token can be circulated in both directions between the main chain and the side chain (6) Wallet Built in Enhanced Lightning Network Support Improvement and enhancement made based on the implementation of existing Bitcoin Lightning Network technology and built into the wallet Provides a peer to peer fast payment channel for fast payment of multiple currencies including stablecoins (7) Decentralized exchange platform The main chain relay node adds installable functional modules pre providing decentralized exchange function modules Each node relayed by main chain can be a small exchange users can directly make pending orders and trades through the wallet (8) Scalability The Seal Chain innovatively provides a standard API for side chain anchoring and an open chip based anchoring device Any consortium chain can 12 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain anchor itself to the Seal Main Chain through the standard API thereby the trust level of the chain is enhanced and extended to the degree of the Seal Main Chain which greatly enhances the professional value of the consortium chain and expands the application scenario of the Seal Chain 3 3 Composition of the Technical Architecture Seal\ s technical architecture is based on a set of distributed business systems built on its own public blockchain architecture including distributed smart contracts distributed computing automated clearing systems and centralized public service modules as follows 3 3 1 Consensus Mechanism On the basis of fully examining the consensus mechanism of the existing blockchain system referring to the Ouroboros consensus mechanism and the Casper consensus protocol and absorbing the fragment design ideas Seal Chain designed its own POS based consensus algorithm named RPOS (Random POS) to avoid POW algorithm\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantages of inefficiency and high energy consumption The consensus agreement divides the time into epoch each epoch contains multiple slots each slot lasts less than 1 minute 13 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain + + + + + > t | slot 0 | slot 1 | | slot N | \\ /\\ epoch M epoch M+1 \xe2\x80\xa6 Each slot has one and only one leader and the leader has the right to generate a block in this slot + + + + + + | Bl 0 |< | Bl 1 |< < | Bl N | + + + + + + + + + + + > t | slot 0 | slot 1 | | slot N | SL 0 SL 1 SL N How does the Slot Leadership Election Work Slot leaders are elected from all stakeholders and only those with enough equity (for example 2% of the total) are eligible to participate in the election We call these owners candidates In the epoch election a slot leader will be elected to partici 14 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain pate in the next epoch So at the end of epoch N we know who the slot leader of epoch N+1 is and this is unchangeable You can think of such an election as a fair draw any one of the equity owners can be a slot leader But a very important idea in POS is that the more shares an equity owner has the more likely it is to be elected as a slot leader Please note Within the same epoch an equity owner can be selected as the slot leader multiple times (1) Multiparty Computation One of the fundamental requirements in the electoral process is unbiasedness We need some randomness as the basis for the election In this case the result of the election is random and fair But the question is where does this randomness come from The Multiparty Computation (MPC) method is used to achieve this randomness Each candidate independently performs a coin toss and then shares the results with other candidates The idea is that the results are randomly generated by each candidate but eventually they agree on the same final value (2) Submission stage First of all the candidate will generate a key (a special random value) Next the candidate will form a submission which is a message containing the certificate of the encryption and the proof of the password 15 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain The candidate then signs the submission with the key specifying the epoch number and attaching its public key In this case everyone is able to know who created the submission and which epoch the submission belongs to Subsequently the candidate will submit it to the other candidates and finally each candidate will receive the submission of other candidates Note These submissions will be placed in the block which means they will be part of the blockchain (3) Opening Stage At this stage the candidate sends an opening status which is a special value for opening the submission A submission is like a locked box (with a secret key inside) we need an activate key to open the box and get the key inside Note All \xe2\x80\x9copening\xe2\x80\x9d will be placed in the block and they will become part of the blockchain (4) Recovery Stage This is the final stage In the end the candidates would have both submission and opening In theory some voters can be opponents It can advertise its submission but does not disclose its opening In this case honest voters can post to rebuild the key The idea is simple even if some voters are opponents the election can be successfully concluded The candidate then validates the submission opens to match and if successful 16 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain extracts the keys from the submission and forms a seed (randomly generated number series) from those keys Therefore all voters will get the same seed and will be used to determine all the slot leaders for the next epoch According to a common random seed and the possession of the account\ s Seal Coin the slot leader selection algorithm will deterministically calculate all the slot leaders for the next epoch and the odds are directly proportional to Seal Coin possession 3 3 2 Expanded Transaction Model UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output which is the data model of that was introduced by Bitcoin and used to record Bitcoin transactions Each transaction contains several inputs and several outputs The input points to the output of the historical transaction and the output is the newly generated data which records the Bitcoin ownership for each account It is a very sophisticated and powerful design but with a single function Based on the UTXO data model used by Bitcoin Seal Chain has innovatively expanded the range of functions that input and output express through the structure with built in various financial domain specific basic datas the expanded UTXO model could encode circulation of various financial assets and transfer of ownership that has greatly expanded the coverage of the UTXO model in the financial industry 3 3 3 Non Turing Completeness Smart Contract Design The emergence and popularity of smart contracts is inseparable from the development of Ethereum Ethereum develops a simple new Solidity development language similar to Javascript syntax Users can easily develop smart contracts using 17 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain this development language After compilation they can be deployed on Ethereum network for other people or other smart contracts to invoke However Ethereum\ s smart contracts are designed based on imperative language and have complex functional mechanisms such as EVM virtual machines and compilers The functions are Turing complete which makes it very prone to various security vulnerabilities This has been fully verified by the numerous incidents that have emerged Security is the core requirement in the financial industry In order to provide the highest security Seal Chain does not adopt a Turing completeness contract system similar to Ethereum Learning from the recent rapid development of functional languages (Haskell Clojure) smart contract system is designed based on the functional language the smart contract written by the user is non Turing completeness directly deployed on the main chain in source form interpreting execution can only access the contract local storage no infinite loop theoretically eliminate the possibility of various holes that has provided the highest security for various key financial businesses 3 3 4 Layered Structure of Main Chain/Side Chain Until now all kinds of main chains in operation face throughput and performance issues Bitcoin allows 7 trades per second and Ethereum allows dozens of trades per second as well as the rapidly growing amount of data has put tremendous pressure on the existing main chain We believe that it is not feasible to carry all possible scenarios on one main chain and it must be managed separately Seal Chain designed a separation architecture based on the main chain/side chain Seal Chain\ s main chain only carries tokens based on expanded UTXO model and 18 \x0cTechnical Architecture of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain corresponding smart contracts token only carries key and important transactions and data Seal Chain\ s side chain can carry a variety of complex calculations and a large amount of business related data Effectively isolates risks and provides good scalability only need to deploy different side chains based on the Seal Main Chain to support a variety of completely independent business scenarios Seal Chain\ s token can flow in both directions between the main chain and the side chain 3 3 5 Scalability of Seal Chain We believe that in the financial sector the consortium blockchain system will exist and develop for a long time Seal Chain positions itself as a financial main chain so Seal Chain has designed a hardware based consortium blockchain anchoring device The various consortium blockchains that financial systems currently run can be anchored to the consortium blockchain provided by Seal Chain which is very safely and conveniently anchored to the Seal Main Chain it greatly expands the trust level of consortium blockchains and also increases the business coverage of Seal Chain Seal Chain and R3 have formally signed a cooperation agreement we will first integrate Corda as a side chain into the Seal Main Chain providing strong support for various practical financial services 19 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain 4 0 Seal Business Model The Seal Ecology is divided into three phases The first phase is to create a fundamental payment layer using blockchain technology and reshape the global financial payment system The second phase is to build the blockchain asset transaction application layer by using the fundamental payment layer as the fulcrum The third phase is to build the next generation of machine finance by integrating AI technology and eventually realize bringing Wall Street (financial center) on the chain As the most influential financial market in the United States and even the world Wall Street is still unable to rid the risk of collapse of the \xe2\x80\x9ctrust mechanism\xe2\x80\x9d Using blockchain technology to create a new financial system integrating AI algorithm realizing machine finance and eventually creating a self trust system subverting the lumersome traditional centralization of credit information and creating a fast intelligent and self certifying \xe2\x80\x9cWall Street on The Chain\xe2\x80\x9d financial center The first phase \xe2\x80\x93 Creating the fundamental payment layer using blockchain technology and reshape the global financial payment system Through the construction of the fundamental technology Seal will gradually build a globally integrated blockchain payment system which will be used to link to the financial ecology and then build an asset trading platform a distributed smart securities exchange The platform\ s smart securities assets based on authentic operational data are traceable including equity debt ABS financial derivatives etc Institution or retail investors can make investment decisions by evaluating smart securities products through on chain information 20 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain Three major advantages of the blockchain payment system 1)Security \xe2\x80\x93 The on chain information is immutable the cost of fraud is high and the history is traceable The parties can transact without knowing each other\xe2\x80\x99s identity increasing the security of payments 2)Fairness \xe2\x80\x93 The on chain payment system removes the need for intermediary increasing the fairness of transactions 3)Efficiency \xe2\x80\x93 No matter it is cross border or cross chain on chain payment is more efficient than the traditional payment method 4)Low Cost \xe2\x80\x93 Compared with the traditional payment processing fee the on chain payment fee is close to zero The Second Phase \xe2\x80\x93 Building the blockchain asset transaction application layer by using the fundamental payment layer as the fulcrum The blockchain application layer draws similarity to the various applications of computers and smartphones The on chain application layer can have various application scenarios such as supply chain finance inclusive finance and e commerce Seal uses the fundamental payment as the fulcrum to connect various scenarios to realize asset transaction flow enabling real decentralization of transactions while achieving security fairness efficiency and low cost 21 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain The Third Phase \xe2\x80\x93 Building the next generation machine finance by integrating AI and eventually realize Wall Street on the chain As large amounts of data are distributed across blockchain ledgers the need to use AI is growing The combination of AI and blockchain is reshaping the economic model and the way information is exchanged In the second phase of Seal Ecology third party AI algorithms will be integrated for intelligent investment analysis Institution or retail investors can use AI algorithms to screen smart securities products that fit their needs and automatically and intelligently distribute their investment into the Seal ecosystem Example INVESTORS AI algorithms Risk preference Supply chain finance Inclusive finance 0 5% Adidas supplier receivables Insurance 0 1% Mini P2P loan Industrial preference Rate of return Funds 0 1% Facebook stock Distributed payment 22 Type selection Equities 0 2% a wine estate in California USA ABS 0 1% a perfume workshop in Provence France Identity authentication system Corporate bond \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain An Investor wish to invest $10 million On the Seal platform the investor input individual preferences such as industry risk and rate of return They can allocate investment to hundreds or even thousands of different smart securities products in a matter of seconds The products may be stocks bonds or it could also be a winery in California a perfume workshop in Provence or an Internet company with a market value of 100 billion USD Through effective investment diversification AI algorithms can maximize risk dispersion and improve investment efficiency With the increase of investors and financial application scenarios on the chain Sealchain will form a diversified financial ecosystem around equity debt ABS and financial derivatives truly realize the Seal\xe2\x80\x99s vision of bringing Wall Street on the chain 4 1 Underlying Framework of Blockchain Technology I Sealchain public chain online \xe2\x80\x93 asset bearer SEAL main chain technical features are as follows 1 The implementation of UTXO model supports native multi currency SEAL main chain supports three currencies Gold Coin Stablecoin and Seal Coin Gold Coin and GD will be issued and destroyed according to the total value of gold on the chain and the market demand for GD in order to achieve public and transparent market liquidity management 23 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain 2 Account model support Users are able to hold and circulate various future tokens in the SEAL ecosystem and receive dividends generated by the tokens through smart contracts 3 Innovative contract engine support based on Clojure SEAL is the only public chain with contract source code viewable on the chain It deploys and invokes the contract directly from the source code which is open and transparent 4 Built in token contract similar to ERC20 standard Various standard tokens can be issued by using built in contract without the need to write code Support rapid blockchainization of various assets and creating a thriving SEAL ecosystem SEAL Sub chain Construct The SEAL sub chain is a consortium chain anchored on the main chain In 2018 the SEAL sub chain provided privacy and customized business capabilities while inheriting the high security and trust level of the main chain and is an important fulcrum for the diversified ecosystem of the main chain 1 Complete the optimization of consortium chain network layer Supports deployment behind firewall and can be deployed and operated in a complex network environment of the enterprise 24 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain 2 Complete permissions and custom contract support Conveniently connecting with existing business systems and customized business processes II Seal Investor Wallet \xe2\x80\x93 Blockchain Asset Transaction Platform Seal tokens (including ) will serve as a medium for all transactions making investment in smart securities possible Since the token is the flow of information and funds it fundamentally eliminates the issue of trust and perfectly embodies the concept that blockchain is value chain 4 2 Investor Wallet SEAL Investor Wallet in addition to meeting the basic functions of transfer display balance etc also contains an investment interface linking all asset platforms (P2P platform supply chain financial platform cultural art trading platform etc ) the data of these platforms can be quickly reviewed and investors can choose to directly invest in the corresponding product by using stablecoin in the wallet This is not only a wallet but also an asset transaction app that facilitates the financial investment of assets on the chain with digital currency in a convenient fast and efficient manner 1 Invest in quality financial assets around the globe In the investor wallet users are able to view the DApps and tokens in the SEAL ecosystem and realize the purchase circulation and dividend payout of the tokens 25 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain 2 Authentic and transparent information Blockchain technology guarantees the authentic status of the capital flow in the investor\xe2\x80\x99s account at the time of transaction and all transaction data are traceable and cannot be tampered with or deleted 3 Decentralized financial management Using blockchain technology to establish a mechanism that does not require third party intermediary credit endorsements thus eliminating the intermediate costs 26 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain SEAL Blockchain Explorer \xe2\x80\x93 Public Chain Information Window The SEAL Blockchain Explorer was officially launched on November 1 2018 In the block browser the issuance circulation income and dividend records of all the tokens and the list of the token holder addresses are all viewable All the tokens are transparent immutable and adhere to the spirit of blockchain 27 \x0cBusiness Model of Seal Chain Wall Street on the Chain 4 3\xe2\x80\x9cBlockchain + AI\xe2\x80\x9d Building Wall Street On The Chain Using SEAL\ s public chain as the information carrier Seal Wallet and the Blockchain Explorer as windows to interface and display various types of tokenized securitization products With increasing number of assets on the chain real data is accumulated and distributed to each node The AI algorithm concentrates the decentralized data on the chain according to demand and intelligently screens the tokenized securitization products that meet the terminal requirements the products that meet the requirements are handed to the terminal and finally the funds of the terminal customers are distributed to multiple products for investment thereby reducing investment risks and improving investment efficiency Blockchain can promote decentralized applications in the open data environment and establish a trust system AI fosters centralized intelligent technology on a closed data platform to achieve smart investment Blockchain + AI seems to belong to two extremes but in fact it can be combined perfectly The introduction of AI can make up for the natural defects of blockchain distributed data and blockchain can overcome the many shortcomings of artificial intelligence The combination of the two can create a new generation of machine finance which is equivalent to moving the financial system to blockchain not only can decentralized secure computing be performed through blockchain but also the intelligent screening of data through AI can be achieved while ensuring data security and privacy Sealchain\ s vision is to create a new financial system that provides global investors institutions and individuals with a portable secure transparent and professional blockchain asset transfer platform subverting the centralized financial system realizing machine finance and ultimately achieving the grand mission of putting Wall Street on the blockchain 28 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain 5 1 E Commerce New research predicts that global E Commerce sales will reach a new high by 2021 Global E Commerce business is expected to grow by 265% indicating that there is no sign of a decline in the future E Commerce market and it will rise steadily Interestingly global E Commerce sales still account for only a small portion of global retail sales According to data global E Commerce sales will account for 11 9% in 2019 and are expected to reach 17 5% by 2021 This means that the future E Commerce market will have more growth opportunities In order to occupy a place in the E Commerce market payment and supply chain finance cannot be neglected 5 1 1 Payment Application in E Commerce I Pain Points of Payment Industry 1 Formation of oligarchy raises high moral hazard of centralization Data shows that the third party payment market has entered a mature stage and the oligopoly market structure leading by Alipay fortune pay and PayPal has been formed The oligopoly structure can easily cause market monopoly and transaction fees and security of user information can not be guaranteed In recent years the centralized payment mode has caused various privacy disturbances A payment platform uses annual bills to improperly collect users\xe2\x80\x99 data violating users\xe2\x80\x99 privacy 2 Pain Points in Cross Border Payment There are pain points in cross border payment such as high transaction fees time 29 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain consuming and insufficient security Cross border payments are usually controlled in the hands of several oligarchs and transaction fees are extremely high Moreover because the financial payment system between the two countries is very different the circulation of funds in the two systems takes a long time the cycle of capital turnover slows down In addition because foreign institutions are not regulated by China the security of funds can not be guaranteed 3 Difficulties in Online Payment Normalization According to statistics the network penetration rate of Thailand Philippines Vietnam Cambodia India Indonesia Egypt Algeria Ukraine and other countries is less than 10% Moreover in more than 200 countries around the world there are nearly 2 5 billion people with no bank accounts and credit cards which makes it more difficult to normalize online payment II Advantages of Blockchain Payment 1 Decentralization to guard against moral hazard The point to point principle of blockchain enables both parties to conduct point to point transactions directly and freely worldwide without third party authoritative bodies 2 Improving the efficiency of cross border payment Using blockchain payment network for cross border transactions the two parties can achieve point to point direct transactions and transactions can be completed in 30 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain a few seconds and transaction fees are almost zero Blockchain network allows transactions to be easily cheaply and safely transferred to anyone on the network with no restriction of borders 3 Increasing payment normalization Cryptocurrency used for payment can effectively solve the payment problems of many countries in Southeast Asia the Middle East Eastern Europe South America and other regions where internet is not efficient Blockchain payment would make payment possible so the rate of payment normalization rate would be improved Case Fucent Gateway Corporation Seal reached strategic partnership with Fucent gateway corporation the only financial service provider in the Philippines that cooperates with Wechat Payment It provides lightning payment services to customers in 3 000 Philippine outlets Users can achieve fast and low rate transactions without network As a start in the Philippines the payment scenario cooperation is being carried out regarding the policy of Belt And Road Case GuoChuangYuanHe Seal Chain has reached strategic cooperation with GuoChuangYuanHe to launch in depth cooperation in financial E commerce and social networking scenarios to jointly promote the implementation of blockchain payment GuoChuangYuanHe is a large scale high tech software enterprise with independent research and development capability Adhering to the corporate purpose of Finding Precise Users for SMEs and Individuals the company is committed to creating a platform 31 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain for long term stable profits for partners through Mobile Internet blockchain It is composed of many sections such as \xe2\x80\x9cQuick collection of Red Envelopes Honey information Honey Mall and Honey Play Token \xe2\x80\x9cSEAL\xe2\x80\x9d as a circulation media is used for payment circulation and right confirmation in each section 5 1 2 Supply chain finance Applied to E Commerce Under the traditional supply chain financial model information systems between companies is uneven cost of business collaboration and communication between enterprises is high information between enterprises is opaque it is difficult for enterprises to prove the authenticity of assets and transactions in facing financial institutions which makes the core enterprises unable to delivery trust effectively throughout the supply chain eventually led to the difficult and expensive financing for small and medium sized enterprises I Pain Points and Solutions 1) Each link in the supply chain is independent for the rest which lead to information silo In the supply chain there are many participants whether it is business flow information flow logistics or funds flow it needs to be transmitted through many links the span is large and the authenticity is difficult to guarantee At the same time the ERP systems of the participating enterprises are incompatible which forms information silo trade information can\ t be shared in real time the transaction is difficult to be effective verified making it difficult for financial institutions to conduct credit evaluation and dynamic risk monitoring for SMEs thereby further increasing the difficulty and costs of financing for SMEs 32 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain Solution The supply chain based on blockchain technology will connect all links and change the situation of the past 2) The source of information is uncertain core enterprise credit can\ t be introduced to suppliers in multiple tiers In the industrial chain purchase orders are introduced from the core enterprise to the first tier suppliers and beyond the funds are introduced from the core enterprise to every supplier That is to say the source of funds receivable for all tiers of suppliers comes from the core enterprises but the credit rating of the core enterprises can\ t be introduced to all suppliers in the same way as the goods flow funds flow and information flow In the traditional supply chain financial service only the first tier suppliers can rely on the core enterprises to obtain financing the fundamental reason is that the data is opaque the business flow funds flow information flow and logistic flow are not interlocked to form a complete data link For example the sales order of the third tier supplier can\xe2\x80\x99t be associated with the procurement of core enterprise and it can\ t be proved that the sales order funds of the third tier suppliers is from the core enterprise As a result the credit rating of the core enterprise can\ t be introduced to the supply chain beyond the first tier suppliers Solution With the traceability characteristics of blockchain technology the anti counterfeiting and traceability of information in all links of the supply chain could be realized thus the credit rating of the core enterprise could be introduced effectively 33 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain The Demo of Investor\ s Wallet is as follows 3) The information recording system is not perfect and can\ t be verified by multiple parties Solution With blockchain technology the forensic and notarization of all links can be achieved along with multi party verification and effective resolution of disputes II System construction Seal Financial Public Blockchain will reshape the traditional supply chain financial model build a smart contract platform with traceable and non tamperable features of blockchain so that corporation credit rating can flow and be introduced so as to build a supply chain financial ecosystem integrating financial institution core enterprise financial service platform and SMEs to solve the financing prob lems of SMEs Case 2 Oasis Future Oasis Future is a global travel finance service company Relying on big data 34 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain artificial intelligence cloud computing blockchain and other technologies Oasis Future successfully develops global tourism resources provides upstream and downstream tourism companies with a full range of financial services At the same time Oasis realizes the free flow and trading of tourism assets through its asset trading platform accelerating circulation of tourism funds hence reduces the overall financing cost At present Oasis Future has more than 100 000 large B level enterprise customers and hundreds of thousands of small B level customers in upstream downstream relationship Since 2018 the company have cooperated with Seal Chain to start the blockchain recording of base assets with that supervises the life cycle of the assets Based on the chain transaction data as the core risk control means Oasis Future has provided the supply chain financial support for the corporate customers on the chain with the average amount around 2 million RMB Now the accumulated loan amount has exceeded 1 billion RMB with the overdue percentage less than 1% The Demo of Yiqiliuliu (a tourism

Inclusive finance At present traditional credit investigation mode have left millions of people without basic financial services Statistics show that only less than 9% of citizens in developing countries have ever borrowed money from financial institutions 5 2 1 Market capacity and beneficiaries (1) The 2 5 billion population without any bank account and credit card located in nearly 200 countries and regions all around the world (2) People without credit record and debt record in traditional financial institutions (3) Blue collars white collars as well as owners of SMEs who have strong consuming demand and good repayment ability (4) The students of senior high school or higher educational background who have no fixed income but good credit (5) More than half of Internet users worldwide who need digital financial services and innovative financial solution (6) Practitioners and participants in crypto currencies market (7) The current over $10 trillion lending market with compound growth rate of 14% 38 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain 5 2 2 The current status and pain points of inclusive finance The lack of access to financial services has forced many people to obtain loans from illegal institutions and P2P online lending is a new type of lending model based on the Internet between individuals and small/micro enterprises P2P on line lending provides convenient financial services for individuals and small and/ micro enterprises and provides investors with efficient and high yield investment options However in the recently rapid development of the P2P online lending platform there have been frequent financial security incidents such as platform misappropriation of funds money carrying and absconding The main reasons for those problems include the following (1) Funds need to go through the platform which makes fund security difficult to ensure The P2P online lending platforms collapse as the management misappropriates funds The main reason is that the funds of investors and borrowers need to go through the platform the funds are used by platform without supervision fund security is difficult to ensure Once the platform is not well managed or for other reasons it will lead to above mentioned situations (2) The information flow is inconsistent with the funds flow the transaction security can\ t be ensured In a typical P2P online lending platform lending relationship will take effect immediately after the investor\ s lending is completed however the funds are still in the platform and the borrower can\ t get the money in the first time borrower needs 39 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain to withdraw cash from the platform for getting the money This situation has created an inconsistency between information flow and funds flow Once the platform mis appropriates funds and can\xe2\x80\x99t repay in time transaction and funds security can\xe2\x80\x99t be ensured 5 2 3 How does Seal Chain build scenarios of inclusive financial Seal Financial Public Blockchain uses the stablecoin as the payment media to achieve decentralized peer to peer payment and the funds don\ t need to go through the platform The investor invests one to one borrower through the stablecoin the borrower also receives the money at the same time as the loan relationship takes effect ensuring the absolute security of the funds and transactions At the same time P2P platform lending risk control default and other data are recorded in the chain in real time Therefore the risk control capability and profitability of the platform can be continuously witnessed on the chain as well as the repayment history and credit status of each borrower which helps to enhance the confidence of investors To establish a free and transparent circulation mechanism for borrowing and lending assets with the advantages of blockchain in distributed ledgers smart contracts and other technologies Seal Chain could achieve the following targets (1)Breaking geographical constraints of the traditional financial system and allowing funds to circulate globally in a efficient way In Seal\ s inclusive financial scenarios anyone can borrow and lend money at low cost in nearly real time anywhere in the world making microfinance more 40 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain efficient convenient safe and transparent Interest rates of this global lending market will be determined regardless of locations and it solves the problem of interest rate differences which affect countries worldwide Specifically developing countries (such as most African countries) suffer the most interest rates of their microloans are dozens of times those of other regions Through Seal\ s inclusive financial scenarios digital currency holders all over the world can lend funds to countries and regions with higher interest rates free from influence of exchange rate When supply and demand are constantly balanced the gap in loan interest rates between countries will gradually narrow and ultimately all people of the world will truly receive \xe2\x80\x9cinclusive\xe2\x80\x9d financial services (2) Achieving the integration of funds flow and information flow into one establishing an efficient and transparent two way credit risk assessment model In Seal\ s financial scenario investors and borrowers correspond one to one lending relationship and funding relationship will be established at the same time Funds flow and information flow are combined into one to avoid the risk of money abscond by platform and ensure the efficiency and transparency of funds flow At the same time all records of investor information borrower information risk assessment model and lending behavior are recorded on the chain No third party can tamper it gradually credible information will be assessed an efficient and transparent two way credit risk assessment model will be established a credible \xe2\x80\x9cportrait\xe2\x80\x9d of investors and borrowers will be established and a highly trusting blockchain inclusive financial system will be built 41 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain (3) Innovating the inclusive financial model to cover diversified financial needs In the Seal\ s financial scenario platform digital assets holders can become investors by directly lending digital currency to obtain stable and safe returns At the same time they can use these digital assets as collaterals without giving up ownership borrow money at market interest rates to solve their own financing problems thus become borrowers in this new inclusive financial model As the digital currency market keeps increasing the related participant will have strong demands for this kind of financial service 5 2 4 Cooperation Case 1 Mini Group Mini Group is one of the first unsecured lending platforms in Indonesia provides safe comfortable and convenient payday loans to Indonesian people With big data risk control only identity authentication will be needed on the platform and the loan will be completed within 20 minutes no collateral or guarantee is needed The circulation of funds is conducted through stablecoin which realizes decentralized payment and promotes the combination of funds flow and information flow to enhance the credit of platform At the same time by building the consortium blockchain and recording the data such as borrowing risk control overdue and bad debts onto the chain the control ability and profitability of platform are proved so more and more investors will be attracted to invest 42 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain The interface of Financing APP Admin panel 43 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain The interface of Financing APP 5 3 ABS 5 3 1 The pain points of ABS business The scale of China\ s SMEs continues to expand and their contribution to thenational economy is increasing However they still face difficult and expensive financing This is an important issue that needs to be solved in China\ s economic development Asset securitization is based on the future stable and predictable cash flow generated by the base assets After the credit enhancement through structured design the securities that can be sold and circulated in financial market are issued Through assets securitization asset holder could activate financial assets which lack liquidity reduce the cost of comprehensive financing optimize corporate statements and improve the efficiency of financing for SMEs eventually However in the process from the formation of the base assets in supply chain to the securitization of assets the following challenges remains 44 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain Too many parties and information transmission links are involved The financing entity of supply chain finance do not have enough qualifications The issue of ABS thus lacks strong credit enhancement the market pays too much attention to subject ratings and ignores the quality of core assets The structured and dynamic assets move in and out of the dynamic asset pool making it difficult to use traditional technical means in conducting accurate credit evaluation and dynamic risk monitoring Even if it can be done because the evaluation method is centralized and opaque it is difficult to obtain the trust of investors With the rapid development of ABS business ABS faces the problems of information asymmetry and information black box also hinders the development of the industry Only through breaking the information black box of ABS assets investors can obtain real raw data of the assets and then conduct investment analysis independently with all that the market can really achieve explosive growth The pain points in the difficult growth of specific businesses are reflected in (1) The validity of due diligence is doubtful lacks a grasp of risk identifica\xef\xbf\xbdtion (2) It is difficult to conduct risk warning and monitoring in the post investment management (3) Information disclosure is not timely and sufficient (4) The management capability of the asset service provider has yet to be verified 45 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain For the above reasons the institutions that actually carry out ABS business in China mainly focus on large institutions with high subject ratings Because investors basically do not trust the debt rating they only choose ABS products issued by institutions with high subject ratings Regardless of the debt rating at least the subject rating is good 5 3 2 Blockchain ABS Based on the risk characteristics of asset securitization along with the characteristics of blockchain as distribution encryption technology non tamperability traceability and etc it is possible to build an asset securitization consortium blockchain allowing the base asset holders securitization service provides and investors to jointly participate in maintaining the account books thereby linking the information silo of the participants promoting information transparency improving risk discovery and control capabilities realizing the life cycle management of the base assets from generation packaging rating sale to post investment management realizing penetrative regulation on underlying assets With all above mentioned the current market size of ABS could reach dozens of trillion US dollars 46 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain 5 3 3 Application values The value of the blockchain based asset securitization consortium blockchain is as follows (1) Multi party joint maintenance of the account books presenting real assets Parties involved in asset securitization jointly maintain the account books and witness the formation of assets until asset exit Since the formation of the basic assets the assets are digitized and blockchained and the transaction data corresponding to the basic assets is recorded on the chain Data cross validation is realized on the consortium blockchain to ensure the authenticity of the assets from the beginning The data on the chain is not tamperable to ensure the authenticity of the assets during the life cycle Chained storage account books is used to achieve asset traceability thereby preventing fraud significantly reducing moral hazard improving risk control capabilities and enhancing investor confidence (2) Penetrating supervision on underlying assets returning to the essence of assets Penetrating supervision on the underlying assets and making the assets transparent will allow participants to face the lowest tier and most realistic asset details directly returning to the essence of the assets It minimizes the investor\ s distrust of the assets along with the rating agencies and reduces the difficulty of due diligence by intermediaries such as issuers accounting firms law firms and rating agencies (3) Digitization of assets laying the foundation for asset securitization After the asset data is recorded on blockchcain the assets are characterized by 47 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain digitization and blockchainization which facilitates the circulation and supervision of assets At the same time the asset data is standardized through the blockchain to meet the regulatory requirements of the exchange facilitate regulatory review and lay the foundation for asset securitization (4) Realizing life cycle monitoring of financial asset securitization Through the consortium chain management platform the life cycle management of base assets and asset securitization is realized First real time monitoring of the entire process from the formation of the base assets in the asset pool to the exit of assets Secondly the life cycle monitoring is carried out from the due diligence product design audit rating issuance purchase and duration management of asset securitization realizing the real time comprehensive monitoring of the quality and risk of the dynamic asset pool At the same time the asset securitization consortium blockchain brings strong business changes to the management of asset securitization by issuers (brokers) reduc ing the cost of due diligence and communication improving business efficiency expanding assets and accelerating the circulation of assets and securities In particular the technical realization of penetrating on underlying asset at any time greatly helps in cooperating with the regulatory authority for enhancing regulation achieving the non nest and transparency of assets 5 4 Insurance With the development of blockchain technology the availability and convenience of blockchain insurance big data has improved the environment for insurance 48 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain innovation implementation it provides real data which is characteristic of traceability time stamp efficient query multi party storage multi party verification smart contract of quick claims thus provides the reference and basis for the insurance industry to decide the direction and focus of future development For insurance industry using blockchain technology to record claims information can ensure that the information is true and accurate and can\xe2\x80\x99t be tampered and that traceable underwriting and claims can be realized Application scenarios cost reduction efficient operations shared information and anti fraud are the top five keywords for future insurance blockchain applications In the insurance field blockchain is expected to influence the entire insurance industry chain such as product development sales channels product pricing underwriting and claims The blockchain can provide the insurance industry with solutions to automatic compensation and electronic insurance policy which are based on smart contract it will play a role in the discovery of insurance scenarios 49 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain How does the insurance business utilize the characteristics of the blockchain to solve the problems (1) With blockchain technology the identity and information verification of the applicant can be quickly carried out (publicly verifiable and unforgeable) (2) Realization of data separation from enterprises enabling authorized third party to sort and analyze data replacing manual contracts with smart contracts facilitating the fair carrying out of contracts and eliminating false information and malicious fraud (smart contract enforcement to ensure fairness) (3) It can effectively trace and mark the information of the insurance subject which will help to further improve the product accurately assess the risk etc (nontamperable) 5 5 Smart investment advisory 5 5 1 The investment management of blockchain fundsThe investment management of the blockchain funds can achieve the following functions (1) Trusted circulation of data Based on Seal Chain it can design the distributed flow of data such as basic information operation status risk warning and historical performance of specific investment projects (2) Multiple evaluation system 50 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain The project operator investors partner institutions upstream and downstream enterprises etc can provide objective facts related to the project and endorse based on their own identity (3) Project reputation management On the basis of data collection data collaboration can be carried out such as the reputation evaluation of the project according to the analysis rules set by investors 5 5 2 Equity entrustment and circulation of blockchain Funds Based on Seal Chain it can realize the multi party recognition of equity entrustment and the effective record of exercise and provide credible evidence for possible entrustment disputes At the same time based on Seal\ s trust ecology the fund\ s equity can be designed to be digitized and entrusted At the same time the whole process of entrustment and transfer is recorded on the chain and the opening and transparency of blockchain ensures the credible record and supervision of equity transfer 5 6 Equities 5 6 1 The legal status of company\ s equities (shares) Companies are divided into two main categories Joint stock companies and limited companies Joint stock companies correspond to shares and limited companies corresponds to equities Joint stock companies are also divided into two main categories listed companies and unlisted stock companies The shares of listed companies are registered in China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation 51 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain Limited (CSDC) Shares of non listed companies comply with the provisions of Company Law of China shares treated as rights certificates and registration booklet needed to record shareholders It is worth noting that the shares issued by non listed companies do not need to be registered by a third party They rely solely on the company\xe2\x80\x99s own issuance of shares and maintenance of share registration to determine equities For limited companies because there are no such shares as certificates equity certificate becomes the \xe2\x80\x9cshareholder registration\xe2\x80\x9d maintained by the company itself Above all Company Law of China gives relatively big autonomy to all compa\xef\xbf\xbd nies allows companies to provide the final proof of equities (shares) 5 6 2 The legal effects of blockchain equities (shares) Company Law of China allows a company to create and maintain shareholder registration in any written format not limited to any specific carriers As a public ledger blockchain not only complies with Company Law of China but also determines the trend By comparison early stocks were paper made and required manual book keeping of transactions which was later electronized Similarly there is a process for money to evolve from banknote to digital currency The company equity registration in China is also increasingly approaching and adopting the matured experiences from developed countries Equities are not registered in state authorities but are registered in autonomous bodies such as chambers of commerce and trade unions and proof of entitlement regarding 52 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain equities (shares) is provided by a market approval third party Therefore if equities are registered through the blockchain the trusted third party will be thoroughly decentralized that is equities register will be no longer limited to a specific third party it will rely on all participants to maintain a registra\xef\xbf\xbd tion system The system has four characteristics as follows (1) Pass the right of registration to the company reflecting the spirit of self governance (2) Ensure the transparency authenticity and credibility of the equity registra\xef\xbf\xbdtion reducing disputes (3) Promote equity circulation and resource sharing the registration and trans\xef\xbf\xbdfer of shares would be more convenient and safe (4) Data is stored in time permanently and safely 5 6 3 Blockchain equity advantages (1) Equity registration management Equity registration plays a role in informing the public allowing potential trading entities to understand the status of ownership Registration also plays a key role in the transaction since it records the transfer of ownership Equities of non listed companies are often need to be handled manually in nowadays the maintenance of the shareholder registration is very complicated which makes it difficult for the maintenance and tracking of historical transactions 53 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain Blockchain ownership registration is completely digitalized and it owns the blockchain characteristics of being secure transparent non tamperable and easy to track Blockchain brings in great advantages (2) The transfer and circulation of equities The transfer and circulation of equities is crucial The traditional OTC equity transaction is based on the credit of both parties which brings the necessity to establish a two way trust before conducting a transaction the credit risk is on both parties By contrast the trading platform takes all the accumulated credit risks from all market participants Blockchain can effectively reduce the credit risk of transactions As equity ownership is registered on the blockchain the equity transaction must be signed with the owner\ s private key for verification After the transaction is confirmed the change made will also be recorded in the blockchain which would protect the interests of both parties 54 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain In summary The adoption of blockchain technology not only realizes the functions of blockchain equity registration transfer inquiry pledge financing etc but also provides the following advantages \xef\xbc\x881\xef\xbc\x89 Efficiency It takes more than 15 20 days to make changes in traditional business registration it take much less time in blockchain equity transfer \xef\xbc\x882\xef\xbc\x89 security Solve the compliance challenge in shareholding entrustment \xef\xbc\x883\xef\xbc\x89 Convenience Mobile APP would be used to conduct a shareholder meeting or a board meeting to vote for financing of business rapidly \xef\xbc\x884\xef\xbc\x89 Public Trust All transaction information and disclosure information are recorded on the blockchain and the record will be available permanently and cannot be tampered with 5 7 Corporate bonds In the current bond market bond issuance requires registration filing custody listing and many other processes bond transactions include inquiry transaction order confirmation order matching transaction amount confirmation and more procedures settlement of accounts will still be needed after all above procedures It is a long and cumbersome process from the preparation of bonds issuance to the final completeness As the bond market development demands higher standard on transaction costs and efficiency such cumbersome business processes can not meet the needs of investment and financing entities 55 \x0cSeal DApps Wall Street on the Chain Blockchain technology provides a new and feasible solution Blockchain owns the characteristics of internal trust decentralization and high transparency and its data is non tamperable and unforgeable These characteristics of blockchain technology enable it to provide full process multi angle technical solutions for bond registration distribution trading clearing and settlement Blockchain brings disruptive changes in business processes Corporate bond transactions based on the super ledger technology achieve a high transparancy i e transactions on the platform can present the entire life cycle of commercial bond The blockchain also allows the list of participating traders to change dynamically In this case all three parties \xe2\x80\x93 the issuer the central custodian and the investor \xe2\x80\x93 receive a decentralized blockchain ledger to process the transaction Each participant can exchange digital documents online and track the transaction status in real time which greatly improves the efficiency of post investment asset management 56 \x0cTeam Introduction Wall Street on the Chain Marvin Zhang
