b \x0cSPECIFICATION This document is Ethereum Gold Project Technology Golden Paper version V2 5 It mainly introduces the background positioning technical characteristics and application scenarios of ETGP In the future we will continually upgrade this document to keep it consistent with new technology evolvement For the latest and more information of ETGP such as technical Golden papers software releases developer communities and more please visit the official site https //etgproject org CONTACT US Golden Paper goldenpaper@etgproject org Developer dev@etgproject org Copyright declaration Copyright of this document belongs to the ETGP team all rights reserved DISCLAIMER AS Blockchain technology progresses the ETGP team will improve and refine existing technology solutions as needed and continue to improve the technical golden paper 1 \x0cABSTRACT 2 \x0c10/12/2018 3 \x0cAnti quantum attack new antiquantum algorithms are devised which replaces existing SHA series algorithm with the Keccak 512 hash algorithm and replaces ECDSA signature algorithm with an integer lattice based NTRU sign signature algorithm These algorithms reduce the threat coming from development of quantum computing and gradual popularization of quantum computer (5) Transaction anonymity based on anonymity characteristics of cryptocurrency such as Monero and ZCash one time key and ring signature are applied to transaction anonymity and privacy protection which performs with high cost effective ratio and excellent security As a function of choice zeroknowledge proofs are used to satisfy privacy requirements in different application scenarios (6) Smart contracts we design Moses virtual machine (MVM) which supports declarative non Turing complete contract as well as advanced Turing complete contract programmed in Moses language MVM is able to access Blockchain data conveniently and securely and supports issuance of third party assets which can be integrated into applications in terms of public permissioned (private) or consortium (hybrid) Blockchain (7) Crossing and merging chains we adopt chain relaying technology to solve the problems in crossing chains transaction and transparent operations among multiple chains which not only can maintain independence of crossing chains operation but also reuses various functions of ETGP (8) Ecological motivation various token allocation methods are used which support double layer mining for incentives 10/12/2018 4 \x0c(9) Industrial application we design lots of industrial common interfaces in form of JSON RPC satisfying different scenarios such as circulation payment data transmission data search and contract invocation ETGP supports implementation for a variety of applications including anonymous communications power sharing storage sharing bandwidth sharing reputation sharing (credit guarantee) and it provides open interfaces for third party app development By connecting with various application scenarios ETGP can cooperate with kinds of service providers and application providers to support commercial organizations or government agencies to build public consortium or permissioned chain application systems according to business characteristics and requirements ETGP will reform existing operational mode in Internet It introduced Token distribution mechanism for incentive to inspire community to maintain ETGP public chain and to develop apps ETGP will stimulate more value and network spreading effects on public chain and turn economic incentive system into a self renewing system and create a completely decentralized ecosystem of value internet and value transfer 10/12/2018 5 \x0c10/12/2018 6 \x0c10/12/2018 7 \x0c10/12/2018 8 \x0cBLOCKCHAIN PROBLEMS 10/12/2018 9 \x0c10/12/2018 10 \x0c10/12/2018 11 \x0cSMART CONTRACT 10/12/2018 12 \x0c10/12/2018 13 \x0cMOTIVATION 10/12/2018 14 \x0c10/12/2018 15 \x0cETGP Android/ IOS Wallets 10/12/2018 16 \x0cETGP TOKEN DISTRIBUTION Platform Airdrop + Holding Competition 10% Team & project foundation 15% 10/12/2018 Reserved 15% Swap 60% 17 \x0cTEAM & ADVISERS CEO & FOUNDER CHRIS GRAVES MARKETING MANAGER JEPHERSON PERRY DEVLOPER JUAN HAN CHAO FINANCIAL ADVISER AMANDA FRENDELY PROJECT DESIGNER MIYA HUI LIANG SENIOR MARKETING MANAGER SICHUAN JUAN WU 10/12/2018 18 \x0cRISK 10/12/2018 19 \x0c10/12/2018 20 \x0c10/12/2018 21 \x0c10/12/2018 22 \x0c10/12/2018 23 \x0c
