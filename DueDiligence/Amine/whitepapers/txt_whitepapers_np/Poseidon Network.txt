POSEIDON NETWORK has focused on content delivery network (henceforth referred to as CDN) for a long time it\xe2\x80\x99s the main service and main source of profit of us now product ready faster and better price Rising Online Users per capita online consumption and growing demand for high quality video content many gaming services have been adopting online channels for delivering content to the users which has further enabled the growth of CDN market One of the major companies Cisco has also predicted that the amount of internet traffic is expected to increase by fourfold emphasizing the need for content delivery networks The global CDN market is expected to grow from USD 7 47B in 2017 to USD 30 89B by 2022 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 32 8% during the forecast period Besides the global storage market is expected to rise from USD 30B in 2017 to USD 89B by 2022 at a CAGR of 23 7% during the forecast period (source Markets and Markets) 7 \x0c2017 2022 Global CDN market Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 32 8% 2017 2022 Global Storage market Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is 23 7% Media delivery is expected to have high market share Rising demand for rich video content among the increasing online users and the trend of digitization among the organizations across the end user verticals boosts the overall CDN market demand Online gaming is one of the major areas where CDN is gaining prominence The gaming companies are increasingly investing in CDN to deliver high quality content for ensuring better user experience Many media organizations are making a transition toward digital distribution model These transitions present a great market opportunity to the CDN vendors The key consumption markets locate at developed countries The USA takes the market share of 42% in 2017 followed by Europe with 20 7% China\ s consumption market has a quicker growing speed with a market share of 41% from 2013 to 2017 We tend to believe this industry becomes more and more mature and the consumption increasing rate will show a smooth curve The need for content to be mobile compatible is further expected to increase owing to the expected growth of consumed data to about 4 5 GB per month which is now at an amount of 900 MB on average (source Mordor intelligence) 8 \x0cBy adopting blockchain technology with IoTs likes NAS desktops and mobiles POSEIDON NETWORK solves the problems of unused network resources in the world pour them into the world of CDN We find the way to decrease the cost and incredibly improve the efficiency of CDN It is time for POSEIDON NETWORK to dominate the CDN market and emancipate the world 9 \x0c1 2 Overall Architecture The following four modules define the main functions of the POSEIDON NETWORK Framework The overview is as follows 1 2 1 User App Information and resources management at the application end is called Smart Contract with features including mining social sharing trading etc Every user can choose to register and login with different social media accounts including Facebook Google Telegram and WeChat A set of private keys are automatically generated after logging in and it is stored in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of the NAS Super Node directly through KeyStore API using session token in the social login as encyrpted signature User data and mapped public keys of social login are stored in the Oracle database for future queries If multiple social logins are bounded encrypted signature is enhanced to be multi sig when BioID verification modules such as FaceID TouchID can be used 10 \x0cYou can use the private key on the TEE via BioID to call smart contract whenever you want to use smart contract As it is hidden in the user flow the user does not need to know how the private key is called and how to use smart contract If the app is uninstalled or your cell phone is replaced you can simply re bind the previously bound social login account and generate the same unlock key to unlock the private key in the TEE The Miners page contains use the Poseidon App as the Mobile Edge to share bandwidth and space choose how much space and bandwidth to share dashboard and bandwidth mining data and revenue can be seen in the app receive corresponding QQQ 1u every day 1 2 2 Oracle Oracle is built on the cloud serving as a bridge between smart contracts and the outside world One feature of the POSEIDON NETWORK is that any user can interact with on chain and off chain via the Restful API In the future Oracle will operate on virtual machines and communicate with the repository 1 2 3 Off Chain Using NAS as a super node mobile phones and computers can be regarded as a light node Nodes provide decentralized CDNs storage space and services such as TEE The process looks like this Store files on IPFS and NAS through distributed technology and quickly deliver files to the desired device using QEdge CDN Upload the file to get the file Hash / URL and get the file through the file Hash / URL 1 2 4 On Chain Integration with Layer 1 (DAG as DLT) and Layer 2 (token digital asset main net) Because DAG is free of service charge non PSD transactions such as file metadata records are stored in the DAG as non tamperable files Metadata files include UserID FileID URL Price etc Using the characteristics of different blockchain technologies and the advantages of each Blockchain to realize the flexibility of Smart Contract layers and to call Smart Contracts based on ETH EOS 11 \x0cTRON etc It is first developed based on ETH and gradually EOS is adopted to speed up transactions and NEM is used to manage digital assets 1 3 Mission and Vision Team\xe2\x80\x99s Vision Transforming the world with decentralized technology revolutionizing the habit of using

miners they will receive additional earnings and reduce waste of resources \xe2\x9c\xa6 Make good use of idle network traffic resources around the world 2 4 Application Scenarios 2 4 1 B2B Business Model Introduction to the B2B Business Model This phase is called the block chain application landing phase The POSEIDON NETWORK provides enterprise services from the third quarter of 2018 It provides acceleration services for the following content video streaming game update acceleration image loading acceleration and video live streaming etc We choose to operate the B2B\ s economic model because it is well received by content industry 15 \x0ccustomers and large miners both needs are increasing at the same time We decided to launch the next stage to enhance our scalability Miners participating in the POSEIDON NETWORK can earn QQQ by sharing bandwidth and storage space Miners can choose to keep QQQ Token or trade to the exchange and convert to fiat Use Cases The application at this stage mainly falls in the fields of media entertainment and education such as video live broadcasters audio and video content industry audio and video education websites social media forums and update file download support POSEIDON NETWORK collects the bandwidth storage space and even the idle network resources of small and medium sized enterprises mainly from NAS and Linux systems and pays the small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) who are willing to provide idle network resources and provides network resources to the above mentioned industries and gets profits For more detailed cases and future work please see Chapter 4 Market Planning 2 4 2 C2B2B Business Model Introduction to the C2B2B Business Model This stage is called the seeding stage which is the focus of current stage of development It is a mass miner mechanism Anyone with a well functioning computer or mobile phone can become a light node In addition anyone with a NAS can also be transformed into a super node sharing idle bandwidth storage space and other network resources to gain profits Use Cases In addition to SMEs we also allow the general public to join the 16 \x0cPOSEIDON NETWORK mining model to share idle resources through NAS computers or mobile phones to gain profits The POSEIDON NETWORK collects network resources such as idle bandwidth storage space and even computing power for content industry customers For more detailed cases and future work please see Chapter 4 Market Planning\xe2\x80\x9d 2 4 3 2C Business Model Introduction to the 2C Business Model This phase called the blooming phase will increase services of average users It can be used for quick downloads of videos fast access to streaming audio and video such as the download service provided by Mega or the broadcast of NBA live events We have more visions to realize Please refer to Future Work for details Use Cases In the third phase we provide personalized data sharing services such as Mega flicker etc and upgrade the POSEIDON NETWORK to a video platform like YouTube and Netflix Miners of any level can provide idle network resources so that the demand side can get the required network resources The POSEIDON NETWORK business model will become complete at this stage For more detailed cases and future work please refer to Chapter 4 Market Planning 17 \x0c3 TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS 3 1 Technology Composition The POSEIDON NETWORK is a platform for a variety of Apps and dApps starting with the top level as shown in the above illustration The upper chart shows the application scenarios of Apps and dApps including live broadcast video sharing photo sharing file sharing update file distribution and future block chain identity Trust Execution Environment (TEE) etc and unlimited possibilities The middle chart displays smart contracts and algorithms With the characteristics of the smart contract disclosure the six main algorithms are like the Constitution and the Congressional system The various algorithms maintain the efficiency of the POSEIDON NETWORK and form the supervision layer of it 18 \x0cThe lower chart demonstrates the entire underlying architecture which includes QCDN DSN and Block chain QCDN also contains QEdge as the node and the Qontroller of the distributor More details will be elaborated in this chapter 3 1 1 QCDN This section will explain the next generation decentralized Content Delivery Network (dCDN) built by the POSEIDON NETWORK which is called QCDN It includes a traffic dispatcher called Qontroller and QEdge decentralized nodes from all over the world that join our network Anyone can become QEdge through the device and perform content delivery (or bandwidth sharing) content storage edge computing and mutual authentication QEdge is divided into two categories Super Node and Light Node which will enhance the stability of the entire network Different levels of nodes have different responsibilities and can generate different profits 3 1 2 Qontroller Qontroller is a distributed traffic dispatcher Bandwidth traffic scheduling is a key part of QCDN Traffic access traction selection of appropriate QEdge etc are all done at Qontroller In short Qontroller\ s job is to distribute traffic to the QEdge around the world with open smart contracts and algorithms Improving the user experience and saving system costs is our ultimate goal 3 1 3 QEdge QEdge is the smallest work unit on the POSEIDON NETWORK Each unit has a different organization size and everyone is welcome to join QEdge\ s devices are mainly enterprise rooms NAS desktop computers and mobile phones and will continue to be used on other ideal and feasible IOT devices in the future The network resources that can be shared include bandwidth storage space and computing power Anyone who sets the device to QEdge will be rewarded each time they deliver any content The setup is very simple even without technical knowledge just let the device operate QEdge in the background you 19 \x0ccan get the corresponding pay QEdge\ s software or app can set a fixed output and even adjust the output automatically so you can use your computer without losing too much bandwidth Automatic bandwidth output adjustment Node software and mobile app use AI technology to automatically adjust the output bandwidth throttle based on various factors If the device is largely idle the node will turn on the bandwidth high speed output mode If the user is downloading or watching a movie the node automatically reduces the speed to the bandwidth low speed output mode or pauses the bandwidth output You can also choose a fixed number to share your network resources steadily while stabilizing your earnings Personal devices can also participate in the QCDN ecosystem and receive a variety of revenue acquisition models based on the actual number of times the content is delivered or the content size In addition content delivery can be fixed and profits will be obtained from the amount of earnings generated by the nearby network Fixed content output Fixed content output mainly depends on the preference If the content is the favorite content of nearby users it will be a QCDN with a very high hit rate The more people access it the higher the profit and even the number of times it can beat the mine For example I like to watch NBA live and only pass the NBA live content It happens that all the people in the vicinity are watching it and the mobile phone will get huge profits Super Node A fully functional node It has the right to request the content of the distribution and entrust it to the adjacent QEdge for network optimization It is highly recommended to use NAS as super node Light Node A node with limited functionality for general use It works on desktops mobile devices and other IoT devices 20 \x0c3 2 Smart Contracts and Algorithms The POSEIDON NETWORK is basically scalable core smart contracts that combine to form an autonomous layer and is operated by PSD tokens As mentioned above at the beginning of the development of the network and before the formation of multiple organizations the POSEIDON NETWORK will form a Poseidon Autonomous Council with several well known companies organizations research groups academies and universities in the world to determine the initial codes parameters and specifications These renewable smart contract codes parameters and specifications will become a set of constitution like guidelines and the public will continue to develop its law The POSEIDON NETWORK has six main types of smart contracts and algorithms which will be introduced here 3 2 1 Node Selection Algorithm The selection and optimization of QEdge is a very important part of QCDN In this smart contract the artificial intelligence related algorithm will be used The core goal is to find the QEdge with the highest relative stability and the most suitable geographical location to reduce the latency for users to access QCDN and to reduce the bandwidth cost of QCDN 3 2 2 Caching Prediction Algorithm The user\ s web experience is closely related to the CDN The CDN solves the problem of network content delivery and user network congestion It is therefore very important to know the operational efficiency of the CDN One of the key factors to increase the efficiency of CDN operation is that CDN must provide the corresponding content when the user proposes a request We use the Poseidon Network Caching Prediction Algorithm to make use of it Deep learning and neural network like technologies predict the content of events and cache high traffic high demand data from the main server to the CDN 3 2 3 Flexible QCDN pricing smart contract The QCDN service is priced in US dollars and uses QQQ as the sole token for driving system services In order to effectively attract general users to join we have established a mechanism for QCDN price elasticity 21 \x0cCustomers using QCDN can directly pay US dollars or use QQQ to pay for use Using QQQ as a payment tool the price instantly corresponds to the USD exchange rate and can be subject to a certain amount of discount 3 2 4 QEdge Voting and Reward to Smart Contract QEdge can be big or small as small as a light mobile phone node or as big as thousands of NAS and multiple network lines or giant enterprises or like a mining pool with NAS computers mobile phones and voluntary organizations scattered around the world We must have a contract to decide which QEdge has voting rights legislative power and QEdge rewards As in society we decide that people who reach a certain age or condition can vote some can serve as legislators and some can serve as leaders We not only encourage the nodes holding PSD to have legislative power but also design corresponding mechanisms for the nodes that pay more and give authority to maintain the stability of the whole society Using a smart contract with open features it clearly demonstrates the distribution open and transparent rankings motivates everyone to participate in the competition and is regulated by the public Similar to contemporary law public announcements on the Internet contemporary competitions people openly compete online And we have a variety of network and economic stability rewards The more you can help with stability the more you can save costs the more you can improve your speed the more you can increase your hit rate the higher the rewards and the higher the profit The initial network reward parameters are as follows The following are the conditions for additional issuance The value of the test network is determined by the council and the public after the official launch The following ratios are the default initial values of the test network 22 \x0c\xe2\x9c\xa6 We encourage super miners to use the special network route to the NAS to ensure the stability of the whole network The rewards are as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 QEdge with stable on line and no disconnection for more than 7 days 1% increase in returns \xe2\x80\xa2 QEdge with stable on line and no breaks for more than 30 days 6% increase in returns \xe2\x9c\xa6 Rare or critical QEdge 3 15% increase in returns \xe2\x9c\xa6 The degree that PSD holders increase profit is based on the number of shares held \xe2\x9c\xa6 NAS miners using a specific label or model 30% 50% increase in returns \xe2\x9c\xa6 The top 1% miners in stability 5% increase in returns The council will add more incentive schemes to scalable smart contracts which can be used for the whole QCDN ecosystem 3 2 5 Payout and Lockup Cycle Smart Contract Under the token economics model users receive virtual point rewards of equivalent US dollars by participating in the POSEIDON NETWORK These rewards are automatically withdrawn daily Tokens can also be seen as incentives and every user who receives tokens is the holder of the POSEIDON NETWORK Under this incentive scheme and from the perspective of getting more rewards each user will contribute to form a better ecosystem forming a virtuous circle In order to maintain balance of the POSEIDON NETWORK ecosystem we encourage users to hold QQQ for a long period of time Long term holders receive a higher proportion of rewards The following QQQ reward parameters are the values of the test network After the official launch it will be decided by the Parliament and the public Daily withdrawal regular rate of returns \xe2\x9c\xa6 Withdrawal every 7 days QQQ returns increased by 1% \xe2\x9c\xa6 Withdrawal every 30 days QQQ returns increased by 2% \xe2\x9c\xa6 Withdrawal every 90 days QQQ returns increased by 5% In addition since the PSD is a type of security token and its holders 23 \x0care members of the board who have important decision making power on the overall balance and stability of the POSEIDON NETWORK Therefore we will also give more incentives to encourage feedback from PSD holders The parameter is the value of the test network After the official launch it is decided by the council and the public 3 2 6 Upgradable Smart Contract All smart contracts and algorithms are upgradeable In the future members of the Poseidon Autonomous Council are responsible for determining how the POSEIDON NETWORK will evolve and ensuring the vision of the POSEIDON NETWORK Over time more governance board seats and diversity will be increased to easily reflect the views of different industries Based on this we need to upgrade our smart contract remove the oligarchic market and return the rights to the public 3 3 Consensus Mechanism A completely different consensus mechanism Proof of Delivering (PoD) PoD will determine both the miner\ s revenue and the user\ s cost The core concept is easy to understand users pay The PoS (proof of SpaceTime) and PoR (proof of Replication) consensus mechanisms of the POSEIDON NETWORK and filecoin program are completely different they are completely different from the PoS (proof of storage) consensus mechanism and file contracts in SiaCoin The POSEIDON NETWORK is more focused on content delivery not just access to data This means that customers of the POSEIDON NETWORK don\ t care where content or data is stored but they care about transmission For example live broadcast the main need for live broadcast is content delivery not permanent storage Customers pay QQQ because they need content delivery not data storage To some extent temporary storage is free because it will disappear soon 24 \x0cTherefore in this case the Poseidon Network creates a PoD delivery proof of consensus which means that each node can only be rewarded based on the amount of content it delivers and needs to be verified by neighboring nodes 25 \x0c4 MARKET PLANNING 4 1 Profit Model As a provider of online resources the POSEIDON NETWORK can generate revenues and profits from a wide range of sources Now the project is still in its very early stages and needs to rely on strong support from all walks of life 4 1 1 CDN Services The CDN

on the distribution subscription and promotion of content and empowering the content creators to create freely to become a new generation of decentralized content entertainment ecosystem 4 3 Future Work 4 3 1 Blockchain Identity Blockchain identity is a part of the overall TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) program including Social Login and Private Key It utilizes the non tamperable feature of the blockchain checks in the digital identity and does the natural person authentication to become the DID (Decentrailized ID) These certifications include private keys emails and general smart phone logins and features such as TouchID & FaceID and even ID cards passports driver\ s licenses When the number of footprints is enough you will rebuild who you 31 \x0care and everyone will be able to verify your identity KYC etc more easily You don\ t even have to remember the recovery phase anymore It is as simple as unlocking your phone You can also choose not to reveal your identity 4 3 2 Big Data Integration When the POSEIDON NETWORK attracts a large number of C end users it stores and bins messages and needs of users to ensure that the data cannot be falsified or reversed Data winding whether it is transaction data or various time data social data geographic data etc will belong to everyone Personal rights will be extremely valuable \xe2\x80\x9ctrust assets\xe2\x80\x9d for the POSEIDON NETWORK 4 3 3 Social media When the number of general users is stable the POSEIDON NETWORK has corresponding technologies rules and storage fields It can also become decentralized but file sharing platform or forum will be supervised It means having the freedom of speech and public supervision at the same time 4 3 4 Audio DRM After DID TEE and Social media have become mature we can compare the FID of each file by taking advantage of machine learning and deep learning to achieve most of the Audio DRM and even Data/ Information retrieval (ML integration) 4 4 After 5G Infrastructures Are Popularly Used 4 4 1 Market In the next 15 years 5G will contribute 2 2 trillion US dollars to the global GDP accounting for 5 3% of GDP growth Three of the application scenarios include enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) massive machine type communications (mMTC) ultra reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) At the same time the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has also defined eight key 5G demand indicators for IMT 2020 which will be described in detail in the next section 32 \x0cThe important role of 5G lies in the interconnection (between people and things) The result of interconnection is communication A deeper level of communication lies in experience and emotional sharing 5G will further enable people to communicate at a deeper level and enhance experience and emotional sharing This means that once the 5G infrastructure is deployed in a certain country or region each mobile phone can be changed from a light node to a super node The era of \xe2\x80\x9cX as a service\xe2\x80\x9d is coming and linking all IoT hardware such as mobile phones and NAS is the day today advantage of the POSEIDON NETWORK which can also be used to the fullest in this day and age It means heavy application of the POSEIDON NETWORK is being realized 4G changes life and 5G will change the society as a whole Using IoT equipped with CDN and proper blockchain technology the POSEIDON NETWORK will thrive like a sea god when the wave of 5G strikes In other words deploying the POSEIDOEN NETWORK means reorganizing the future of the world 4G and 5G applications will be introduced in this order 4 4 2 Eight Key Indicators of 5G IMT 2020 of the International Telecommunication Union In order to achieve the above three application scenarios the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) defines IMT 2020 as having eight key demand indicators of 5G and it also defines its target value which greatly exceeds the 4G indicator The eight key demand indicators are as follows 1 The actual experience rate of a mobile user/device in an area of sustainable and seamless network signal service is up to 100 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s 2 The highest peak rate per user/device under ideal conditions is 20Gbit/s 3 The ability to maintain sustainable communication at a speed of 500 km/h 4 Network latency is 1 millisecond 5 The total equipment connection density per unit is 1 million units per square kilometer 6 Energy efficiency is 100 times that of the 4G standard which can 33 \x0cbe divided into two categories for network and device respectively 7 Spectrum efficiency The average data transmission per unit of spectrum resource used by each base station is 3 times that of the 4G standard 8 The intra area communication capability provides 10 Mbps of service per square meter per base station Differences in demand indicators of 4G\xef\xbc\x88IMT Advanced\xef\xbc\x89and 5G\xef\xbc\x88IMT 2020\xef\xbc\x89are shown below 1 2\xef\xbc\x9a 4 4 3 Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) Having enhanced indoor and outdoor ultra high speed connections for consistent service quality even at the edge of the cell the eMBB focuses on people centric applications which will involve access to all content applications and services that need to be connected faster Application scenarios of the POSEIDON NETWORK viewing ultra high definition (4K/8K) video VR/AR application 1 Ofcom (2017) Update on 5G spectrum in the UK at 9 available at https //www ofcom org uk/ __data/assets/pdf_\xef\xac\x81le/0021/97023/5G update 08022017 pdf 2 ITU R IMT 2020 Contribution https //www itu int/md/R15 IMT 2020 C 0001 34 \x0cIn high speed trains (such as on high speed rail) the signal is sometimes very poor because seamless connection between signals has not yet been achieved The enhanced mobile bandwidth usage scenario can effectively solve such problems by improving the network increasing network transmission speed and enhancing communication capabilities ultimately improving the user experience 4 4 4 International Roaming The POSEIDON NETWORK will also provide international roaming services so that when you go abroad you only need to connect to other nodes such as mobile phones NAS and other IoTs enabling you to connect to the local network without using local telecom operators 4 4 5 Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) Because these services require extensive coverage relatively low power consumption and low transmission speed its application is characterized by a large number of connected devices that typically transmit relatively small amount of sensitive and non delayed data As it is being widely used equipment costs are reduced and battery life is greatly extended Smart home is a common theme with a wide variety of products and each product transmits a small amount of data and is not particularly sensitive to latency requirements Large scale mechanical 5G communications just meet the need of this type of application scenario In addition smart cities are also recognized as one of the important application scenarios of 5G There are many kinds of objects that can be connected including transportation facilities air water electricity meters etc More than one million connected devices need to be carried and the amount of data that the device needs to transfer is small Compared to the existing technology 5G can provide the ability to connect objects in a very dense manner across existing areas The POSEIDON NETWORK can effectively and massively release the bandwidth of all IoT objects 35 \x0c4 4 6 Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) This use case has very strict requirements for latency and packet loss to ensure improved responsiveness The application areas of the POSEIDON NETWORK include wireless control of industrial manufacturing or production processes remote surgery automation on smart grid distribution and transportation security Driverless and autonomous driving have been applied in specific areas while driverless driving is an advanced stage of autonomous driving requiring less latency To ensure user safety the transmission latency needs to be as low as 1ms and it needs to be super reliable With the arrival of 5G the POSEIDON NETWORK can turn each car into a node and driving is expected to be truly unmanned 36 \x0c5 TOKEN ECONOMICS 5 1 Token Economics Mechanism Design Token Economics are fundamentally new ways of incentivizing human behavior The main task in mechanism design is to specify a mechanism that incentivizes rational agents to behave in certain ways based upon their private information that lead to socially desired outcomes POSEIDON NETWORK issues two kinds of token Security token PSD and utility token QQQ STO is a kind of security which is going to be compliance supervised by SEC USA PSD token anchored the real value of POSEIDON NETWORK mainnet including all of the devices NAS desktops mobiles IoTs\xe2\x80\xa6etc and network resources bandwidth storage computations\xe2\x80\xa6etc If you own PSD token you own some duty and rights to the mainnet likewise legal citizen in the world of POSEIDON NETWORK It means that you have the right to vote or even more amend the law which are smart contracts in this case on governance layer QQQ is the functional token of POSEIDON NETWORK platform the most important part of POSEIDON NETWORK mainnet furthermore the only token in this ecosystem Pay QQQ token to drive the services of POSEIDON NETWORK or get QQQ from supplying your unused network resources And find the table below for the release detail PSD QQQ Token Type Security Token \xe5\x8a\x9f\xe8\x83\xbd\xe5\x9e\x8b\xe4\xbb\xa3\xe5\xb9\xa3 (Utility Token) Total Amount 1 Billion 21 Billion 37 \x0cPSD Method QQQ A

Parameters of PSD Token Securities type token PSD is issued by the POSEIDON NETWORK The PSD will anchor the POSEIDON NETWORK node value and will distribute a percentage of the node\ s revenue per quarter to all token holders The distribution ratio of PSD tokens is as follows The main parameters of PSD are as follows \xe9\xa0\x85\xe2\xbd\xac\xe7\x9b\xae

Token The PSD token will anchor the node value Its holders will get more earnings and have the right to influence the direction of the entire POSEIDON NETWORK The voting rights will be based on the number of shares and the detailed rules will be disclosed in the Poseidon Council document The value of the PN network is determined by the node value Vn and the number of nodes N and the Poseidon constant p The Poseidon constant p is a fair and publicly available parameter on the scalable smart contract The default value of the test network is 1 that is VM = Vn \xc3\x97 N \xc3\x97 p The node value Vn is the multi node VD multiplied by the number of nodes N plus the available value V multiplied by the time t The PN network value reference formula is as follows\xef\xbc\x9a VM = (VD \xc3\x97 V \xc3\x97 t) \xc3\x97 N \xc3\x97 p As long as the number of nodes or the value that can be sold grows the price of PSD will be affected The price of NAS will also slightly affect the price of PSD VN total can be regarded as the economic variable y After a certain period of time n the formula of the annual growth rate g is g= 39 ln \xc3\x97 n yn y0 \x0cWhen QCDN is completely evolved into DAO CDN (Distributed Autonomous CDN Organization) the POSEIDON NETWORK will form a blockchain supervision layer independently which is compatible with each main chain through mapping to further increase liquidity 5 2 3 DAO CDN Decentralized Autonomous CDN Organization There are several special upgradeable smart contracts in the POSEIDON NETWORK including innovative algorithms smart contracts and the token economy for community mass regulation Because smart contracts are open and transparent they will gradually become open source and autonomous smart contracts Smart contracts will define the configuration parameters of the POSEIDON NETWORK such as how rewards are distributed how much is distributed etc With the development of the POSEIDON NETWORK the public participating in the network can propose discussions and updates on the parameters of autonomous smart contracts They can jointly decide whether to accept the proposal to change the content to form multiple autonomous organizations (which may take the form of a foundation) a research organization or a mining pool 5 2 4 POSEIDON Governance Council Before forming multiple organizations engineers must complete the initial code economists set the economic model the analysts do the investigation and research and the lawyers conduct legal affairs and supervision It requires the cooperation of many professionals From this perspective the POSEIDON NETWORK will initially work with the world\ s leading companies organizations research groups and academic universities to gather talents from relevant backgrounds to form the Poseidon Autonomous Council to determine the initial code parameters and specifications These renewable smart contract codes important parameters like M and N and related antidiscrimination specifications will become a set of constitution like guidelines and the public will continue to help develop and enrich the law Our most important work is to maintain the stability of miners\xe2\x80\x99 earnings and the stability of the network transmission It is therefore important to determine the reward mechanism parameters and specifications of the stable network All members can participate in 40 \x0cthe discussion and PSD holders and members of the Council can vote to change the parameters of smart contracts It is the responsibility of the members of the Poseidon Autonomous Council to determine how the POSEIDON NETWORK will evolve and make sure the vision of the POSEIDON NETWORK is realized Over time more governance board seats and diversity will be added to more easily reflect the views of different industries 5 3 Functional Token QQQ 5 3 1 Main Parameters of QQQ Token The POSEIDON NETWOR has a virtual credit mechanism designed specifically to reward miners which is called QQQ The core formula for QQQ revenue is as follows R= M1 n \xe2\x88\x91i=1 Mn \xc3\x97 Ct We will devote the following extensive paragraphs to explain the formula The revenue is generated by the delivery of content As long as there are videos files and other data transmission it will generate revenue Customers must pay first This is called the Proof of Delivering (PoD) According to the PoD consensus design as long as you have the data you will get QQQ as rewards and the process is similar to mining 41 \x0cQQQ will raise funds initially through IEO The distribution ratio of QQQ tokens is as follows Partner / Advisor Team IEO Community Bounty 10% 30% 20% 10% 30% 42 \xe9\xa0\x85\xe2\xbd\xac\xe7\x9b\xae Allocation Tokens IEO 10% 2 100 000 000 Partner / Advisor 10%

000 Ticker QQQ Initial price 0 002 USDT Standard ERC20 Fund raising time May 11 2019 Lock up period 6 months 5 3 2 Fair Mining Formula Design The output of QQQ will be calculated based on the node contribution M value of each node designed to be fair and to maintain the stability of the whole network The rights of miners need to be protected to ensure stable supply of miners so that the stability of the whole POSEIDON NETWORK can be guaranteed As long as your node is online there will be a base reward which is called UBI (Universal Basic Income) The variable vc is a controllable variable If your node is online even if you don\ t share any network resources such as transmission storage computing etc we will still give you a certain reward This bonus variable is vc which is tested on the network The default is 0 1 and the DAO organization decides its adjustment The variable CTB value is the actual contribution which consists of many parameters The detailed formula for CTB is disclosed in the next section of this section The formula for node contribution is M = UBI \xc3\x97 vc + CTB \xc3\x97 (1 \xe2\x88\x92 vc) If there are N devices in the whole network Ct is the number that can be dig and your revenue in the whole network (Revenue) R is 43 \x0cR= M1 \xc3\x97 Ct M1 + M2 + M3 + + Mn Income formula simplifies to R= M1 n \xe2\x88\x91i=1 Mn \xc3\x97 Ct 5 3 3 Design for the Actual Contribution CTB Due to different network infrastructures and hardware prices in each region the basic price for network resources such as bandwidth storage and computing etc will affect the actual mining incentives and efficiency and thus affect the stability of the entire network Therefore the design of the actual contribution CTB value is a major challenge for the POSEIDON NETWORK The formula is as follows CTB = (d + b + c) \xc3\x97 ps Equipment variable d Equipment quality will also affect mining efficiency resulting in an equipment variable d which considers CPU core (s) CPU Ghz and RAM Hardware scores are more complicated and hardware upgrades rapidly The council will reasonably adjust them according to hardware trend Here we design the default score of CPU DC default score of Ram DR and the corresponding variable score points xC\xe3\x80\x81xR which correspond to the CPU\ s brand core clock RAM and sizes and types of hard drive The formula for d is as follows d = DC \xc3\x97 xC + DR \xc3\x97 xR 44 \x0cBandwidth variable b The bandwidth variable b is one of the most important consumable variables including the default total scores for upload bandwidth bu and default total scores for download bandwidth bd and also the corresponding variable (initial) scores yu yd Location is also one of the key factors For example bandwidth price for each country is different For the POSEIDON NETWORK we will balance the benefits of all miners in the formula There is also a certain gap for node values between Singapore and Vietnam so the GeoLocation factor G is designed to balance the benefits in the two places The formula for b is as follows b = G \xc3\x97 (bu \xc3\x97 yu + bd \xc3\x97 yd ) Storage capacity variable c The storage capacity variable c contains sharable capacity of hard disk Hs default total scores of the occupied capacity HO and the corresponding variable scores (initial) scores xs and xo It also includes the default total score for hard disk type (HDD or SSD) DH The formula for c is as follows c = DH + Hs \xc3\x97 xs + Ho \xc3\x97 xo Special variable ps Specially added to the POSEIDON NETWORK is a variable called ps which includes node type online duration number of QQQ and PSD with a default value of the test network being 1 Any changes will be promptly updated on the website 5 3 4 Bitcoins and Mining Difficulty We design the QQQ bitcoin in accordance with the characteristics of spot gold with the following characteristics 45 \x0c1 Its global amount is constant 2 Early miners are more likely to get the coins 3 Easy to split 4 Having currency properties but not in the form of cash 5 Immediate settlement of funds 6 Controllable risk Based on the first point above the POSEIDON NETWORK defines the maximum amount of QQQ\ s measurable total with an upper limit of 8 400 000 000 Based on the second point it defines a design where the bitcoin production reduces by 50% every 4 years while the difficulty gradually increases and the mine is expected to be emptied in 20 years The output of coins for every four years is as follows Time 1 ~ 4 yrs 5 ~ 8 yrs 9 ~ 12 yrs 13 ~ 16 yrs 17 ~ 20 yrs Total Amount 3 251 612 903 1 625 806 452 812 903 226 406 451 613 203 225 806 Accumu lation 3 251 612 903 4 877 419 355 5 690 322 581 6 096 774 194 6 300 000 000 46 \x0c5 3 5 Buy back and The Burn Destroying tokens is similar to repurchasing Destroying QQQ coins will make the volatility limit irreversible forever which can be regarded as a way of deflation The POSEIDON NETWORK performs deflation in accordance with The Debt Deflation Theory put forward by worldrenowned economist Irving Fisher Deflation will increase the actual purchasing power of the currency In Fisher\ s formulation of debt deflation when the debt bubble bursts the following sequence of events occurs Assuming accordingly that at some point in time a state of overindebtedness exists this will tend to lead to liquidation through the alarm either of debtors or creditors or both Then we may deduce the following chain of consequences in nine links 1 Debt liquidation leads to distress selling and to (next line) 2 Contraction of deposit currency as bank loans are paid off and to a slowing down of velocity of circulation This contraction of deposits and of their velocity precipitated by distress selling causes (next line) 3 A fall in the level of prices in other words a swelling of the dollar Assuming as above stated that this fall of prices is not interfered with by reflation or otherwise there must be (next line) 4 A still greater fall in the net worths of business precipitating bankruptcies and (next line) 5 A like fall in profits which in a capitalistic that is a private profit society leads the concerns which are running at a loss to make (next line) 6 A reduction in output in trade and in employment of labor These losses bankruptcies and unemployment lead to (next line) 7 pessimism and loss of confidence which in turn lead to (next line) 8 Hoarding and slowing down still more the velocity of circulation The above eight changes cause (next line) 9 Complicated disturbances in the rates of interest in particular a fall in the nominal or money rates and a rise in the real or commodity rates of interest Debt deflation theory has been studied since the 1930s but was largely ignored by neoclassical economists and has only recently 47 \x0cbegun to gain popular interest After the main network of the POSEIDON NETWORK is online in order to ensure the investor\ s rights we will destroy the QQQ coins according to the profit of each quarter until the destruction of 2 100 000 000 QQQ coins The destruction process will be open fair and transparent ensuring that every user can confirm the destruction news through the blockchain browser 5 5 Purpose of Financing It is anticipated that a significant portion of the proceeds of the offering will be used for the following

of ABA Fenix NEM TW CTO TRON competition \xef\xac\x81rst prize 58 \x0c8 APPENDICES 8 1 Idle Network Resources Idle resources are tremendous and unnecessary waste of resources Take cars as an example If your car is used for 1 hour a day which is about 4 2% of the time it is not running for the other 95 8% of the time The 95 8% of the idle time is wasted If every car in the world can travel 50% of the time or if 50% of the cars are driving then the number of vehicles in the world can be reduced by more than 90% Traffic jams would have been resolved and resource waste in case of cars would have dropped dramatically UBER solved this problem Since the creation and development of companies such as Lyft Grab and Blablacar etc the traffic jam situations in San Francisco Singapore and other places have improved unintentionally People with extra vacancies in their cars have more opportunities to make part time profits Traditional buses trains rapid transit systems and high speed rails will not disappear This is an embodiment of decentralization or multi centralization The same is true for network bandwidth If your home\ s full Wifi network is only used 12 hours a day at home it means that for 50% of the time bandwidth is wasted The network bandwidth is more like a faucet Suppose the water from your faucet is always on 50% of the water is flowing away This is a terrible waste Imagine how much water you have wasted and how much bandwidth you have wasted Just because bandwidth cannot be materialized we don\ t feel the waste of the bandwidth The POSEIDON NETWORK is solving this problem Internet downloading speed is getting faster network resources are being wasted less network traffic jams are being solved and people with extra bandwidth in their homes are also given the opportunity to give back In today\ s society not everyone needs a car but almost everyone needs the Internet 8 2 The Sharing Economy Has Just Begun 59 \x0cThe first wave of startups in the sharing economy business such as Uber and Airbnb is to solve a single problem with lean entrepreneurship For example Uber lets a car rely on a driver to make money and distribute more profits Then UberEat appeared You can also deliver run errands and maybe even become a tour guide in the future The future in a few years with electric cars and automatic driving can become a scene only seen in science fiction films The POSEIDON NETWORK has endless potential and an exciting future 8 3 What is CDN\xef\xbc\x9f In addition we must introduce the CDN in a familiar way First of all in the world of internet all roads are charged Image the Internet as roads Imagine the world\ s main network as a highway Imagine CDN as cities\xe2\x80\x99 elevated highways The divergence of cities\xe2\x80\x99 elevated highways can reduce the severity of traffic jam on the main network POSEIDON NETWORK provides rental of home wifi or physical network bandwidth at home just like renting roads of your own so that the cities\xe2\x80\x99 elevated highways can achieve a more thorough diversion effect The world\ s main network the highway was established by consultation between the two governments For example there is an ocean floor network cable directly between the United States and Japan The CDN the domestic elevated highway is mostly owned and built by companies such as Akamai Amazon Google and Microsoft The CDN market is an extremely centralized oligopolistic market with high fees and underwhelming latency which we will introduce later Looking at the Wifi or wired networks around you at home or nearby these are the established cities\xe2\x80\x99 roads This road is usually available to us for internet but when we leave home it is idle What POSEIDON NETWORK is doing is to safely utilize the unused network at home for our selected specific and secure Internet companies such as Youtube and Netfilx such that we can start to charge these companies Fifty years ago it was hard to imagine diversion of highways because cars were not fast and it was difficult to encounter a traffic jam The government with the foresight saw the potential of highway diversion 60 \x0cand as a result the United States and Germany built the world\ s densest road network Now although the internet speed is getting faster and faster because of the rise of Youtube Instagram live video etc the cost is getting higher and higher and POSEIDON NETWORK sees the infinite potential in applications of decentralized storage coupled with blockchain technology 8 4 CDN Demand Is Increasing Year by Year with No Major Breakthrough in Technology CDN is the abbreviation of Content Delivery Network CDN was born more than 20 years ago and the demand for long distance information transmission has gradually increased causing heavier and heavier loads on the main network and as a result the quality of longdistance transmission was getting worse In 1995 Tom Leighton a professor at MIT tried to solve the problem of network traffic jams with mathematics and developed the CDN When internet users in Taipei connects to the internet in San Francisco Bay Area without the CDN the long distance data transmission will cross the Pacific Ocean with a distance of about 10 300km Assuming that data transmission uses the world\ s fastest fiber optic at a speed of 300 000 km/s a beam of light from Taipei to San Francisco takes at least 35 ms and the round trip takes 70 ms In addition to transmission loss equipment delay and sometimes the need of encryption and decryption hundreds of milliseconds are needed Even if you look at a small picture it will wait for hundreds of milliseconds and little things add up The netizens will be greatly restricted by visiting reddit Visiting the US Amazon shopping website may drive users crazy With the CDN the servers actually visited by the Taipei residents are not real servers in the United States but CDN servers in Japan and even Taiwan The CDN itself has a cache function that distributes and caches the same content on the web page such as pictures music movies and even Javascript files to each CDN node so that the residents do not have to visit the San Francisco Bay Area from Taipei You can access the Japanese node closer to you and there is a direct cable between Taiwan and Japan saving more than 90% of the time If the CDN node is also located in Taiwan such as Google\ s data center 61 \x0cin Changhua the effect will be more obvious The large number of applications of CDN also contributed to the evolution of technology in the world the popularity of cloud computing the rise of IoT and the evolution of serverless technology 8 5 Oligopoly Market of CDN According to statistics most CDN users who stream movies sound files and downloads of certain types of software and firmware update constitute the largest proportion of the traffic The global bandwidth for the usage of CDNs and similar products and the amount of usage of the network itself will continue to grow at a significant rate The global CDN market will grow from $7 billion in 2018 to about $31 billion in 2022 Despite the many problems to be solved such as cost and delay the demand for CDN is still rising The video streaming and photo sharing software is prospering and the market for CDN will continue to grow The mainstream providers of CDN operate in a similar manner with only minor differences in service and billing methods and the relative competitive advantages such as differences between Akamai and Amazon\ s Cloudfront In addition the market share of these two giants has reached about 50% The CDN market is monopolized by large companies such as Akamai Amazon Google and Microsoft Due to high hardware costs personnel costs and the difficulty for large scale organizational innovation large companies pass on the costs to client enterprises and consumers and introduce various puzzling billing methods to earn commissions This is the money that can be saved In addition highly advanced regions incur high electricity and personnel costs Developing regions have political issues and problems such as the power might not be unstable and personnel training is not easy These issues cause nodes to be selected only in specific countries or regions Most countries are geographically far away resulting in unnecessary delays for advanced regions and developing regions There are delays that could have been saved POSEIDON NETWORK will be particularly popular in these areas especially in rich areas and isolated and densely populated islandstyle areas While blockchain technology is developing DSN (Decentralized Storage Network such as filecoin siacoin etc ) must be technically 62 \x0cdependent on CDN to operate effectively It also constitutes an indispensable reason for the CDN to exist in the world In the traditional economy intermediaries and agents often charge unreasonable fees and provide services without added value Under the framework of a shared economy the network allows resource providers and demands to directly match Traditional intermediaries such as car rental taxi dealers advertising agencies marriage agencies and even usury will gradually be replaced by shared economies The higher the profit the sooner it is replaced The simpler the service the sooner it is replaced The less added value the sooner it is replaced When crossing laws and regulations the unprotected one is replaced first Akamai Amazon Google and Microsoft are the traditional economic providers in the CDN field Being large organizations it is not easy for them to innovate The POSEIDON Network is the star of tomorrow in the CDN field It uses cutting edge technology has strong traditional hardware vendors to support flexible economic models ecosystems inspired by token rewards strong and adaptive organization Just like the god of the sea we can sweep the world 8 6 What is NAS Why is NAS particularly suitable as a node NAS is an acronym for Network Attached Storage which is simply a private cloud There are already enough cars in the world and as long as 1% of cars join UBER UBER will become the world\ s largest car rental network Similarly there are already 5 million NASs in operation in the world As long as 1% of the world\ s NAS joins our network the POSEIDON NETWORK will become one of the best accelerating networks in the world And the Internet is easier to access than the car The NAS is particularly suitable as a node for the POSEIDON NETWORK It is due to the hardware properties of the NAS and it does not unplug the network and power unnecessarily NAS has many brands and world renowned brands include WD QNAP Synology Seagate and Buffalo 63 \x0cThe first phase of the POSEIDON NETWORK has been developed and finished and is operating the QNAP NAS node sharing app QEDGE online Next we prioritize the development of other brands\xe2\x80\x99 NAS nodes sharing app the POSEIDON NETWORK node sharing app for personal computers and mobile phones Node sharing apps for IoT devices are also being developed and tested 64 \x0c9 DISCLAIMER AND RISK WARNING Please read this disclaimer and risk warning in detail

loss of participants due to policy changes is a possible risk 9 3 Trading Risks Trading PSD and QQQ which are virtual currencies has some uncertainties Because there is no strong supervision in the field of virtual currency trading risks related to virtual currency such as skyrocketing all weather trading banker trading etc and individual 65 \x0cparticipants have no long term investment Experience may result in loss of personal assets Participants should choose the investment method according to their own situation and experience 9 4 Coordination Risks The POSEIDON NETWORK team will spare no effort to achieve all of the development goals set forth in the white paper At present there are well established technical and commercial teams in the project However there are unforeseen factors and uncertainties in technology development and other development The existing business models and the overall planning ideas may not be in good agreement with the market demand which makes it difficult to achieve profit targets or we may not be able to meet investor expectations At the same time the follow up of this white paper may be adjusted as the project progresses If the details of the follow up progress of the project are not known to the participants in time or the participants are not aware of the plan due to information mismatch which may cause losses or impact the future development of the plan 9 5 Security Risks Virtual currency is characterized by anonymity and difficulty in tracing It is easy to be exploited by criminals or attacked by hackers or may involve criminal activities such as illegal asset transfer Participants are required to fully understand the team\xe2\x80\x99s background understand the overall framework and ideas of the project make reasonable predictions of their visions and purchase virtual currency rationally 9 6 Technical Risks Blockchain is often described as a very advanced technology To understand the nature of risk you must have a complete understanding of applied cryptography and information science During the update and adjustment process the POSEIDON NETWORK may find that there are loopholes and the technical team will continue to make up for it through the form of hot repair By using the Service you declare that you have sufficient knowledge high market familiarity experience and professional expertise to be able to carefully evaluate the merits and risks of all transactions that you perform in accordance 66 \x0cwith the Service and you agree to be able to take sole responsibility for the aforementioned declaration 9 7 Malicious Node Risks The POSEIDON NETWORK is built on a blockchain Some nodes on the blockchain may be malicious and attempt to take advantages without any contribution Such hackers may attempt to damage the operating system of the POSEIDON NETWORK Therefore we need a strong guarantee to protect the network from malicious attacks and to determine the security of the transaction and the continued operation of the operating system Next we will list and discuss attacks that may threaten the operation of the blockchain network 9 7 1 Sybil Attack A malicious node may generate multiple Sybil identities in an effort to gain more benefits or spoof the target network In general the protection mechanism should establish a barrier wall to prevent Sybil attacks but there is no guarantee that such a barrier wall will always be effective to prevent Sybil attacks 9 7 2 Out of Work Attack Although hackers can control many nodes these nodes can also be used to create interference with shared computing networks A node that is maliciously attacked can be called a zombie The attack may be done by causing the zombie node to stop working once or completely In the POSEIDON NETWORK zombie nodes may override AI\ s instructions but do not complete or give invalid results If zombie nodes are mostly responsible for the AI\xe2\x80\x99s instructions then the AI instruction will produce unrealistic results or may directly cause an error 9 7 3 Outsourcing Attack It is possible for a malicious node to outsource its instructions to other nodes so it may be easier to take advantage of its benefits without using the corresponding computing power In the POSEIDON NETWORK network nodes should demonstrate their ability to work 9 8 Governing Law 67 \x0cThis
