2007\xe2\x80\x93 2008 was characterized by a sharp increase in demand and consequently in world food prices Demand did not find a corresponding increase in supply due to insufficient productivity of world agriculture This was a consequence of low investment in agricultural production over the previous three decades The crisis prompted investors to increase the volume of investments in the development of the agrarian sector of the economy throughout the world After that there was a trend of growth for foreign direct investment (FDI) in agriculture industry of the developing countries primarily with significant land and other natural resources Of course the investment flow alone was not enough In modern conditions the continuous and progressive development of the agroindustrial complex depends on the professionalism of managers and the availability of skilled workers Consequently the problem of forming professional personnel for the agro industrial domain is one of the most important aspects This requires a deep study of the specifics identification of appropriate professional training and necessary knowledge and skills of personnel Due to numerous legal and economic difficulties very few manufacturers enter the international market and the lack of necessary competition allows them to adjust easily to the prices of their goods In this regard other manufacturers have to compete only in domestic markets and repack them This significantly reduces the cost of farmers efforts and inevitably leads to a decrease in the prestige of the labor sector Of course this cannot contribute to the influx of all the necessary specialists in the sector since the majority of workers do not see prospects for themselves and retrain for related areas In the modern agro industrial sector there is a need to increase the prestige of cluster members increase its attractiveness for beginners and experienced specialists streamline international and domestic trade which will imply a transparent and adequate evaluation of goods thus solving logistics problems and creating and strengthening long term bilateral agreements \x0c2 CONDITIONS OF MODERN AGROINDUSTRIAL MARKET 2 1 CURRENT SITUATION IN THE AGRO INDUSTRIAL MARKET The data from research shows that the agricultural industry is about 25% of the global GDP with a likelihood of more development in the near future According to the research data on the volume of investment agricultural industry ranks first among a wide range of macro economic areas in the developed countries of the world It is expected that the potential of trade in the modern world will grow rapidly in the next 10 years Consequently the proportion of trade in increasing food security will grow proportionately The widespread introduction of new technologies and solutions did not leave the agrarian industry intact The growing openness of markets around the world allows even small and medium enterprises to independently find and attract customers from other countries and enter into contracts with them for the supply of products 2 2 DISADVANTAGES OF AGROINDUSTRIAL MARKET AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES Of course the development of international agro trade could not expose some significant shortcomings that can directly affect the development of international relations in the agro industrial sector Among these shortcomings can be identified the following points 1 Lack of knowledge and understanding of domestic and international legislation and trade rules 2 Acute shortage of its own highly qualified specialists lawyers and international economists 3 Presence of intermediaries with high purchase prices 4 Insufficiency of production capabilities that would allow producing and supplying large quantities to foreign markets 5 Bureaucracy which impedes the quick realization of goods due to a large number of documentary delays \x0cIn the world market the price of products also depends on the number of participants in the transaction directly affecting its constant growth Taking into account all the difficulties associated with the production and transnational sale of goods by farmers those who want to occupy this segment of the international market are becoming less and less There are only those players who have extensive experience well established international relations and schemes of buying and selling goods This forces the rest of the competitors to compete only in the domestic markets which leads to their excessiveness and high competition and that adversely affects the incomes of producers The most important point here is that the value of the labor of agrarians in the public consciousness is sharply reduced 2 3 NEED FOR AGROCOIN AND AGRODEX Agrocoin and Agro exchange will be a long awaited

marketers have already adapted to the trends of the modern market and they are already widely using tools that help in a short time to make their product recognizable among a wide audience and study the demand of society for a certain type of goods 5 2 1 AIR DROP One of the most effective marketing tools should be considered is an \xe2\x80\x9cair drop\xe2\x80\x9d This encourages users to receive a referral reward The concept means that users receive a certain number of tokens for participating in advertising campaigns of such projects For example users are invited to fold this project on all social networks either comment on the post with their friends added to the comments or make a post on any social networks with a certain hashtag and get a gift for this in the form of a certain number of tokens or a fixed discount on their buying 5 3 INTEGRATION As the market developed the boundaries between currencies securities and tokens began to blur Being a universal tool of the market tokens

SMART CONTRACTS AND BENEFITS In order to conclude any transaction you must contact the notary or a lawyer pay for the documents and wait for their execution Often many points of these documents contain references to legislative articles that can be interpreted for themselves and bypassed In the event of failure to comply with the terms of the transaction in real life people have to go to the court spend money on the process and prove their case At the conclusion of such transactions in general it cannot be talked about the confidence of parties to the contract People have always realized the need for optimization and were looking for a revolutionary solution to the existing problems of the workflow At this difficult moment a smart contract appeared that solves all existing problems \x0cA smart contract is an electronic protocol written using computer code Its purpose is to transfer information and to enforce the terms of a contract by both parties The parties sign the contract using methods similar to signing the sending funds in the existing crypto currency network After signing the contract comes into force To ensure the automated fulfillment of contractual obligations a living environment is certainly required which allows you to completely automate the execution of a contract clause Having unhindered access to the objects of the contract the smart contract monitors for the specified conditions to achieve or violate the items and makes independent decisions based on the programmed conditions Thus the basic principle of a smart contract is to fully automate and reliably enforce contractual relationships \x0cSmart contracts are based on blockchain technology This is a distributed registry which is a decentralized system that exists on the network of connected computers across the globe Blockchain allows users to carry out transactions transfer information and material value without banks and intermediaries The simplest example of using smart contracts is multi signing With the help of such signature the parties to the agreement can freeze a certain amount of coins on the blockchain so that if necessary more than half of the participants will need to sign it Such a condition of the contract ensures the safety of funds invested in the project In case of failure the funds will be returned to the investor automatically If the collection of the claimed amount was successful then the participants of the multi signature will activate their keys confirming the good faith of the project in which they invested Thus it is possible to highlight the main key benefits of smart contracts Saving money and time since you no longer need to resort to the services of intermediaries to enter into contracts or transactions Security is ensured since the prescribed terms of the contract are stored in a distributed registry and no one can change them Absence of intermediaries allows the parties to the contract to work on more favorable terms and save their money on lawyers notaries auditing and intermediaries Smart contracts provide faster resolution of issues As soon as the terms of the contract are fulfilled the parties immediately exchange assets Using smart contracts AGRODEX users can fully enjoy all the benefits offered by the smart contract technology Modern market participants in a short time will be able to appreciate the advantages of technology over traditional methods of sale \x0c6 3 THE TEAM \x0cADVISORS \x0cEMAIL help@bitagro io Address AgroExchange O\xc3\x9c Registry code 14647739 Harju maakond Tallinn Kesklinna
