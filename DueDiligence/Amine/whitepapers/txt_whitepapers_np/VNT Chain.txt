entitled \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin A Peer to peer Electronic Cash System\xe2\x80\x9d and proposed the idea of building a bitcoin cash system based on blockchain marking the birth of blockchain technology[1] Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer to peer network The transactions are secured by cryptography and over time that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together by timestamp and secured which creates an immutable unforgeable record of all transactions across the network[2] Blockchain has been adopted as a technical tool to address pain points in existing centralized systems and regulations as well as gradually created economic and business value in domains such as finance energy supply chain and IoT services 1 2 Blockchain and Value Network A value network is the relationship and structure of value generation distribution transfer and adoption across multiple stakeholders With rapid social and economic development users require more efficient secure and flexible value networks to meet individual demand In the traditional value network users rely on third parties to build trust which makes value transfer centralized and inefficient In addition different service providers have different management systems which leads to poor compatibility low security and inefficient management How to realize the efficient and cost effective value transfer becomes an urgent issue in the era of digital economy The blockchain system is considered as a decentralized secured tamper proof database Its birth and development brings the possibility for more effective transparent and reliable circulation of various assets 3 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network 1 3 What is VNT Chain VNT Chain was born for empowering the distributed economy system VNT Chain\xe2\x80\x99s target is to build a global distributed smart value network based on blockchain technology to provide reliable secure efficient friendly and low cost value transfer services and to gain widespread use in different vertical markets such as finance healthcare supply chain gaming etc 2 Architecture For enterprise users existing public blockchain solutions do not quite meet the demands of commercial applications due to the lack of permission management and low performance While consortium blockchain solutions offer secure information sharing among members it lacks support for value transfer making it hard to be applied to a large scale Creatively VNT Chain integrates the distributed value transfer capabilities of the public blockchain and the business features of the consortium blockchain into the architecture named Aggregation Chain This architecture of consists of public chain (Hubble Network) consortium blockchains (Galileo Network) and crosschain (Kepler Route) 2 1 Hubble Network A public blockchain as main chain that interacts with consortium blockchains (Galileo Network) through crosschain mechanism to provide value transfer services for various applications and supports sidechain mechanism for different consumer based applications such as gaming and social networking 2 2 Galileo Network A series of consortium blockchains with member access that are designed for use cases of commercial applications in finance healthcare supply chain industries and so on The core components of Galileo Network such as consensus encryption and certificate services are under a modular design with flexibility and extensibility 2 3 Kepler Route A crosschain mechanism to secure interaction of assets and information between Hubble Network and Galileo Network 4 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network Figure 1 VNT value network architecture 3 Key Technology 3 1 Hubble Network 3 1 1 Consensus Algorithm VNT Chain utilizes the Vortex consensus algorithm to reach performance of 10000+ TPS Vortex integrates high performance finality high security collateral and incentive mechanisms[3] into its design The advantages are as follows \xef\x82\x9f High performance Vortex speeds up transaction packing and block generating which results in higher transaction performance \xef\x82\x9f Finality Any legal transaction will be confirmed in a certain timeslot which cannot be rolled back \xef\x82\x9f High security Vortex can handle various types of attacks including nothing at stack long range attack double spending attack and bribery attack It also prevents forks \xef\x82\x9f High transmission efficiency Vortex implements fast transaction transmission among verification nodes and substantially relieves network flow among nodes \xef\x82\x9f Effective incentive mechanism Vortex provides an incentive mechanism under which all the transaction packing nodes transmission nodes and regulatory nodes in the blockchain network will get rewards Revealing malicious nodes will be rewarded as well 3 1 2 Smart Contract 5 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network Hubble Network supports smart contracts written in multiple languages and uses Web Assembly (WASM) technology to compile contracts into WASM format binary files WASM has the following advantages \xef\x82\x9f High performance Highly effective with a stack based instruction set and a strongly typed variable system \xef\x82\x9f Low storage costs Binary coded text occupies less storage space than other text formats \xef\x82\x9f Multi language support Users can use multiple languages such as C/C++/RUST to write smart contracts and compile them into WASM format Based on the advantages of WASM VNT Chain independently developed WAVM which is an execution machine of the Web Assembly language inherits all the advantages of WASM and further optimizes WASM in the following four aspects \xef\x82\x9f Modifying the design of non deterministic calculations caused by multithreading floatingpoint numbers and exception handling in native WASM to ensure the certainty of calculations \xef\x82\x9f Adding the Gas mechanism and solving the Halting Problem in smart contracts \xef\x82\x9f Providing a sandbox operating environment to achieve resource isolation and ensure the security of the system \xef\x82\x9f Realizing standard instruction set on chain with high scalability[4] 3 1 3 Sidechain Mechanism VNT Chain uses the sidechain mechanism to support multiple types of assets Hubble Network provides an open interface that allows developers and users to link their applications as an independent sidechain to Hubble Network Hubble Network is designed purely for settlement so only VNT transaction data is retained on Hubble Network while user customised data is placed on the sidechain[5] The advantages of this architecture are as follows \xef\x82\x9f Relieves Hubble Network If all kinds of applications transaction data are connected to Hubble Network directly it will cause congestion and affect the real time transactions After the introduction of sidechain mechanism Hubble Network only needs to support VNT token transactions rather than support all applications transactions on sidechain 6 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network \xef\x82\x9f Data isolation The sidechain mechanism guarantees isolation of transaction data on Hubble Network and applications transaction data on sidechains Also it achieves data isolation between sidechains to effectively ensure data security and privacy \xef\x82\x9f Easy to develop DApps The sidechain is a completely customized blockchain so every application on the sidechain runs independently and users can customize all specifications parameters and transaction types \xef\x82\x9f Ensure Hubble Network\xe2\x80\x99s security The application runs independently on the sidechain As a result defects (such as hard fork) in the sidechains will not affect Hubble Network at all 3 2 Galileo Network 3 2 1 Zero knowledge Proof Public blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ensure privacy protection for both sides of the transaction through a pseudo anonymous wallet address but the data (such as transaction details and account balances) transmitted and stored on the chain is publicly visible In many applications of consortium blockchain data security and privacy protection is vital to the business itself as well as regulatory requirements Therefore privacy protection in the process of value transfer is crucial Zero knowledge proof means the prover succeeds in convincing the verifier that a certain argument is correct without providing any useful information to the verifier Based on zero knowledge proof VNT Chain can verify the correctness of the entire transaction without exposing its details In other words the encrypted data can be verified without decryption protecting the users\ privacy The security of zero knowledge proof is well established on discrete logarithms and other mathematical puzzles It is therefore highly secure requires little computation less interaction information and highly efficient in data validation Galileo Network uses the zero knowledge proof module to provide enterprise level privacy protection The participating nodes can not only trade anonymously but also verify the encrypted data in real time to protect data security without exposing identities This suits many applications such as finance proof of existence source tracing payment transactions etc which require privacy protection of business data and transaction tracking 7 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network Galileo Network can meet these requirements and support both anonymous and public visible transactions where users can easily deploy according to their needs 3 2 2 Multichain Galileo Network implements data isolation and privacy protection by adopting a multichain architecture Multichain infrastructure can support same or different businesses Participants can join in one business or multiple business chains according to their needs The ledgers between different business chains are isolated Figure 2 Multichain isolation As shown in the figure 2 organizations A B C and D participate in the finance business chain and organizations D E F and G participate in the business chain of the supply chain The ledgers of different chains are isolated from each other organization A B and C only own finance chain ledger Organization E F and G own supply chain ledger But organization D owns both the finance chain and supply chain ledgers 3 2 3 Supports High Concurrency To meet the concurrent requirements of high frequency applications the Galileo Network improves system processing capabilities in four ways \xef\x82\x9f Parallel verification Isolate the transaction verification and data writing process Handle the transaction verifications in parallel 8 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network \xef\x82\x9f Concurrent execution of contracts Galileo Network supports parallel processing of different smart contracts \xef\x82\x9f Network Load Balancing Galileo Network client can automatically select light loaded nodes to achieve network load balancing \xef\x82\x9f Hardware acceleration Switch from CPU serial processing to FPGA parallel processing of digital signatures digital verification consensus algorithms encryption and decryption algorithms 3 2 4 KYC Service To remain compliant with the regulatory requirements of different applications Galileo Network provides a know your customer (KYC) service for service providers by auditing the process of transactions The KYC service can also help to effectively manage risk KYC allows the service provider to verify both parties\xe2\x80\x99 identity information (ID) before processing the transactions First the service provider of transaction sender communicates the users\xe2\x80\x99 ID to the service provider of transaction receiver Only after the receiver service provider confirms the ID can the transaction then be processed Failing which the transaction request will be rejected 3 2 5 Decentralized Workflow Business chain governance needs to be completed by all participants In order to improve collaborative efficiency Galileo Network supports a blockchain based workflow engine as shown below Figure 3 Decentralized workflow The workflow engine is essentially a smart contract in the blockchain network Taking data isolation 9 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network issues into consideration different business chains can initialize different workflow engines By calling the contract execution or querying the data structure maintained in the contract all workflow functions can be achieved Based on the workflow engine users can \xef\x82\x9f Define workflow templates Set the workflow name state set initial state and state change rules etc \xef\x82\x9f Create workflow instances Using template to create workflow instances and realize the instance directly into the initial state then notify the selected participants according to the state rules \xef\x82\x9f Change workflow status Participants can modify the status of the current workflow by submitting a request \xef\x82\x9f Alter participants Participants of the current workflow can be altered any time which improves the scalability of the workflow The altered details will notice all former participants This not only accelerates information flow but also achieves network decentralized management such as smart contracts management nodes Join/Quit management and online signature management Every operation will be recorded on blockchain network[6] 3 3 Kepler Route Currently the consortium blockchain solution focuses on real time synchronization of information and ledger consistency between institutions Without a Token however the efficiency of asset transfer and clearing procedures is below expectation Hence consortium blockchain applications are narrow Kepler Route is the bridge that realizes the value linkage between Hubble Network and Galileo Network With the verifier and supervisor mechanisms Kepler Route queues the blocks which are requested by then enables the asset transfer and information flow In this way the Galileo Network data\xe2\x80\x99s privacy characteristic is preserved while Hubble Network provides the clearing and settlement service for Galileo Network by Token Advantages of Kepler Route include \xef\x82\x9f The world state of Galileo Network can be dumped to Hubble Network which is the basis of crosschain which facilitates analysis of contract data 10 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network \xef\x82\x9f Extending Galileo Network\xe2\x80\x99s public data to Hubble Network without any DApps \xef\x82\x9f The asset verification required by Galileo Network can be consented in Hubble Network and then transmitted back to Galileo Network for endorsement via Kepler Route 4 Ecosystem The VNT ecosystem aims to build a global open source community for a value network involving blockchain technical enthusiasts industry vertical resources investors and third party organizations to focus on blockchain technology innovation This community will then promote the VNT infrastructure to various fields of applications such as finance social networking tourism gaming and IoT (Internet of Things) Following which the applications will be integrated to VNT Chain The VNT Ecosystem will be a long term project with all services provided subject to the local regulatory regime The roadmap is as follows a) Infrastructure construction VNT founding team and community developers will build a high efficiency stable and easy tooperation infrastructure network to meet the requirements of various applications and value transfers VNT token is the medium of value transfers b) Community tool construction \xef\x82\x9f Community tools With close collaboration between original developers and global developers mutiple tools on VNT Chain will be designed to support more applications including digital wallets smart contract developer platform etc \xef\x82\x9f Incentive system Any person or institution can join the network and will be assigned with corresponding roles and permissions All contributions (personal or institutional) to the VNT ecosystem can be rewarded if certain conditions are met c) Provide full value services Following the completion of a well established infrastructure powerful development tools and various community resources VNT will integrate the potential of blockchain technology with real world applications to realize effective and efficient value transfer \xef\x82\x9f Galileo Network Enterprise users is able to customize solutions according to their application\xe2\x80\x99s demands to use singular or multichain structures to facilitate a variety of 11 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network applications and to anchor real assets to digital assets \xef\x82\x9f Hubble Network More use cases can be extended to Hubble Network through a sidechain mechanism \xef\x82\x9f Kepler Route Enable information flow between Galileo Network and Hubble Network realizing value transfer among different types of assets in the process 5 Application VNT Chain is dedicated to building a stable efficient secure and scalable distributed smart value network to solve the lack of trust caused by information asymmetry and lack of information which in turn solve the value transfer problem At the micro level participants are allowed to obtain relevant data through the VNT Chain network according to application requirements and process effective privacy controls over their own data At the macro level VNT Chain promotes efficient resource synergy to accelerate digital economic cooperation among different countries regions institutions and individuals VNT Chain adopts the Aggregation Chain architecture to link business chains and value network to realize the interconnection of information and value and to provide comprehensive data and asset services for finance healthcare supply chain payment shared computing etc Figure 4 Applications 12 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network 5 1 Data Service VNT Chain is based on immutable and consistent distributed ledger technology providing standard data access protocols for participating organizations on various business chains and forming a multidimensional data network for various applications 5 1 1 Data Collection VNT Chain can collect data in various business applications after authorization by users All datacollecting activity as well as the data itself form a complete record The whole process is encrypted to ensure data security and that it meets regulatory requirements VNT Chain collects data under the following two scenarios a) Institutional data Various business applications (finance healthcare supply chain internet finance etc ) can join VNT Chain network through business chains The business data such as identity information circulation records transaction proof transaction flow etc will be provided by participants who join the business chains of the VNT Chain network Continuous production updates and improvements to data as the business grows will ensure authenticity and accuracy of the data The timeliness of data collection is ensured through the real time synchronization of the VNT Chain Figure 5 Institutional data collection 13 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network b) User data Users can upload their personal data (e g identity health travel transaction logistics and living expenses) through different application clients In order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of data VNT Chain introduces third party operation platforms to verify the data uploaded by the users All data and relevant data collecting activity are recorded on the VNT Chain in realtime Figure 6 User data collection 5 1 2 Data Collaboration VNT Chain\ s multichain architecture provides privacy protection and business isolation for data generated by participating entities under different business applications The applications\xe2\x80\x99 transaction data are recorded on different ledgers For some or all data in different business applications information exchange can be achieved through the crosschain mechanism The certifiers and supervisors (clusters elected according to the algorithm) are responsible for \xe2\x80\xa2 Ensuring data consistency \xe2\x80\xa2 Completing data coordination under different applications \xe2\x80\xa2 Implementing data collection under multichain architecture When the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s development reaches a certain level VNT Chain will form a credible multidimensional data system to provide effective data support for more applications 14 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network All data collection activities will comply with local laws and regulations and fully respect the willingness of participating parties in each case All on chain data will be protected by the chained data structure from being tampered and privacy protection will be achieved through encryption technology Users can manage their personal data through authority control Figure 7 Data collaboration 5 2 Asset Service Conventional asset classes can be divided into financial assets and non financial assets The absence of an efficient asset circulation system has led to low asset turnover inefficient circulation of capital and high transaction costs Based on a standardized asset management process and efficient circulation system VNT Chain provides efficient convenient and low cost value transfer infrastructure for finance social networking consumer education and medical industries without a centralized party involved thereby reducing cost and improving circulation efficiency 5 2 1 Financial Assets VNT Chain provides efficient and secure asset circulation services for various types of financial assets such as equity bonds notes derivatives etc The implementation steps are as follows a) Financial assets (ownership) authentication There are two ways to authorize the rights of financial assets \xef\x82\x9f Off chain Assets Participating organizations access the relevant business chain as nodes 15 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network and upload the offline authorized documents and certificates to the VNT Chain network for confirmation Once confirmed by the endorsement nodes (agencies who can provide relevant certificates or authorized services) the authentication information will be registered in the blockchain network \xef\x82\x9f On chain Assets The change of ownership of the assets is accomplished by smart contracts During the execution of the contract the unique digital signature of the user is used to confirm the rights b) Asset trading and circulation Asset trading and circulation involves a two way flow of funds and assets \xef\x82\x9f Pay off chain transfer on chain The fund transfer is completed by a third party payment institution who confirms the payment and transaction vouchers submitted by the transaction parties and records them in the VNT Chain network The smart contract completes the asset transfer \xef\x82\x9f Pay and transfer on chain The assets\xe2\x80\x99 trading and transfer are completed by smart contract and the payment and settlement can be accomplished through VNT Token or other digital assets issued on the sidechain of the VNT Chain network The on chain information includes asset information transaction records fund information and credential information requested by counterparty VNT Chain provides efficient and convenient services for authentication trading and circulation of financial assets also ensures the ledger to achieve real time synchronization and hardly be tampered with 5 2 2 Non financial Assets a) Digital Assets Digital assets such as digital rights gift coupons gaming equipment incentive points and ads traffic have low rates of circulation due to limited use cases The sidechain of VNT Chain network supports the issuance of various digital assets The mainchain completes the consensus process and the sidechain records the transaction information The digital assets from sidechain can be exchanged with VNT token from mainchain to allow the trading of multiple digital assets and improve the efficiency of digital asset circulation 16 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network Figure 8 Digital assets service b) Physical Assets VNT Chain can support the registration split trading and settlement of physical assets like commercial real estate fixed assets large scale mechanical equipment etc to complete the value transfer Detailed steps are as follows \xef\x82\x9f Asset authentication The certificate representing ownership of the assets can be digitized and registered on chain by the relevant regulatory agency \xef\x82\x9f Asset digitization All kinds of physical assets are assembled into asset packages Through the structured design of professional organizations asset packages are split up into multiple securities and traded in compliance decentralized exchanges \xef\x82\x9f Trading assets on chain registration Compliance agencies perform physical asset delivery according to on chain specifications and transaction certificates are recorded in the VNT Chain network 5 3 Value Transfer VNT Chain implements a Data Service system and an Asset Service system The Data Service collects data from different participants under different business applications to form a multidimensional trustworthy data network based on distributed ledger technology It provides participation credentials and decision making basis for different users Asset on chain registration authentication splitting and trading are accomplished through smart contracts Without a central entity the real time settlement and the liquidity of assets can be completed through VNT Chain value network 17 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network Figure 9 Value transfer network With synergies realized between the Data Service system and Asset Service system VNT Chain will further expand its service scope and promote the development of the digital economy by mitigating information asymmetry and improving data and asset circulation efficiency VNT Chain aims to \xef\x82\x9f Resolve information asymmetry Business applications such as asset securitization supply chain finance and equity trading usually feature multiple parties in each transaction and long standing information exchanges leading to information asymmetry and nontransparency problems which seriously inhibits normal value transfer With VNT Chain each participant accesses the network as a node shares billing rights and synchronizes service data in real time thereby solving the asymmetric information problem \xef\x82\x9f Improve circulation efficiency Most existing business applications are relatively isolated their data is incompatible with those in different applications There is a lack of effective circulation among all kinds of assets Part or all of the data in different business applications can be exchanged freely through VNT Chain\xe2\x80\x99s crosschain mechanism Assets in each business chain and sidechain can be transacted with in realtime achieving efficiency of circulation \xef\x82\x9f Expand scope of services In traditional finance government affairs and medical fields due to there being only a single source of data as well as isolation among institutions some business are only open to specific groups VNT Chain\ s multi dimensional trustworthy data network provides more references for participants in the network reduces transaction costs improves risk control capabilities and expands service coverage 6 Governance 6 1 VNET Foundation and Governance 18 \x0cDistributed Smart Value Network The VNET Foundation is a non profit organization established in
