8 \x0cIntroduction about Background 1 Cloud Computing Platform According to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e g networks servers storage applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management e\xef\xac\x80ort or service provider interaction That is to say cloud computing o\xef\xac\x80ers IT infrastructure resources and capability and decouples them with devices thus achieving the experience of rapid delivery and application Meanwhile cloud computing alters the Capex model of traditional IT into OPEX model thereby minimizing consumed cash flow for enterprises This especially provides a friendly supply model for unexpected resource demands 2 Centralized Cloud Computing Platform Due to huge initial investment in cloud computing industry it becomes a game among tycoon players which caused many issues Lack of industry standards Suppliers of cloud computing industry are mostly tycoon players in the big game From the perspective of commercial value each player wants to set the industry standard so each cloud computing supplier has their own set of standards and systems for the users to define application standards When users work with multiple platforms for the benefit of lower costs and higher stability they have no choice but to adapt to the standards of multiple suppliers Therefore users have to bear the usage costs brought by competition among commercial products For upstream supply chain companies they have to provide customized products for every tycoon to meet demands of their customers Black box operating environment As a black box environment o\xef\xac\x80ered to users centralized cloud computing platform makes it impossible for users to keep their resources and applications in a reliable status On the other hand cloud computing enterprises tend to be intrusive to the resources of users due to the purpose of control and management Under such an environment there have been multiple examples of user data loss and application malfunction caused by cloud computing service providers\xe2\x80\x99 own bugs (e g certain public cloud\xe2\x80\x99s security products had deleted user files) BonusCloud Page # 9 \x0cIntroduction about background Excessively high cost Due to huge initial investments and multi oligarch monopoly in the cloud computing industry cloud computing vendors have strong pursuit of profitability According to Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements EBITDA (gross margin) of AWS reached almost 45% with operating margin of 25% (net profit) In terms of service model cloud service providers could only meet resources usage and growth on a steady basis rather than temporary large scale ones as substantial investment cannot be rewarded in a timely manner due to uncertainty of resources usage Therefore current cloud computing platforms cannot meet the existing demands causing a conflict between business and technology But the repressed demand also has created a large blue ocean market 3 Decentralized Cloud Computing Platform Blockchain technology and its development give everyone a new trustworthy and collaborative ecosystem model And combination of Blockchain and cloud computing technology could solve issues in the centralized cloud computing platforms A decentralized cloud computing platform is also an ideal application platform for future Blockchain DApps 4 What is BonusCloud Individual household networks have witnessed an evolution from ADSL to broad band and then fibre optic and mobile network from 2G to 4G and 5G While with increase of computing capability for common chips at user end and popularity of dedicated chip di\xef\xac\x80erence of computing power between user end and server is not far from big It is predicted that when internet access capability and terminal computing power further improves user terminals and IDC servers in same region will not have any obvious di\xef\xac\x80erence and when popularity of the related infrastructure has exceeded 20% the industry will embrace an overall boom The BonusCloud team (BonusCloud io) aims to develop a decentralized trustworthy global cloud computing platform to serve open and shared ecosystem platform in Blockchain application The BonusCloud Platform connects and utilizes all resources with computing capability and converts them into valuable digital assets so as to enable DApps to empower Blockchain application entrepreneurs Thanks to its computing power trading platform the BonusCloud Platform could e\xef\xac\x80ectively connect such resources worldwide as current cloud computing enterprise data centers personal computers and CPU/GPU/bandwidth of user ends it provides general computing services with an ultra cheap price huge scope and ultra strong computing power to a range of industries including network access data storage digital currency mining 3D rendering live video transcoding AI learning and IoT protection At the same time the BonusCloud Platform will further promote development and upgrading of infrastructure through granting incentives to all the contributors in its ecosystem BonusCloud Page # 10 \x0cTechnology Architecture 1 Next Generation Blockchain (BonusChain) In traditional cloud computing services the matching of resource transactions and the distribution and execution of tasks are centered around the service provider in the form of centralization However at the beginning of its founding the cloud computing and service was characterized by the distributed pattern Compared with the distributed pattern of minicomputer and super computer the traditional computing system is too centralized in the globalized Internet of today But the attendant consequence of this centralized resource service is the lack of information transparency and symmetry The users are having di\xef\xac\x83culties in understanding the distribution and utilization patterns of resource and task in the cloud computing system Besides various security risks overbooking and other problems are also quite common The emergence of Blockchain technology especially the Blockchain 2 0 represented by Ethereum which extends the application scenes of through the smart contract mechanism operated by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its characteristics of information transparency openness and non falsification provide a right solution to the problems facing traditional cloud computing The BonusCloud Platform can make further improvements based on this On one hand it can combine the virtualization technology of cloud computing with the Blockchain to enhance the functions of the Blockchain virtual machine to support more PaaS applications under the promise of ensuring its security It can execute the smart contract as well as web application storage application and computing application Based on this FaaS and Edge Computing can be developed with the virtualization technology of BonusChain On the other hand it stores all the transaction information and resource information into the Blockchain where the users can inquire and audit freely Due to the di\xef\xac\x80erences in timeliness and data volume generated through di\xef\xac\x80erences in information BonusChain uses the pattern of combining both the main and side chains The main chain is in charge of the making of contracts and recording of contract information and other core content while one or multiple side chains are in charge of recording resource information log information and other forms of content with large data volume and low timeliness The side chains can apply di\xef\xac\x80erent technologies such as DAG di\xef\xac\x80erent to the main chain according to requirements [More technical details will be continuously updated] BonusCloud Page # 11 \x0cTechnology Architecture 2 Open Hardware Platform (BonusNode) As an infrastructure platform for decentralized cloud computing the BonusCloud Platform adopts a software and hardware decoupling scheme to achieve rapid iteration and opensharing At hardware level open source and open hardware platform is used to adapt and verify terminal hardware so as to maximize shared resources and develop an open platform The hardware adaption of the BonusCloud Platform is mainly divided into three types Lite Normal and Super Di\xef\xac\x80erent hardware plans apply to di\xef\xac\x80erent application scenarios which equip clients with di\xef\xac\x80erent customers di\xef\xac\x80erent platform capabilities Lite client (light client) for the fulfilling of light network related assignments lean client hardware namely micro controllers and household routers is mainly applied in network access and measurement data acquisition test of mobile APP etc With batched processing it emphasizes on the distribution capability and access capability of terminals has lower requirements of signal node stability It mainly focuses on assignments with short cycle and light workload Normal client general hardware namely PC+GPU engages in calculating assignments and are applied in calculation of HPC deep learning and rendering With batched processing it emphasizes on calculating capability assignment breakdown and deployment capability of terminals and has average requirements of signal node stability It addresses assignments with short period and heavy computing Super represented by a Server scale setup Super terminals have a wide range of application scenarios as it mainly involves in network hub fast storage access scalable data processing and computing and enterprise applications It tackles problems requiring enterprise level service with real time requirements focuses on the stability of its terminal and rapid processing capability and has strong demand for the stability of a single node It is mainly deployed in IDC It mainly addresses long cycle and real time enterprise service Users can choose hardware platform solutions based on their own requirements develop and deliver their services so as to flexibly allocate resources and rationalize utilization of resources BonusCloud Page # 12 \x0cTechnology Architecture 3 Distributed Network (BonusNet) The BonusCloud Platform endeavors to connect and utilize any qualified resources so as to create a safe and reliable network that connects any resource is foundation for delivering all services BonusNet is a new internet based cyberspace In its cyberspace independent basic components as DNS and Router could be designed BonusNet adopts L2+L3 over Internet model in which DHT framework similar to the Kademlia protocol is adopted on the L2 layer and encrypted tunnel protocol is used on L3 layer It is supplemented by a new namespace addressing mode instead of the DNS protocol used on the Internet and provides compatible support to DNS agreement With su\xef\xac\x83cient compatibility a standard network space protocol whether it is a public protocol (e g TCP/IP) or a user s private network protocol can be seamlessly migrated from Internet cyberspace to BonusNet space Kademlia is a distributed hash table (DHT) communication protocol for decentralized peerto peer networks A completely decentralized virtual or overlay network is formed out of the participant nodes Each node is identified by a number or node ID The node ID serves not only as identification but the Kademlia algorithm uses it to locate values (usually file hashes or keywords) Kademlia uses an XOR metric to define distance Two node ID s or a node ID and a key are XORed and the result is the distance between them For each bit the XOR function returns zero if the two bits are equal and one if the two bits are di\xef\xac\x80erent The Kademlia network with 2\xe2\x80\x99s N th power of nodes could only use a few steps to find searched node or value under the worst scenario Meanwhile the upgrade of a Kademlia network node is featured by the maximizing of existing node information and ranging by time sequence From an inspiration perspective this means has a certain logic a node that has been online for a longer time is more trustworthy as it has been online for several hours is more likely to be online for the next hour than for the node one has recently visited BonusCloud Page # 13 \x0cTechnology Architecture The decentralized network structure also has upper hand in being able to significantly improve anti attack capability Even if a whole batch of nodes in the network su\xef\xac\x80ers from extensive attack availability of network will not be a\xef\xac\x80ected Through the bypassing of these loopholes (the attacked nodes) and rewiring the network the network could restore its availability In Kademlia algorithm distance of selected node has nothing to do with physical distance but XOR result so selected nodes have higher chance of being located in di\xef\xac\x80erent regions or even di\xef\xac\x80erent countries BonusNet introduced the concept of physical distance which converges on physical distances every time a loop in neighboring nodes is found At the same time one could also divide and aggregate BonusNet based on features of the user s basic network such as region operator etc so as to provide more e\xef\xac\x83cient and robust network access capability In the transaction matching process application users could raise selective requirements in certain area of network to workers and resources with di\xef\xac\x80erent characteristics could also be quoted di\xef\xac\x80erently BonusCloud Page # 14 \x0cTechnology Architecture In a traditional Kademlia network connection between nodes is protected by private network protocols and applications could not match and use the Kademlia network without altering transmission agreement In order to develop more compatible application and to address issues of address management data transmission security etc The BonusCloud Platform develops an exclusive encrypted network on the basis of Kademlia network architecture which adopts an IPv6 address to accommodate all nodes All nodes are connected through an encrypted tunnel to ensure the security of transmitted data So nodes of the BonusCloud Platform could all be connected to build a set of seamless network system in parallel with current basic one Even if nodes are behind a NAT or a firewall they can also break regional restrictions of user base network through the utilization of NAT penetration technology As the basic network of the BonusCloud Platform BonusNet will act as a cornerstone for the cloud platform itself as well as platform application BonusCloud Page # 15 \x0cTechnology Architecture 4 Distributed Computing Platform (BonusComputing) Through the means of evolving and executing decentralization of centralized cloud platform software the BonusCloud Platform relies on BonusNode to provide community with three di\xef\xac\x80erent kinds of computing environments which are BonusContainer BonusAppEngine and BonusServerless so as to meet the requirements of di\xef\xac\x80erent developers Users may build DApps on their own or purchase DApps provided by application developers The BonusCloud Platform is in charge of packaging DApp operating environment into Docker files distributing them to the leased resource nodes securely and reliably based on directives of demand side to activate and operate BonusVM the virtual machine of BonusChain is in charge of the lifecycle management and task allocation so as to set up safe connections within BonusNet Although containers have fundamentally change means of development package and application deployment security remains one of the key issues in the usage of containers in public resource scheduling platforms How application programs access system resources in traditional Linux containers is exactly the same as that of regular (noncontained) applications which is directly deploying host kernel The kernel runs in a privileged mode allowing it to interact with the necessary hardware and returning results to the application The kernel imposes some restrictions on the resources that an application can access by using Linux control groups (cgroup) and namespaces but not all resources can be controlled through this mechanism In addition even with such limitations the kernel still faces big exposure of being attacked which can be directly attacked by malware To improve container isolation it could make each container operate within its own virtual machine being completely isolated from the host Even there are loopholes in guest system programs in virtual machines could still isolate itself from host and other programs/ containers on it Container technology of the BonusCloud Platform allows the one with virtual isolation technology to have isolation and security features at virtual machine level as well as maintain flexibility and performance at container level Image registry is used to store and distribute Docker images uploaded by users which is not essentially a centralized repository but only provides interfaces for uploading and downloading In such a distributed computing environment as the BonusCloud Platform a centralized image storage and distribution is unable to meet system requirements Therefore the image registry relies on the distributed storage service provided by the BonusCloud Platform and combines technologies such as intelligent compression intelligent flow control and P2P distribution to achieve low latency accelerated distribution of images BonusCloud Page # 16 \x0cTechnology Architecture BonusContainer BonusContainer provides container resource services mainly meeting requirements of resource usage from users Users can apply for designated case of CPU memory and storage specifications The platform selects the most suitable computing node to run the container through scheduling With BonusContainer users will firstly upload Docker image to BonusRegistry and then select the image name and label from BonusRegistry to create registry Users can choose certain scheduling policy such as geographic location a\xef\xac\x83nity resource requirements etc BonusController will select the most suitable node to create resources based on user scheduling requirements Advantage of BonusContainer Security Runs in an exclusive kernel and provides isolation of CPU memory network and IO Strong hardware isolation can be achieved through the usage of virtualized VT extensions Compatibility Supports OCI container format industry standards of Kubernetes CRI interface as well as traditional virtualization technologies Simplicity No need to embed an operating container in a completely virtual machine usage method is similar to Docker Performance Performance is aligned with that of Linux container BonusCloud Page # 17 \x0cTechnology Architecture BonusAppEngine BonusContainer is applicable for users with certain container usage background It requires users to create a container image in a certain format and determines means of utilizing resources It is the most flexible computing environment with certain technical threshold In order to make it easier for application developers to use the platform the BonusCloud Platform also provides BonusAppEngine function which is a DApp application runtime sandbox Users can use the SDKs in di\xef\xac\x80erent languages provided by the BonusCloud Platform and upload the coded program to platform BonusAppEngine has the following characteristics I It supports mainstream programming languages it could run Java Node js Ruby Go Python PHP to code applications II Easy to use thanks to BonusAppEngine developers could only focus on coding rather than infrastructure BonusAppEngine could fully manage tra\xef\xac\x83c change of application balanced loading monitoring of system running failure recovery and automatic updates of the infrastructure III Control of version and A/B Test Di\xef\xac\x80erent versions can be released on grayscale to complete A/B test BonusServerless In comparison with BonusAppEngine BonusServerless has more advanced features which could provide operation environment for functional level programs support business logic and forward network requests to user defined functions by means of network requests Advantages of BonusServerless I No need to manage servers as it can achieve flexible scale up highly automated expansion of capacity and recovery of failure II More granular billing better control of cost and no need to pay for idle time of AppEngine in comparison with BonusAppEngine III Provide third party tools and open source project ecosystems to simplify the buildup test and deployment of development and production process BonusCloud Page # 18 \x0cTechnology Architecture 5 Distributed Storage (BonusStorage) For the convenience of app developers and community users the BonusCloud Platform provides distributed node based BOS (BonusObjectStorage) and will launch BonusBlockStorage (BBS) services in the following plan With regards to platform design BOS focuses on scale of data storage while BBS focuses on latency of data processing both of which have certain di\xef\xac\x80erence in design and utilization of bottom level resources There would be certain di\xef\xac\x80erence between the two in design and resource utilization at underlying layer There are two mainstream means of data distribution in distributed storage system which are hash distribution such as Kademlia DHT Amazon Dynamo etc and central nodebased distribution such as google GFS Hadoop HDFS At implementation level object storage and KV storage generally adopt hash distribution ratio while block storage and distributed database often use central node distribution BonusStorage could support two data distribution strategies as well as negotiate during resource request at the same time Supported by BonusStorageEngines the BonusCloud Platform provides di\xef\xac\x80erent types of storage to serve BOS and BSS BonusStorageEngines supports two types of blob\xef\xbc\x9a immutable blob for BOS and mutable blob for BBS Object storage could be realized by one write and multiple read so underlying level uses immutable blob whose specific execution is to maintain a set of rocksdb on the local disk with key of the blob\xe2\x80\x99s hash value BonusCloud Page # 19 \x0cTechnology Architecture Block storage is required to support random read and write so the underlying level uses a mutable blob supported through a set of chunk files and logs Each chunk file matches with certain chunk content of a volume and is required to maintain current version Once each request is written it has to be updated and a log is used to record requests with focus on data checking and recovery BonusCloud Object Storage (BOS) BOS Storage Model BOS provides decentralized and encrypted object storage services On the client terminal of BonusStorage if an object (file) is to be stored the terminal will first be encrypted on the client and then split into multiple immutable blob data The check block blob code of the erasure code will be calculated according to the blob data and then the data blob and the check blob will be stored in the BonusStorage with the hash value of the blob as the key This set of blobs will be stored in a combination of multiple instances and erasure codes in the BonusStorage Specific strategies will be negotiated at the time of creation BonusCloud Page # 20 \x0cTechnology Architecture BOS Data Distribution Business scenarios of BOS cover PCDN distribution standard types low frequency types and archived types which combines traditional CDN and cloud object storage capability and supports flexible conversion The BonusCloud Platform supports three hardware solutions Di\xef\xac\x80erent workers will be allocated to support di\xef\xac\x80erent scenarios matched according to their di\xef\xac\x80erent storage and bandwidth capabilities When BonusStorage client uploads an object it could designate storage type and change it later during the process of converting object storage type BonusCloud Page # 21 \x0cTechnology Architecture 6 Ecosystem Model The BonusCloud Platform will develop a bilateral (multi lateral) ecosystem which is composed out of workers bookkeepers application developers application users and resource trading platforms Bilateral market will lead to \xe2\x80\x9cbilateral network e\xef\xac\x80ect\xe2\x80\x9d which is cross side network e\xef\xac\x80ect the value captured by users at one side of market will depend on number of users on the other side Take the example of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s business model the user value of passengers depends on the number of drivers (the more drivers they attract the shorter time of idling while driving hence the higher incomes they will generate) The two sides promote each other to amplify the network e\xef\xac\x80ect Therefore in the ecosystem of the future first of all the BonusCloud team will focus on supply increase such as increase of the number of workers as resources suppliers and their online time incentivizing bookkeepers and application developers to provide more sound transparent and diversified products and services Secondly e\xef\xac\x80orts will be made to stimulate user demand by means of marketing and penetration in global market with the goal of mutual promotion of supply and demand development e\xef\xac\x80ect of scale during competition and forming of competitive barriers The whole ecosystem of the BonusCloud Platform is an economic system The BonusCloud team would focus on increasing the overall activity in the economic system BonusCloud Page #

23 \x0cTechnology Architecture Application Developers As important participants in the BonusCloud Platform application developers develop DApps with various functions based on resources and services provided by the BonusCloud Platform package DApps into a Docker image to complete all preparations before distribution DApp usage payment is determined by a system algorithm and is written into a smart contract when the DApp is used Once application users are authorized to use it BxC payments will be transferred from user account to developer account Quality and usage of the DApp represent contribution of the DApp to the community which will a\xef\xac\x80ect calculation results of DApp\xe2\x80\x99s usage remuneration Application Users Once application users are authorized by application developers to use they can release resources and computing assignments according to the actual needs including requirements of resource allocation for assignments and price Application users submit a container image that contains assignment requirement to resource platform and spend the corresponding amount of BxC required to complete these tasks Resource Trading The BonusCloud Platform is responsible for matching transactions between application users and workers The workers or application users publish the resources they are about to rent or lease and the corresponding BxC quotations for the collection / payment on the resource trading platform and the BonusCloud Platform helps both the buyers and the sellers to complete the match quickly Once the transaction is approved by both parties the smart contract will be triggered automatically to ensure fairness in the transaction Depends on the di\xef\xac\x80erent application types the factors that a\xef\xac\x80ect the quotation include but is not limited to the floating point operand the occupied storage space memory space usage in a unit of time and tra\xef\xac\x83c flow usage in a unit of time etc User factors and random factors will also be introduced in the transaction matching to ensure a certain randomness and distribution so that the task assignment is not too centralized In each transaction match the resource trading platform will charge 1% of the transaction amount as the technological service fee (payable in BxC) to support the development of the Foundation BonusCloud Page # 24 \x0cTechnology Architecture Developer Incentive Protocol The BonusCloud Platform provides developer incentive protocol (DIP) to DApp developers DApp that reached certain contribution levels in the recent cycle (including number of usage number of users etc ) will be chosen between a certain number of blocks so as to incentivize its developers Newly released DApps and existing DApps will have di\xef\xac\x80erent incentivization strategy to reach di\xef\xac\x80erent results With the help of DIP\xe2\x80\x99s incentive mechanism more developers will be continuously encouraged to create DApps with more utility value so as to develop forward feedback facing developer community Consensus Algorithm The BonusCloud Platform adopts a hybrid consensus algorithm of DPoS+PBFT Bookkeepers are regularly elected by workers according to their contribution value Contribution value is calculated based on a series of factors (such as computing capability network bandwidth capacity transferred data amount size data storage capacity data storage time and node health etc ) When they become bookkeepers the value of some factors will be cleared to encourage them to keep providing services for application users in the next period Bookkeepers will turn over a certain amount of stakes as a margin which will be returned once they are no longer a verifier But if they are proved to have committed any malicious conduct the margin will be held in the token pool to be distributed as community incentives for contributions When the bookkeeper election is completed the list of current bookkeepers will be randomly sorted (to ensure that the order of each round of bookkeepers is di\xef\xac\x80erent and that the next round cannot be predicted) and then each bookkeeper will create a block successively If the bookkeeper has the right to account for this round but is not online the right to account will be handed over to the next bookkeeper in sequence This will not result in any deduction of the margin but will be recorded as a related factor for the next election BonusCloud Page # 25 \x0cTechnology Architecture Based on the analysis above the system consensus protocol workflow is as below I Verifier Registration To register verifiers are required to provide margin Vb The margin must be greater than the minimum margin parameter set by the system B_Min At any time the party who register may exit from the registration but the margin will have a waiting period which is normally set as one month The contribution value of verifier who runs for election is Vc II Equity Holders Vote to Elect Verifier Token holders can vote on verifiers If the weight generated by the voters is St the ranking weight of the verifier would be Wc= St*Vc If the verifier does not obtain any votes its weight is Wc=0 III Campaign of Qualified Verifier The verification nodes for registration are kept in a table that lists n higher ranked Bookkeepers sorted according to weight They are the qualified bookkeepers and the ones who can participate in the competition of generating blocks For those who are qualified as Bookkeepers there will be an eligible deduction of their contribution value Vc IV Qualified Bookkeepers Package Deal With the parent block header hash value Hp the current transaction Merkle root Hm and the timestamp T a nonce generates the candidate block header hash Hn and then broadcasts a proposed transaction Each qualified verifier can only send one proposed transaction per round anybody who sends proposed transactions repeatedly in the same round will be considered to be a malicious node If reported the margin will be confiscated Only if the system has not reached a consensus within a certain period of time (the system s consensus timeout parameters) can the qualified verifier change the nonce to regenerate the hash value of a new block and initiate the proposed transaction BonusCloud Page # 26 \x0cTechnology Architecture V Confirmation of Transaction Information After every qualified verifier has received the proposed transaction other Bookkeepers will first verify the node that initiates the proposed transaction and the transaction in the block After verification the verifier will calculate a voting weight value Vw vote on the proposed transaction that corresponds to the highest current Vw and initiate the Vote Block message The original proposer will initiate the Commit Request message after receiving the Vote Block message from more than 2/3 of the Bookkeepers Each verification node will verify whether the Vote Block message corresponding to the Commit Request message exceeds 2/3 If it does the commitment of the Commit Request message will be carried out and broadcast Each qualified verification node will broadcast the New Height transaction after receiving more than 2/3 commit transactions Each node will confirm the transaction and update the respective local Blockchain after receiving the New Height transaction The New Height transaction also allows the new block to be confirmed and not to be forked before the block For the avoidance of doubt only bookkeepers who have participated in the consensus would receive token incentives VI Contribution of node Letter P represents device contribution P includes online contribution of PO and contribution of device assignment PT in which PT is the sum of on grid contribution of assignment PW and completion contribution of assignment PB weight of online contribution is WO and weight of assignment contribution is WT As for designated user X total contribution of user X is P X = WO PO + WT PT = WO PO + WT (PW + PB ) Continuously online devices could accumulate online contribution PO without interruption and will be benefited by the same amount of share generated by new block at this stage based on PO \xe2\x80\x99s current percentage in the overall network after a phased block is generated Meanwhile Power value is used to express di\xef\xac\x80erence of di\xef\xac\x80erent hardware cost energy consumption and computing capability So with di\xef\xac\x80erent power at di\xef\xac\x80erent types of node accumulated speed of PO will be di\xef\xac\x80erent too BonusCloud Page #
