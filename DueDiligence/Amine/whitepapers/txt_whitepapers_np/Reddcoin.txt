Reddcoin Project Roadmap Infographic overview Detailed Overview Team Reddcoin Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 Roadmap 1 \x0cExecutive Summary During the summer of 2016 Reddcoin saw a major update to the network through the release of the v2 0 Core wallet Features included in the release pave the way for Reddcoin to be made more accessible and to encourage widespread adoption V2 0 also introduces several security fixes notably the enforcing of strict DER signatures and validation rules (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal \xc2\xad BIP66) The code base has moved from Litecoin with Reddcoin becoming a fork of Bitcoin based on the v0 9 branch This grants Reddcoin direct access to upstream features and fixes coming from Bitcoin development With this major work now complete and adoption of v2 0 steadily increasing the attention of the Reddcoin team now turns to the road ahead Beyond developing a blockchain the team is planning a broad ecosystem of applications that will realise the vision of Reddcoin \xc2\xad the \xe2\x80\x8bSocial Currency This document presents the 2016\xc2\xad2017 roadmap detailing Reddcoin development goals and objectives over the next 18 months The outline of core objectives are made along a timeline with milestones to measure and validate healthy progress Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 Roadmap 2 \x0cReddcoin Status Report Over the past year there has been significant work done at the Core wallet level to provide a stable blockchain ready to support various applications and features as development continues Upgrades include a rebase from Bitcoin Core the inclusion of strict DER signatures to further secure transactions and close possible attack vectors (BIP66) the ability to store data on the blockchain through OP_RETURN with a 80\xc2\xadbyte limit as well as numerous security upgrades and bug fixes taken from Bitcoin Core Over the past 18 months additional infrastructure has also been implemented and planned (new DNSSeed node new Electrum server nodes implementation of testnet network) As features continue to be added further extensions of infrastructure will be required While the core team will provide some of this infrastructure the broader community will also be encouraged to become involved The core team will be available at all times to provide guidance if requested The Reddcoin team maintains a strong proactive attitude Contact is being made and maintained with third\xc2\xadparty teams who are planning or who have already implemented various services for Reddcoin For the long\xc2\xadterm viability of the project it is essential to engage with other groups who have taken or who will take the time to support Reddcoin in their endeavours The Reddcoin team has been engaging with the broader community and working with local groups in non\xc2\xadEnglish speaking locations to establish local (non\xc2\xadEnglish) information portals Recently both the Chinese and Italian Reddcoin communities have launched websites forums and blogs The next priorities aim to expand the functionality of Reddcoin while maintaining the integrity of the Core software and blockchain The team will continue to forge relationships with the broader community as it identifies possible collaborative exercises Regular updates will be made by the team to keep the community informed about ongoing development The focus is on building an ecosystem that reaches beyond the blockchain One that allows Reddcoin to operate on a flexible platform which the average person is able to use to earn support and to show appreciation As it builds Reddcoin into a resource through which to express appreciation the Reddcoin team is working to make adoption easy for the broader community and the average social network user Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 Roadmap 3 \x0cReddcoin Fund Raising Maintaining and developing Reddcoin as a global digital currency incurs various regular and one\xc2\xadoff expenses The Reddcoin team now accepts

broader community the Reddcoin team has created the following infographic This infographic will be used to communicate on Reddcoin websites and social media platforms It provides a high\xc2\xadlevel introduction to the project goals over the next 18 months The infographic also provides insight into the ecosystem that is being designed and built along with approximate timelines for implementation As the exciting and inspiring steps along the roadmap are undertaken and completed this will create a unique opportunity for the Reddcoin team to build an highly\xc2\xadintegrated system that will make cryptocurrency easy and rewarding to use Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 Roadmap 5 \x0cDetailed Overview Reddcoin Project Roadmap 4th Qtr 2016 Redd\xc2\xadID (Blockchain\xc2\xadbased distributed naming service) Electrum Servers (SPV servers) \xe2\x97\x8f Redd\xc2\xadID is a blockchain\xc2\xadbased naming service \xe2\x97\x8f The service provides users the ability to create and own multiple user IDs (e g social work or community) \xe2\x97\x8f Each created ID is verified on the blockchain and linked to a Reddcoin address \xe2\x97\x8f The Redd\xc2\xadID can be used for sending and receiving Reddcoin to common names (Address\xc2\xadbook) \xe2\x97\x8f User Redd\xc2\xadIDs are public and searchable \xe2\x97\x8f A Redd\xc2\xadID can include as much or as little profile information as the owner sees necessary (contact details avatars etc) \xe2\x97\x8f User profile details can be made public or private \xe2\x97\x8f Within each user profile is the ability to link multiple social network identities (e g Facebook Twitter etc ) \xe2\x97\x8f Each social network identity can also have a separately assigned and individual Reddcoin address \xe2\x97\x8f There is a cost for registering each Redd\xc2\xadID \xe2\x97\x8f The cost of registering is determined by a number of factors such as the length mixture of characters vowels etc (e g john id > johnadam id > john0001 id ) \xe2\x97\x8f Due to popularity the cost of registering some short names (Joe Tom etc ) will be 6 figures or more (at current exchange rates) \xe2\x97\x8f Redd\xc2\xadIDs are verified in PoSV blocks with active Reddcoin stakers supporting the registration service \xe2\x97\x8f The majority of the registration fee paid for a Redd\xc2\xadID goes to the wallet\xc2\xadholder who stakes and fully verifies the transaction \xe2\x97\x8f A small percentage of the registration fee goes to the network (the Electrum server operator) to support infrastructure \xe2\x97\x8f Redd\xc2\xadIDs may be transferred between users (creating a potential marketplace) \xe2\x97\x8f Redd\xc2\xadIDs will have an expiration date and require renewal (terms between 1 and 5 years with discounting) \xe2\x97\x8f Essential to bootstrapping the Redd\xc2\xadID ecosystem will be the revival of Reddcoin Electrum servers \xe2\x97\x8f The servers provide the initial interface to the Redd\xc2\xadID system for registration and maintenance \xe2\x97\x8f The Electrum protocol is extended to support Redd\xc2\xadID operations and to enable interaction between clients and the blockchain Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 Roadmap 6 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Network participants are encouraged to run Electrum servers to receive a percentage of registration fees as network operators\xe2\x80\x99 fees (service fees) \xe2\x97\x8f Electrum Server operators set their own service fee percentage \xe2\x97\x8f The fee structure is advertised to users when they register their Redd\xc2\xadID and they can choose their prefered server to connect with 1st Qtr 2017 Electrum Client (SPV wallet providing instant startup) \xe2\x97\x8f The Reddcoin Electrum Client provides the interface for Reddcoin users \xe2\x97\x8f Reddcoin Electrum is a lightweight client with fast start times \xe2\x97\x8f Operation requires a much smaller blockchain download (block headers only 110MB vs 1 8GB full chain) \xe2\x97\x8f As of the publication date of the Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 roadmap the Electrum Client is already updated to support BIP66 transactions (low_S signature) \xe2\x97\x8f Electrum wallets are easier to backup and maintain with addresses being generated / restored from a seed phrase \xe2\x97\x8f The client is available on \xe2\x97\x8b Desktop (Linux Windows OSx) \xe2\x97\x8b Android \xe2\x97\x8b iOS (availability depends on the evolution of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s policy on supported cryptocurrencies) \xe2\x97\x8f The Electrum Client supports natively the registration and maintenance of Redd\xc2\xadIDs and full user profile metadata management \xe2\x97\x8f Plugin architecture is included to allow the extension of additional features \xe2\x97\x8b Users can opt in/out of features (enable / disable plugin) \xe2\x97\x8b Additional plugins extend the functionality of the wallet \xe2\x96\xa0 Tip notifications \xe2\x96\xa0 Tip feed \xe2\x96\xa0 Built in RDD exchange rates \xe2\x96\xa0 As of roadmap publication discussions are underway with some exchanges for built\xc2\xadin currency conversion \xe2\x96\xa0 Other possibilities include social chat/IRC/news feeds \xe2\x97\x8f The Electrum wallet becomes the social wallet 2nd Qtr 2017 Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 Roadmap 7 \x0cBrowser Wallet (Decentralised tipping) \xe2\x97\x8f Tipping wallets are no longer stored on discrete servers \xe2\x97\x8f The existing tip bots (Reddit / Facebook/ Twitch) are reworked to become decentralised entities \xe2\x97\x8f Tips are deposited and spent directly from a user s wallet with private keys under the control of the user \xe2\x97\x8f Inclusion of many popular social platforms (Facebook Youtube Twitch Twitter and others) via browser plugin architecture acting as a bridge \xe2\x97\x8f The Browser Wallet supports the extended Electrum protocol \xe2\x97\x8f The wallet allows in\xc2\xadbrowser registration of Redd\xc2\xadIDs \xe2\x97\x8f Micro\xc2\xadsubscriptions \xe2\x97\x8b Scheduled or time\xc2\xadbased transactions to websites and users to support good content \xe2\x97\x8f Chrome is first on the list to support followed by Firefox and Safari 3rd Qtr 2017 Social Broadcast (Service to encourage social and micro\xc2\xaddonations) Redd\xc2\xadID API (Blockchain data interface) \xe2\x97\x8f Reddcoin Social Broadcast encourages positive social exchange and interaction and rewarding / donations \xe2\x97\x8f Social Broadcast links users to content creators \xe2\x97\x8f The service generates metrics on popularity interaction etc \xe2\x97\x8f URLs and postings that attract positive tipping behaviour are ranked and highlighted \xe2\x97\x8f Activity is broadcast and users can subscribe \xe2\x97\x8f Specific users or content can be followed \xe2\x97\x8f An API for third\xc2\xadparty integration with Redd\xc2\xadID \xe2\x97\x8f Allows remote registration from third\xc2\xadparty services \xe2\x97\x8f Perform blockchain data queries and look\xc2\xadups 4th Qtr 2017 PoSV 2 0 (Proof of Stake Velocity v2 improvements) \xe2\x97\x8f Continued investigation of PoS algorithms in the context of further upgrades (security performance etc ) to PoSV \xe2\x97\x8f Improving the current PoSV algorithm to strengthen the existing PoS reward scheme \xe2\x97\x8f Extending the algorithm to encourage more active staking nodes \xe2\x97\x8f Modifying the existing algorithm to reward active stakers with interest based on the total money supply (staking + non\xc2\xadstaking) For example if only 50% of the available Reddcoin are staked those Reddcoins generate Reddcoin 2016\xc2\xad2017 Roadmap 8 \x0c2 x interest i e 10\xc2\xad12% This is implemented in the full\xc2\xadnode Qt wallet first Electrum Staking (Extended staking ability) \xe2\x97\x8f To benefit smaller coin holders who find downloading the entire blockchain a burden the implementation of staking in Electrum \xe2\x97\x8f Staking enabled in each of the Electrum clients (Windows OSx Linux Android) Team Reddcoin Lead Developer | Developer | Communications & | Reddheads Chief Editor | Community Manager | John Nash (Gnasher) Henry Stuart (reddibrek) Eric Reddcoin Community Reddcoin
