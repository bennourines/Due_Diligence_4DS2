Birth of Blockchain The secret of getting ahead is getting started Mark Twain Preface There has also been speculation in the past about the practical security of the SHA 256 hashing algorithm given future technological advances Particular concern has centered around the advancement of quantum computing and the hypothetical reduction of brute force diffculty over time Originally created in December of 2013 with several exchanges of authority since the Dimecoin project has until now existed without a formal summary of technology or intent This document is an attempt at providing this information in a clear and succinct format otherwise only acquired by arduous research through numerous websites source code repositories message boards and hear say \xe2\x80\xa2Blockchain The data store adhering to a public consensus strategy implemented by Bitcoin for trust less management of a cryptocurrency For sake of brevity this document makes the assumption about its audience of having a good general understanding of cryptography cryptocurrency and blockchain Where further research may be desired to supplement this piece outside links are provided \xe2\x80\xa2Miner The computing software/equipment that engages in mining Broad assumptions are also made about development intent of derived projects and legacy teams that have contributed in some way to the Dimecoin project Because they are not active participants in the project\xe2\x80\x99s current development one can only make educated guesses as to their past concerns and motivations Bitcoin Before discussing Dimecoin and its objectives it is important to provide some fundamental information on Bitcoin and blockchain (abstract) of which Dimecoin was originally built upon \xe2\x80\xa2Bitcoin (https //bitcoin org/bitcoin pdf ) The cryptocurrency managed by the Bitcoin blockchain 6 \xe2\x80\xa2Mining The storing of public data on the blockchain authenticated by performing \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult work\xe2\x80\x9d as to create an investment of time and energy required for said activity Since the invention of blockchain and its Bitcoin implementation countless other cryptocurrencies have attempted to utilize its innovative data storage strategy while also conforming to its behavior (protocol) to better suit more specific objectives Quarkcoin Originally released July 21st 2013 Quarkcoin attempted to solve the community perceived issue of mining centralization that was prevalent on the Bitcoin blockchain that mining was no longer possible with budget computing resources and was only accomplished with any success after a large financial investment in expensive ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) based mining facilities SEE FIG 1 There has also been speculation in the past about the practical security of the SHA 256 hashing algorithm given future technological advances Particular concern has centered around the advancement of DIMECOIN FOR THE COMMUNITY BY THE COMMUNITY \x0cDIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE quantum computing and the hypothetical reduction of brute force difficulty over time An example implementation of the Quark hashing algorithm can be found on Github at (https //bit ly/2HHxSfV) Although there have been no security \xef\xac\x82aws found in the SHA 256 algorithm to this date that could compromise its application to the blockchain it is not unusual in cryptography for interested parties to discover share and implement more secure cryptographic algorithms and strategies Quarkcoin\xe2\x80\x99s solution to these concerns was to deviate from SHA 256 block hash discovery and turn to a newly created cryptographic algorithm called Quark FIGURE 1 Quark Algorithm The Quark cryptographic hashing algorithm provides an output from chain hashing (SHA 512) 6 different cryptographic digests 9 times The type and order of these digests are as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 blake bmw groestl or skein groestl jh blake or bmw sha 3 (keccak) skein sha 3 (keccak) or jh This pattern is understandably more secure than Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s SHA 256 itself even if SHA 256\xe2\x80\x99s security is not necessarily in question Although the Quark algorithm in turn requires more computing time than SHA 256 in a proof of work environment where hashing diffculty is desirable this has no negative effect Beside security at the time of its creation this algorithm allowed for inexpensive computing equipment to participate in mining as no commercial ASIC was available with Quark algorithm hashing capability 7 \x0cDIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE Our History 8 DIMECOIN FOR THE COMMUNITY BY THE COMMUNITY \x0cDIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE The Evolution of Dimecoin An abridged history and glimpse of things to come Following the release of the Android wallet it has never been easier to accept Dimecoin in your business Dimecoin Origin Dimecoin Hiatus The Dimecoin project was announced on December 23rd 2013 on the Bitcoin Forum (https //bitcointalk org/index php topic=382164 0) as \xe2\x80\x9cBased on Quark\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOnly better\xe2\x80\x9d The motivation for its release can only be supposed like many new blockchains at the time as the implementation of a \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d protocol configuration and the intent of wealth accumulation of blockchain assets (coins) It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly when or why but interest in development and maintenance of the Dimecoin blockchain appears to have broken down some time toward the end of 2014 with few active discussions on the Bitcoin Forum to give clear insight into the community opinion of the project Dimecoin like both Bitcoin and Quarkcoin was created as a proof of work mineable blockchain with a software foundation of Bitcoin qt (https //github com/bitcoin/ bitcoin) (wallet) and eventually Bitcoinj (https //github com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj) to support its protocol Because Quark by this point had already found some popularity and maintained its ASIC resistance this algorithm was a reasonable selection for a new blockchain meant to be community maintained and mineable using budget computing resources Examining the blockchain itself there looks to have been an aggressive drop in coin in\xef\xac\x82ation at that time suggesting a possible shut down of active mining operations If reliable pools were unavailable at the time there may have been little opportunity for individuals to effectively participate in Dimecoin\xe2\x80\x99s network operations **Let this be a living document if any of this conjecture is claimed to be inaccurate at a later time by those parties who were involved this documentation should be amended to disclose those more accurate accounts of what took place ** For the most part the Bitcoin Forum community initially rejected the Dimecoin project announcement considering it \xe2\x80\x9cspam\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9calready dead\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpremined garbage\xe2\x80\x9d It still did not fail however to attract some early participants (miners nodes) to spread and propagate the network that exists to this day 9 \x0cDIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE Dimecoin Revival Timed nicely with the 2017 surge of interest in cryptocurrency trading the addition of Dimecoin to the livecoin net exchange on March 29th 2017 sparked new interest and awareness of the project Active discussion returned to the Bitcoin Forum that Summer with piqued interest in operation of wallet nodes and trading Dimecoin on exchanges This interest in the digital asset escalated as community members volunteered time to moderate social media channels promotional websites and create new media to promote Dimecoin This enthusiasm continued through the recent cryptocurrency market surge that took place in the Winter of 2017/2018 which led to the official project adoption by the newly created management group Dimecoin Network LLC Dimecoin\xe2\x80\x99s commitment is to maintain security for our community to support them in fostering growth to assist in achieving financial liberty and to enable them to empower us to exceed their expectations through optimum utilization of blockchain technology In the United States\xe2\x80\x94where cryptopayments are on a brink of becoming fully mainstream\xe2\x80\x94we assist in the mass adoption process not only for Dimecoin but for all valuable cryptocurrencies by reaching out to small businesses and landing key partnerships with larger businesses to expand globally We help businesses accept crypto payments utilizing a decentralized secure and trusted money transfer offering extremely fast transactions with a near zero fee Our Mission For the community By the community We realize that the future of Dimecoin depends on widespread adoption We are committed to bringing this plan to fruition It is the focus of our mission

foundation to solidify Dimecoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain for longevity into future endeavors How we aim to achieve this is by making Dimecoin available everywhere through the natural dedication of a global collected human effort and by our desire to demonstrate and deliver the best of what cryptocurrency offers It\xe2\x80\x99s for the community by the community Dimecoin is on its way to being heavily marketed and many key relationships are currently being forged Worldwide mass adoption of cryptocurrencies has barely been embarked on but Dimecoin is planning to lead the charge Most cryptopayments now occur online We believe the next step is for cryptocurrencies to become heavily involved in point of sale purchases The Dimecoin team has initiated the mass adoption process of cryptocurrency locally We started with mom and pop shops retail the parking industry and other small businesses The next phase includes moving to large business investors and affiliates in an aligned international effort We are planning and executing this endeavor aimed at small and medium enterprises and easing into larger enterprises to expand outwardly We will be a leader in the adoption of cryptocurrencies Dimecoin plans to amaze the world with its affiliations partnerships and business integrations Our intention is to make this happen within a three year timeframe but with the support of the community we are confident that we can and do it much sooner We understand and are motivated by the fact that Dimecoin is powered by the laws of mathematics The Dimecoin community and its development team insist on \xef\xac\x82awless updates and timely communication for both the Dimecoin community and Dimecoin investors The future of Dimecoin will be guided by the collective voice of its community members and the development team Dimecoin is a crypto coin a way of money transfer It is based on transparency mathematics cryptography and the human nature of people around the world who want to give back to their community Please join us as we bring new features and the best user experience to Dimecoin We invite you to be part of the Dimecoin community as we write history Our Focus The idea for merchants and customers to transact with the least resistance could be summed up as \xe2\x80\x9chigh \xef\xac\x82uidity \xe2\x80\x9d Fluidity can be broken down into three attributes \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Rapid movement with lowest cost of micro and macro transactions Accessibility to readily interactive gateways An ever increasing demand to exchange cryptocurrency for goods and services The more fees a cryptocurrency has the higher chance that users will resist utilizing it on a daily basis Dimecoin will be easy to use easy to spend and easy to accept Every adult child and business around the world will be able to accept Dimecoin As the percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) of cryptocurrency inevitably and exponentially grows so will its acceptance Celebrities will begin speaking positively about trusted cryptocurrencies and its usage will be seen in movies and on television This will assist in allowing mass adoption 11

Edward Counsel Fast Transactions A Dimecoin transaction will show up in the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s wallet in less than 10 seconds That transaction will be confirmed in a block (on average) in 64 seconds \xe2\x80\x9cevery day\xe2\x80\x9d micro transactions Because of its speed pairings and non compulsory transaction fees Dimecoin is recognized and promoted as an ideal candidate for daily trading and real world use Fee Structure Block creation is currently supported primarily by a mining reward effectively in\xef\xac\x82ating the currency supply equal to or less than most fiat currencies The in\xef\xac\x82ation rate is observed to be declining over time with a ~3 6% increase in supply from April 25th 2017 to April 25th 2018 expecting less in\xef\xac\x82ation over the next year due to the block reward halving policy (see block reward formula FIGURE 2) As of this writing the Android wallet has transaction fees of 3e 7/kb 1e 4 min These fees may need to be increased in the future but it will still be nearly free to send Dimecoin Asset Availability Having billions of available coins in the Dimecoin ecosystem benefits micro transactions and \xe2\x80\x9ceveryday use\xe2\x80\x9d a number of ways \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Once the market has settled on a general valuation of the currency it is not likely to experience the volatility observed in other cryptocurrencies A greater supply should encourage real world use opposed to only being traded on exchanges for financial gain like a security Lower risk perception by real world adopters as overall market capital is spread across a greater number of units Suitability For Micro Transactions The value of Dimecoin\xe2\x80\x99s protocol as identified by community members and by Dimecoin Network is its suitability for 14 Decentralized Network For a step by step guide on how to mine Dimecoin please refer to our mining manual It can be located here (https //t me/ DimecoinMining/1160) or found on our website under the F A Q section Although there are now commercially available Quark algorithm ASICs they are still in the minority when compared to SHA 256 This allows for the economically viable creation of mining pools of common computing equipment to participate in mining network activity Today there are many active pool mining participants which encourages community involvement and longevity of project interest Mobile Payments Send Dimecoin through the Android wallet application These types of crypto payments are becoming the way of the future More and more people are using their phones to make payments in neighboring countries See figure 3 (pg 12) which re\xef\xac\x82ects a staggering growth of interest in payment methods involving mobile devices

Nightingale Payment Gateways Both Online & Offline Video Games Micro Transactions With Dimecoin\xe2\x80\x99s quick transfer speeds along with it\xe2\x80\x99s [virtually] free transaction costs users can buy/sell goods & services by utilizing the Dimecoin blockchain Whether it be an online store a mom & pop shop buying/selling an item on Craigslist users paying with Dimecoin can be confident that their financial assets and personal identity will never be compromised The explosion of growth in the gaming industry brought with it new ways to spend money within games Unfortunately this has created a problem for gamers to sustain the enjoyment they get out of their experience The most popular revenue generating methods that have been introduced in recent years are mostly due to the rise of mobile games Users are essentially forced to pay for in game items to win Did you know that both Google and Apple take a 30% cut from all mobile apps/games With Dimecoin being the currency of choice to pay for digital items that means game developers will have an immediate 30% increase in revenue Thus allowing developers to charge significantly less for their products This ultimately delivers a much greater user experience and brings enjoyment back to the gaming industry Under Developed Countries Strengthening Currencies There are several underdeveloped countries that won\xe2\x80\x99t even hold their country\xe2\x80\x99s native currency due to its instability This results in a lot of people exchanging their native legal tender for either gold or another country\xe2\x80\x99s currency Shopkeepers will even refuse payment in some cases So by introducing Dimecoin to these countries it would not only bring more financial stability to the people but it would also bring with it the freedom and peace of mind 17 \x0c\xe2\x80\x9cFor the community By the community \xe2\x80\x9d \x0cDIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE GIVING BACK Giving is not just about making a donation It\xe2\x80\x99s about making a difference Kathy Calvin Dime Donation Dime Non Profit Organization (NPO) Dimecoin being a community based coin does not only mean that it only caters to the crypto community Our vision of changing the world based on how individuals use this The \xe2\x80\x9cDimeDonation\xe2\x80\x9d will be managed by a NPO This organization will be responsible for the accepting and securing the donations receiving community input on the recipient of the donations and finally the distribution of the donations coin as means of paying for goods & services is not our only goal we also have a burning desire to help people who are less fortunate around the world Whether it be from a natural disaster or people who are born into an underdeveloped country where food & water is a scarcity By becoming a leader in the cryptocurrency space Dimecoin will gain the ability to donate funds that will feed & clothe the less fortunate A special fee will be introduced with the next generation of wallets expected during the summer of 2018 This fee is yet to be negotiated and will be done with the community at a later date The DimeDonation fee will apply to all Dimecoin transactions (except for trading transactions on the exchanges) This very small fee will be used to support charities and non profit organizations all over the world The Dimecoin community will determine who gets these donations and when The donations will be sent via check to the charity or non profit organization unless they prefer to receive DIME instead This is a very important part of Dimecoin and sets us apart This \xe2\x80\x9cDimeDonation\xe2\x80\x9d was inspired by the Dimecoin community and it is how we will give back to our communities all over the world 19 \x0cDIMECOIN | PAST
