 2 INTRODUCTION TO NEUROCHAIN AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE PROJECT
 Artificial Intelligence the next digital and productivity frontier 
 As many business leaders and government officials are debating on the potential impact of Artificial
 Intelligence on their cost and profit structure they actually may already be late to the party 
 Forward thinking companies in financial services high tech and telecommunication are re thinking their
 business process to boost productivity According to Accenture the growth of profits dropped from 25
 percent in 2010 to 3% in 2015 On the other hand there is a potential to boost profitability an average
 of 38% by 2035 This will lead to the creation of $14T across 16 industries in 12 economies by 2035
 (Source The impact of AI on profits by industry Accenture and Frontier Economics) 
 So it is here and it will create massive changes in our economies No doubt What most people see is
 the impact on their job As productivity changes scale millions of people need to be redeployed on
 additional and new added value activities The need for re training for both the workforce and our
 government and business leaders is certainly one of the first priority In this early 2018 the initiatives
 to fully embrace this new digital frontier should be at the top of all leaders’ agendas 
 So what 
 The classic People Process and Technology is a rational way to address the topic 
 As far as the Process is concerned identifying how millions of tasks can be automated and how
 decisions can be made based on successful patterns is a first step that can lead to significant
 improvement As an example in the supply chain world newly created platforms unify procurement 
 logistics manufacturing and inventory operations in real time and provide early warning of potential
 problems and propose alternative solutions thanks to processes retooled with AI they analyze tens of
 millions incidents per day and US$ trillion worth of products in real time 
 The People aspect will be the north face for most businesses According to Michael Chui from McKinsey
 Global Institute half of our workforce activities can be automated But on the other hand the world will
 welcome millions of people coming from India China Indonesia Africa and others These populations
 are entering the consuming age with needs for a better efficiency energy mix and will create enough
 new jobs to offset the cut in traditional economies 
 Then Technology There is so much to say here So in a nutshell the first vital technology need is a
 new automation protocol that fully leverages artificial intelligence and allows businesses and individuals
 to fully develop their potential The blockchain was the first step since it provided a decentralized ledger
 to transfer and store information safely But the reality is that it is still a heavy process to approve the
 blocks (transactions) The concentrations of approvers (miners) in a few countries/hands is a complete
 paradox to the original spirit of the Blockchain and the energy needed to power the server farms is just
 impossible to scale to the level needed to rethink entire economies 
 What is coming next 
 NeuroChain (the “Company”) is the best answer available since it is a brand new protocol based on a
 new consensus that does not give the priority to the biggest computation capacity or the wealthiest
 approvers but rather the best behaviors (entropy enthalpy and integrity see below or in our blog for
 scientific whitepaper for further technical descriptions) 
 With NeuroChain intelligent bots can evolve thanks to machine learning and benefit from the collective
 improvement made by other providers in the system This new protocol an open source language can
 be deployed safely and benefit from the collective intelligence created by the network of contributors

 This is a very disruptive way to address technology since it is based on a rapidly evolving language that
 is accessible by all Pioneers for sure will be the first to benefit from these new productivity boosts 
 Nobody can afford to be left behind 
 NeuroChain will propose the protocol that will securely help to augment business processes with AI 
 Business leaders have the expertise in their field with NeuroChain they will also have the best strategy
 to stay ahead of the pack

 3 WHAT IS NEUROCHAIN 
 3 1 BLOCKCHAIN BACKGROUND
 The Blockchain is a large scale innovative technology that allows digital data to be stored in a
 decentralized and secured manner 
 Data and related transactions are ‘written’ in a ledger pretty much like in a register This ledger is
 decentralized i e stored on the users servers and not in a single location 
 Constantly updated transactions are tamper proof since they are based on a user controlled
 cryptographic validation system The transactions materialized by the lines in the register are recorded
 in the general ledger after validation by blocks of data and thus form a chain of unalterable blocks the
 Blockchain 
 The Blockchain is therefore a decentralized registry in which everyone has the right to write but no one
 can delete what has been written This registry is available to everyone It can be viewed at will but
 without being able to modify its contents once written Having only one version of a physical register
 would be problematic (i e it would be impractical if everyone wanted the opportunity to write but it
 would also be very risky if stolen or destroyed) To ensure the sustainability of this registry many copies
 would have to be made Unlike a good old paper registry today s computers can share information
 quickly and ‘en masse’ The Blockchain register is computerized and copied in multiple places 
 Unlike the current Internet network which operates on nodes owned by multinationals with the
 Blockchain technology which is based on a decentralized and peer to peer network network users
 themselves become network nodes Some of the users hold copies of the Blockchain worldwide 
 Thousands of the registry copies are constantly updated simultaneously making the Blockchain totally
 indestructible 
 « BLOCKCHAIN »
 v A sophisticated technology
 v For storing and transmission of certified
 data
 v With no centralized control and authority
 HOW DOES IT WORK 
 A problem (a transaction 
 a situation etc ) needs to
 be translated/encoded
 on the blockchain
 A community composed
 of “miners” offers its
 encoding services
 The selection of the
 successful miner is done
 according to a method
 ( consensus )
 determined by the type
 of Blockchain used
 The selected miner
 encodes the information
 (in a block )
 The information / block
 is certified by the
 community of miners
 The information / block
 is stored on the
 Blockchain
 BASIC DEFINITIONS
 v Miners computers validating new
 transactions and recording them on the
 blockchain
 v Consensus method of selection of the
 miner which will produce the block 
 Bitcoin Ethereum and NeuroChain are
 using different consensus 
 v Block structure containing transactions

 Page 8/51
 Some versions of the Blockchain such as Ethereum or HyperLedger even allow executing pieces of
 programs in the Blockchain making decentralized execution possible 
 Disruptive technology
 As of today any transaction between two parties is somehow certified by a trusted third party (a notary 
 a bank an insurance company a government etc ) The trusted third party ensures that the conditions
 are met to complete the transaction and then allows the execution (or even executes it) in accordance
 with the contracts signed and the legislation in force At the very top of the chain of trust the State is
 the guarantor of the coherence and stability of the entire system It may grant or withdraw approvals to
 operators who do not comply with the rules 
 This system which has been in place for centuries is in the process of being somewhat overturned by
 the Blockchain technology Thanks to Blockchain transactions between two parties will be carried out
 directly via the Blockchain mechanism without going through a certifying third party 
 Applications
 Blockchain was born when the Bitcoin was created in 2009 The Bitcoin is certified non duplicable 
 traceable and tamper proof all this guaranteed by technology The exchanges and transfers of Bitcoins
 are visible to everyone so it is impossible to create false Bitcoins without this being reflected in the
 decentralized registry This technology also makes it possible to make payments without having to go
 through a bank or financial institution third party 
 Bitcoin is a special application of the Blockchain which is based on a monetary value it is a cryptocurrency 
 The technology is used to ensure the traceability of transactions since each Bitcoin has its
 own encryption code Thus a user can only use a Bitcoin with a single recipient corresponding to a
 single given transaction 
 As a result the Bitcoin solved a first problem the question of the permanence and uniqueness of digital
 assets 
 But the Blockchain technology will have many other applications In particular Blockchain will bring a
 new generation of business processes as detailed later in this document

 3 2 NEUROCHAIN AT A GLANCE
 NeuroChain is an augmented Blockchain NeuroChain brings AI at the heart of the Blockchain So far 
 the blockchain technology has not really met its promises This creates a significant barrier to entry It
 has become urgent to overcome the current issues NeuroChain offers a long term solution which will
 make the blockchain technology open to the world 
 NeuroChain is intelligent more secure more reliable and hundreds of times faster than existing
 Blockchains 
 NeuroChain is an evolution of the Blockchain that integrates machine learning and Artificial Intelligence
 (AI) to drastically improve the performance and capabilities of distributed systems It’s a technological
 platform specifically designed to carry collective AI applications 
 NeuroChain is the future of Blockchain Its cutting edge technology is based on years of extensive
 scientific research 
 Key concepts
 It relies on 4 key concepts to go above and beyond the regular capabilities of Blockchain 
 It’s powered by INTELLIGENT ultra fast secure and reliable bots (robots)
 The bots act independently and use machine learning algorithms to get better and better as time goes
 by 
 It’s an ECOSYSTEM of collective artificial intelligence
 The bots work seamlessly together thanks to a new protocol The whole network of bots makes up the
 NeuroChain environment an ecosystem of connected AI that gets more virtuous as it gets used 
 It performs better thanks to a clever DECISION protocol
 Instead of relying like Blockchain on Proof of Work – that requires an enormous amount of brute
 computing power – NeuroChain uses a PROOF OF INVOLVEMENT AND INTEGRITY (PII) protocol
 to achieve the best performance from a limited number of bots 
 It’s an OPEN SOURCE initiative
 NeuroChain is designed as a base on which to build intelligent applications The power resides in the
 community that stands united under the banner of NeuroChain 
 NeuroChain’s strengths
 Intelligent Applications Forget smart contracts which requires to lay down all the possible outcomes
 of a given scenario in advance Think intelligent applications where AI is now embedded into the
 contract NeuroChain’s architecture was designed to carry intelligent applications from the start The
 scope of potential intelligent applications is endless 
 Reliability NeuroChain favors quality over quantity Intelligent bots over brute computer processing 
 Incredible Speed Hundreds of times faster than the regular Blockchain 
 Security NeuroChain doesn’t rely on external validation (i e mining farms) the consensus comes
 from within the NeuroChain network

 5 THE DIFFERENTIATORS
 5 1 NEUROCHAIN PROTOCOL PROMISES
 Existing blockchains execute anticipated programs (i e smart contracts) The existing protocols do not
 handle not pre planned and not pre programmed circumstances 
 Machine learning capabilities are embedded into NeuroChain its protocol allows execution of any
 transaction planned or unplanned pre programmed or not pre programmed 
 Existing blockchains are based on two protocols Proof of Work & Proof of Stake 
 The Proof of Work protocol takes into account the computational power to select a miner who validates
 a transaction This has led to a race for computational power and the creation of farms of servers for
 mining to get the cash rewards involved As a result the most powerful miner is the winner 
 The Proof of Stake takes into account the miner’s wealth in the network The more a miner owns the
 more it is selected to validate transactions 
 NeuroChain’s protocol is called Proof of Involvement and Integrity (PII) 
 Bots vs Miners given the limitations of miners NeuroChain replaces them with Bots 
 Bots are rewarded for their involvement in the network and their intrinsic integrity Involvement and
 Integrity rather than power and wealth 
 This is made possible thanks to new machine learning capabilities embedded into Bots 
 NeuroChain Scoring
 For NeuroChain purposes a business is a bot when adopting NeuroChain a particular business will
 be represented in the blockchain ecosystem by its Bot 
 In NeuroChain Bots are rewarded for their involvement in the network and their intrinsic integrity 
 Involvement and Integrity 
 Involvement is based on physics theories Entropy and Enthalpy 
 Entropy is the ability of a Bot to interact with other Bots effectively sharing information means good
 entropy 
 Enthalpy relates to the quality of the interaction with other Bots sharing critical information means good
 enthalpy 
 Each Bot will have an Entropy and an Enthalpy score calculated by NeuroChain’s algorithm This is
 machine learning and artificial intelligence at work 
 Integrity is the recognition of interaction relevancy Integrity is calculated on the probability of a bot
 interacting with all bots including in the future Integrity means trust Each bot will have an Integrity
 score

 Page 13/51
 The more effective a Bot is in introducing value to the network the higher the global score The higher
 the global score the more chances the bot will be recognized by its peers and will be selected for
 validating transactions 
 NeuroChain value proposition
 NeuroChain offers a scoring mechanism of each of the bots so that peers and players are permanently
 assessed based on balanced criteria 
 ð BEST & MOST RELEVANT BOTS (i e BUSINESSES) ARE EMPOWERED AND REWARDED
 NeuroChain protocol enables the automation of decisions based on the dynamic scoring A bot with a
 ‘bad’ score may automatically be replaced by a ‘better’ bot for carrying out the exact same task 
 ð OPTIMUM DECISION MAKING AUTOMATION
 Unlike current blockchain rigid smart contracts NeuroChain contracts evolve and re assess constantly
 the ecosystem and the players (bots) agility and machine learning
 ð UNLIMITED EVOLUTIVITY AND SCALABILITY BASED ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

 Solving the problem ‘just’ requires computational
 power
 BITCOIN 1st blockchain generation ETHEREUM 2nd blockchain generation NEUROCHAIN the next blockchain
 CONSENSUS Proof of involvement and integrity
 1) Miners are replaced by robots (“Bots”)
 Bots scoring according to interaction with their
 environment (active Bots vs static miners)
 Involvement = quality of information provided
 Integrity = reliability of information provided
 2) Selection of the Bot validating a block –
 Random selection among highest rated bots
 CONSENSUS Proof of Stake (The most common
 alternative to proof of work)
 The miner is randomly selected among all
 cryptocurrency holders The probability is
 weighted by the total amount of cryptocurrency
 held (i e a miner who holds 10 000 tokens will
 have 10 more chances of being selected than a
 miner holding 1 000 tokens (1 token = 1 chance)
 Limited application Bitcoin is a blockchain
 limited to cryptocurrency (Bitcoins) exchange – no
 other business applications are available
 Bots interaction – Businesses are represented by
 Bots Bots will interact with each other thanks to
 Machine Learning and AI algorithms Bots (hence
 businesses) will self adapt to the environment
 => Interactive and reliable network used for
 business applications
 Applications Smart Contracts 
 They carry with them the benefits of the
 Blockchain technology and allow for automation…
 with limitations
 Cons –
 • Very large electricity consumption
 • Concentration of the block production power
 to a limited number of miners – the most
 powerful
 • No other business application development
 available
 Pros –
 • Consensus is smart intelligent and ecologic
 • Bots may be lodged in regular desktops 
 laptops or even smartphones
 • Advanced business applications – adaptive
 technology
 • The Bots scoring mechanism is a guarantee of
 the network and smart applications reliability
 Adoption of the blockchain by businesses and the
 public at large is made possible
 Pros –
 • Security The smart contract is encrypted and
 distributed among nodes 
 Cons –
 • Smart contracts’ Human factor People write
 the code and can make mistakes which are
 then embedded into the smart contract
 • Smart contracts’ Implementation costs Smart
 contracts cannot be performed without
 programming hence generating high cost

 6 BUSINESS APPLICATIONS
 6 1 INTELLIGENT APPLICATIONS VS SMART CONTRACTS
 The smart contracts were for the first time described in the nineties (1996) by Nick Szabo 
 In the context of the Blockchain a smart contract is an object in which a methodology is defined to
 execute facilitate and verify the negotiation or improve the performance of a contract 
 Smart contracts are pertinent since many contractual clauses may be partially or fully self executed 
 The integrity of the contract is ensured by the Blockchain since all the transactions are listed in the
 immutable register 
 However the main limitation of smart contracts is their inability to handle complex clauses and take into
 account the evolution of their environment –they execute pre planned conditions 
 In NeuroChain the intelligent applications are based on distributed rational agents (Bots) A rational
 agent always selects an action that optimizes an appropriate performance measure depending on its
 knowledge The performance measure is fully defined by the final user and reflects what the user
 expects from the rational agent 
 To highlight the difference between intelligent applications of NeuroChain and existing standard smart
 contracts a clear description of a rational Agent should be given 
 Rational Agents (Bots)
 A Bot is a rational agent taking into account its environment and having an autonomous behavior To
 act rationally an agent should take both the past and the future into account when making an action 
 The past refers to the information the agent knows and the actions it has made until time t The future
 refers to the information the agent expects to receive and the actions it will make after time t
 (predictions) 
 For an optimal decision making an agent has to map the complete history of observation action of all
 the other agents in its ecosystem Merely storing all observations would require very large memory and
 computational power hence would be too expensive 
 In a standard artificial intelligence environment a goal for a particular task is a desired state of the
 considered environment Accordingly planning in the AI world refers to searching through the state
 space for an optimal path to the goal 
 In a deterministic environment (smart contracts) planning comes down to a simple graph search
 problem 
 In a stochastic world (intelligent applications) the agent takes into account the uncertainty of the
 transaction when planning 
 As a conclusion the main difference between smart contracts proposed by existing blockchains and
 intelligent application proposed by NeuroChain is the planning world (decision making system) With
 existing blockchains the world is deterministic while with NeuroChain the world is stochastic 
 With NeuroChain the Bots are rational agents they will comprehend their environment including the
 behavior of other Bots and will act rationally depending on the ecosystem and the “potential” actions
 of the other Bots 
 This intelligent environment will allow to build smart business applications

 NeuroChain when Intelligent Blockchain Reinvents Business
 NeuroChain is composed by a chain of Bots which is an intelligent Blockchain where Machine Learning
 and Artificial Intelligence enrich the distributed system The main characteristic which makes
 NeuroChain different is its capability to share the intelligence between the Bots 
 The first intuitive application of NeuroChain is public which means Open Blockchain But also specific
 private applications called Smart Business Application such as the chains of traceability applied in
 various industries (agriculture health finance accounting human resources etc ) 
 NeuroChain s entire design is focused on intelligent business applications architecture communication
 protocol machine learning algorithms and connectivity with other Blockchain but also with other orphan
 (exogenous) bots that provide a fertile ecosystem for augmented business 
 Another important aspect of NeuroChain is its flexibility to provide a distributed environment to connect
 autonomous agents and create a synergy between them This property meets the needs of companies
 to achieve a high level of cooperation and collaboration between their various applications and therefore
 between their teams 
 In other words NeuroChain provides tools for transforming disparate intelligent agents into artificial
 (and human) collective intelligence 
 Security trust and exploration are the main properties included in the package offered by NeuroChain 
 The NeuroChain new paradigm is to create a space or an environment that represents a source of
 intelligence NeuroChain is designed to analyze the situation and make a decision 
 The created Bot ecosystem allows different workflows (whose integrity is ensured by the protocol)
 between these Bots and also between Bots and humans It thus induces trust and neutrality in the
 exchanges within and between companies 
 Two exemples 
 Traceability and transparency The distribution and persistence characteristics of NeuroChain allow
 the lineage of an object or concept between different actors in a given process This induced traceability
 could apply to different fields of activity agriculture food medicines energy compliance and regulated
 professions Machine Learning algorithms shared between the Bots allows also an audit of the
 transactions in order to detect anomalies or malicious exchanges This process will allow the
 establishment of high level trust in the application 
 Documents storage and management the redundancy of validations in the network will achieve a
 high level of trust and certification The use of NeuroChain protocol will provide a cryptographic
 signature of the documents Stamps of documents will be saved in the Blockchain to ensure the
 uniqueness and durability of digital signatures This repository of documents will be used for different
 applications such as traceability 
 The list of applications is endless The two exemples above give an overview of NeuroChain
 capabilities A number of companies have been targeted already and all of them are very keen to move
 forward quite quickly in creating customized applications (Energy taxes calculation and collection 
 industry IoT etc ) Some companies have even asked for consulting type of services to the NeuroChain
 team (please see the web site for the name of ‘partners’)

 7 ICO STRATEGY – TERMS AND POLICIES OF ICO
 The next few pages describe the creation of NeuroChain Blockchain and its attached crypto currency 
 Executive Summary
 Details on the crypto currency issued
 ICO economics
 Any update on this part of the project will be posted on the Company website in particular the Terms
 and Policies which shall be amended or supplemented at any time at the sole discretion of NeuroChain 
 https //www neurochaintech io/
 The document describes forward looking elements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could
 cause actual results to differ materially from our projections 
 This document is not an offer and is for information purpose only The information contained herein is
 subject to change No part of this draft document is legally binding or enforceable Accepted purchasers
 of the token will receive legal documents in due course NeuroChain is compliant with existing
 regulations Therefore all token purchasers without any exception will have to provide the required
 data as specified in the KYC form they will receive (Know Your Customer) Before signing the Token
 Sale Agreement with NeuroChain specific attention will have to be paid by each purchaser to the legal
 warnings which will be displayed in due course on our web site and ICO related documentation since
 some participants may be banned and will not be allowed to take part to the ICO This will be detailed
 extensively and NeuroChain will strictly enforce its KYC policy 
 The NeuroChain ICO is a Pre Sale since NeuroChain is a new Blockchain protocol and the crypto value
 created will be forged later in the NeuroChain ecosystem 
 NeuroChain’s blockchain development is in progress A demonstrator already exists 
 The first NeuroChain elements to be delivered will be 
 The NeuroChain infrastructure (Blockchain Protocol)
 The Artificial Intelligence that will act as a part of the validation process
 The client software
 The Meta language based on C++ agent oriented (the Neuronal)
 The SDK (development kit for intelligent apps)
 The interface apps
 The tooling for web apps
 The fast deployment tools with automatic controls and online repositories
 The documentation to use it all 
 Beyond these technical points a wiki and training center will be created 
 Easy to use interfaces for simple apps will be created and a large marketing and evangelization process
 toward corporations to get quick wins on technical issues will be started as soon as possible

 7 1 ICO EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 NeuroChain will create a crypto currency 
 The NeuroChain’s crypto currency will be called CLAUSIUS or “NCC” (for NeuroChain Clausius) 
 The total supply ever will be NNC 4 374 000 000
 The total forged NCCs will be distributed as follows 
 A 70% will be distributed to NeuroChain elected Bots (forging block reward “neurogenesis”)
 Validate transactions and Block analysis reward 
 Support stable / viable network
 Processing intelligent applications
 B 15% will be granted to Token purchasers (Genesis allocation)
 People who wish to support the NeuroChain project from the outset will be able to buy NCCs
 in exchange for other crypto currencies (Bitcoin Ethereum) or Euros 
 The crypto currencies or Euros they give in exchange for NCCs will help develop and support
 the project & business development it will also help develop partnerships with various
 industries and top level universities (La Sorbonne MIT …) and it will allow to start a marketing
 and communication campaign 
 C 10% to be granted to founding team & key advisors (Genesis allocation and 5 years linear
 vesting)
 Two thirds of these NCCs will be generated through a vesting process linearly spread over 5 years to
 ensure the full success of the project 
 The main missions of the group are 
 Design of the NeuroChain blockchain
 Technical research engineering deployment
 Security and communication protocol
 Maintain / improve the protocol

 D 3% to be granted to NeuroChain Foundation (Genesis allocation 5 years linear attribution or
 vesting)
 Insure long term governance / meetings
 Public works
 Training and education
 Community building
 Legal and compliance
 If the NeuroChain Foundation is not created the 3% NCCs will never be forged 
 E 2% to be granted to seed capital and innovative applications (Genesis allocation 5 years
 linear vesting)
 Developing promising applications on top of the NeuroChain
 Build partnerships and continuous improvement mechanism for the protocol
 Branching with other Blockchains
 Critical points of attention in relation to the NCCs distribution
 The allocation detailed above offers a long term visibility of the created volume and potential value of
 the NCC 
 The long term vesting process for the founding team and advisors is critical to keep their energy and
 creativity focused on the success of the project 
 Altogether the NCC distribution is a powerful tool to control speculation and volatility of the NCC by
 injecting regularity in the process 
 The founding team and advisors will not hold more than 10% of all the NCCs ever created 
 The largest part of NCCs (70%) is granted to the Bots

 7 2 NCCS FEATURES
 The Tokens are utility tokens that will once the Platform is developed be used exclusively on the
 Platform 
 In particular purcharser of NCC will have the right to 
 use the artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities of the created blockchain platform 
 create intelligent applications and
 become Bots providing artificial intelligent and machine learning services in the NeuroChain
 network and therefore elected Bots during the election process hence potentially earning
 Clausius (“NCC”) as a contribution for their election 
 The various uses and utilities of the Token will be further described on NeuroChain website at
 https //www neurochaintech io/ 
 The Ownership of Tokens carries no rights uses or attributes express or implied other than those
 described in these terms and in the Whitepaper 
 In particular you understand and accept that Tokens 
 a) do not represent or confer any financial right on the economic results of the Company 
 b) do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake share or security or equivalent rights 
 intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Platform and/or
 Company and its corporate affiliates and
 is not intended to be a digital currency security commodity or any other kind of financial
 instrument

 7 3 ICO ECONOMICS
 The ICO is designed to allow participants who believe in the project to take part in it at the outset 
 There will be two stages subsequently 
 A Private sale
 A Public sale in three steps 
 o Discount sale phase
 o Attractive sale phase
 o Haste sale phase
 The accepted cryptocurrencies are the following 
 Bitcoin (will depends on statistics and compromise between security and utility)
 Ether (confirmed)
 Euros will be accepted as well 
 The crypto currency is called NeuroChain Clausius Its tag is NCC 
 The Private Sale (Feb 19th – Mar 12th 2018)
 The Private sale of NeuroChain has two main objectives 
 Incentive the early adopters (or believers)
 Show to the community a quantitative measure of early success 
 To be accepted in the private sale purchasers of tokens must 
 Provide the KYC form (Know Your Customer) 
 Sign the confidentiality clause along with the KYC

 Page 23/51
 Attach a scan of ID (Passport or driving license or ID)
 Plan a skype interview with the NeuroChain executive team to finalize the conditions 
 NeuroChain team will make a decision on whether accepting the purchaser to the Private Sale 
 Afterwards an Agreement will be provided to be signed by each accepted purchaser At this time only 
 the purchase will be possible 
 Philosophy of the Private Sale
 Regarding our project and strategy (communication and ICO) the community is an important factor to
 the success of NeuroChain For these reasons the private sale is proposed to the community with
 conditions and limits 
 Lock up period
 To ensure the stability of NCC and therefore the stability of NeuroChain a lock up mechanism will be
 set up for the private purchasers The lock up process is as follows 
 30% of NCCs will be available after the ICO
 30% of NCCs 3 months after the ICO
 40% of NCCs 9 months after the ICO
 The steps of the lock up period are correlated with the progress of the NeuroChain project to ensure its
 stability 
 The Public Sale – Terms and Conditions
 Step 1 The discount phase
 The first step of the sale is characterized by the fact that there is a decreasing discount over a period
 of one week maximum 
 Starting date March 19th 2018 00 00 00 UTC (Equinox Spring)
 Ending date March 25th 2018 23 59 59 UTC
 Maximum total expected ~10 million EUR equivalent in BTC or ETH
 Minimum entry floor Median expected funds computed from white list commitment(1)
 Maximum entry cap Average expected funds computed from white list commitment +
 3 standard deviation(2) (to satisfy maximum people)
 Unit price 0 08 EUR equivalent in BTC or ETH increasing over time(3)
 Max token distributed 200 000 000 NCC
 Conditions White List and KYC
 The pricing function is as follows 
 𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 𝐵 ∗ 𝑒𝑥𝑝23456789 9< ∗ = >(@
 A C
 D_FGHIJKLM_NOPHQ )
 Where 
 B is the base price 0 08 EUR
 M is the max price 0 10 EUR
 t is the marginal time spanned from phase start to phase end
 T is the total time spanning over the phase
 f is the funds invested so far
 F_discount_phase is the max amount of money expected during this phase 10 million EUR

 𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒t
 𝐵
 [
 When the threshold of the allocated volume of NCCs sold is reached or at the end of the week 
 whichever comes first the sale is temporary closed Any purchaser that would apply for the first step of
 the sale while it is closed will have a priority for the second step of the sale 
 Step 2 The attractive phase
 The second step of the sale is characterized by the fact that the selling price of the NCC will be constant 
 The amount of NCCs that could be purchased will be of 30 000 000 maximum over a two weeks period 
 Participants that would have applied for the first step of the sale while it is closed will be toggled to Step
 2 automatically 
 Step 2 will be over when the number of NCCs exchanged reaches 30 000 000 or at the end of the two
 weeks period whichever comes first 
 During this phase all funds are accepted and a peg is established during two weeks 
 Starting date March 26th 2018 00 00 00 UTC
 Ending date April 8th 2018 23 59 59 UTC
 Maximum total expected 3 million EUR equivalent in BTC or ETH
 Minimum entry floor 0 1 ETH or its equivalent in BTC 
 Maximum entry cap 2000 ETH
 Unit price 0 1 EUR equivalent in BTC or ETH constant price
 Max token distributed 30 000 000 NCC
 Conditions KYC
 Step 3 The haste phase
 During the third step over a one week period of time the selling price of the NCC will progressively go
 up for a maximum of 20 000 000 NCCs sold The more purchasers will want to benefit from the sale 
 the higher the exchange value 
 Starting date April 9th 2018 00 00 00 UTC
 Ending date April 15th 2018 23 59 59 UTC
 Maximum total expected Up to EUR 3 Million
 Minimum entry floor 0 5 ETH or its equivalent in BTC 
 Maximum entry cap 2000 ETH or its equivalent in BTC 
 Unit price EUR 0 10 up to EUR 0 20
 Max token distributed 20 000 000 NCC
 Conditions KYC
 The maximum total expected at this phase is unknown The peg on the price is not maintained at 0 10
 EUR equivalent for 1 NCC The price will increase and will be computed based on demand The upper
 limit of the price is 0 20 EUR The idea behind the mechanism is that the critical amount necessary to
 start and trigger the project is reached The price increases to dissuade people purchasing but as said
 randomization is important for the protocol The unsold tokens will be locked

 The duration of this period could be adapted according to the ICO progress If the objective of the
 attractive phase is reached the hast phase will be shortened 
 The model is similar to the discount phase but for 
 the limit conditions and
 the valorization rate 
 The equation transforms into 
 𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 𝐵_ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒_𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 ∗ 𝑒𝑥𝑝23456789 9< ∗ = >(@
 A C
 D_OPHMQ_NOPHQ)
 Where 
 B_haste_phase is the base price 0 1 EUR
 t is the marginal time spanned from phase start to phase end
 T is the total time spanning over the phase
 f is the funds invested so far in the phase
 F_haste_phase is the max amount of money expected during this phase around 3 million EUR 
 The equation that will allow to compute by using limit conditions the decreasing discount rate is as
 follows 
 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = ln Z
 𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒t
 𝐵_ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒_𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒
 [
 We believe that a fair valuation mechanism is much sounder than hectic speculation Therefore the
 mechanism allows keeping a relatively stable value during the haste phase 
 Project Cap
 The NeuroChain project is based on a strong business plan built and audited with experts in finance
 and blockchain to capture the correlations and ensure the coherence between the different steps of the
 project and the financial part The projections are on 5 years with high granularity during the first 18
 months 
 The adequacy between the technical part and the financial part of NeuroChain project allowed to identify
 the different steps and deliverables in time and according to the funds raised 
 Formally the hard cap is the addition of the expected raised amounts during the private and public
 sales è EUR 30 M equivalent in BTC or ETH The hast phase is designed to dissuade the purchasers
 given the increase in token price (x2) The circulating supply after the ICO will correspond to the volume
 of sold tokens 
 The unsold tokens if any and the reserve will be locked They will progressively be made available
 over time to finance the following steps of the project according to the roadmap after a new version of
 the blockchain is delivered the total token reserve will be made available to finance the next version
 (See below for details on the timing) No other event shall generate unlocking of the reserve In
 particular the founding team will not be granted these tokens 
 The community will be in a position to clearly follow up on these critical points

 9 1 USE OF THE PROCEEDS RESEARCH STRATEGY
 NeuroChain is an intelligent Blockchain with many innovations in different fields consensus 
 communication analysis distributed abstraction and security 
 Because technologies are in fast and perpetual evolution technological watch is taken into account
 earlier in the project parallel to its development and industrialization 
 Most of the funds collected will be used in R&D 
 Four main axes of research are identified 
 Consensus and Blockchain Performances
 In distributed systems the consensus is central in the decision process in order to converge to a specific
 state of Blockchain In this regard consensus may be considered as a state function which is fully
 determined In NeuroChain the consensus is based on another state function which is the entropy
 weighted by the enthalpy and integrity This measure is fully adapted to distributed systems and
 therefore determines the most pertinent Bot (depending on the paradigm) to enrich the resilient data
 base and create wealth 
 The consensus in Blockchain in particular in NeuroChain has to be continuously improved to adapt it
 and its parameters for performant operations in the network NeuroChain is constructed to support these
 improvements through adaptive parameters similar to machine learning methodology 
 This research focus is a priority for NeuroChain In this context collaborations with leading universities
 in the world in algorithmic and distributed systems are initiated and will be enhanced over the coming
 months 
 Proof of Workflow developed for distributed algorithms and based on IPFS protocol will be improved
 rapidly by involving the Bots for the distributed storage of the algorithms keeping a high level of security 
 The idea is to dissociate NeuroChain from IPFS to guarantee a complete and auto consistent
 ecosystem 
 Security Cryptography and Anomaly Detection
 Security in distributed networks represents a constitutive pillar since any regulation entity in the system
 is banned Cryptographic techniques are therefore used to introduce high level of security and trust in
 the system In NeuroChain Machine Learning Algorithms are also at work to detect malicious
 transactions and behaviors in the network The first proposed algorithm is based on Bayesian network
 to estimate the probabilities in order to detect incoherent or improbable events 
 These two complementary processes the first a priori and the second a posteriori represent an active
 field of research in many disciplines At NeuroChain also cryptography and Machine Learning
 algorithms are identified as critical and a dedicated team is constituted with this aim early in the project 
 Communication Protocols and Technologies
 Secure and adaptive direct communication between the Bots in NeuroChain is important to achieve
 high level of availability and resilience In NeuroChain several communication protocols are available
 in order to ensure maximum security and portability The evolution of the protocol is critical to keep the
 performances at the highest level This is also a research priority for NeuroChain 
 New promising communication technologies will also integrate into the project We will be testing them
 through proof of concepts

 Architecture
 By design through distributed Bots NeuroChain is totally polymorphous It can meet current and future
 needs by adapting to Kappa Lambda Data Driven and even Event Driven architectures 
 NeuroChain architecture presents also a large flexibility and capability of partitioning treatment and
 connectivity with existing applications The ultimate goal is to bring a new vision of architecture by
 decorrelation of the application layer from the physical layer The applications will become totally fluid
 and dynamic without adherence to the hardware Like ideas spreading from one human mind to another
 through collaboration applications will adapt from one technical environment to another 
 ð In other words NeuroChain is inspired by the most advanced and efficient engine the
 brain
 The following diagram represents the research projections for the coming five years potentially less
 than that depending on funds collected

 11 LONG TERM VISION
 NeuroChain WILL change the world
 Blockchains are bringing us to a massive turning point but in their present form they will not be able to
 completely make the transition 
 Things have accelerated considerably in recent years wealth has been created faster than ever 
 technology is embedded in our lives and technology changes are somehow frightening 
 It may only be the beginning 
 We dream of moving from a compartmentalized world to a world of trust and exchange – implementing
 decentralized applications without a single point of control and consequently without having to question
 the legitimacy of the operators Security provided by cryptographic mechanisms and peer to peer
 dissemination of information is a fanstatic way to do it 
 The Blockchain would be the link between the world of business and that of consumers Exchange
 becomes possible by opening bridges between mainstream applications and closed corporate worlds 
 But the existing Blockchains may not be ready to take on this responsibility They fulfill their task in
 cryptocurrency exchange and on executing smart contracts but this is not enough They lack
 intelligence At NeuroChain we bring machine learning and artificial intelligence to the blockchain 
 Blockchains are composed of 3 main elements peer to peer exchanges cryptography technology and
 a consensus algorithm The magic side of Blockchains lies in one word decentralization – no central
 server no control point 
 The differences characterizing blockchains often lie in their consensus algorithm The precursor 
 Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work which uses the power of machines to determine who can write the next
 block This has generated a frantic race to machine power because whoever gains the right to write
 the next block will receive money Others use the Proof of Stake which will choose a random token
 from all existing tokens In this world the richests those with the most tokens are more likely to win 
 It is hardly possible to have a fair and impartial system with the existing consensus 
 How to do it then At NeuroChain we decided to put everything back to square one starting from a
 empty page and we have given a lot of thought to it In our consensus algorithm the Proof of
 Involvement and Integrity we take into account the quality of the data entered in the Blockchain We
 have created a formula based on entropy enthalpy and integrity 
 It’s more ethical it’s fairer it’s quicker it’s more efficient It’s the blockchain made intelligent No more
 brute computationnal power no more ‘wealth comes first’ 
 If you have convictions it s time to take part and be active If you want to change things speed up the
 movement contribute to creating something incredible now is time to seize the opportunity Like many 
 we are blockchain enthusiasts” We are fans of this movement but to our regret the values underlying
 the creation of these technologies have fallen into oblivion 
 We at NeuroChain have the opportunity to change this This is going to be the Blockchain momemtum 
 our collective momemtum 
 Let s not miss this opportunity

 We want to make sure that our lifes will not remain in the hands of the giants of the Internet or
 governments We want to bring more justice and fairness in the technology world As specialists of
 machine learning and artificial intelligence we will bring the thinking ability to the Blockchain The
 Blockchain is beginning to deliver its promises Things happen despite the reluctance of skeptics This
 is just the beginning 
 We want to go several steps further We want to bring collective intelligence into the system 
 Intelligence is one of the most complex concepts to define In the context of NeuroChain there is a
 relevant definition of intelligence which was in fact given in the fifteenth century during the Italian
 Renaissance “Intelligence is none other than the reassembly of knowledge” 
 This definition is really appropriate for Blockchain technology since the latter consists in an assembly
 of different independent and complementary technologies namely cryptography distributed consensus
 and peer to peer protocol However if the Blockchain has the property of aggregation of knowledge
 and information where is the intelligence 
 NeuroChain is designed to answer this question by merging Blockchain technology with machine
 learning algorithms NeuroChain represents a substantial evolution of existing Blockchains enabling
 intelligent and complex applications beyond crypto currencies and deterministic smart contracts thanks
 to machine learning 
 ð It’s artificial intelligence at work 
 NeuroChain is a distributed system of Bots (intelligent or rational agent) The cognitive abilities of the
 Bots community will constitute the collective artificial intelligence of the network Bots interact with their
 environment and have ‘social’ interactions with other Bots 
 ð It s collective artificial intelligence at work 
 NeuroChain brings intelligence and open a new world to the Blockchain

 14 WARNINGS ON THE RISKS INHERENT TO THE ICO
 1 Risk of loss of access to an NCC due to loss of credentials 
 Until it is distributed to the buyer the said buyer’s NCCs may be linked to a Company account You can
 only access the Company account using the credentials selected by the buyer The loss of these
 credentials will result in the loss of the NCCs Good practices advise buyers to store their credentials
 securely in one or more backup locations that are geographically separated from the work location 
 2 Risks associated with the buyer’s credentials 
 Any third party that obtains access to the buyer’s credentials or private keys may be able to use the
 buyer’s NCCs To minimize this risk buyers must protect themselves against people gaining
 unauthorized access to their electronic devices 
 3 Legal risk and risk of adverse regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions 
 Blockchain technologies have been reviewed by various regulatory bodies around the world including
 within the European Union The ICO has been structured to comply with EU law applicable at the time
 of the offer and may be subject to securities regulation under US law 
 The operation of the Platform and of NCCs may be impacted by the passing of restrictive laws the
 publication of restrictive or negative opinions the issuing of injunctions by national regulators the
 initiation of regulatory actions or investigations including but not limited to restrictions on the use or
 ownership of digital tokens such as NCCs which may prevent or limit development of the Platform 
 Given the lack of crypto currency qualifications in most countries each buyer is strongly advised to
 carry out a legal and tax analysis concerning the purchase and ownership of NCCs according to their
 nationality and place of residence 
 4 Risk of an alternative unofficial Platform 
 Following presales and development of the original version of the Platform there is a possibility that
 alternative platforms may have been established using the same open source code and open source
 protocol that underlies the Platform The official Platform may find itself in competition with these
 alternatives unofficial platforms based on NCCs which could potentially adversely impact the Platform
 and NCCs 
 5 Risk of a lack of interest in the Platform or distributed applications 
 There is a possibility that the Platform may not be used by a large number of companies individuals
 and other organizations and that there may be limited public interest in the creation and development
 of distributed applications Such a lack of interest could impact on the development of the Platform and 
 therefore on the uses or potential value of NCCs 
 6 Risk that the Platform is not developed 
 The main right associated with NCC is the right to access the Platform the right to create intelligent
 application using the Platform and the right to become Bots in the NeuroChain network and become
 the first elected Bots potentially earning NCCs The value of the NCCs is therefore heavily correlated
 with the existence of such Platform and network which has not yet been implemented NCCs may lose
 part or all of their value if the Platform and/or network is never fully developed

 Page 46/51
 7 Risk that the Platform as developed does not meet buyer expectations 
 The Platform is currently under development and may undergo significant redesign prior to its launch 
 For a number of reasons not all buyer expectations concerning the Platform or NCC’s form and function
 may be met on the launch date including changes in design implementation and execution of the
 Platform 
 8 Risk of theft and piracy 
 Hackers or other malicious or criminal groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Platform
 or the availability of NCCs in several ways including but not limited to denial of service attacks Sybil
 attacks mystification surfing malware attacks or consensus based attacks 
 9 Risk of security weaknesses in the Platform’s core infrastructure software 
 The Platform‘s core software is based on open source software There is a risk that the Company team 
 or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core
 infrastructure elements of the Platform by interfering with the use of or causing loss of NCCs 
 10 Risk of weakness or exploitable breakthrough in the field of cryptography 
 Advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may
 present risks for crypto currencies and the Platform which could result in the theft or loss of NCCs 
 11 Risk of a mining attack 
 As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and crypto currencies the blockchain used for the
 Platform is vulnerable to mining attacks including but not limited to dual expense attacks powerful
 mining attacks selfish mining attacks and critical competition attacks Any successful attack poses a
 risk to the Platform the expected performance and sequencing of the Company’s markets Despite the
 best efforts of the Company’s team the risk of known or new mining attacks exists 
 12 Risk of the Platform failing to be used or adopted 
 While NCCs should not be considered an investment their value is bound to change over time This
 value may be limited if the Platform is not sufficiently used and adopted In such a case there could be
 few or no markets at the Platform launch which would limit the value of NCCs 
 13 Risk of a tight market for NCC 
 There are currently no exchanges or trading facilities on which NCCs can be traded If such exchanges
 or trading facilities do develop they will probably be relatively new and subject to poorly understood
 regulatory oversight They may therefore be more vulnerable to fraud and default than the established
 and regulated exchanges that exist for other products Should exchanges or trading facilities that
 represent a substantial part of the NCC trading volume be involved in fraud security failures or other
 operational problems the failures of such exchanges or trading facilities may limit the NCC’s value or
 liquidity 
 14 Risk of an uninsured loss 
 Unlike bank accounts or accounts in other regulated financial institutions funds held through the
 Company are generally uninsured At present there are no public or private insurance agents providing
 buyers with coverage against a loss of NCCs or a loss of value

 Page 47/51
 15 Risk of winding up of NeuroChain’s project 
 For a number of reasons including but not limited to an unfavorable fluctuation in NCC value the
 failure of business relationships or competing intellectual property claims the NeuroChain project may
 no longer be a viable activity and may be dissolved or simply not launched 
 16 Risk of malfunction in the Platform 
 The Platform may be impacted by an adverse malfunction including but not limited to a malfunction
 that results in the loss of NCCs or market information 
 17 Unforeseen risks 
 Crypto currencies and cryptographic tokens are a new untested technology In addition to the risks
 stipulated above there are other risks that the Company’s team cannot predict Risks may also occur
 as unanticipated combinations or as changes in the risks stipulated herein
