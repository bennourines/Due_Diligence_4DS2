recently has raised a reconstruction strategy a promotion of the \xe2\x80\x9cCOOL Japan strategy as one of the major strategy to reconstruct Japanese economy Japan\ s subculture is commonly referred to as geek culture or \xe2\x80\x9cotaku culture \xe2\x80\x9d It is now well known throughout the whole world with the spread of the Internet and it became a powerful content of \xe2\x80\x9ccool Japan\xe2\x80\x9d According to Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry survey the market size of the content industry such as Japanese movies animation TV programs music games etc is said to be about 12 trillion yen However this is only for the domestic market It is also said that the scale of the market spreading on a global scale is tens of times that For example more than 230 000 visitors from all over the Europe come to Japan Expo a festival of Japanese culture which is held every year in France and other countries as well Japanese subculture is now becoming famous every year that even Stephen Spielberg who came to Japan this year excitedly mentioned that the Japan\ s pop culture is my favorite the best Based on such global trends the MINDOL Project will be creating new contents in the \xef\xac\x81elds of \xe2\x80\x9cCool Japant\xe2\x80\x9d subculture and pop culture such as animation movies games cartoons and music In addition we will manage and operate the project safely and securely using blockchain technology MINDOL is the new currency for the world of \xe2\x80\x9csubculture market \xe2\x80\x9d In MINDOL project we have raised 3 8 billion yen (approx 42 million dollars)

capitalization after the bitcoin In order to launch MINDOL business e\xef\xac\x83ciently we will utilize the smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to operate the MINDOL system Smart contracts will automatically execute and save various transactions done in MINDOL Using Smart Contract for example the contract content such as when and when to remit is automatically executed When the contract is executed its execution contents are saved on the network The key feature of the Ethereum blockchain is that the contract content can be automatically enforced without going through the central

transactions\xe3\x80\x91 It is not currently decided that the tokens that we distribute to customers are listed on virtual currency exchanges in Japan and abroad as virtual currencies Tokens are not legal currencies that the country guarantees its value like Japanese yen and dollars It is electronic data exchanged on the Internet Price may fluctuate for tokens There is a possibility that the token\ s price plummets sharply in conjunction with the price of the bit coin or suddenly becomes worthless unexpected loss Consultation on virtual currency and fraudulent coins is on the rise Please pay attention to fraud and malicious commercial law which uses virtual currency or piggyback on the introduction of virtual currency exchange industry \xe3\x80\x90Important matter explanation\xe3\x80\x91 We will read the following contents fully understand our services and after accepting without objection to these we shall conduct transactions at customer\ s judgment and responsibility The tokens handled by us are not virtual currency Japanese currency or foreign currency Token handled by our company is not guaranteed its value by a specific person \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x91\xef\xbc\x89Value fluctuation risk The handling token is not a statutory currency such as Japanese currency or foreign currency nor is it based on legal currency The value of bit coins etc is fluctuating from hour to hour every day The value of the handling token depends on other market trends such as prices currencies securities markets natural disaster lands war political change alliance departure regulation strengthening dissemination of other similar virtual currencies other future unexpected events It may be affected by special events etc Therefore the value of handled tokens possessed by customers may fluctuate rapidly and fall Also please be aware that the value of handling token may fall below purchase consideration there is a possibility of becoming zero 16 PAG E \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x92\xef\xbc\x89Characteristics of virtual currency system risk A handling token is a property value recorded by electronic means and it is relocated through the Internet In addition transactions you do are transactions that use electronic trading systems In the event that the electronic trading system suffers a cyber attack if the information such as the customer\ s ID / password used for electronic authentication leaks due to theft or eavesdropping etc and the third party misuses that information etc the disappearance of the handling token Or a decrease in value resulting in a loss to customers If you fail to enter an order there is a possibility that the intended order does not promise or an unintended order promises The possibility of situations where the electronic trading system can not be used temporarily or for a certain period due to various reasons such as malfunction of our company or customer\ s own communication / system equipment or communication trouble or a delay to customer\ s order instruction to our system \xc2\xb7 Orders may be invalid due to non arrival Also in the event of a failure of the electronic trading system the customer\ s business execution may be canceled A system failure may occur due to changes in the external environment etc and there is a risk that customer transactions will be hindered System failure is an obvious problem in the system for providing our service (It does not include failure of line and customer\ s PC etc ) is judged and we will not be able to order customers via the Internet (our website smartphone site \xc2\xb7 application) Or your order has been delayed or disabled Emergency maintenance of the system \xc2\xb7 Opportunity loss due to system failure etc (Example Customers orders can not be ordered mismatched opportunities for customers to order missed profits that would otherwise be obtained etc) We can not identify the content of the order you ordered (original order) so we can not perform error correction processing Purchasing / selling price of token bit coin etc calculated by the system may be abnormal value We may cancel the transaction on judgment of our company if we find that transaction is established with abnormal value \x0cL EG AL ST AT EM ENT Legal notation \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x93\xef\xbc\x89Liquidity risk Depending on market trends and volume of trading volume trading of handling tokens becomes impossible or difficult or it may be forced to trade at a significantly disadvantageous price \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x94\xef\xbc\x89Risk with no settlement completeness There is a risk that transactions will be invalidated retroactively because handled tokens do not have a mechanism that it can be said that transactions have been established definitively \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x95\xef\xbc\x89Branch risk by hard fork Depending on the handling token there are risks that the tokens are branched to two or more by a hard fork and mutual compatibility disappears In that case there is a risk that significant value declines and transactions will be invalidated retroactively \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x96\xef\xbc\x89Attack risk Depending on the handling token if a malicious person other than our company has a majority of the total number of issued tokens there is a risk that illegal transactions will be carried out \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x97\xef\xbc\x89Risks related to business hours fees etc Handled tokens may fluctuate greatly outside our business hours (including during the maintenance period) We can not take any responsibility even if it is impossible to trade tokens bit coins etc outside business hours \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x98\xef\xbc\x89Risk of failure Our business continues due to changes in the external environment (including strengthening of legal regulations on handled virtual currency) deterioration of our financial condition failure of outsourcing parties etc to provide our system and other necessary services It may not be possible In the event that the Company can not continue its business procedures will be taken in accordance with applicable laws such as bankruptcy law civil rehabilitation law corporate reorganization law corporate law etc including measures for customer\ s assets We may receive deposits of handled tokens from customers but we manage the assets you keep from customers separately from their own assets However when our company fails it will be impossible for us to return the property of the customer which may result in a loss to the customer \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x99\xef\xbc\x89Legislative \xc2\xb7 Tax system change risk Today the law and tax system concerning handled virtual currency applied to people involved in handling virtual currency transactions is fluctuating In the future handling tokens handled virtual currency transactions will be banned restrictions or taxation will be strengthened due to changes in laws regulations tax system or policies etc possession of handling tokens and transactions will be restricted or handling that is more disadvantageous than the present situation There is a possibility In this case unexpected loss may occur to the customer \xef\xbc\x88\xef\xbc\x91\xef\xbc\x90\xef\xbc\x89How to check the order status of tokens You can check the status of the token on the screen of
