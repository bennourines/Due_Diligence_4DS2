encryption (cryptography) to generate tokens and to verify transactions Transactions are added to a public ledger \xe2\x80\x93 also called a Transaction Block Chain \xe2\x80\x93 and new coins are created through a process known as mining As of 2017 cryptocurrency has been used as a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies (which are usually backed by some central government) such as the US dollar (USD) For the average person using cryptocurrency is as easy as \xe2\x80\xa2 Get a digital wallet to store the currency \xe2\x80\xa2 Use the wallet to create unique \xe2\x80\x9cpublic addresses\xe2\x80\x9d to receive currency \xe2\x80\xa2 Transfer funds in or out of your wallet using public addresses What is a cryptocurrency address A public address is a unique string of characters used to receive cryptocurrency Each public address has a matching private address that can be used to prove ownership of the public address With Bitcoin the address is called a Bitcoin address Think of it like a unique email address that people can send currency to as opposed to emails The first decentralized digital cryptocurrency can be traced back to \xe2\x80\x9cBit Gold\xe2\x80\x9d which was worked on by Nick Szabo between 1998 and 2005 Bit gold is considered the first precursor to bitcoin In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto (an anonymous person and/or group) released a paper detailing what would become Bitcoin Bitcoin became the first decentralized digital coin when it was created in 2008 It then went public in 2009 As of 2015 Bitcoin is the most commonly known cryptocurrency Given the popularity of Bitcoin as well as its history the term \xe2\x80\x9caltcoin\xe2\x80\x9d is sometimes used to describe alternative cryptocurrencies to bitcoin As of mid 2017 there were over 800 different types of cryptocurrencies \xe2\x80\x93 or altcoins \xe2\x80\x93 for trade in online markets and about 10 of them have market capitalizations of more than $1 Billion USD At the time of writing this the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has eclipsed $70 billion bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 3 \x0cIn other words cryptocurrency isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a fad it is likely a growing market that (despite its pros and cons) is likely here for the long haul Cryptocurrency Basics Public Ledgers All confirmed transactions from the start of a cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s creation are stored in a public ledger The identities of the coin owners are encrypted and the system uses other cryptographic techniques to ensure the legitimacy of record keeping The ledger ensures that corresponding \xe2\x80\x9cdigital wallets\xe2\x80\x9d can calculate an accurate spendable balance Also new transactions can be checked to ensure that each transaction uses only coins currently owned by the spender Bitcoin calls this public ledger a \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction block chain\xe2\x80\x9c Transactions A transfer of funds between two digital wallets is called a transaction That transaction gets submitted to a public ledger and awaits confirmation When a transaction is made wallets use an encrypted electronic signature (an encrypted piece of data called a cryptographic signature) to provide a mathematical proof that the transaction is coming from the owner of the wallet The confirmation process takes a bit of time (ten minutes for bitcoin) while \xe2\x80\x9cminers\xe2\x80\x9d mine (ie confirm transactions and add them to the public ledger) Mining In simple terms mining is the process of confirming transactions and adding them to a public ledger In order to add a transaction to the ledger the \xe2\x80\x9cminer\xe2\x80\x9d must solve an increasingly complex computational problem (sort of like a mathematical puzzle) Mining is open source so anyone can confirm the transaction The first \xe2\x80\x9cminer\xe2\x80\x9d to solve the puzzle adds a \xe2\x80\x9cblock\xe2\x80\x9d of transactions to the ledger The way in which transactions blocks and the public blockchain ledger work together ensures that no one individual can easily add or change a block at will Once a block is added to the ledger all correlating transactions are permanent and a small transaction fee is added to the miner\xe2\x80\x99s wallet (along with newly created coins) The mining process is what gives value to the coins and is known as a proofof work system Although there can be exceptions to the rule there are a number of factors (beyond the basics above) that make cryptocurrency so different from the financial systems of the past bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 4 \x0cAdaptive Scaling Adaptive scaling essentially means that cryptocurrencies are built with a number of measures to ensure that they will work well in both large or small scales Adaptive Scaling Example Bitcoin is programmed to allow for one transaction block to be mined every ten minutes The algorithm adjusts after every 2016 blocks (theoretically that\xe2\x80\x99s every two weeks) to get easier or harder based on how long it actually took for those 2016 blocks to be mined So if it only took 13 days for the network to mine 2016 blocks that means it\xe2\x80\x99s too easy to mine so the difficulty increases However if it takes 15 days for the network to mine 2016 blocks that shows that it\xe2\x80\x99s too hard to mind so the difficulty decreases A number of other measures are included in digital coins to allow for adaptive scaling including limiting the supply overtime (to create scarcity) and reducing the reward for mining as more total coins are mined Cryptographic Cryptocurrency uses a system of cryptography (AKA encryption) to control the creation of coins and to verify transactions Decentralized Most fiat currencies in circulation are controlled by a centralized government and thus their creation can be regulated by a third party Cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s creation and transactions are open source controlled by code and rely on \xe2\x80\x9cpeer to peer\xe2\x80\x9d networks There is no single entity that can affect the currency Digital Traditional currency is defined by a physical object (USD representing gold for example) but cryptocurrency is all digital Digital coins are stored in digital wallets and transferred digitally to other peoples\xe2\x80\x99 digital wallets No physical object ever exists Open Source Cryptocurrencies are typically open source That means that developers can create APIs without paying a fee and anyone can use or join the network Proof of work Most cryptocurrencies use a proof of work system A proof of work scheme uses a hard to compute but easy to verify computational puzzle to limit exploitation of cryptocurrency mining Essentially it\xe2\x80\x99s like a really hard to solve \xe2\x80\x9ccatpcha\xe2\x80\x9d that requires lots of computing power bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 5 \x0cPseudonymity Owners of cryptocurrency keep their digital coins in an encrypted digital wallet A coin holder\xe2\x80\x99s identification is stored in an encrypted address that they have control over \xe2\x80\x93 it is not attached to a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity The connection between you and your coins is pseudonymous rather than anonymous as ledgers are open to the public (and thus the ledgers could be used to glean information about groups of individuals in the network) Value For something to be an effective currency it has to have value The US dollar used to represent actual gold The gold was scarce and required work to mine and refine so the scarcity and work gave the gold value This in turn gave the US dollar value Cryptocurrency works with a similar concept In cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\x9ccoins\xe2\x80\x9d (which are nothing more than publicly agreed on records of ownership) are generated or produced by \xe2\x80\x9cminers\xe2\x80\x9d These miners are people who run programs on specialized hardware made specifically to solve proof of work puzzles The work behind mining coins gives them value while scarcity of coins and demand thereof causes their value to fluctuate The idea of work giving value to currency is called a \xe2\x80\x9cproof of work\xe2\x80\x9d system The other method for validating coins is called proof ofstake Value is also created when transactions are added to public ledgers as creating a verified \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction block\xe2\x80\x9d takes work as well PLAN AND PURPOSE FOR bitqy The plan and purpose for launching our own cryptocurrency centered on our desire to reward our company\xe2\x80\x99s value creators the people who take action and participate in specific activities that bring value to the company With the growth and excitement behind cryptocurrency we envisioned the \xe2\x80\x9creward\xe2\x80\x9d to be an exciting incentive for the value creators in the company As part of the reward process we also set up our own trading platform to give all people the ability to easily and quickly set up an account and trade bitqy for bitcoin (and vise versa) in the open market A strong component of the bitqy ownership experience is the smart contract tying bitqyck Inc stock to the bitqy token Every bitqy token is \xe2\x80\x9cembedded\xe2\x80\x9d with 1/10 bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 6 \x0cshare of one (1) bitqyck Inc common stock thereby giving bitqy holders actual ownership of bitqyck Inc as outlined in the bitqy Constitution THE bitqy COIN CONSTITUTION bitqy the in app token for bitqyck bitqy is a cryptocurrency token for the marketplace platform bitqyck and the general market as it is accepted by businesses and consumers globally bitqy will be allocated by the directors of bitqyck Inc Once allocated bitqyck relinquishes control of the allocated bitqy The latest and most up to date legal disclosures can always be found on bitqy org Additionally bitqyck Inc a Texas corporation certifies \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 that it has authorized the minting of ten billion digital tokens known as \xe2\x80\x9cbitqy tokens\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbitqy coins \xe2\x80\x9d created on the Ethereum Blockchain App Platform and further certifies that through its directors and founders has duly authorized one billion shares of common stock as the only class of ownership shares in the Corporation and further certifies that the bitqy tokens are only created by the smart contract that these certifications are enumerated within and further certifies that the holder of a bitqy token is also the holder of one tenth of a share of bitqyck Inc common stock and further certifies that the holder of this coin shall enjoy the rights and benefits as a shareholder of bitqyck Inc as provided by the directors of bitqyck Inc and ONLY IF the bitqy holder has his/her bitqy tokens in the official bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 7 \x0cbitqy wallet operated and maintained by bitqyck Inc and further certifies \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 pursuant to the terms and conditions that the directors and founders attach to the bitqy token and further certifies that this bitqy token is freely transferable by the holder hereof in any manner which said holder deems appropriate and reasonable The holder of this bitqy token certifies that he or she has ownership and possession pursuant to a legal transaction or transfer from the prior holder ETHEREUM bitqyck Inc decided early on to build bitqy upon the Ethereum Blockchain We chose Ethereum to take full advantage of their smart Bitqy is an ERC 20 Token contract technology To help our partners and readers established on the understand why we chose Ethereum and how smart contracts work we provide a beginner\xe2\x80\x99s guide to Ethereum Blockchain Ethereum with some valuable information as written by blockgeeks Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime censorship fraud or third party interference These apps run on a custom built Blockchain an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property This enables developers to create markets store registries of debts or promises move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet all without a middle man or counterparty risk Ethereum gives partners the ability to create and manage their own tokens (crypto coin) on their Blockchain The benefit of this is the ability to utilize their Blockchain scalability as well as their smart contract functionality bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 8 \x0cTo a beginner the entire concept of Ethereum and Ethereum tokens can get very confusing very fast The idea that Ethereum not only has its own currency (Ether) but also has tokens on top of that which can act as currency themselves can be a little mind boggling Before we even begin understanding what Ethereum tokens are all about it\xe2\x80\x99s important to grasp some basic concepts The entire Ethereum network is a giant mass of nodes (computers) connected to one another In fact the entire network can be visualized as a single entity called the \xe2\x80\x9cEthereum Virtual Machine\xe2\x80\x9d or EVM for short All the transactions that have happened and will ever happen in this network are automatically updated and recorded in an open and distributed ledger Smart contracts are how things get done in the Ethereum ecosystem When someone wants to get a particular task done in Ethereum they initiate a smart contract with one or more people Smart contracts are a series of instructions written using the programming language \xe2\x80\x9csolidity\xe2\x80\x9d which work on the basis of bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 9 \x0cthe IFTTT logic aka the IF THIS THEN THAT logic Basically if the first set of instructions are done then execute the next function and after that the next and keep on repeating until you reach the end of the contract The best way to understand that is by imagining a vending machine Each and every step that you take acts like a trigger for the next step to execute itself It is kind of like the domino effect So let\xe2\x80\x99s examine the steps that you will take while interacting with the vending machine Step 1 You give the vending machine some money Step 2 You punch in the button corresponding to the item that you want Step 3 The item comes out and you collect it Now look at all those steps and think about it Will any of the steps work if the previous one wasn\xe2\x80\x99t executed Each and every one of those steps is directly related to the previous step There is one more factor to think about and it is an integral part of smart contracts You see in your entire interaction with the vending machine you (the requestor) were solely working with the machine (the provider) There were absolutely no third parties involved So now how would this transaction have looked like if it happened in the Ethereum network Suppose you just bought something from a vending machine in the Ethereum network how will the steps look like then Step 1 You give the vending machine some money and this gets recorded by all the nodes in the Ethereum network and the transaction gets updated in the ledger Step 2 You punch in the button corresponding to the item that you want and record of that gets updated in the Ethereum network and ledger Step 3 The item comes out and you collect it and this gets recorded by all the nodes and the ledger Every transaction that you do through the smart contracts will get recorded and updated by the network What this does is that it keeps everyone involved with the contract accountable for his or her actions It takes away human malice by making every action taken visible to the entire network But having said that what mainly incentivizes these people to fulfill their end of the bargain anyway What are they getting by helping out the requestors This is where Ether comes in bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 10 \x0cEther Every single step in a smart contract is a transaction or a complex computation and would have a cost that is measured in \xe2\x80\x9cgas\xe2\x80\x9d The price of this gas is paid by the requester in \xe2\x80\x9cEther\xe2\x80\x9d Ether is the currency with which everything runs in the Ethereum When people talk about ETH and ETC they are actually talking about the value of the Ether in their respective blockchain bitqy REWARDS As discussed earlier in this whitepaper bitqyck Inc has a bitqy rewards program Bitqyck stakeholders (affiliates merchants consumers etc ) are rewarded in bitqy for specific actions and activities throughout the bitqyck network of companies For example a purchase of a product through bitqyck would allow for the company to reward the participants in bitqy thereby making the purchase more valuable to the participant In addition bitqyck runs promotions and incentives that enable users to earn additional bitqy by following the rules of the promotion qyckwallet Bitqyck Inc has launched it\xe2\x80\x99s own custom wallet named qyckwallet\xe2\x84\xa2 Qyckwallet is important for several reasons First of all it is the most secure way for someone to hold and manage their bitqy because it has specifically been designed for bitqy Secondly the only way to take advantage of qyckwallet is a centralized wallet architecture \xe2\x80\x93 the smart contract that relates to stock a conscious decision from the coin architects to ownership in bitqyck Inc by holding bitqy is ensure compliance around corporate by keeping the bitqy in qyckwallet Due to ownership within United States\xe2\x80\x99 jurisdiction the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency Again since bitqy is an ERC 20 Token holding bitqy in qyckwallet is not a requirement unless users that have an active qyckwallet can tie participating in corporate governance events their qyckwallet account to a registered see Coin Constitution for more info bitqyck affiliate account and therefore have an identity that is necessary to associate with equity ownership Other wallets do not have that feature and therefore are perfectly anonymous bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 11 \x0ctradebq tradebq is bitqyck\xe2\x80\x99s custom bitqy open marketplace trading platform Through tradebq users can monitor current prices as well as the top bids and asking prices for bitqy and a report of the most recent trades Bitqy can be purchased through tradebq with Bitcoin It takes less than a minute to create a free account on tradebq com The decision to create tradebq immediately upon launch was to give early bitqy holders liquidity while we waited for listing on public exchanges No fees are charged for trades on tradebq Bitqyck bears the cost of gas for trades through the tradebq system MINING AND SECURITY The security of the bitqy token is guaranteed by the security of the underlying Ethereum Blockchain which at the time of this writing is Proof of Work Bitqyck Inc has applied the ideology of Proof of Work to the disbursement of bitqy tokens to future bitqy token holders The designation of Proof of Work comes from mining or from rewards for specific actions COMPLIANCE bitqyck Inc has taken numerous precautions to maintain complete compliance across its cryptocurrency operations It is especially important due to the smart contract stock connection that comes with the ownership of bitqy As such bitqyck has established direct working relationships with corporate governance and compliance professionals as well as business and securities attorneys bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 12 \x0cTHE FUTURE OF bitqy It is the intent and goal of bitqyck to distribute all of the allocated bitqy At that point we believe that bitqy will be a viable global currency As bitqyck matures and the verticals business industries grow the company plan has always been to allow consumer to use bitqy and merchants to accept bitqy in exchange for products and services This type of co dependent relationship will ensure growth and success of the bitqy marketplace as well as success for the consumers and merchants that transact business with bitqy It is our vision that the \xe2\x80\x9cFirstmovers\xe2\x80\x9d in bitqyck will be rewarded greatly by their ownership of bitqy as we move into the future bitqy\xe2\x84\xa2 | The official cryptocurrency of bitqyck Inc | Page 13 \x0c
