opportunities We aim to build the ProBit platform that will guide this new technology into the future starting with a new innovative cryptocurrency exchange VISION \xe2\x80\x93 HOW PROBIT WILL BE

very fast and reliable which will give its users a solid advantage in the market SECURITY FEATURES Security is a highest priority for the ProBit platform While cryptocurrencies present a huge

professional traders and at the same time will be very convenient and easy for every user including beginners A key software feature that the ProBit platform will introduce is a modular dashboard that will be able to support full customization We feel that many exchanges that exist today have the same layout with the same constantly blinking of information With a customizable layout on the platform the dashboard can be built to the preference of each trader with only the most relevant and prevalent information for the trader Under the fully customized interface any type of investors will be allowed to quickly place orders on a powerful system Screenshot of a the ProBit Exchange trading dashboard with different layouts and themes ProBit trading system will support various professional

FEES MAKER 0 050% If the trading fee is paid in PROB a discount of up to 50% applies to the fee rate (i e 0 050% for taker and 0 025% for maker) The discounts for ProBit will be detailed under ProBit token section Charging a very low fee to makers (i e base rate of 0 050%) is our commitment to creating abundant liquidity by giving advantages to market making We believe this pricing as well as mining of PROB will encourage liquidity in exchange and provide benefits for makers Other revenue streams include listing fees if we decide to charge withdrawal fees and other fees associated with the planned implementation of margin trading and other products 8 \x0c02 PR O B I T TO K E N (PROB) PROB is a utility token at ProBit The main usage of PROB is to pay for fees on the ProBit exchange

multiple levels of \xe2\x80\x9cPremium\xe2\x80\x9d users depending on the PROB holding by users The service will provide enhanced benefits for those \xe2\x80\x9cPremium\xe2\x80\x9d users that hold the required PROB balance The membership level will be adjusted on a daily basis Premium users will qualify for enhanced fee discounts and referral bonus listing voting rights and priority access to new

to and at launch 50% 100 000 000 Trade Mining 20% 40 000 000 ProBit Team 20% 40 000 000 Strategic Reserves Subject to 5 year vesting period The sale of 20 000 000 PROB will occur in several planned rounds prior to and at launch via Private Sale Pre Sale and IEO The Private Sale will occur prior to the launch and will be available only to selected investors The Pre Sale will be the first chance any user can get PROB To participate in the Pre Sale users will need to have registered for an account at ProBit The pricing and further details of the PROB PreSale will be announced at a later date Any unsold tokens from Private Sale and PreSale will be sold via IEO upon the launch of the ProBit Exchange Trade Mining will also begin upon the launch of ProBit Exchange 40 000 000 PROB allocated for strategic reserves will be issued only if a plan to issue and use PROB for the benefit of existing PROB holders as a whole and ProBit Exchange is announced for one (1) month or longer period after which a resolution is passed among PROB holders or appointees elected by PROB holders (e g supernodes) Currently there is no plan to issue TRADE MINING After the launch of ProBit exchange PROB will enter the Trade Mining period During this period for qualified transactions at ProBit PROB worth 80% of the trading fee based on the market price of the PROB will be mined and issued to the trader as a reward Any instance in which the trading fee is paid by PROB will not qualify for trade mining but trading fee discount applies instead as explained in Section 2 4 below The simplified example below showcases how the Trade Mining will operate 10 \x0cT AKERS MAKERS Example Example Trade 1000 0 BTC Trade 1000 0 BTC Discount n/a Discount n/a Trading Fee 1 0 BTC Trading Fee 0 5 BTC PROB Mined PROBs

participate in ProBit ProBit can change the conditions for referral bonus which will be disclosed properly on www ProBit com 11 \x0cWe have determined that the fee discount and bonus structure together with trade mining described above are the most effective strategies to provide long term sustainability of the platform and continual benefits to the users and token holders As we develop and receive feedback we will continue to adjust the model to best fit market conditions RATIONALE Utilizing this approach for the token issuance and benefit PROB will be available to early adopters via the pre launch sales and users who actively participate in trading on the exchange via trade mining We believe that utilizing this model will generate interest and ensure long term value of PROB for the exchange and its users Unlike other exchanges that implemented a mining model to their exchange token ProBit\xe2\x80\x99s utilization of trade mining is meant to encourage active trading on the platform while providing users benefits in being early participants in the platform With the utility characteristics of the PROB and differentiated structure of trade mining we believe we have minimized incentives for malicious trading behavior that have plagued others exchanges utilizing the mining model PROB VESTING PLAN PROB held by investors in the Private Sale and the team are subject to vesting periods PROB held by users in the Pre Sale and Trade Mining periods are not subject to lock up or vesting period The details on the vesting period for Private Sale investors will be subject

I S K S Regulation in the cryptocurrency space is an ongoing debate for governments around the world As the market for cryptocurrency exchanges has developed there has been increased scrutiny on the business practices and security of exchanges During the development of the ProBit platform we have seen governments install new regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges that have either halted or shut down operations in those countries It is our belief that more regulatory measures will be proposed and debated that will define the future of cryptocurrencies We hope to work with governments around the world to help define and implement regulations that will help ensure security for investors and promote the growth of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem Despite our best efforts ProBit\xe2\x80\x99s entry as a cryptocurrency exchange comes with a fair share of risks that can interrupt or even terminate operations as a platform These risks can include deliberate actions such as DDOS attacks phishing and stricter than anticipated regulatory requirements To mitigate risks to the platform we are continually staying abreast of the news and participate in discussions on the path forward for cryptocurrencies The platform will implement security features outlined below at launch and in future development KYC AND AML The ProBit platform aims to meet the standards of KYC and AML in the markets it operates to ensure client due diligence monitor and report suspicious transactions and prevent funding of illegal and terrorist enterprises ProBit will launch a system with varying levels of verification that will open access of actions on the exchange depending on the amount of verified data ProBit receives on the account 14 \x0c04 TEAM HYUNSU DO CEO & Co founder STEVE WOO CTO
