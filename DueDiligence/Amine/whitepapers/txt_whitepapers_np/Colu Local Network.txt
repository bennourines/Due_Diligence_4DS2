lives With the speed of adoption increasing technical barriers are being lowered and we find our physical and digital lives beginning to integrate creating a huge impact especially on millennials They are the first digital native generation to be born into this world and the largest generation in history\xe2\x80\x94significantly larger than the baby boomer generation and are expected to be in control of 24 trillion dollars of the world s wealth by 2020 They are more likely to live in cities they own fewer cars and they choose their brands based on values like ethical sourcing social justice and environmental effects They are looking for meaning and often find it in making a positive impact on the community around them thus creating a demand for financial community ties Technology is dramatically changing the way millennials make payments and consume other financial services As physical cash is being replaced by digital means from cards to mobile they come to expect payments to be quick safe cool to use and available 24/7 This creates pressure on merchants to broaden the means of payments they accept in an effort to catch up with user demand This pressure is especially burdensome for smaller merchants in today\xe2\x80\x99s environment as they often pay the highest fees for payment processing making for an uneven playing field for local initiatives Moreover as a consequence of accelerating globalization the diminishing frictions in cross border commerce have incentivized corporate rent extraction through cost externalization and the outsourcing of production Encouraged by the continuation of open policies on multilateral trade global supply chains have penetrated domestic markets resulting in the incremental centralization of capital flows toward multinational organizations \xe2\x80\x8b[1] \xe2\x80\x8b While the free movement of goods is imperative to open markets SMEs (small to medium size enterprises) get the short end of the stick being unable to compete in their native markets In particular small businesses with less than 10 employees make up over 93 percent of all enterprises in the EU and account for around two thirds of employment \xe2\x80\x8b[2] \xe2\x80\x8bIn the US small businesses account for 99 7 percent of firms with paid employees and annually contribute almost 40 percent of US private non farm output \xe2\x80\x8b[3]\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bYet these small businesses often face difficulties accessing capital \x0c3 A comparison study published by the OECD shows that the share of SME loans in total business loans in 2014 was 22 5% in the UK 21 2% in the US and France and 14 2% in Canada \xe2\x80\x8b[4] Community financial service providers typically provide services to SMEs and consumers based on \xe2\x80\x9crelationship banking\xe2\x80\x9d however they encounter tough competition from large national and multinational financial institutions Credit unions and community banks play an important role in the US by lending to small businesses and providing access to payments services for a large percentage of the population However their share in total deposits and loans has been decreasing significantly over the years \xe2\x80\x8b[5]\xe2\x80\x8b Credit unions are typically another type of community financial service provider A study in Canada shows that they retain a higher share of net income to support future growth and investment in creating jobs that they provide loans through periods where availability of credit is low and that they lead in SME business lending The idea of a community currency as a secondary medium of exchange store of value and unit of account has also been around for a while \xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bCommunity currencies have attracted attention from academics and policy makers alike due to their unique ability to produce and retain wealth within communities \xe2\x80\x8b[6] \xe2\x80\x8bThese currencies have the potential to increase overall profitability for local stakeholders and to facilitate countercyclical growth cycles and increased social welfare \xe2\x80\x8b[7] \xe2\x80\x8bSeveral projects have attempted to establish local payment systems however due to lack of sufficient infrastructure these initiatives have failed to provide a secure liquid and scalable environment for financial transactions \xe2\x80\x8b[8] Technological advancements notably the emergence of blockchain technology lower the barriers to offering payment processing solutions and establishing local payments systems While the macroeconomic consequences of issuing digital peer to peer currencies remain hypothetical regulators are exploring opportunities in distributed financial solutions \xe2\x80\x8b[9] \xe2\x80\x8bAs the notion of digital currency manifests itself in private and regulatory institutions the efficiency resilience and accessibility of disintermediated digital payment infrastructure is gaining momentum with a broader audience The CLN is looking to build an ecosystem that will combine the two changes discussed above\xe2\x80\x94technological and social\xe2\x80\x94by creating a network that supports the evolution of local payment systems each of which provides incentives to its local stakeholders while sharing tools and services provided over the entire network \x0c4 A fresh approach to community \xe2\x80\x9cbanking\xe2\x80\x9d using blockchain technology where transactions are verified P2P and intermediaries are removed shows the promising potential to generate value by increasing competition on the price quality and variety of services relative to existing means of payment and other relevant services Colu is firmly rooted in the open source blockchain developer community as a leading member of the\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bColoredCoins\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bpr\xe2\x80\x8b oject and is investing additional resources in open source code with the latest release of\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bBankbox\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8b This commitment is also reflected in the initial release of the Colu Local Wallet \x0c5 2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CLN NETWORK AND PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE The current state of payment systems globally even in well developed markets such as the UK and the US is such that the gap between end user needs both of consumers and of businesses and what is being delivered by the current payments infrastructure is growing and creating significant detriment for users who are demanding greater control greater assurance enhanced data and reduced financial crime \xe2\x80\x8b[10]\xe2\x80\x8b A recent report by the Payments Strategy Forum in the UK identifies key requirements that current legacy systems and the entire payment infrastructure must meet \xe2\x80\x8b[11] \xe2\x97\x8f The ability to respond to current and future end user needs \xe2\x97\x8f Improving trust in the safety and certainty of payments \xe2\x97\x8f Simplifying access to data and to systems in order to promote competition \xe2\x97\x8f A new architecture for the payment ecosystem In thinking of a new architecture for the payment ecosystem one that can support us in achieving the desired goals given today\xe2\x80\x99s technologies a recent dedicated report (the \xe2\x80\x9cNPA Report\xe2\x80\x9d) details a proposed conceptual framework \xe2\x80\x8b[12]\xe2\x80\x8b The guidelines listed in the NPA report include \xe2\x97\x8f A single set of standards and rules with strong central governance \xe2\x97\x8f End to end interoperability (including Application Programming Interfaces and common messaging standards) \xe2\x97\x8f A collaborative infrastructure allowing multiple providers of overlay services to compete in the market simultaneously \xe2\x97\x8f The need to ensure our payment systems are secure and resilient with financial stability as a key foundation Somewhat surprisingly both regulators and traditional financial players on the one hand and disruptive innovators in the blockchain arena on the other agree on most of the above guidelines with the notable exception of the form of governance \x0c6 The blockchain space is currently experimenting with different methods of community governance but it is already clear that this technology offers new capabilities that are not possible in the financial system when it comes to transparency and the ability to coordinate a large group of organizations around an open and secure protocol The proposed CLN network implements an infrastructure that will facilitate the evolution of an ecosystem that adheres to many of the above principles \xe2\x97\x8f The choice to develop the CLN as an open source project\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bon a public blockchain implies there is a transparent set of standards and rules that ensures interoperability \xe2\x97\x8f Moreover the existence of a vibrant fast growing community of developers facilitates the emergence of overlay services offered by third parties that will compete on the network This is evident by the Ethereum transaction volume which has already surpassed Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s transaction volume by allowing new functionality that has attracted thousands of companies to develop on top of it \xe2\x97\x8f A new network evolving over the blockchain is more prone to being dynamic and adaptive to future end consumer needs than would be any result of a mere transformation of an old network built as it is on the foundation of legacy systems owned and operated by traditional players \xe2\x97\x8f The ability to bypass the network or fork it and make changes where it is proving to be inefficient or failing to create value for end consumers provides ongoing healthy competitive pressure on the network Such competitive pressure is often missing in many other proprietary payment schemes owned and operated by banks and credit card companies 2 1 THE BUSINESS MODEL AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CLN NETWORK The key business goals that the CLN network is designed to support are \xe2\x97\x8f Providing economic incentives that will facilitate the development and provision of new services to the network \xe2\x97\x8f Providing services in an accessible manner which will support broad adoption of the technology (\xe2\x80\x9cbringing the use of crypto currencies to the masses\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x97\x8f Using economic incentives as a growth engine by facilitating the introduction of community currencies [See Chapter 3 for details] The importance of designing the network in such a way that it will organically provide adequate incentives to the various participants in order to facilitate broad adoption is also reflected in a recent report by the US Faster Payments Task Force concerning the design \x0c7 of a faster payments system in the US \xe2\x80\x8b[13]\xe2\x80\x8b The report discusses the need to provide incentives to consumers and merchants to encourage them to learn access and use the system and to provide solution operators and service providers with incentives to develop and deliver solutions and participate in an ecosystem that enables interoperability among competing solutions Moreover the report acknowledges the importance of enabling financial service providers of all sizes to participate and deliver solutions \xe2\x80\x9cby fostering competitive fairness continued innovation and flexibility to take advantage of emerging technologies \xe2\x80\x9d Therefore the network should be structured to provide incentives to entities providing those financial services that address everyday needs entities often referred to as gateways The CLN network proposes a framework via which to provide incentives using blockchain technology Next we discuss the multiple stakeholders that could participate in the CLN network and the fundamental role they each play in establishing developing for and maintaining the network on the one hand and in using the services provided on the other The incentives to the various players would be provided through the circulation of the network\xe2\x80\x99s native token (CLN) and community currencies in the form of rewards or fees \x0c8 Role Description Financial A financial gateway accepts fiat or crypto deposits from users and acts as a Gateways custodian for user funds flowing in and out of the network A gateway can be any institution including financial institution as long as it provides services that accompany the custody of consumers funds such as KYC and other regulatory requirements Gateways act as entry and exit points for fiat currencies They are in a position to play a vital role in the network by providing transaction verification and settlement across the network without a central operator and without reliance on a single gateway Gateways are compensated for their services in CLN fees Community A community currency issuer uses the tools provided by the CLN network to Currency issue a community currency for its community and provide liquidity for it This Issuers role can be taken by merchant networks local businesses consumer clubs and other entities that have a community of users for which they wish to facilitate consumption payments lending crowdfunding or credit Developers and Developers and service providers will build tools and services on top of the Service CLN network enhancing its capabilities The network will support partnerships Providers with products or other networks that complement the CLN network\xe2\x80\x99s services such as credit providers credit scoring service providers or integrators to legacy networks Merchants Local merchants accept fiat payments for the services they provide Merchants are rewarded in their community currency for transactions that take place at their point of sale End users Consumers pay at merchants\xe2\x80\x99 point of sale with digital fiat currency They are rewarded in their community currency for pursuing this economic activity on the network \x0c9 2 2 NETWORK CAPABILITIES FOR ISSUERS AND GATEWAYS Issuers are entities that issue cryptocurrencies and provide them with liquidity This role can be taken by merchant networks local businesses consumer clubs and other entities that have a community of users for which they wish to facilitate consumption payments lending crowdfunding or credit Issuers are at the heart of the network and they are also in a position to act as gateways although it is not mandatory The network will launch with two key functionalities for issuers\xe2\x80\x94the ability to issue community currencies using a template that is easy for developers to use and to provide a smooth exchange between community currencies as well as ERC 20 tokens via the CLN token Both functionalities will be implemented using a set of smart contracts \xe2\x86\x92The issuer tools are discussed in detail in Section 3 2 3 PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE OF THE CLN NETWORK A successful token is one with a distribution pattern that creates a system of incentives that support the business goals set for the token For the CLN it is creating a token that provides access to a network of local payments The CLN token allows financial gateways developers and service providers to make payments exchange between currencies and provide additional services that address local communities\xe2\x80\x99 needs thus providing an alternative to traditional financial institutions Moreover the goal of community currencies is to be a store of value for local communities connecting consumers and businesses In the previous section we discussed the network capabilities for issuers and gateways We refer to these capabilities as the issuer layer Next we discuss how the proposed architecture enables two layers of services that facilitate various stages in the payment process to be developed on top of the issuer layer \x0c10 2 3 1 Products and services layer Products and services developed by anyone in the community could be integrated to the network as the network is an open source public blockchain The development of payment processing capabilities will provide merchants with an easy bundled API/SDK to collect payments made using all types of payment means including POS or e commerce Payment processing services will also support innovation in advanced payment types\xe2\x80\x94for example the introduction of recurring payments or of decentralized fiat exchange between gateways Merchant services will handle merchant related operations such as the generation of invoices or fund withdrawals to the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s bank account Any operation using SDK tools will pay the applicable gateway or service provider a fee in CLN \x0c11 The goal of using community currencies as rewards to facilitate payments in fiat between consumers and merchants is enabled by the network architecture which allows for the development of the capability to issue crypto fiat pegged to the corresponding fiat money by gateways holding fiat deposits \xe2\x80\x8b[14] 2 3 2 Clients Layer The clients layer interfaces with end users\xe2\x80\x94consumers and merchants Tokens issued on the CLN network will be compatible with any Ethereum wallet A key requirement of this layer is that it is independent of the CLN network The CLN network will incentivize many potential players to build clients on top of the CLN and it will be attractive thanks to the capabilities it will provide for processing fiat payments and cryptocurrencies The freedom of clients to bypass the CLN network in order to process payments will drive the CLN network to focus on providing value added services that reduce the technical barriers and increase usability of payments on the blockchain \x0c12 3 THE ROLE AND DESIGN OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES The CLN network lowers the barriers that stakeholders are facing when attempting to launch and maintain a new financial system in their community by providing them with tools and services that make it easier to launch a new digital payment infrastructure and design the growth engines that will make it flourish Community currencies that could be issued on the CLN network may be used to offer incentives to end users in the community (consumers and merchants) as well as developers and service providers Thus community currencies could support an organic reward scheme for transactions being made within the community The community currency will be issued by community gateways with a transparent supply schedule and distribution rules The community currency will serve as an alternative medium of exchange and store of value allowing users to transact with it freely with any Ethereum compatible wallet In order to create a mechanism that allows this functionality the CLN network will provide two main network tools Issuance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8bCommunity currencies will be issued as ERC 20 tokens on Ethereum leveraging Ethereum smart contract capabilities to set and enforce business rules like milestone based access to funds for issuers This will remove the current need for users to have blind trust in issuers Any deviation from or agreed change in supply or governance is visible and verifiable by the public Liquidity provision\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x94Providing liquidity for newly issued currencies requires major effort and is addressed by the automatic market making contract In order for the community currency vision to be realised there is a need for liquidity so that supply and demand forces will manifest in the price This is achieved by leveraging smart contracts\xe2\x80\x99 capabilities and by using the CLN as a reserve currency \x0c13 The CLN network thus solves the fundamental chicken and egg problem as engaged communities will be able to launch currencies regardless of their size location or transactional volume In doing so they will be able to benefit from having access to a decentralized group of stakeholders and service providers that take on a variety of roles in the value chain The implication is an open source and distributed financial framework facilitating a safe and transparent payment system accessible to all 3 1 THE ISSUANCE OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES Community currencies will be issued by stakeholders within the community These stakeholders will have a vested interest in the success of the community Organizations like community banks credit unions merchants\xe2\x80\x99 associations and the like are potential issuers We refer to these organizations as community issuers All communities will be interconnected through the CLN Each community issuer can launch a new community currency for its local community The issuance and allocation process will be transparent and publicly verifiable using an Ethereum smart contract The currency will be an ERC 20 token that will be compliant with any Ethereum wallet As part of the issuance process the issuer locks a certain amount of CLN in an automatic market making contract The lock in of CLNs releases a portion of community currency tokens to the issuer and establishes an \xe2\x80\x9cissuance price\xe2\x80\x9d for the community currency That is the amount of CLNs locked in by the issuer determines the initial value of the local community measured by the product of the amount of circulating tokens and the issuance price From this point onwards this price evolves according to the flow of trades sent by anyone to the market making contract If the issuer chooses not to lock any CLNs in the reserve of the market making contract the issuance price is set to zero and all community currency tokens are locked in the contract initially implying a starting value of zero to the community Any appreciation in value from this point onwards will be as a result of demand for the community currency paid for in CLNs In fact the issuer can allow investors to participate in the issuance process and receive community currency tokens in exchange for their investment in CLNs See Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the process \x0c14 The two reserves established by the issuance process will provide a functionality of exchange and thus liquidity for community currencies without having to list these currencies on centralized exchanges in the early stages during which the potential value of doing so is relatively small The issuance process of a community currency could allow a milestone based process for the allocation of CLN funds received and tokens issued This supports an alignment of interests whereby additional community currency is released to a community issuer as the economic activity in the community\xe2\x80\x94measured for example by the volume of transactions\xe2\x80\x94increases in order to cover their growing operational costs As the community currency network expands new issuers and gateways will integrate into the network Through the CLN network financial institutions and companies will be able to offer value added services further stimulating local economic development and growth 3 2 THE PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY FOR COMMUNITY CURRENCIES Once a local payment system supported by a community currency is up and running it will generate value by increasing competition on the price quality and variety of services relative to existing means of payment and other relevant services However this value will have to be built up over time and be reflected in the value of the community currency Consequently consumers and merchants will likely value the option to exchange a community currency for the CLN network token or for other cryptocurrencies that can be used as means of payment or stores of value Furthermore participants may want to convert these tokens to fiat money However it is unlikely that there will be sufficient liquidity for community currencies at their inception Participants looking to exchange community currencies may not find a counterparty to trade with On a typical exchange the price of the asset is determined in response to the supply of and demand for the traded asset and so the price reflects a willing exchange between a buyer and a seller While there is no way to mimic the behavior of such an exchange mechanically the CLN network will provide the community currency gateway with a tool that allows it to act as a market maker for the community currency from the time of issuance It will do so by executing exchange transactions automatically using a smart contract according to a preset formula We will refer to this process as \xe2\x80\x9cmechanical market making\xe2\x80\x9d \x0c15 There are a number of important features that a liquidity model should satisfy First as argued above it is important to realize that mechanical market making predetermined and \xe2\x80\x9cset in stone\xe2\x80\x9d (or smart contract) cannot mimic the behavior of a real time market exchange In fact hypothetically were the community currencies to be traded on an exchange there could be a gap between the exchange rate on the exchange and the one determined by the mechanical market making contract Therefore it is important that the way that the contracts are implemented should not prevent the CLN and the community currencies from being traded on exchanges (other than through the mechanical market maker) or prevent other entities from providing an exchange service in parallel (i e function as competing market makers for community currencies) Moreover the model should not create unfair conditions that would preclude this in practice Consequently we find it preferable that the mechanism should not have the authority or capability to alter the amount of community currency issued through the operation of liquidity provision Otherwise the ability of the mechanism to issue or destroy tokens in the process and affect the value of the currency could potentially harm the incentives to others to provide liquidity and could potentially be used to manipulate the exchange rate Moreover the more available means there are for arbitrageurs to correct a mis pricing caused by mechanical market making relative to the market perception the smaller such possible gaps in pricing are likely to be Second the model should mimic the basic behavior of a market and therefore should posses the following characteristics \xe2\x97\x8f When there is demand for a community currency its price (relative to the CLN) should increase and vice versa when there is demand for CLN in exchange for the community currency \xe2\x97\x8f There should be sufficient liquidity to execute each trade Our proposal is to maintain two reserves\xe2\x80\x94one in CLN and another in the community currency\xe2\x80\x94that are dedicated to serve as a counterparty for each exchange transaction \xe2\x97\x8f The price instrument should be used to implement the above characteristics and in particular to ensure that the reserves do not exhaust themselves in the process unless the entire money supply from one side is being added to the reserve (in which case it can exhaust the reserve on the other side) \xe2\x97\x8f The price is only a function of the state of the two reserves and other fixed parameters (e g the amount of tokens issued in total) Therefore whenever reserves are in the same state the exchange price should be the same \x0c16 The equations that will be used to set the exchange rate for a community currency against the CLN are provided in the appendix We show that they maintain this set of desired properties We note that the model is inspired by a model presented in an article titled \xe2\x80\x9cDealership Market Market Making with Inventory\xe2\x80\x9d by Amihud & Mendelson 1 The article presents a dealership market which is dominated by a single centralized market maker The possible temporal discrepancy between market buy and sell orders and the obligation to maintain continuous trading induce the market maker to carry an inventory of the stock The crux of the analysis is the dependence of the quoted bid and ask prices on the market maker\xe2\x80\x99s inventory The paper establishes that the optimal policy is one where prices are monotone decreasing functions of the inventory at hand In the case of linear demand and supply for the stock transition rates in each state which respect a one to one correspondence with the bid and ask prices satisfy an ellipse equation 3 3 THE USE OF COMMUNITY CURRENCIES AS REWARDS FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY The goal of community currencies is to be a store of value for local communities by connecting consumers and businesses Thus we envision that the distribution of community currency will be carried out through purchasing transactions taking place at a brick and mortar merchant\xe2\x80\x99s terminal as this form of distribution implements the focus of the CLN network on strengthening economic activity in local economies To facilitate this a portion of each transaction at a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s terminal will be subtracted from the payment to the merchant and allocated as a \xe2\x80\x8breward in community currency\xe2\x80\x8b to the consumer and the merchant involved in the transaction for their economic activity in the community and on the network In particular when a consumer conducts a transaction using digital fiat or crypto fiat a portion of the fiat payment will be exchanged to CLN and then to community currency using the market making contract before being allocated to the parties The use of the community currency in this manner will allow the network to offer a competitive alternative to traditional financial models 1 \xe2\x80\x9cDealership Market Market Making with Inventory \xe2\x80\x9d Yakov Amihud & Haim Mendelson Journal of Financial Economics 8 1980 \x0c17 Transaction flow diagram 4 SUMMARY The CLN creates a decentralized network of tools and services that support community payment systems Through the introduction of community currencies the CLN network creates a potential link between the economic activity taking place at brick and mortar merchants within the community which is facilitated by fiat payments (whether digital or crypto fiat) and the distribution of the community currency among stakeholders as a reward for engaging in this economic activity The CLN network provides a platform for currency issuers and local gateways to support payments for goods and services and provide other financial services Therefore community currencies lower the barriers for communities to upgrade their payment infrastructure and reduce costs to intermediaries \x0c18 4 1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This is a collaborative effort of multiple individuals within the Colu team and involves reviews comments and

the value of the token issued is merely the trust in the gateway that issued it to back it up with a fiat deposit and allow its convertibility back to fiat money \x0c22 APPENDIX A\xe2\x80\x94MATHEMATICAL EQUATION FOR THE MECHANICAL MARKET MAKING CONTRACT The mechanical market making contract is a formula that adjusts the exchange rate between two tokens\xe2\x80\x94the CLN and a community currency\xe2\x80\x94based on the total supply of tokens from each and the state of the reserves in each currency which the contract controls The reserves and the price evolve over time in response to demand for the tokens The formula has a number of desired properties Given the total supply of the two tokens S\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b S\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b the reserves owned by the contract for the two tokens denoted by R\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b and R\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b must satisfy at any time the following equation Eq (1) Alternatively stated denote the percentage of tokens circulating outside the reserve of the contract by then In particular given the reserve in Token1 R\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b which determines \xe2\x80\x8bx\xe2\x80\x8b we can express \xe2\x80\x8by\xe2\x80\x8b and the reserve of Token2 and this determines R\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b in return Note that given that starting conditions for the two reserves satisfy the relationship above 2 the reserve of either of the tokens exhausts itself only when the entire supply of the other token is put into the opposite reserve\xe2\x80\x94that is and or alternatively stated when R\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b=S\xe2\x80\x8b1 \xe2\x80\x8b it implies R\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b=0 and symmetrically when R\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b=S\xe2\x80\x8b2 \xe2\x80\x8b then R\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b=0 2 The smart contract responsible for the issuance of a new community currency ensures that starting conditions are satisfied This is discussed in detail in Appendix B \x0c23 To derive the price of Token1 differentiate Eq (1) with respect to R\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b Price can also be expressed in terms of \xe2\x80\x8bx\xe2\x80\x8b and \xe2\x80\x8by\xe2\x80\x8b Note that when the limit cases are approached the price approaches zero or infinity\xe2\x80\x94that is when R\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b=S\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b then P=0 and when R\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b=0 then P\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b approaches infinity The smart contract needs to calculate for any amount E1 of Token1 sent to the contract and thus added to the reserve of Token1 the corresponding amount E\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b (in Token2) to be released from the reserve in exchange s t To understand the price behavior we can derive the percentage change in the price of Token 2 in response to an amount E\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b of Token1 sent to be exchanged Assume that before the exchange of E\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b This can be expressed as \x0c24 After the exchange of E1 where Resulting in Thus the percentage change in the price of Token2 can be expressed as As can be seen from the equation the percentage price change depends on the size of the reserve relative to the total supply of Token1 and on the size of the amount sent to be exchanged relative to the size of the reserve Alternatively we can derive an expression for the percentage price change when E\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b is measured as a percentage of circulating supply outside the reserve of the contract Let where After the exchange of E1 Thus the percentage change in the price of Token2 can be expressed as \x0c25 APPENDIX B\xe2\x80\x94MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF A COMMUNITY CURRENCY AND THE LOCK UP OF INITIAL RESERVES The process We want to define the parameters that an issuer has to provide the smart contract in order to facilitate a process that a) issues a community currency and b) establishes a two side reserve in the CLN (Token 1) and in the community currency (Token 2) Denote the total supply of CLN by S\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b There are two types of issuance procedures \xe2\x97\x8f Where CLN tokens are sent to the issuance contract by the issuer referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cissuance with issuer\xe2\x80\x99s own fund\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x97\x8f Where the issuer specifies certain parameters for the issuance but CLN tokens are sent to the contract by \xe2\x80\x9cinvestors\xe2\x80\x9d (i e any CLN token holder) referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cissuance with investors\xe2\x80\x99 funds\xe2\x80\x9d Issuance with issuer\xe2\x80\x99s own funds When issuing using this option the issuer follows certain steps \xe2\x97\x8f Step 1 The issuer specifies to the contract the desired amount of tokens to issue S\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b The contract issues the tokens and locks them in the reserve\xe2\x80\x94that is to say R\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b=S\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b This sets the price of Token 2 to zero as \xe2\x97\x8f where Step 2 The issuer then sends an amount contract thus establishing of CLN to the market making \xe2\x97\x8f Step 3 The issuer receives of Token 2 is the \xe2\x80\x8bissuance price \xe2\x80\x8band the total value of Token 2 in circulation (i e outside the reserve of the contract) in CLN terms is equal to \xe2\x97\x8f Step 4 The market making contract opens to any Token 1 or Token 2 holders Issuance with investors\xe2\x80\x99 funds When issuing using this option the issuer follows certain steps \xe2\x97\x8f Step 1 is the same as in the first option \xe2\x97\x8f Step 2 The issuer specifies the amount \xe2\x80\x8bI\xe2\x80\x8b1 \xe2\x80\x8b of CLN expected to be received (\xe2\x80\x9chard cap\xe2\x80\x9d) and a fraction of the amount (\xe2\x80\x9csoft cap\xe2\x80\x9d) designated to be locked in reserve for the purpose of market making and establishing an issuance price \xe2\x97\x8f Step 3 The contracts test the validity of the pair verifying that if of Token 1 are received then the value of Token 2 in circulation (in CLN terms) is at least I\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x94that is assuming that of Token 1 are received then \x0c26 And the requirement is that Thus requiring that Note that the expression satisfies it automatically is less than 0 5 for and so \xe2\x97\x8f If the contract passes the validity test the contract opens to accepting CLN tokens from investors Tokens sent to the contract are locked in the reserve \xe2\x97\x8f If less than tokens are sent within the specified time the contract returns the tokens to their holders and the contract shuts down (as funds received are below the \xe2\x80\x9csoft cap\xe2\x80\x9d) Any tokens in excess of I\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b (\xe2\x80\x9chard cap\xe2\x80\x9d) are not accepted by the contract Assuming the amount of tokens sent is within the range \xe2\x97\x8f any tokens in excess of are sent to the issuer Token 2 released from the reserve R\xe2\x80\x8b2\xe2\x80\x8b are distributed to investors so that their value given the issuance price is equal to the value of the investment sent in CLN The validity test ensures that there are enough Token 2 in circulation to satisfy this condition given the issuance price established by the contract Any excess Token 2 are sent to the issuer \x0c
