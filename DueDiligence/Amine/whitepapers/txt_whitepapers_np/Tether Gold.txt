 Introduction 
 
 
 
 Once synonymous with the term money gold is a substance of immense intrigue and 
 historical significance Known to the Incas as tears of the sun gold was described by Homer in 
 the Iliad and the Odyssey as the glory of the immortals and a sign of wealth among ordinary 
 men Having featured in both the Old and New Testaments the timeless and universal cultural 
 relevance of this shiny metal cannot be denied 
 
 
 Today however gold is not synonymous with money There exists instead a vast array 
 of monies each associated with a sovereign political authority and used predominantly only 
 within national boundaries These national systems of money were originally based upon 
 redeemability to fixed amounts of gold either directly or via a peg to the U S dollar the whole 
 point of paper money was to represent physical gold in a manner conducive to transacting 
 
 
 
 By enabling gold to effectively be divided stored and transported in a much easier 
 manner representative paper money enhanced the economic functionality of gold greatly 
 stimulating trade But the superior medium of exchange properties of gold representative 
 paper introduced a new problem trust in scarcity Put simply there are geophysical limits to 
 the supply of physical gold which do not apply to gold representative paper This potentially 
 enables a dishonest issuer to print representative notes exceeding the gold supply they hold 
 This added element of trust a new form of counterparty risk means that gold representative 
 paper is an inherently lesser store of value than gold itself 
 
 
 
 It was for this reason among others that many countries began to repatriate their gold 
 from American vaults starting in 1965 In the post war period two decades earlier the Bretton 
 Woods agreement had established the U S dollar as the worlds reserve currency All other 
 major currencies would be convertible at fixed rates into U S dollars which would remain 
 convertible to gold at $35 per ounce This caused much gold to flow into the United States 
 which in turn exported many U S dollars As these flows reversed American gold reserves 
 began to rapidly deplete leading to a unilateral suspension of international convertibility of 
 U S dollars to gold This move completed the formal unbundling of gold from the international 
 monetary system thrusting the world into the current era of unbacked fiat money 
 
 
 
 A new entity TG Commodities Limited (Tether Gold) digitizes the value of gold using 
 the new token XAUt This novel token gives XAUt holders the ability to own digitally allocated 
 gold in small sums that are highly transferable and with comparably low fees This whitepaper 
 unbundles monetary principles to highlight the innovation and benefits provided by XAUt 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Evolving Financial Ecosystem 
 
 
 
 For the current generation of finance professionals the idea of fixed exchange rates for 
 national currencies based on a peg to the U S dollar (or gold itself) is entirely foreign Since the 
 1970s these rates have been permitted to float that is they are determined in the global 
 
 
 foreign exchange markets based on supply and demand relative to other fiat currencies This 
 new system had several major implications for global finance 
 
 
 
 First the global supply of money was no longer pegged in any way to the global supply 
 of gold This lead to sharply rising gold prices and high levels of inflation within many domestic 
 economies With these new fiat money supplies being wholly unpegged from gold the scarcity 
 of money became only artificially ensured Trust in the physical scarcity of gold and of its 
 existence within vaults was replaced by trust in the economic stewardship of national 
 monetary authorities 
 
 
 
 Second and relatedly was the emergence of global foreign exchange markets With 
 rates no longer fixed market mechanisms were required to discover the relative prices of 
 foreign currency Whereas the fixed exchange rates under the gold based system largely 
 precluded speculation freely floating rates transformed the foreign exchange markets into a 
 global arena for speculative activity wholly separate from the production of goods and 
 services The Bank of International Settlements has reported that since 1992 foreign exchange 
 turnover has clearly increased more than the underlying economic activity whether measured 
 by GDP equity turnover or gross trade flows 1

 These and other issues associated with physically unconstrained fiat monies are what 
 has perpetuated the economic function of gold Despite its lesser monetary role gold remains a 
 universally popular safe haven asset and is still held by many central banks There are an 
 estimated 6 1 billion ounces of physical gold above ground of which about half are connected 
 to financial markets implying a market cap of approximately $4 7 trillion USD 2 With over $200 
 billion combined daily trading volume gold markets are among the most liquid in the 
 world One major reason that gold continues to be held in many investment portfolios is as a 
 hedge against financial instability 
 
 
 
 
 
 i Fiat Money & Financial Instability 
 
 
 
 
 The post Bretton Woods era of unbacked fiat money has coincided with numerous 
 periods of currency related financial instability around the world The Latin American debt crisis 
 of the early 1980s the 1997 Asian financial crisis and many other smaller scale emergency 
 situations all had their roots in this relatively new global monetary system More recently the 
 Global Financial Crisis has shed light on the financial turbulence associated with debt based fiat 
 money Its aftermath an unprecedented global monetary expansion coordinated by leading 
 central banks has raised concerns about these monetary authorities economic stewardship 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ii Bitcoin & Digital Tokens 
 
 
 
 
 The Bitcoin network commenced on January 3rd 2009 and was originally introduced as 
 a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online payments to be sent 
 from one party to another without going through a financial institution 3 This description 
 speaks to Bitcoins financial aspect (payments) but there is also a fully internal decentrally 
 secured monetary unit bitcoins Massively enhanced global payments efficiency is a major 
 financial innovation but the invention of digital scarcity e g a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins 
 is a landmark monetary innovation it is why some call bitcoin digital gold 4

 Embedded within the first bitcoin block was the following text The Times 
 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks This British headline was a 
 reference to the fallout from the Global Financial Crisis hinting at the motivation of Bitcoins 
 pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin and its underlying technologies seem 
 intended to address problems and moral hazards associated with fiat money and the implied 
 concentration of economic power in the hands of monetary authorities and major banks 
 
 
 
 With truly humble origins bitcoins were first used to purchase a real world item in 
 2010 when 10 000 bitcoins were used to pay for two pizzas in Jacksonville Florida 5 Bitcoins 
 market value has since experienced a tumultuous ascendency regularly expanding by multiples 
 and then contracting by over 50% For example in 2011 the price first reached $1 USD surged 
 to $31 and then fell back to $2 Reaching $1000 in 2013 bitcoins price peaked at $19 500 in 
 2017 before falling back to $3 500 and was approximately $7 200) as of midnight UTC on 
 January 1 2020 Though generally trending upwards bitcoins meteoric rise has been 
 accompanied by extreme volatility 
 
 
 
 These massive price movements caused media coverage of bitcoin to soar particularly 
 during the latter half of 2017 With value and popularity continuing to rise politicians and 
 financial regulators began paying attention Amidst the frenzy surrounding this still nascent 
 technology many around the world began to ask is bitcoin money For its biggest proponents 
 bitcoin was undoubtedly money and of an entirely superior form 6 However for its detractors 
 bitcoin could never be money it was associated with nefarious activities was not backed by 
 any government and its price was far too volatile 7 
 
 
 
 
 These debates raised the question what is money With dictionary definitions lacking 
 consensus on its meaning one popular way to conceptualize this English term is by considering 
 the following three functions medium of exchange store of value and unit of account For 
 bitcoins detractors the regularity of major price movements precluded bitcoin from being a 
 store of value meaning it could not be money The purchasing power uncertainty associated 
 with holding this volatile asset would preclude its widespread use as a medium of exchange 
 
 
 
 
 
 iii Stablecoins 
 
 
 
 
 With bitcoins price volatility seemingly holding back a ground breaking enhancement to 
 the transactional utility of money (i e medium of exchange functionality cheap and fast global 
 value transfers etc ) attempts were made to create digital tokens with stable values This was 
 done by pegging the value of a digital token to a fiat monetary unit to achieve the best of both 
 worlds the transactional utility of a decentralized digital token but the price stability of fiat 
 money These projects came to be known as stablecoins 
 
 
 
 Tether was created on October 6th 2014 in response to a clear market need to transfer 
 funds quickly and globally whilst benefiting from the relative stability of fiat money Since then 
 the value of outstanding tethers has surpassed $4 billion with versions now available both in 
 numerous fiat denominations and on a variety of blockchains Price stability is maintained by 
 Tether always valuing the token at the monetary unit to which it is pegged a policy supported 
 by holding reserves equal in fiat value to all outstanding tethers 8 Maintenance of this policy 
 generates arbitrage activity in the secondary markets keeping prices near their pegged fiat 
 values 
 
 8 Reserves include traditional currency cash equivalents and from time to time may include other assets and 
 receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties which may include affiliated entities

 10 Money serves three functions medium of exchange store of value and unit of account These functions or 
 monetary principles are interrelated For example a medium of exchange must also be a store of value in the 
 
 
 
 With the highest daily traded volume of any digital token9 Tether is the undisputed 
 global leader in fiat backed stablecoins Built on top of open blockchain technologies but 
 backed by reserves Tethers effective unbundling of monetary principles marks a new frontier 
 in the evolution of money particularly regarding transactional utility 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Evolution of Money Unbundling Monetary Principles 
 
 
 
 Before the emergence of Bitcoin and its underlying technologies there were no 
 alternatives to fiat money Now with plausible alternatives individuals are beginning to make 
 their own trade offs between monetary principles10 in their choices of money Dramatically 
 
 
 short term These monetary principles are best conceived of as heavily preference laden This is because 
 individuals imbue their financial activity with their own preferences particularly regarding time 
 
 accelerated by the emergence of Bitcoin and its underlying technologies the evolution of 
 money has long been characterized by an unbundling of monetary principles 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tethers existing line of fiat backed stablecoins create value by unbundling and 
 repackaging the monetary principles associated with fiat money and bitcoin respectively In 
 exchange for bearing the counterparty risk of Tether the issuer holders of tether tokens are 
 rewarded with a transactional utility far exceeding that of traditional fiat money all while 
 maintaining the price stability of the domestic fiat monetary unit 
 
 
 
 Tethers introduction of a gold backed product is a natural progression in the evolution 
 of money Since gold is more physically cumbersome than fiat money the incremental benefit 
 of a gold backed stablecoin is commensurately greater than for its fiat backed counterparts In 
 the Tether Gold token users will have access to an asset with a scarcity basis and price stability 
 akin to gold but with the transactional utility of a digital token a novel permutation of 
 financial characteristics By relentlessly expanding the potential for individuals to make their 
 own trade offs between monetary principles Tether has become a global leader in financial 
 empowerment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 i Physical Gold 
 ii Exchange Traded Products 
 iii Derivatives 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Existing Markets for Gold 
 
 
 
 Predating modern securities markets and the globalization of financial services markets 
 for physical gold have a history that stretches to antiquity When gold was used as money the 
 price of gold was expressed in other goods e g food items other metals etc However in the 
 modern financial system the price of physical gold is most commonly expressed in fiat money 
 value particularly U S dollars As such whether gold is held as a safe haven asset is traded for 
 speculative purposes or is made part of a well diversified investment portfolio it is exposure to 
 the fiat money price change of gold that is sought As the global financial system matured new 
 financial products were designed that could provide economic exposure to the fiat money price 
 change of gold without having to hold the physical gold itself There are currently three 
 primary ways to gain economic exposure to the price of gold 
 
 
 
 
 
 The global standard for investment grade physical gold is the London bullion market a 
 wholesale over the counter (OTC) market for trading gold and silver Trading is conducted 
 amongst members of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and is loosely overseen by 
 the Bank of England The LBMA issues a Good Delivery specification a set of rules regarding the 
 physical characteristics of the gold and silver bars used in settlement in the market With most 
 members being major international bullion dealers and refiners the public can typically only 
 access this market indirectly through a third party 
 
 
 
 
 
 Exchange traded gold products include exchange traded funds (ETFs) exchange traded 
 notes (ETNs) and closed end funds (CEFs) which are all traded like shares on the major stock 
 exchanges Gold ETFs have come to represent a large share of the market for gold as they 
 allow investors to put small amounts of capital to work more effectively Within this category 
 there are a range of products to choose from with some designed to track the price of physical 
 gold itself and others designed to invest in companies that specialize in gold These products 
 provide only varying levels of indirect exposure to the price of gold but they save investors the 
 burden of storage and verification of physical gold 
 
 
 
 
 
 Financial derivatives such as gold forwards futures and options are a third primary 
 way for investors to gain exposure to the fiat price changes of physical gold These products 
 currently trade on various public exchanges around the world as well as in various OTC private 
 markets Gold futures are used as hedging tools by commercial producers and users of gold 
 facilitating both global gold price discovery and opportunities for portfolio diversification 
 Derivatives enable purchasers to tailor their economic exposure to physical gold to suit their 
 specific situation e g strike price duration 
 
 
 
 
 i Basic Functionality 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Each of the above three ways to gain economic exposure to the price of gold has pros 
 and cons Holding physical gold provides direct economic exposure to a highly liquid market for 
 physical gold but the costs of storage transfer and verification can be prohibitive particularly 
 for smaller investors Exchange traded products largely overcome these high expenses but can 
 only provide indirect exposure to the price of physical gold Although many ETFs hold large 
 volumes of physical gold investors are not entitled to any specific allocation meaning that 
 some counterparty risk is baked into the product Gold derivatives are free of such 
 counterparty risks but their use requires fine tuning and sophistication They are not generally 
 a cost effective way for typical investors to gain economic exposure to gold prices 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tether Gold (XAUt) 
 
 
 
 The economic alternatives to holding physical gold have expanded the potential for 
 individuals and entities to make trade offs between monetary principles e g accepting indirect 
 rather than direct exposure to the price of gold (counterparty risk) in exchange for lower 
 storage and transaction costs (accessibility) But the traditional market still lacks a low cost way 
 for investors to gain direct exposure to the price of physical gold XAUt will combine the best of 
 three distinct worlds direct exposure to the price of physical gold the accessibility of 
 traditional financial assets like ETFs and the transactional utility of a digital token

 By applying the technology and functionality of Tethers world leading fiat backed 
 stablecoins to physical gold XAUt will dramatically mobilize gold markets significantly lowering 
 barriers to entry for non institutional investors in the process XAUt will mirror Tethers existing 
 products in many ways but there are several important differences including the creation of a 
 new entity that will issue XAUt tokens Tether Gold 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Each individual XAUt token represents 1 troy fine ounce of London Good Delivery gold 
 held in a vault in Switzerland and will be capable of being fractionalized up to six decimal 
 places (i e increments as small as 0 000001 troy fine ounce) 
 
 
 ii Product Details & Fees 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Holders of XAUt will be able to redeem their tokens for the associated physical gold 
 subject to the payment of fees and minimum redemption requirements The gold will be 
 delivered at a location of the holders choosing in Switzerland Rather than take physical 
 delivery in Switzerland a holder can ask Tether Gold to make arrangements to attempt to sell 
 the gold and take the proceeds from that sale 
 
 
 
 Specific gold bars will be associated with each on chain address that holds XAUt tokens 
 Tether Gold will make a Look up Website available where anyone can identify the specific 
 gold bar(s) associated with each on chain address where XAUt tokens are held 
 
 
 
 When an on chain transaction transfers XAUt from its initial on chain address (A) to a 
 second on chain address (B) the Tether website will reflect that some of the physical gold 
 previously associated with A moved to B Gold associated with other on chain addresses wont 
 be impacted by this transaction Where needed (e g to support a redemption or to mitigate 
 fractionalization) the physical gold associated with the XAUt held at on chain addresses can be 
 consolidated This reallocation will happen instantly so that each XAUt token will always 
 represent ownership of physical gold on a particular gold bar 
 
 
 
 In order to either purchase or redeem XAUt with Tether Gold users will be required to 
 complete an identity verification process agree to a set of specific terms for service for XAUt 
 and meet applicable purchase or redemption minimums 
 
 
 
 
 
 XAUt tokens will initially be available on the ERC20 and TRC20 protocols with others to 
 follow All purchases and redemptions will be in U S dollars 
 
 
 
 Tether Gold will purchase or arrange for the purchase of London Good Delivery gold 
 from a gold dealer in Switzerland which will then be securely stored by a custodian in a vault in 
 Switzerland The gold will be insured by the custodian and held for the benefit of XAUt token 
 holders not for Tether Gold 
 
 
 
 As with Tethers existing products and unlike some other gold backed stablecoins as of 
 the date of this whitepaper Tether will not charge gas fees The only fees will be on issuance 
 and redemption 
 
 
 
 As of the date of this whitepaper to buy XAUt directly from Tether Gold verified users 
 will be required to purchase a minimum of 50 fine troy oz of gold (i e 50 XAUt tokens) and pay 
 the cost to purchase the gold in the Swiss gold market plus a 25 bp fee 
 
 
 
 As of the date of this whitepaper to redeem XAUt for the physical gold associated with 
 it the holder must have a minimum of 430 XAUt tokens (i e 430 fine troy oz of gold) 
 Redemptions can only occur with full bars of gold and gold bars are not exactly 430 fine troy oz 
 
 
 iii Potential Use Cases 
 a Highly Mobile Safe Haven Asset 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (they usually range in size from ~385 to ~415 fine troy oz) the holder of XAUt seeking to 
 redeem them will be responsible for the difference In the highly unlikely event that the gold 
 bar is bigger than 430 fine troy oz the holder will either have to (a) provide additional XAUt to 
 be burned to cover the excess or (b) pay an amount of fiat necessary to cover the cost of the 
 excess gold (based on the then current cost to purchase the gold in the Swiss gold market) If 
 the gold bar is smaller than 430 oz the holder seeking to redeem will only be entitled to 
 redeem the number of XAUt tokens equivalent to the amount of gold on the bar rather than 
 the full 430 XAUt they sought to redeem 
 
 
 
 As of the date of this whitepaper the fee for physical delivery of gold in Switzerland will 
 be 25 bp of the then current cost to purchase gold in the Swiss gold market plus the cost of 
 physical delivery to the location in Switzerland selected by the holder If the holder requests 
 Tether Gold to make arrangements to attempt to sell their gold Tether Gold will attempt to do 
 so in the Swiss gold market If the gold is successfully sold Tether Gold will provide the holder 
 of XAUt the fiat money they were able to sell it for less a fee of 25 bp 
 
 
 
 Fees and minimum redemption or purchase amounts may be charged from time to 
 time Tether Gold terms of sale and service will provide information on the current fees and 
 minimum redemption and purchase amounts 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tethers fiat pegged products have been adopted for a variety of purposes particularly 
 those requiring high degrees of global transactional utility Fiat money could already be moved 
 around the world but the enhanced speed and efficiency of fiat pegged stablecoins spurred 
 adoption by users who most value these traits With physical gold being significantly less mobile 
 than fiat money a gold pegged stablecoin such as XAUt opens the door to entirely novel forms 
 of economic activity as the token represents an even greater step change in the transactional 
 utility of the underlying asset 
 
 
 
 
 
 Physical gold has long been held as a safe haven asset However with its physically 
 cumbersome nature physical gold is difficult and costly to transact with and store By imbuing a 
 digital token with the economic characteristics of physical gold XAUt removes a great deal of 
 friction and cost associated with holding the underlying asset While the physical gold itself will 
 largely remain in vaults XAUt will enable certain economic qualities of gold e g ownership 
 value to flow seamlessly around the world 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 b Liquid & Effective Portfolio Hedge 
 c Sovereign Neutral Monetary Unit 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Being unpegged from the global monetary system many investors include gold in their 
 portfolios as a hedge against financial instability However although numerous gold related 
 investment products exist today it has historically been costly and burdensome for non 
 institutional investors to gain exposure to physical gold particularly smaller quantities Lower 
 cost gold related investment products are widely available but these often lack the liquidity 
 and hedge effectiveness of physical gold itself By allowing smaller denominations at wholesale 
 prices XAUt will democratize access to physical gold as an asset class 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The broadest use case of XAUt is as a sovereign neutral monetary unit By unbundling 
 and repackaging the monetary principles associated with gold and bitcoin respectively users 
 will gain access to a money like asset that has the scarcity basis and price stability of gold 
 While many herald bitcoins lack of political affiliation and the resistance to censorship that this 
 implies physical gold was the original sovereign neutral monetary unit Bitcoin and physical 
 gold both exist outside the control of monetary authorities but bitcoins massive price volatility 
 has precluded its use as a monetary unit upon which to base trade By combining the most 
 desirable qualities of these two assets XAUt could become the first widely traded sovereign 
 neutral monetary unit with a high degree of price stability By making gold based contracting 
 and global settlement accessible to everyone XAUt tokens will provide a new and feasible 
 monetary basis for global trade Governments may no longer adhere to a gold standard but 
 XAUt will empower individuals to do so
