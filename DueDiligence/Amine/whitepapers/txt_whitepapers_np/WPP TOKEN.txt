 HISTORY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT
 
 1972 WPP President Mr Rafael Ben was concerned about the high rising fuels within the US and abroad and began a 
 research and development with his engineering and scientist team to alternate other fuels technologies and was the 
 first person who has used alcohol blends during this period and wrote Methanol A Clean Fuel for the 21st century 
 
 1986 WPP President Mr Ben worked various aspects of developmental technology for biomass and gasification 
 
 1990 WPP President Mr Ben traveled to India for FAO in 1990 and evaluated conversion of agricultural wastes to 
 fuels 
 
 1992 Mr Ben traveled to China for the Rockefeller Foundation to evaluate two new gasifiers built there 
 
 1996 WPP President Mr Ben travelled around the world visiting various gasification sites gathering information for 
 the book Survey of Biomass Gasification 
 
 1997 WPP President Mr Ben and his engineering team started the first prototype of a 1 Mega Watt per hour Biomass 
 Plant in Chandpur near New Delhi the testing of the smallest unit that produced 24MW power generation per day 
 that could power a small village with great success 
 
 1998 WPP President Mr Bens team in conjunction with partner CPG deployed the first power plant in a remote 
 village in Ghana West Africa which was installed successfully and commissioned using Biomass A new power 
 source to 24 000 homes avoiding the cost of underground cables with great success 
 
 1999 WPP President Mr Ben started the first testing device that converts water into Hydrogen with proprietary 
 science developed in Belarus The vision was to convert large thermal power plants to reduce their operating costs 
 and dramatically increasing efficiency by 35% Lowering costs and increasing effeciency while running the entire 
 power station at zero pollution and saving huge amounts on oil and gas costs 
 
 2000 WPP President Mr Ben and his team of engineers conducted ongoing research and development partnering 
 with world leaders in power generation sectors focussing on the worlds most advanced technology to reach the 
 highest possible capacity of power production and at the same time to reduce the cost of operations with the vision 
 to run only clean energy sources to address global warming and to present power producers around the world with a 
 viable solution to produce power in an environmentally friendly way resulting in clean air for the benefit of generations 
 to come 
 
 
 
 2004 WPP President Mr Ben became one of the worlds VIP speakers in green summits speaking about the need to 
 convert and upgrade power generation throughout the world to advance the use of new technologies as an alternative 
 to the oil and gas sectors starting at Sydney Australia Hong Kong Cambodia Bulgaria Georgia Macedonia Crete 
 Greece Saint Petersburg and others 
 
 From 2006 2008 WPP President Mr Ben had power plants in Managua Nicaragua for upgrading into Biomass 
 plant The conversion was to adopt new advanced Pyrolysis combining Plasma Gasification with the Pyrolysis using 
 tires and biomass combination to increase the amount of BTUs converting the plants to run on a clean energy with 
 much higher profits on the sale of the Carbon Black and Stainless Steel by products using the Kremsmuler exhaust 
 system that eliminates the gases and fumes used as a second cycle increasing power production by 18% 
 
 2009 Mr Ben formed World Power Production Energy Corporation (WPP Energy) to solve Municipal Solid Waste 
 problems around the world using the advanced zero pollution technology converting waste into power 
 
 2010 WPP Energy introduces a revolutionary concept along with GE generators increasing power plant production 
 by 30% and reducing operating costs by 45% 
 
 2011 WPP collaborated with Technip (a leader in Oil & Gas) for a total investment of $50 Billion USD for mega projects 
 in Morocco 
 
 2012 WPP Formed a Joint Venture with INEWCORP to implement waste to energy projects in 15 countries in Africa 
 for waste to energy and green villages with a signed PPAs with federal government in the SUM of $55 Billion USD 
 for 35 years contract back by a signed Government DECREE 
 
 2013 WPP Formed a Joint Venture Agreement with GDTC for a Large Waste to Energy Projects totalling $9 4 Billion 
 USD

 In 2014 WPP expanded its Far East presence by signing a Joint Venture Agreement with South Korea to convert water 
 into Hydrogen building the first Home Unit to provide Low Cost Heat Hot Water and Electricity to Home Owners 
 
 2015 WPP deploys technology for the desalinization/purification of water The quality of drinking water is a powerful 
 environmental determinant of health 
 
 2016 WPP Energy begins to visualize the potential of block chain technology once applied to the power production 
 industry and concludes it is the ideal way to reduce public power costs dramatically 
 
 2017 WPP Energy President Mr Rafael Ben was invited to present at the green energy summit to resolve the problem 
 of waste heavy gases and fumes generated from the power plants via a special exhaust system built in Austria that 
 eliminates heavy pollution and reuses the same gases and fumes with power production increased by 18% with zero 
 pollution 
 
 Also in 2017 WPP ENERGY established 35 year contracts in Africa for waste to energy projects at the Federal 
 Government level This encompasses over 10 000 metric tons per day of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Each of 5 
 Power Plants will process 2000 Metric Tons of MSW Per Day converting waste into power and by products WPP 
 ENERGY has simultaneously secured a government Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to consume the energy 
 produced at 14 5 cents per kilo watt In addition a 35 year agreement is in place for gate/tipping fees of $35 per 
 metric ton Contract includes yearly increases in the per kilowatt price and in the gate/tipping fees 
 
 January 2018 WPP signs agreement with Dahir Insaat to bring to market Green City Vertical Greenhouse Agricultural 
 Towers

 models of Vorax which have capacities ranging from 2 Tons of Waste per day to our largest 
 model which can treat 400 Tons of Waste per day solving the global landfill problem Models 
 from 22T/day and up also have steam power generation packages available to create electricity 
 demonstrating VORAXs Waste to Energy capability 
 
 VORAX is in a technological classification of its own after more than 10 years of R&D from a 
 brilliant team of scientists and in the invention of DuoTherm technology which puts VORAX 
 ahead of plasma Incineration Gasification and also traditional pyrolysis VORAX is thought of 
 as a quantum leap over traditional Pyrolysis in part because two thermal processes one at 900 
 C and the other at 1600 C forming a thermal gradient liquifying all solids completely even inert 
 materials such as sand or iron 
 
 VORAX completely destroys the garbage effectively and safely without combustion or an 
 auxiliary equipment VORAX requires no combustion of waste and disintegrates as a whole 
 completely destroying infectious pathological and organochlorined materials 
 
 The technology is patented in over 40 countries and is now available for distribution globally by 
 WPP Energy after initially being deployed in Brazil 
 
 WPP W2H2 POWER GENERATION 
 
 W2H2 is based on an advanced proprietary scientific method which includes the invention of 
 using Thermoplasma to extract Hydrogen Gas from water in high volume for power generation at 
 much lower cost than competing technologies (i e Electrolysis) W2H2 utilizes the combined 
 effects of magnetization produced by neodymium magnets ionization via plasma induction and 
 resonance
 
 
 
 brought about by radio frequency to minimize the energy required to dissociate the water molecule 
 into its element constituent of hydrogen and oxygen atoms 
 
 Laser pulses are then applied to the water molecules as a final step to split the water into hydrogen and 
 oxygen atoms The combined effects of the said process requires much less energy than electrolysis 
 (less than 10% for W2H2 versus 30%+ for electrolysis) and is able to produce greater volumes of 
 hydrogen when compared to electrolysis 
 
 With WPPs W2H2 disruptive energy technology solution will solve many energy and environmental 
 problems around the world working toward a zerocarbon footprint Our water to hydrogen energy 
 production solution will eliminate fossil fuel electricity generation in every fossil fuel based power plant 
 and generator we convert to hydrogen 
 
 WPP will convert polluting power producers into efficient lowcost green energy producers WPPs 
 business plan includes converting to clean W2H2 energy (water as the main input to produce mass 
 amounts of hydrogen gas onsite) as many as possible of the worlds 20 000+ polluting Coal Oil 
 Natural Gas and Gasoline Power Plants and countless Diesel Generators around the world W2H2 
 will greatly reduce the largest operating cost of a power plant or generator namely fuel and increasing 
 Power Plant efficiency by using Hydrogen gas which has a much higher caloric output than fossil fuels 
 while increasing environmental benefits through a near zero carbon footprint 
 
 Many of the target power plants are shut down or on the list to be shut down because of EPA no longer 
 allowing fossil fuels to be used as the source for generating electricity

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 
 Renewable Energy currently represents just under 25% of the worlds total energy production 
 and forecasts indicate by 2040 that share will increase between 33 40% We believe the latter 
 number is achievable and in fact can and will be surpassed To do so both existing and new 
 green technologies must be efficient in their science economics distribution promotion and 
 barriers removed for market adoption To convincingly outmaneuver and outperform the 
 polluting toxic and often lethal fossil fuel market the global renewable energy market needs 
 to have a highly organized central hub for the transacting of all types of green energy supply 
 
 Enter WPP Energy with a product line up of technologically advanced solutions designed to 
 make a major positive impact on the environment through a one two punch combination in 
 both Clean Energy Production and in Waste Management with a solution to reduce landfill 
 waste by up to 97
 
 WPPs solutions will eventually all work their way into a Blockchain initiative is called the Global 
 Green Energy Platform which in combination with use of its product line up will greatly reduce 
 dependency of landfills fossil fuels utility companies and lower the cost of energy production 
 by a wide margin 
 
 Platform participants will be incentivized with rewards for Going Green Buyers will make 
 informed decisions based on numerous green energy solutions provided in the platform 
 
 Given the massive scale and importance of the disruption we propose and the market power 
 of the existing participants we expect push back from the markets we intend to disrupt The 
 importance of what we propose and the massive resulting change to the health of our planet 
 and those who live on it and making energy much more affordable is well worth taking some 
 punches along the way 
 
 
 
 ANATOMY OF THE PLATFORM
 
 WPPs Global Green Energy Blockchain Platform is a multi phased initiative with a 
 staggered roll commencing in Q3/Q4 2020 consisting of the following 5 stages 
 
 1 A blockchain marketplace to buy and sell green biofuel futures contracts which have been 
 derived from W2H2 water to hydrogen technology 
 
 See W2H2 Power Plant Conversion
 
 Smart contracts are being created to represent an underlying fuel futures contract being 
 offered by the truck/plant owner The supply contract is ready to be agreed to and purchased 
 outright The contract can also be resold on the platform if the original buyer decides to do 
 so The underlying fuel itself is a fully exportable/transportable commodity so that the 
 buyer can take physically possession should they wish to do so WPP will offer 2 financial 
 settlement options Fiat currency or WPP Tokens WPP Tokens will carry an additional 
 incentive over fiat to encourage cryptocurrency adoption in the energy sector 
 
 2 Expanding on Phase 1 above Phase 2 sees the green biofuel futures marketplace expand 
 in a continuous multi year initiative to cover any type of renewable energy supply (fuel 
 electricity) that can be bought and sold via futures contracts between producers/suppliers 
 and end buyers by using WPP Tokens that are smart contract enabled to represent an 
 underlying asset namely an energy supply contract that is ready to be agreed to and 
 purchased outright The contract can also be resold on the platform if the original buyer 
 decides to do so As the transaction facilitator WPP will offer 2 financial settlement options to 
 the end energy supplier Fiat currency or WPP Tokens with WPP Tokens carrying additional 
 incentives over fiat to encourage cryptocurrency adoption within the energy sector 
 
 To support the marketplace activity in 1 & 2 above the following 3 elements below are also 
 being introduced
 
 3 A Trust Reputation and Feedback system all managed on the blockchain This will help 
 create the necessary confidence for parties to transact with one another 
 
 4 Cryptocurrency Exchange feature that will convert fiat currency credit cards and 
 crytpocurrencies into WPP Tokens an accepted currency on the Global Green Energy 
 Platform 
 
 
 
 3 a) Green Energy Rebate Program WPP Tokens paid out as a rewards system to promote 
 conducting green energy transactions on the Global Green Energy Platform 
 
 
 b) WPP ERC20 Wallet and Mobile App WPP Token rewards earned from the Green Energy 
 Rebate Program will be sent to a users WPP Wallet which can then be loaded into app 
 and spent goods and services on the Global Green Energy Platform Marketplace or on a 
 separate rewards marketplace which will follow with a wide range of products available 
 from various participating companies also willing to reward users for Going Green 
 
 The following is an outline of the renewable energy green energy supply marketplace along with 
 a distributed storage system for data collection from the participating energy producers for 
 safe secure and easy energy transaction at a wholesale rate to the energy suppliers anywhere 
 anytime Use of Smart Contracts through WPP Token on a distributed storage system on a 
 permissioned ledger will help avoid any attempted disruption or blocking of what will be energy 
 industry changing transaction methods and increased market pressure to lower costs based on 
 the exposure of much lower prices offered in the Global Green Energy Platform Marketplace 
 WPP will be using a permission based blockchain model to avoid mining and to ensure we are 
 not adding to the present and growing energy crisis caused by crypto mining 
 
 The project will be an intuitive user friendly cross platform web and mobile application which 
 will allow the energy buyers and energy sellers to connect and do the energy transaction below 
 the wholesale price bypassing the utility companies 
 
 This document covers details about the product vision which will be a complete global green 
 energy solution for green energy cryptocurrencies green energy goods and supply transaction

 # LACK OF VERIFICATION
 
 When the system cannot form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of a customer 
 we will deactivate the account or keep it in deactivated status close an account after attempts 
 to verify customers identity fail and determine whether it is necessary to inform the FSC or 
 FCU in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
 
 USER ONBOARDING
 
 In order to start trading on the platform user registration is mandatory The users will be 
 registered through email verifications followed by mobile verification username creation and
 
 KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER (KYC) IDENTIFICATION & CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE (CDD)
 
 The system will collect sufficient information from each producers seller and the buyer who 
 have opened an account to enable the customer to be identified record CDD information and 
 the verification methods and results provide the required adequate CDD notice to customers 
 that we will seek identification information to verify their identities and compare customer 
 identification information against the IDs issued by the government 
 
 # REQUIRED CUSTOMER INFORMATION
 
 Users who have opened an account need to provide a scanned copy of photo graphic ID and 
 proof of address prior to being allowed to trade 
 
 # RECORDKEEPING
 
 We will keep logs of our verification including all identifying information provided by a customer 
 the methods used and results of verification and the resolution of any discrepancies identified 
 in the verification process 
 
 # TO CUSTOMERS
 
 The system will provide notice to customers/inform them by email that the system is requesting 
 information from them to verify their identities as required by law when the customer wants 
 to activate their account for doing any operations on the platform

 Introduction
 
 WPP Energy presents VORAX a scientific breakthrough in the ideal treatment of nearly all 
 types of Waste such as MSW/Urban Medical/Hazardous Industrial Pasty/Sludge Liquid 
 Tires There are 12 different models of Vorax which have capacities ranging from 2 Tons of 
 Waste per day to our largest model which can treat 400 Tons of Waste per day Models from 
 22T/day and up also have steam power generation packages available to create electricity 
 demonstrating VORAXs significant Waste to Energy (WtE) capability 
 
 Vorax is in a technological classification of its own after more than 10 years of R&D form a 
 brilliant team of scientists and in the invention of DuoTherm technology which puts Vorax 
 ahead of plasma Incineration Gasification and also traditional pyrolysis Vorax is thought of 
 as a quantum leap over traditional Pyrolysis in part because two thermal processes one at 
 9000C and the other at 16000C forming a thermal gradient liquifying all solids completely 
 even inert materials such as sand or iron 
 
 
 ETNA 2T/day model shown
 
 
 
 Vorax completely destroys the garbage effectively and safely without combustion or an 
 auxiliary equipment Vorax requires no combustion of waste and disintegrates as a whole 
 completely destroying infectious pathological and organochlorined materials having as a 
 solid byproduct a ceramic matrix (do not produce ashes) and inert in the bottom of the fusion 
 module with commercial application the gases formed in the process have no dioxins or 
 furans and are of low volume because they only arise from the disintegration of the material 
 and not from combustion or gasification traditional processes 
 
 The fusion module in turn works in negative atmosphere preventing gas leaks The 
 process is dry distillation of the waste with absence of air no combustion of waste which 
 provides extreme reduction of the exhaust gases as compared with conventional processes 
 and moreover does not allow the formation of dioxins or furans in view of lack of oxygen 
 and high temperature The garbage is not mixed with the atmospheric air and suffers a dry 
 distillation meaning it is completely disintegrated and liquified in the absence of air which 
 considerably reduces the formation of pollutants harmful to the environment and health 
 including carcinogens The reduction in mass of organic waste in this process is by volume 
 100 1 up to 250 1 according to the category of waste processed 
 
 The gases formed inside the fusion module are suddenly sucked and cooled (quench) to 
 then be treated and neutralized in an immersion tank alkaline Last generation filters coal 
 based activated ensure that the emissions meet environmental standards 
 
 The fusion modul is not refractory as in conventional models except in the melting pot 
 Therefore it is lightweight and low maintenance equipment suitable for use in hospitals 
 factories ships among other places of waste treatment 
 
 For its operation the Vorax WTU DuoTherm only requires a 220V or 380V outlet The 
 equipment allows to operate continuously or intermittently as needed by the user Its power 
 consumption is low and purely electric for example a 2T/day model consumes only 40kWh 
 depending on the category of garbage 
 
 
 
 5 ton/day model shown below 
 
 
 38
 
 
 Control and Operation of Vorax is automatic After feeding no operator is required from 
 departure to the disconnection of its cycle Anyone can feed the fusion module with the 
 material to be treated which operates automatically The waste to be treated does not 
 necessarily require selectivity at first everything can be processed organic matter iron 
 metals and even sand 
 
 
 
 Training for operating Vorax is performed at the installation site and requires only one full day 
 of instruction 
 
 The technology is patented in over 40 countries and is being made available for 
 distribution globally by WPP Energy after initially being deployed in Brazil 
 
 
 
 The scientific challenge of waste treatment 
 
 The fundamental challenge of garbage is to find an effective way to treat it Modern garbage 
 contains high doses of heavy metals organochlorines benzene dioxins furans among 
 others Landfills emit pollution including methane and essentially many parts of the world 
 are drowning in garbage 
 
 Incineration Gasification and Partial Pyrolysis (with presence of atmospheric air) even via 
 plasma processes are known techniques but they fall short Incineration or gasification (even 
 with plasma technology) involves the presence of atmospheric air and it is for this reason that 
 these technologies create environmental problems The presence of air entails introducing 
 a lot of oxygen in the process for combustion or gasification Incineration Gasification and 
 Partial Pyrolysis (with presence of atmospheric air) even via plasma processes are the all 
 too common techniques given their problems 
 
 These techniques despite reducing the weight and the initial volume of garbage cannot be 
 considered effective they are unable to dispose the waste once the waste remains toxic 
 being presented mainly in the form of ash More seriously it is produced large amounts 
 of greenhouse gases which need to be addressed The ashes despite concentrating on 
 small volumes are fine particulates of non volatilizable materials and may contain high 
 concentrations of active elements harmful to the environmental balance such as heavy 
 metals The gases in turn require appropriate filters and intensive maintenance because 
 they contain significant concentrations of pollutants 
 
 Additionally the combustion process can form at inappropriate temperatures by means of 
 reactions catalyzed by the ashes a family of hydrocarbons usually cyclical high destructive 
 power of genomic features of human cells which results in the production of cancer cells 
 Other procedures applied on a smaller scale such as autoclaving and destruction by radiation 
 (including from sources of microwave) for not reducing the volume of disposable material 
 are not considered appropriate for the disposal of waste 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the case of hospital and industrial waste due to the components present in it the quantity 
 of heavy metals in the ash coming from the incineration is absurdly high greatly increasing 
 the risk of contamination of groundwater when accommodated in landfills 
 
 The increased presence of chlorine components in these types of waste can also greatly 
 enhance the generation of carcinogenic residues which are present in the exhaust gases of 
 combustion and in the generated microparticles 
 
 The laws currently in force (as the National Solid Waste Policy enacted in August 2010 
 which stipulates the prohibition of dumps) may become even more expensive the treatment 
 of these special wastes which practically requires the search for new technologies for waste 
 treatment that can make the process cheaper and less polluting 
 
 It is for all the reasons above that VORAX was invented as total solution to satisfy the 
 scientific challenge summarized above Vorax has appropriately received its name thanks 
 to its power to swallow almost any type waste disposal and providing an economical and 
 highly efficient environmental destination 
 
 WPP Energy asserts to the world that the technology used in Vorax WTU DuoTherm 
 of dry distillation via thermal gradient WITHOUT the use of oxygen is the most 
 effective waste treatment solution in the world

 VORAX TREATS ALL WASTE TYPES & SOLVES THE 
 UNIQUE PROBLEMS OF MEDICAL & BIOHAZARD 
 
 Medical waste generated at health care facilities includes a large component of general 
 waste and a smaller proportion of hazardous waste which contain infectious agents toxic 
 chemicals or pharmaceuticals radioactive and genotoxic 
 
 All individuals exposed to hazardous health care waste are potentially at risk including those 
 within health care establishments that generate hazardous waste and those outside these 
 sources who either handle such waste or are exposed to it as a consequence of careless 
 management 
 
 According to the U S Environment Protection Agency improper management of discarded 
 needles and other sharps can pose a health risk to the public and waste workers For 
 example discarded needles may expose waste workers to potential needle stick injuries 
 and potential infection when containers break open inside garbage trucks or needles are 
 mistakenly sent to recycling facilities Janitors and housekeepers also risk injury if loose 
 sharps poke through plastic garbage bags Used needles can transmit serious diseases 
 such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis 
 
 Measures to ensure the safe and environmentally sound management of health care 
 wastes can prevent adverse health and environmental impacts from such waste including 
 the unintended release of chemical or biological hazards including drug resistant 
 microorganisms into the environment thus protecting the health of patients health workers 
 and the general public 
 
 Proper measures to deal with medical and biohazard waste typically come at a high cost of 
 up to $2500 per ton depending on the region 
 
 
 
 VORAX IS A TOTAL SOLUTION FOR 
 MEDICAL WASTE WITH NO PRESORTING OR 
 STERILIZING NEEDED
 
 
 43
 
 Current best practices and often laws state that the hazardous waste must be separated 
 treated and disinfected Common practice now is that all infectious medical wastes are 
 disinfected by autoclaves strong heated containers used for chemical reactions and other 
 processes using high temperatures and steps must be taken to dispose them 
 
 Even the non hazardous medical waste is not often considered normal waste as long as the 
 governing bodies in a territory have not approved the wastes being harmless in accordance 
 with the waste management laws medical wastes are still considered infectious 
 
 Landfills are not equipped to handle the unique requirements of medical waste and often 
 dont have the most basic infrastructure such as water electricity and etc 
 
 Infectious waste must not be dumped it must be burned Medical waste incineration devices 
 (VORAX ) are needed

 Key Data Summary 
 
 Using 2780 kCal/kg 400 tons of waste per 24 hour day generates 10 93MWh (NET) or 262 32MW/24 hours
 
 656kWh (NET) per ton of waste 
 
 1 525 tons of waste = 1MW (NET)
 
 
 
 
 
 10 93MWh (NET) assumes MSW with PCI (Lower Calorific Value of 2780 kCal/kg) Higher outputs achievable depending 
 on types of waste used as feedstock 
 
 Example TDF (tires) 7000 kCal/kg = 35 22MWh gross = 32 17MWh net (after Vorax electrical consumption) 
 
 Example WDF 4500 kCal/kg = 22 64MWh gross = 19 59MWh net (after Vorax electrical consumption)

 INTERNATIONAL AWARD2016IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CATEGORY 
 AWARDWINNING

 The technology is patented in over 40 countries and is being made 
 available for distribution globally by WPP Energy after initially being 
 deployed in Brazil 
 
 
 
 VORAX Q & A
 
 What are the Pre sorting requirements if any 
 
 No pre sorting no pre selection and no pre classification is required the waste of various categories 
 can be processed simultaneously solid liquid and pasty waste 
 
 Can Vorax accept Plastics 
 
 Yes Vorax thrives on plastics of all types no physical or chemical restrictions exist as to which plastics 
 it can handle Furthermore on our 22T 400Tpd models plastics provide very high energy output for 
 electricity generation 
 
 What type of Warranty does Vorax come with 
 
 Vorax comes with a standard Two Year Comprehensive Warranty with Warranty extension options 
 available 
 
 What about replacement parts 
 
 A list of spare parts will be provided that we recommend to have on hand for quick change cases 
 this list includes fusion module (5 10 year life expectancy on the module itself) heat torches pumps 
 motors gaskets sensors 
 
 What is the expected downtime for VORAX per day/week or month 
 
 The equipment will only be stopped for maintenance reasons normal operation will occur 24 hours a 
 day 30 days a month Maintenance is monthly 1 stop per month for a maximum of 12 hours 
 
 When necessary a refractory inspection will take place on the fusion module For faster maintenance a 
 new fuser module should be purchased as replacement parts 
 
 What is the expected life expectancy of a VORAX Model 
 
 With all maintenance performed correctly the expectation is that life expectancy exceeds 40 to 50 
 years the equipment is made of steel all components used are of industry standard if necessary these 
 components can be replaced by new ones not interfering with useful life 
 
 What is VORAXs efficiency 
 
 VORAX reduces in mass of 10 1 and volume up to 250 1 Vorax Fusion Module Effeciency is 70% 
 
 For more info refer to the Energy Balance/Comsumption Table (page 58)
 
 
 
 
 
 How much Electrical Energy can Vorax Produce (22T 400Tpd models only)
 
 At the upper end of the scale using the largest Vorox Model Orion 400Tpd and burning very 
 high calorie waste such as tires Vorax can produce 32MWh net after factoring for its own energy 
 consumption requirements Our smallest WtE model Zeta One capacity of 22Tpd the net power 
 produced (tires as feedstock) is 1 77MWh 
 
 For MSW of varying compositions and moisture levels electrical energy outputs can be expected to be 
 roughly within the range of 1/4 to 1/2 of the values provided in the Tires example above Mixing MSW 
 with Plastics and Tires increases the amount of electrical energy that can be produced 
 
 Clients who submit details of the proposed waste composition will receive a more accurate 
 estimate of the electrical power output to be expected 
 
 Is steam based power generation from waste heat the only type of electrical energy that Vorax 
 can produce 
 
 No Vorax can be configured to produce Syngas as the output to be used for power generation and 
 also a future version will be available with the custom option of steam reforming and prism membranes 
 technology to achieve 95% purity of H2 in high production volumes (400T/day Vorax Orion model = 
 11 000kg 30 000kg per 24 hour day of H2 depending on waste type) 
 
 Does the total daily capacity need to be divided by 24 to determine the max loading capability 
 per hour What happens if we exceed that capacity 
 
 For each model the waste feeder will be set to this condition the torch is set for processing this volume 
 For example A 2t / day model processes 83 33kg/hour the waste feeder will be set to that maximum 
 accordingly 
 
 Can you tell us more about the award that VORAX won 
 
 VORAX equipment technology received from the German government through the Germany Brazil 
 Chamber of Commerce the Cities of the Future award This award was sponsored and delivered by 
 BASF Chemical Parallel to the award VORAXs state of the art technology was also presented 
 at the IV Germany Brazil Innovation Seminar which annually brings the main trends in innovation and 
 technology 
 
 How loud is VORAX Can I use it indoors and outdoors 
 
 Well within accepted ranges 77dB (2T to 10Tpd Models) up to 90dB (22T to 400Tpd Models) 
 
 Yes VORAX can be used both indoors and outdoors
 
 
 
 What residual is left from VORAX 
 
 The only residual product after the two thermal products is a saleable inert by product material in 
 demand by the construction and asphalt industry The by product can be used as an asphalt filler ie 
 as a complement to the asphalt mix itself this by product can be pressed and through this process 
 produce bricks it can also be aggregated into other materials manufacturing of precast parts and lastly 
 as a suggestion is the use with noble rubble The byproduct with the characteristic of crushed sand 
 similar to crushed stone 
 
 
 Inert ceramic product Can be used in constructions as 
 concrete load cement glass wool asphalt tile etc 
 Heavy materials such as lead arsenic cadmium chromium 
 mercury etc are retained within the crystal structure 
 VORAX reduces in mass of 10 1 and volume up to 250 1
 
 Whats the risk of radioactivity on the Vorax and the inert residue considering the elemental 
 disintegration of waste 
 
 There is no radioactivity in the waste unless it is radioactive but after processing at 1600 C this 
 radioactivity is zero ie the waste is inert and not hazardous Thats why VORAX uses high temperature 
 processing 
 
 
 
 What are the safety features of VORAX 
 
 VORAX features a design that maximizes safety as it is equipped with anti explosion systems On 
 top of the fusion module is installed a valve that moves as the internal pressure increases instantly 
 preventing explosions 
 
 In the event of a power outage bypass valves are installed at the fusion module outlet that direct all the 
 gas into the atmosphere to prevent this gas from standing still inside the fusion module 
 
 In order for the melting torches to be supplied with gas and air the system goes through a pressure and 
 flow check control and also a leak check if these parameters are incorrect a fault system is activated 
 and the equipment is not supplied 
 
 For safety reasons for any fusion module door that is opened the grinding is paused and only resumes 
 when the doors close 
 
 For any fault a visual and audible alarm is issued on the equipment control screen 
 
 All equipment complies with safety regulations Regulatory Standard 12 br safety at machinery and 
 equipment work Created by the Ministry of Labor and Employment Regulatory Standard No 12 aims 
 to ensure that machinery and equipment are safe to use worker 
 
 The equipment has level sensors that control the levels of waste feed so that there is no overload of the 
 feeders The same is true for sodium bicarbonate feeders 
 
 If there is a pressure drop the system stops for the operator to check the leak location and failure

 What is a Fusion Module 
 
 The fusion module fuses the waste through the high temperature torches The solid part of this molten 
 residue is conveyed to a collection mat and the gaseous part is released by the upper part of the 
 module this gas fraction is the synthesis gas then the fusion module fuses the waste and releases the 
 synthesis gas For optimal heat retention the fusion module is lined with refractory bricks it helps to 
 conserve heat making the process more efficient avoiding losses to the environment 
 
 What technology exists within the Vorax Fusion Module to be able to accomplish the dramatic 
 increase in temperatures between the two chambers 
 
 We are able to reach very high temperatures and transition between the first chamber at 9000C 
 and the second chamber at 16000C because Vorax is equipped with gas burners assisted by low 
 amperage (back plasma) electric discharges Transient because it is in the range between cold plasma 
 and thermal plasma and has anomalous behavior sometimes the amperage may increase with the 
 discharge sometimes it may decrease today we work with 3 amps up to 10 amperes is still considered 
 transient plasma 
 
 
 
 
 
 How is Vorax different from the other technologies in the market 
 
 Vorax is in a technological classification of its own after more than 10 years of R&D from a brilliant 
 team of scientists and in the invention of DuoTherm technology which puts Vorax ahead of plasma 
 Incineration Gasification and also traditional pyrolysis Vorax is thought of as a quantum leap over 
 traditional Pyrolysis in part because two thermal processes one at 9000C and the other at 16000C 
 forming a thermal gradient liquifying all solids completely even inert materials such as sand or 
 iron 
 
 Vorax completely destroys the garbage effectively and safely without combustion or an auxiliary 
 equipment 
 
 Vorax requires no combustion of waste and disintegrates as a whole completely destroying infectious 
 pathological and organochlorined materials having as a solid byproduct a ceramic matrix (do not 
 produce ashes) and inert in the bottom of the fusion module with commercial application the gases 
 formed in the process have no dioxins or furans and are of low volume because they only arise from the 
 disintegration of the material and not from combustion or gasification traditional processes 
 
 The fusion module in turn works in negative atmosphere preventing gas leaks The process is dry 
 distillation of the waste with absence of air no combustion of waste which provides extreme reduction 
 of the exhaust gases as compared with conventional processes and moreover does not allow the 
 formation of dioxins or furans in view of lack of oxygen and high temperature 
 
 The garbage is not mixed with the atmospheric air and suffers a dry distillation meaning it is 
 completely disintegrated and liquified in the absence of air which considerably reduces the formation 
 of pollutants harmful to the environment and health including carcinogens The gases formed inside 
 the fusion module are suddenly sucked and cooled (quench) to then be treated and neutralized in an 
 immersion tank alkaline Last generation filters coal based activated ensure that the emissions meet 
 environmental standards

 Landfills a global environmental problem
 
 Vorax was designed by a team of world class scientists and engineers to accept nearly every 
 possible type of waste to address the global problem of landfills and the reality that the earth 
 is drowning in garbage After treating the waste Vorax leaves only an inert resalable Vorax 
 byproduct leaving nothing to dump at landfills saving money real estate and pollution 
 simultaneously 
 
 VORAX can save governments the massive cost and the long list of problems that come 
 from creating and maintaining landfills VORAX can eliminate landfills and their harmful 
 pollution caused by methane gas and carbon that landfills bring 
 
 VORAX also has a Waste to Energy component where models from 22T 400Ton per day 
 can be equipped to produce ample amount of electricity turning trash into money 
 
 VORAX owners can also benefit by collecting landfill tipping fees 
 
 The need to take action now
 
 Projected global waste increase of 2 2 billion tons annually by 2025
 
 The staggering amount of landfill waste produced each year poses enormous challenges 
 for the health of our planet Despite efforts by many of us to Reduce Reuse and Recycle 
 the fact is were generating more landfill trash now than ever before Worse yet our waste is 
 projected to nearly double globally over the next 15 years 
 
 Today the average American throws out about 1 000 pounds of garbage each year 
 Americans generated about 250 million tons of trash last year according to U S EPA 
 estimates Globally were producing a colossal 1 3 billion tons of landfill waste annually with 
 a projected increase to 2 2 billion tons by 2025 The environmental problems caused by 
 landfills are numerous Due to massive global scale some say the scope of our global trash 
 crisis could exceed the challenges we currently face with climate change 
 
 
 
 MANY REGIONS MUST SHIP WASTE 
 BY SEA TO AN OFFSHORE ISLANDHOLES ARE DUG IN THE ISLANDS 
 AND OFTEN LINERS ARE NOT USED 
 WASTE POLLUTION THEN SEEPS 
 AND CONTAMINATES THE WATER
 64
 
 Tougher environmental standards instituted have resulted in waste management companies 
 closing many facilities Local dump sites have been replaced by a smaller number of regional 
 mega landfills often located hundreds of miles away 
 
 Waste now must travel farther from a household trash can to the landfill The longer trips 
 mean more greenhouse gas emissions from trucks trains and barges Depending on the 
 route one ton of garbage traveling 500 miles by train could generate 115 pounds of carbon 
 dioxide Trucking is even less efficient and produces more air pollution 
 
 
 
 65
 
 
 Greenhouse gas pollution
 
 Our landfill problems not only can be compared to climate change but they also contribute to it As 
 organic material such as food scraps break down in a landfill they eventually release methane into the 
 atmosphere This greenhouse gas is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide Methane from landfill sites 
 account for 12% of total global methane emissions and almost 5% of total greenhouse gas emissions 
 
 Ground water pollution
 
 Toxic waste that leaches from landfills into our soil and groundwater are extremely harmful to human 
 animal and plant life The protective barriers and stricter standards of modern landfills only delay the 
 inevitable 
 
 Even though todays landfills cannot legally receive hazardous wastes they can still slip in resulting in 
 a dangerous toxic soup Aside from industrial and household chemicals growing amounts of electronic 
 waste containing lead cadmium and mercury are serious threats to water quality issues 
 
 The EPA reports that of the nearly 3 million tons of electronic waste 25 percent or less were recycled 
 Noxious e waste materials accumulate and can eventually penetrate landfill linings or be washed away 
 periodically by rain and into our municipal water supplies VORAX can process electronic waste

 shares 
 
 (Subject to SEC FINMA and any other regulatory approvals required) 
 
 WPP Energy GmbH has is in the process of executing a Binding MOU to acquire a 90% interest in a Public 
 Company which is now with the SEC attorney for review and execution 
 
 WPP will provide exclusive worldwide licenses to the public company for the manufacture of Vorax facilities 
 
 (See www wppenergy com for a complete explanation of the technology) 
 
 WPP will also provide operations licenses to the Public Company for the operational use of the Vorax 
 Facilities throughout the world 
 
 The public company intends to have an Offering to issue a convertible preferred stock (amount to be 
 determined) subject to SEC approval 
 
 It is further intended that the public company will accept payment in Tokens at an exchange value of a 
 minimum of $1 per token or 25% over the current market value 
 
 The issuance of the Public Company Convertible Preferred Stock will be priced at the time of Offering The 
 pricing of the convertible Preferred Stock will be at $25 to $50 per share with an estimated 8% annual 
 dividend payable quarterly 
 
 WPP Tokens will carry a valuation premium of 25% over fiat currency when purchasing the Preferred Shares 
 
 When purchasing Preferred Stock with WPP Tokens you must provide a least a 25% fiat currency component 
 to the purchase 
 
 
 
 2 SO HOW DOES IT WORK 
 
 EXAMPLE 1
 
 WPP Token trades at $0 50 and the Preferred Share is expected to be priced between $25 $50 per share 
 
 WPP will accept WPP Token at a value of $1 00 when purchasing a convertible preferred share and at least 
 a 25% in fiat Component 
 
 To Purchase a Preferred share at $25
 
 You will need a fiat requirement of $6 25 and 18 75 WPP Tokens (when WPP Token price is at $0 50 but 
 accepted at $1 value)
 
 EXAMPLE 2
 
 WPP Token trades at $1 50 and the Preferred Share is expected to be priced between $25 $50 per share 
 
 WPP will accept WPP Token at a value of $1 875 when purchasing convertible preferred share and at least 
 a 25% fiat Component 
 
 To Purchase a Preferred share at $25 
 
 You will need a fiat requirement of $6 25 and 10 WPP Tokens (when WPP Token price is at $1 50 but 
 accepted at $1 875 value)
 
 MORE DYNAMICS IN MOTION
 
 This provides a dynamic aspect to WPP Token as it provides Token Holders access to the equity markets 
 where dividends can be earned and crypto is valued favorably over fiat 
 
 Furthermore traditional stock market buyers will recognize it may be a better strategy to buy WPP Token first 
 before buying the shares with fiat currency so the 25% valuation premium can be obtained 
 
 The Convertible Preferred Stock will also have redemption rights backed by a cash component of the Principal 
 Investment which will be placed in an IOLTA Trust account at a Major World Bank This offering is subject to 
 Swiss Law and SEC approval 
 
 
 
 The Public Company intends to issue the Convertible Preferred Stock which will be convertible into common 
 shares of stock or may be traded as a separate stock on an exchange subject to SEC approval 
 
 It is intended the Public Company will have the exclusive worldwide license for the WPP VORAX technology 
 including 
 
 1 Operational licenses for VORAX Plants
 2 WPP VORAX Manufacturing facility licenses 
 
 
 2 INTENT TO ASSET BACK WPP TOKEN WITH COMMODITIES
 
 The WPP Engineering teams blockchain chemical industrial and electrical engineering are working together 
 to
 
 accomplish the tie in of H2 (Hydrogen Gas) production and target H2 Reserves/Reservoirs into the blockchain 
 
 The intent is to Asset Back and correlate WPP Token to the retail price of 1 Nm3 of H2 (Hydrogen Gas) 
 (Subject
 
 to SEC FINMA and any other regulatory approvals required)
 
 For information purposes only 
 
 1 Nm3 of H2 = 0 08988 of 1 Gallon of H2 
 
 WPP market observations as of March 2019 reveals the price of H2 in the USA at approx $16 per gallon
 
 = $1 43 per 1 Nm3 
 
 The intent of our overall strategy is to tie the price of the token to the retail price of 1 Nm3
 
 no later than the end of Q3 2020 
 
 Prior to that the strategy is to create incremental levels of asset backing of the token along the way
