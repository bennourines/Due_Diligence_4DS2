token \xe2\x80\x9cZEUS\xe2\x80\x9d designed to provide users with the ability to donate to charities disaster relief programs and fundraising campaigns without the interference of any third party or governing body Crowdfunding Examples \xe2\x80\xa2 Natural or man made disaster relief \xe2\x80\xa2 Illness or injury relief \xe2\x80\xa2 Poverty relief \xe2\x80\xa2 Funeral expenses \xe2\x80\xa2 Education donations \xe2\x80\xa2 Athletic team fundraising Mission Zeus Network is built on the Ethereum Network which enables fast and secure transactions where funds can be sent to anyone globally within seconds This revolutionary technology provides a platform for any user to participate in charitable giving no matter what the prior limitations may have been As long as one has an internet or mobile connection a transaction can take place Vision As we know it donating to charity is big business with many organizations handling several million in revenue Unfortunately many organizations have become morally and ethically unsound in how they handle those funds By applying our blockchain technology Zeus Network will create a new pathway for both for profit and non profit crowdfunding

progress bar showing transparency to their donors Once users accomplish their campaign fundraising goal or have decided to withdraw funds Zeus Network will deposit to nominated account/address of their choice within 24 48 hours Copyright 2018 ZeusNetwork 2 \x0cZeusNetwork Technical Features Platform The ZEUS token powers all of the crowdfunding campaigns offered on the ZeusNetwork Platform All of the campaign details are presented in the platform and their data is fetched directly from the Ethereum blockchain since each campaign will have a unique address associated with it for donations To start a campaign the user must visit www zeusfundme com and click the Start Crowdfund button in the top right hand corner The user will be asked to fill out a form with all the requested data about their campaign which will be sent to the ZeusNetwork team for review The ZeusNetwork team will perform a vetting process to guarantee only legit campaigns will run on the platform and to provide safety to our donors that the causes are fully backed by a verifiable story Once the vetting process is complete and the cause has been determined to be legit the ZeusNetwork team will create a smart contract to receive Ether funds from donors and forward to the individual or charity in need Each campaign smart contract will show the following \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 ETH raised in Wei units Wallet where the donated funds are sent Wallet where the 1% TX fee is sent Each campaign will have an associated QR code or address displayed in the platform for the donator to use when making a donation Additionally a link to an explorer for each campaign is presented to the donor to confirm all the transfers completed in the campaign Important Currently all donations must be made with Ethereum but additional cryptocurrencies will be added in the future such as BTC LTC BNB and more Make sure to only use the presented address in the crowdfund platform when donating Copyright 2018 ZeusNetwork 3 \x0cZEUS Token Utility and Fees The ZEUS token is intended to be used as a utility token CAMPAIGN ORGANIZER After the ZeusNetwork team has vetted the organizers story the organizer will need to pay 10 000 ZEUS to deploy the smart contract and begin crowdfunding DONATOR In order for users to be able to donate to a campaign they must hold 10 000 ZEUS in the ERC 20 wallet that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be sending Ether from The smart contract for the campaign will automatically check the donors address to ensure it has a balance of 10 000 ZEUS before accepting the donation See the below example Maria wants to donate 1 ETH to a cause she saw in the ZeusNetwork platform She noticed the campaign requires the donor to hold 10 000 ZEUS in their ERC 20 wallet in order to donate Maria proceeds to buy 10 000 ZEUS and can now donate 1 ETH to that campaign If Maria wants she can sell the Zeus or she can hold it to be able to donate to other campaigns on the ZeusNetwork platform With this we guarantee that the Zeus token is used and helps power the platform FEES Zeus has a HolderCrowdfundFee template that is deployed to Ethereum Blockchain for each campaign Each donation made with Ether in this smart contract will have a 1% fee deducted from it where the fee is forward to the ZeusNetwork team wallet to help cover the costs associated with KYC manual checks The remaining value is forwarded to the donation wallet for the campaign When the ZEUS token volume grows in all markets the ZeusNetwork platform will provide the option for users to donate ZEUS directly to the individual or charity instead of Ether without being charged any fee Smart Contracts ZeusNetwork has developed the following set of crowdfunds contracts that are used together to provide the full functionality of the Zeus crowdfund template Crowdfund Crowdfund is a base contract for managing donations allowing donators to donate Ether to a cause This contract implements such functionality in its most fundamental form and can be extended to provide additional functionality and/or custom behavior The external interface represents the basic interface for purchasing tokens and conform the base architecture for crowdfunds Copyright 2018 ZeusNetwork 4 \x0cCrowdfundFee Add Fee s functionality to each donation The ZeusNetwork team has costs associated with doing a rigorous manual check of each campaign which is cover by the 1% fixed fee charged at each donation This fee is presented transparently in the blockchain and you can check all the transfers using the etherscan explorer Freezable Crowdfund Add Freezable functionality This feature is used when despite the ZeusNetwork team completing a rigorous verification of the organizer and their story the team finds out that the organizer or story is not legit In these instances the ZeusNetwork team will freeze the donations to the contract limiting the amount of damage caused Another usage for this feature is when the donation goal was already accomplished or the individual or charity designated to receive the donation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need it anymore HolderCrowdfund Is an extension of Crowdfund that only allows donors with a pre determined token holding to be able to donate to a campaign This contract enables the ZEUS token utility before ZEUS gains high exchange volume and can start to be used as the main currency in the crowdfunds The ZeusNetwork team decided that in order to donate to the campaigns the user must have a certain amount of ZEUS in their wallet without it the donator cannot donate This contract has already been deployed to the Ropsten Testnet if you would like to test it out Just ask the team to transfer you test ZeusNetwork tokens from this contract in order to donate test ETH to one of the test campaigns so you can see how the ZeusNetwork contracts will work Test Instructions 1 Go to https //faucet ropsten be/ and enter your Ropsten ERC 20 address to be sent test Ether Note This is different than your ERC 20 address where you hold your real Zeus Network tokens 2 Ask the ZeusNetwork team to transfer you test ZeusNetwork tokens to your Ropsten ERC 20 address 3 Go to https //zeusfundme com/index php/discover/ and click Donate Now on one of the campaigns listed 4 Send the test Ether to the address displayed Note the text under the Campaign name stating that you must have
