COIN Whitepaper This paper is the result of collaboration between cotton farmers agents buyers blockchain specialists government officials and business advisors For centuries the cotton industry in 3rd world countries has been operating on an archaic system prone to data manipulation and payment inefficiency COTTON COIN resolves these major issues by using blockchain technology where all data and interactions are auditable transparent and secure way on COTTON COIN\xe2\x80\x99s distributed ledger COTTON COIN\xe2\x80\x99s versatile solution enables instant peer to peer payment cotton authentication and grower to buyer traceability It also features two front end dApps for the B2B and B2C markets offering a plethora of services such as cotton advice live price monitoring and comprehensive tracking 1 1 Cotton Industry Popularly known as white gold cotton is the world\xe2\x80\x99s most in demand commodity It is the most commonly used natural fibre and is in nearly 50% of our clothing and 80% of our bedding accessories Although cotton has a clean wholesome image long cultivated by the garment industry in reality it is not Cotton is one of the most chemically dependent crops in the world While only 2 4 % of the world\ s cropland is planted with cotton it accounts for 24% and 11% of the global sales of insecticide and pesticides respectively Some genetically modified (GMO) varieties which are resistant to some insects and tolerant of some herbicides now make up more than 20% of the world\ s cotton crop About 20 million tonnes of cotton are produced each year in around 90 different countries China United States India Pakistan Uzbekistan and Brazil account for over 75% of the global production 4 COTTON COIN \x0c1 2 The Problem As lucrative as cotton trade might be it is tough being a cotton farmer For over two hundred years the cotton industry has been plagued by various problems poor working conditions non and delayed payment to farmers poor quality cotton environmental pollution lack of government support corruption scams and more This has only worsened with time as global warming and ozone depletion made the weather highly unpredictable and unfavourable to cotton farming All these affect the quality consistency and sufficiency of the crop It\xe2\x80\x99s every cotton farmer\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare Therefore it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to learn that more than 300 000 cotton farmers in 3rd world countries like India have killed themselves since 1995 Mostly by hanging or drinking Mosanto a very potent pesticide A study by the International Food Policy Research Institute revealed that indebtedness and destitute as the main reasons 5 COTTON COIN \x0c2 0 Solution Overview Since 2015 we have been working closely with key players in the cotton industry to resolve procurement issues and improve global distribution The most pressing issues that we have identified are lack of funding and trust While developed countries like the US is more supportive of their farmers with their progressive Farm Bill the same cannot be said of 3rd world countries Not only are farmers being given inadequate subsidies payments from government entities mostly never reach these farmers due to corruption The cotton industry is constantly threatened by debates lawsuits inefficiencies and scams that even data coming from a 3rd party traceability system is viewed with suspicion by the participants For such an important commodity it\xe2\x80\x99s high time that a viable solution is found 2 1 Our Solution We needed a technology which ensures that the cotton related data cannot be corrupted or modified in any way by any party Thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto the anonymous creator of blockchain we now have the most appropriate solution COTTON COIN COTTON COIN runs on blockchain protocol that creates a trusted transaction ledger to integrate consumers supply chain participants and authorities in one ecosystem COTTON COIN has a built in peer to peer payment network can be used as an alternative to fiat currency offering instant payment by bypassing corrupted intermediaries In addition COTTON COIN has a backend growers to buyers blockchain traceability solution that can manage more than 1 000 000 transactions each day Once implemented we are expecting a vibrant ecosystem involving more than 10 000 agents and 30 million participants (farmers agents buyers etc) throughout the world Two front end B2B and B2C dApps help to authenticate cotton sources tracks delivery and monitors cotton prices 6 COTTON COIN \x0cOur versatile COTTON COIN solution will help to improve the distribution of cotton resolve procurement issues fight off corruption support fair trade and build trust among the cotton supply chain companies consumers and authorities in the emerging markets We believe that building a self sustainable business through proper management is better than any type of government aid Our mission is To make Cotton more transparent To democratize the access to Cotton related information as a common property To enable technology to become the \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d To reduce the scale and effect of epidemics and Cotton frauds in emerging countries all around the world To educate people through incentivizing conscious consumer behaviour To help small Industries to be more competitive 7 COTTON COIN \x0c3 0 Instant Payment System COTTON COIN is an ASIC resistant utility coin with X11 hash algorithm This is important as we do not want miners who are neither in the industry nor supportive of cotton farming to benefit by generating and dumping COTTON COINs into the exchanges for quick profits It is our intention to stabilize the price of COTTON COIN by reducing open market volatility MASTERNODES secure blockchain network and make transaction instantly In return node holders get a high daily reward DECENTRALIZED peer to peer technology does not require a 3rd party like a bank to complete the transaction DARKSEND enables you to send anonymous transaction to another party PROOF OF STAKE provides extra coins to node holders as well as helps to secure the network further 8 COTTON COIN \x0cGLOBAL PAYMENT system that\xe2\x80\x99s fast and secure SECURE ENVIRONMENT provided by X11 hash algorithm 9 COTTON COIN \x0c4 0 Versatile Traceability System COTTON COIN enables all companies of the cotton supply chain to manage logistics and cotton safety related data in their operations Identification tools of various technologies are applied to planting transport and cotton packages to enable the tracking of items throughout the whole supply chain Cotton products in retail can be traced back to their origin together with cotton safety related information Cotton Producer The basic process of the cotton supply chain can be broken down to a series of activities The roles activities and their input / output data can vary in different categories and in different countries COTTON COIN\xe2\x80\x99s modular structure enables it to easily customize the process flow and its data requirements according to the requirements Connecting the physical and digital is done via QR codes with COTTON COIN\xe2\x80\x99s mobile dApps to read/write/update data about a tracked item 10 COTTON COIN \x0cAdditional features Cotton safety alerts Reputation system Supporting conscious consumer behaviour Cotton safety alerts are built into the whole process and can be triggered by certain events E g if a Cotton transport takes longer than the average it can trigger an alert at the receiving side to check on the transport for suspicious activities An internal reputation scoring system helps supply chain participants to rate their own suppliers through their common business transactions COTTON COIN provides a mobile dApp for consumers to check the history and cotton quality of the cotton products and provides incentives for frequent usage 11 COTTON COIN \x0c5 0 Industry Management Tool 5 1 B2B Mobile dApp COTTON COIN provides a multilingual mobile admin dApp optimized for low end phones Using the dApp is role based each role (e g Industry refine house packaging house etc ) has its own processes menus and functions such as Logistics transactions sending and receiving transport verifying information provided by the previous step Cotton safety information providing weight package number farm name etc Identification tool management \xe2\x80\x93 inventory and ordering of identification tools and transactions Authority tools \xe2\x80\x93 functions of the supply chain enforcement for the authority The mobile dApp uses the phone\ s camera to read 1D/2D barcodes to identify items (Cotton package transport Cotton product) as part of processes 12 COTTON COIN \x0cStandard interfaces COTTON COIN is open towards companies with third party logistics or traceability solutions Traceability information can be sent to the system through standard interfaces Supply chain companies which have their own identification tools can request identification serials through an API Reporting tools Supply chain participants automatically get daily weekly monthly reports with tables and charts about their activities 13 COTTON COIN \x0c6 0 Retail And Consumer Tools 6 1 B2C Consumer Mobile dApp Besides supply chain members and the authority COTTON COIN is transparent towards the consumers as well A B2C consumer mobile dApp enables consumers to read the QR codes and view the history and characteristics of the cotton they intend to buy The mobile dApp is available for downloading on Android and IOS smartphones 6 2 Cotton Registry As part of the Cotton safety tools provided to authorities our Cotton Registry and management solution enables national or international authorities to get certain regular status reports from Industries From basic cotton inventory information to sales and export reports the system provides a wide range of information To provide the necessary data Industries need to download an easy to use mobile dApp or connect their systems to our API In the 2nd phase the system will be extended with AI based smart pandemic forecasting and alerting modules to provide authorities with tools to prepare for and to limit the effects of potential outbreaks 14 COTTON COIN \x0c7 0 Blockchain Utilization 7 1 Why the Cotton Industry Needs Blockchain The data provided by the supply chain participants must be immutable Due to the significant distrust and suspicion among consumers supply chain companies and authorities (caused by numerous cotton frauds and corruption) only technically unalterable logistics and cotton quality data can provide credibility As the data in the system is a common property of all participants It must be stored in a shared distributed ledger to provide transparency Although cotton safety related data form all over the world is a property of ours data accessibility must be public and democratic Because the economic inequality is one of the largest social problems and we need a technology which helps to create a fair access to data know how and income Because corruption is a global economic problem and the cotton sector in emerging countries is one of the most affected sectors incorruptible cotton history information leads to transparent cotton supply chains which can make a difference in public health and literally save lives Blockchain Structure Blockchain is implemented for two purposes 1) Token Transaction Ledger The token payment solution will be implemented on a public network using COTTON COIN 15 COTTON COIN \x0c2) Traceability Transaction Ledger Transactional and cotton related information will be stored on a private blockchain and will be driven by an internal technical token the Transaction token COTTON COIN transaction Ledger on public blockchain Traceability information and transaction ledger on private blockchain Supply chain companies will have a COTTON COIN wallet on the public network which can be accessed directly or through the COTTON COIN mobile app a Transaction wallet on the private network which can be accessed by the COTTON COIN B2C mobile dApp 16 COTTON COIN \x0c8 0 Utility Token COTTON COIN can be used in various ways Toll To use COTTON COIN\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain traceability ledger supply chain participants will need to pay for transactions using the token Value exchange There is a lot of information provided by certain type of supply chain companies which is valuable for other supply chain companies Value exchange Consumers get tokens as reward for using the COTTON COIN consumer mobile dApp in retail reading the QR code and viewing the Cotton history This way the system incentives conscious consumer behaviour Value exchange Consumers can use the tokens to order cotton analysis services They remove a part of the cotton product and send it to us for analysis Within 1 2 hours you will receive the results of the cotton analysis in electronic format Right Token holders can rate supply chain companies with which they are in connection with so the system can maintain a supply chain company scoring system 17 COTTON COIN \x0c9 0 Tokenomics 9 1 Buying Traceability Transactions Supply chain participants indicate the number of transactions they want to buy in the COTTON COIN B2B app To cover the cost of the desired number of transactions they can buy COTTON COINs for fiat money or ETH on the Exchange and store it in their COTTON COIN wallet The smart contract automatically deducts 10% of the COTTON COIN tokens and 9% is exchanged to transactions on a fixed exchange rate for supply chain reimbursement (See the Reimbursements process) transfers 1% to the COTTON COIN Consumer Rewards wallet exchanges the tokens to transactions on a fixed exchange rate the remaining tokens are distributed to the solution provider On the private blockchain COTTON COIN deposits the purchased transactions to the supply chain participant\xe2\x80\x99s Transaction wallet 9 2 Reimbursements Each time a supply chain participant buys transactions 9% is exchanged to transactions on a fixed exchange rate for supply chain reimbursement Daily once an algorithm selects the supply chain companies to share the tokens On the private blockchain COTTON COIN automatically deposits the transactions to the selected supply chain members\xe2\x80\x99 transaction wallet 9 3 Paying for Value Added Information Supply chain companies (value providers) can set a price / item on specific Cotton related data they provide If other supply chain companies (the buyers of the value providers) want to obtain those information a smart contract deducts the total price (value added information price multiplied by the actual number of the received tracked goods) from their COTTON COIN wallet transfers the COTTON COINs to the value provider\xe2\x80\x99s COTTON COIN wallet 9 4 Rewarding Conscious Consumers Consumers check the COTTON COIN tracked Cotton product\xe2\x80\x99s QR code using the B2C mobile app A smart contract automatically transfers a pre specified amount of COTTON COIN tokens from the COTTON COIN Consumer Reward wallet to the Consumer\xe2\x80\x99s COTTON COIN wallet as reward 9 5 Selling Tokens Supply chain participants and consumers can sell their excess tokens on the Exchange for a desired rate It creates a selling offer on the Market Buyers can buy tokens on a desired rate when they match the deal is written in a smart contract The seller\xe2\x80\x99s COTTON COINs are transferred to the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s COTTON COIN wallet 18 COTTON COIN \x0c10 1 Transaction Ledger Due to the fact that data stored in a the country wide COTTON COIN system is extremely sensible from a governmental viewpoint we assume in most cases storing transactional data on a public blockchain network will not be acceptable for governmental customers The blockchain layout differs from the traditional public ledger network model for the planned solution is heterogeneous based on real world business logic The protocol will route it\ s mesh network not on traditional IPv4 or IPv6 methods like kademilla but use existing business logic called contract routing Rhyno Technologies is by default part of this contract routing as per the EULA and additional partners interacting with the smart contract framework can find other partners based on this mesh network While self marketing takes place with known blockchain paradigms business logic requires private information retrieval that will be implemented using quantum safe lattice cryptography and zero knowledge transactions as seen in EIP207 and EIP760 Having a heavily USD backed marked interoperability with the utility token is a must which will happen transparently for end users putting the exchange mechanism under the same consensus model for the USD market as seen for the token itself Data storage shall make use of decentralized storage to mitigate redundancy where nodes can only store hashes known to not fall into their contract scope using bloom filters This way we remove interest in unpinning sensitive data for doing so will ruin business reputation outside of the consensus model too Instant transactions for existing Cotton solutions where fee handling and block time acceptance is not an option we offer a lightning network/tumble bit solution for instant off chain transactions while preserving all guarantees of the network 19 COTTON COIN \x0c11 0 Other Planned Developments 11 1 Cotton Safety Sensor Tools For Cotton the environmental conditions of transportation are crucial for Cotton safety We plan to develop a special hardware product which can be built in transportation vehicles and transportation boxes to measure these environmental parameters (temperature humidity time interval geolocation) log them directly to blockchain and build an analyser layer to send alerts when pre set conditions are violated This tool provides proof if the Cotton is kept in appropriate conditions during transportation 11 2 Marketplace COTTON COIN already covers all logistical and Cotton safety aspects of the supply chain To broaden the possibilities of companies we plan to extend it with trading related data (e g pricing inventory contractual conditions) to create a virtual Cotton and Cotton marketplace which enables easier matching of buyers and sellers as well as wizard based contracting with automated conditioning (e g quality or transporting conditions) and escrow based payment 20 COTTON COIN \x0c12 0 Advantages of COTTON COIN Credibility Cost effectiveness Introducing blockchain to provide an incorruptible unalterable ledger combined with a smart Cotton safety alert system creates trust among consumers authorities and supply chain companies To keep costs down COTTON COIN doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require to use costly equipment or enterprise integration The cost of tracking an item can be as low as $1 throughout the whole chain Methodology Consumer involvement We have a top to bottom implementation roadmap for emerging markets which describes how to organize train and communicate such implementation We provide a mobile app and a token based motivation system to consumers to act more consciously when shopping for Cotton Pragmatism Reimbursement Changing processes of the supply chains need time COTTON COIN doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disrupt current contracting or payment methods It extends them with trusted technologies Supply chain participants can get reimbursements for providing more Cotton safety information This is important to make Industries committed to provide proper traceability data 21 COTTON COIN \x0cInteroperability Flexible business models Whole chain approach and general standards (GS1) provide interoperability beyond borders and the opportunity for participants to mitigate common redundant actions COTTON COIN can be implemented by a government or institution in B2G model or by companies (eg Cotton producer) in a B2B model Customized approach COTTON COIN can be used as a full scale tracking solution as well as a transaction ledger on top of an existing traceability The system to follow the custom elements of the customer\xe2\x80\x99s processes 22 COTTON COIN \x0c13 0 Business Plans Detailing the business plan serves informational purposes only and intended to ensure token sale contributors that the company will be able to provide the services they buy for a long term 13 1 Market Market Size Global COTTON market will reach $15 1 Billion by 2021 (Allied Market Research) 2017 2018 2019 2020 23 COTTON COIN \x0cTarget Markets COTTON COIN\xe2\x80\x99s primary target markets are the emerging countries The reasons 65% of the Cotton frauds happen in the emerging countries In many emerging countries corruption is very strongly present in Cotton supply chains and is a major obstacle in making supply chains transparent However there is a strong will in governments to make this Cotton cleaner which gives a strong regulatory background Supply chains in emerging countries lack any form of a traceability system But they have the opportunity to skip several stages of technological advancement They simply leave out DOS based applications or Excel and jump from paper based transaction register directly to blockchain based mobile app driven operation using QR codes Growing middle class in emerging countries and increasing awareness among population drives growing demand for consumer level product history insight Our technology and implementation methodology fits perfectly in the needs of emerging countries Emerging countries represent 60% of the world\ s population and 45% of its GDP 24 COTTON COIN \x0c13 2 Market Analysis Challenges in the COTTON COIN Market Difficulty Long implementation time (6 \xe2\x80\x93 12 months) Solution The funds raised on the Masternode presale shall provide liquidity during implementation Face to face trainings require a lot of resource and organization We have large experience in building and training team Authorities need a lot of consultations We will provide a written guidebook and efficient consultation services to help authorities in their implementation tasks Finding local leaders in target countries is a tough task We will put huge effort into the recruitment of the leaders in the target countries and offer them convincing incentives to motivate them 25 COTTON COIN \x0c13 3 SWOT Analysis of COTTON COIN Strengths \xe2\x80\xa2 One of the largest tractions \xe2\x80\xa2 Cost effectiveness as COTTON COIN is the cheapest solution on the market \xe2\x80\xa2 Practical implementation methodology through experience \xe2\x80\xa2 COTTON COIN ecosystem with a wide range of synergistic tools and applications Weaknesses \xe2\x80\xa2 Lack of international awareness * Large initial funding to kick off the project \xe2\x80\xa2 Few existing sales channels in the emerging countries \xe2\x80\xa2 Distance between the company leaders Opportunities \xe2\x80\xa2 Cotton safety becomes an important development area in emerging countries \xe2\x80\xa2 Growing middle class in emerging countries and increasing awareness among population for consumer level product insight \xe2\x80\xa2 Cotton scandals became well publicized which drives authorities to tighten regulations Threats \xe2\x80\xa2 Government dependency (governmental implementation) \xe2\x80\xa2 Many conflicting interest (because of frauds and corruption) can affect implementations 26 COTTON COIN \x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Government dependency (governmental implementation) \xe2\x80\xa2 Technological issues and lack of best practices regarding blockchain cause uncertainty \xe2\x80\xa2 Cryptocurrency regulations (or the lack of regulations) can affect target markets 27 COTTON COIN \x0c14 0 How We Plan to Overcome the Weaknesses Lack of international awareness We are planning to hold 10 2 exhibitions yearly attend 20 conferences and for the first 3 years come up with targeted B2B and B2A marketing activities We already exhibited at three trade fairs and our experience shows that government and media representatives are open to the topic of Cotton safety and accept our practical arguments Lack of funds for expansion because our business model needs 1 2 years for ROI Our main goal with the Masternode presale is to raise funds to finance the international expansion of COTTON COIN The funds will provide the necessary liquidity to implement the systems in the PPP model Few existing sales channels in the emerging countries We will aggressively look for local and international partners to find channels to the governments and supply chain participants We have convincing arguments we just need to find the leads 28 COTTON COIN \x0c15 0 Marketing And Sales Strategies 15 1 Market Expansion COTTON COIN operates in a buyer/authority driven market According to this the potential target customers/partners list are (in descending order of importance) Cotton safety authorities Trade and export authorities Cotton
