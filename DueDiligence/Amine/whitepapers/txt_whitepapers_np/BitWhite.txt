been rapidly developing for these several years people found that Bitcoin has more potential than just be a kind of electronic currency Especially blockchain the underlying technology of Bitcoin has the unlimited capacity even more valuable than Bitcoin itself The blockchain technology can be applied in the development of different kinds of application which have the same characteristic that is decentralization The emerging of these decentralized applications also promotes a new application architecture which is based on an open source platform Based on this concept we propose the BitWhite

amount of network transaction information which is used to validate the authenticity as well as generate the next block To a normal user it looks like a public ledger on which every single transaction will be recorded and to an application developer it looks like a distributed database which features decentralization open self autonomy and harden against tampering The blockchain presents a very tight relationship with decentralized application which makes it very suitable for store these applications As a specific blockchain the sidechain applies a \xe2\x80\x9cSPV (simplified payment verification) Pegged\xe2\x80\x9d technology to achieve the goal that the user\xe2\x80\x99s asset can be transferred from one blockchain to another which means users can use their current assets to utilize the new cryptocurrency system There will be no need to worry about the disadvantage of 3 \x0cBitcoin that is hard to adapt the innovation and meet the new request What need to be done is just create a sidechain and link it to the main blockchain of Bitcoin By inheriting and reusing the powerful blockchain of Bitcoin other issues such as liquidity shortage and market fluctuation often occurred when a new currency is introduced can be averted Furthermore since the sidechain is a isolate individual system any severe failure will only impact the sidechain itself instead of the whole blockchain thus significantly reduce the risk and\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bcost\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bof\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8binnovations

vs\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bSidechain The scripting engine is a highlight in design of Bitcoin on which not only can transfer the currency but can realize the smart contracts such as multi signature escrow and arbitration and gambling Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s scripting system however applies a concise design setting a series of limitations due to the consideration of security and difficulty of implementation for example it cannot support loop or must strict the length of its scripts or only supports limited numbers of standard transactions The most attractive characteristic of Ethereum is that it significantly expands the scale of functionality of this scripting engine In detail Ethereum adds several instructions such as reading blockchain charging jumping etc as well as releases the limitation of the invoke depth of stakes and functions and length of the script Ethereum claims that its scripting engine is Turing completeness by which developers can carry out almost any computation that can be represented by mathematic model Although with Ethereum expanding script became a prevail approach of decentralized application platform it still has one disadvantage that cannot be ignored the application itself and the data generated by it have to be stored in the same blockchain which makes the blockchain grows extremely rapidly Ethereum tried to slow this trend down by optimizing or compressing the program code and data but still cannot solve the problem completely Moreover since those applications based on scripting have to share the same ledger some parameters i e created time of blockchain cannot be changed which prevents developers from customizing the application Sidechain mechanism in contrast deals with scalability in another way Every sidechain is running in a different distributed network node having separate users investors and development team This partition like solution has resolved the blockchain expansion problem and has made every application has its own ledger on which the consensus mechanism blockchain parameter and transaction mode can be customized For this reason we believe sidechain mechanism is a lower cost more flexible

systems there is no so called \xe2\x80\x9caccount\xe2\x80\x9d to save the user\xe2\x80\x99s balance The balance has to be dealt with by the status transition of the whole transaction system\xe2\x80\x99s status Let\xe2\x80\x99s introduce a new term UTXO standing for unspent transaction outputs Every UTXO has its own nominal price and its owner and each transaction has multiple inputs and outputs Each input includes a reference of current UTXO and a 5 \x0ccryptographic signature generated by private key related to owner\xe2\x80\x99s address If a user own this private key he/she can consume the value of this UTXO in other words the balance this user has is the sum of the currency value of all the UTXO related to the user\xe2\x80\x99s private keys The main advantage of UTXO is high level security which means the user can generate a new address for each of his/her transaction so that he/she cannot be traced It is a great thing for a currency involved transaction but

trustful account voted by community and 101 delegates who have the most votes are allowed to running the nodes which maintain the network and generate the blocks Those accounts who cannot be the top 101 are called \xe2\x80\x9ccandidates\xe2\x80\x9d who can be delegate once they get enough votes to become the top 101 Every BTW user has the right to vote up to 101 delegates and the weights of vote is determined by the amount of BTW owned by this user Each voting round will generate 101 blocks and the ranking change of each voting and delegates will be shown in the next round The new block will be generated in 10 seconds after the previous one and then be broadcasted into network and appended in the blockchain Once new block is added the confirmation count of all transactions before will be increased 1 time After gaining 6 confirmations a transaction can be treated as \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d If the amount of transaction is small less confirmation count is allowed In other words larger confirmation count is necessary when it is a large transaction to improve the security If some failures occurred in a few delegates such as under attacks or shut down the block will miss and this issue will be recorded This problem has an impact on the online rate of this node hence the voting of community Therefore the election of delegate should be treated solemnly for example a delegate needs to have experience on running a website ability to maintain the nodes stable

the DPOS applied is first randomly sorting the delegate list of current round (to make sure the delegate of next round cannot be predicted since the order of delegate of each round will be different) then let delegates create block in turn through a round robin way The main issue of this algorithm is that if a delegate attempt to attack he may broadcast many different blocks which may contact double payment trades to \xe2\x80\x9cfork\xe2\x80\x9d the whole network It is no doubt that if only one delegate betrays the fork will be solved by syncing with the next longest chain However it will take a much longer time to eliminate betrayed nodes as their amount is increasing A few betrayed nodes are enough to have a serious impact on system security which means even we can gain 6 confirmations it still may not be sure that the network is safe To deal with this problem we introduced an algorithm known as PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Same as DPOS PBFT also chooses delegates in the way of round robin The different part is there will not be a block generated after delegates are voted In fact there will be a piece of propose issued to determine the hash code of next block Only when more than 2/3 of all nodes agree with this propose next block will be generated The hash of next block must be the same as that agreed with all delegates of current round Essentially the introduction of PBFT solved the issue of abusing the\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bdelegates\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bright

are also able to fully customize their sidechain system 8 \x0cincluding its own database consensus mechanism trading mode and account architecture Sidechain system can be hosted in the clusters of nodes of individual delegates so that a partitioned mechanism can be naturally generated hence avoid the rapid expansion of the main blockchain Every DAPP is related to a sidechain A sidechain\xe2\x80\x99s core code is developed by nodejs but UI can be programmed by any of front end techniques such as QT HTML or JavaScript The communication between front end and back end is usually implemented under JSON RPC protocol The developer or owner of a DAPP can trace the usage of their application Compare to cryptocurrency that is based on community consensus DAPPs are more like a private company All the transactions within a DAPP are handled by main node which is run by DAPP\xe2\x80\x99s owner The owner of DAPP must have an BTW account like a multi signature account whose major objective is to create a consensus of a new block and to sign it in DAPP\xe2\x80\x99s main node just like multi signature wallet Once a new DAPP is created and signed in main node the SHA256 hash of this block need to be calculated and submitted to the main blockchain of BTW system as a DAPP block by the owner of it When BTW main blockchain received information of a trade including DAPP hash the delegate will compare it with the previous one and then store it into BTW blockchain Then lately when main node is in sync with network the user will validate all DAPP blocks through BTW blockchain which means it is impossible to remove the previous DAPP block from main blockchain Developers can replace BTW blockchain with Bitcoin blockchain to use the same functionality since the usage of BTW API will be the same The security of DAPP can also be guaranteed by Bitcoin blockchain Developers can take advantage of both BTW and BTC as the currency of their DAPP In the case of money in and out when using a DAPP the BTW coin or BTC will be delivered to a DAPP address and appropriate amount of money will be shown in that DAPP\xe2\x80\x99s account ready to use The deposit mechanisms of both BTC and BTW are the same which is to deliver to a particular DAPP address and then the appropriate amount will be shown in the account In every DAPP the account is created by the developer so all deposited BTC or BTW coin will be saved in related address Considering the security only those DAPP accounts owned by trustable signers with multi signature are recommended A withdrawal from DAPP is main node\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility When someone requests a withdrawal of money DAPP main nodes will acquire the request and move the money from DAPP address to BTW blockchain or Bitcoin blockchain Developers are allowed to issue a token in their own DAPP and to use it as the currency of this DAPP These kinds of token can be circulated in DAPP like BTW or BTC but are not allowed to

therefore the third party libraries cannot be imported smoothly and even 9 \x0cworse the modular development cannot be conducted This requires DAPP developers to use a \xe2\x80\x9cbrowserify\xe2\x80\x9d technique to bundle all the third party libraries they used to a JavaScript file so that BTW system can load it and run Some necessary system level API will be

version client is a perfect solution for those super users delegates and developers running on Windows Mac OSX and Linux but only Linux system can run delegate nodes on which blocks forging is enabled The lite wallet client allows users to connect network through full version wallet or API but it is necessary to open all the right of this API by the owner of this full version wallet A full version wallet can download the whole blockchain from other full version wallets through peer to peer network An ordinary user usually use lite wallet to manage his/her BTW account The lite wallet can run on Windows and Mac OSX platform without installation It utilizes the system built in browser It needs to be noted that the lite wallet cannot run as a network node since it would not download the blockchain data but only links with other nodes through HTTP protocol which have several advantages first no blockchain data downloaded would keep the volume small second no private key broadcasted to network make it possible to make all types of trade since all the data will be signed locally If you want to run a delegate node you can use lite wallet to register a delegate account but cannot run delegate node through it to produce block In order to run it downloading and running a full version wallet in Linux would be necessary The DAPP users can take advantage of lite version wallet to manage installed DAPP The APIs of both DAPP and node are available for developer to invoke so that it can make them rapidly and easily creating JavaScript DAPP through Node js The mobile version client allows users to manipulate their own BTW accounts on their mobile devices both iOS and Android platform They can download the client from AppStore or Google Play The backend of the client is

decentralization can be realized otherwise only half decentralization would be supported In this case legal currency can circulate through gateway but transaction information would be made public Full decentralized exchange can still be divided into two types one is peer to peer trade through \xe2\x80\x9catomic cross chain exchange API\xe2\x80\x9d The other one is pending order which require seller transfer an amount of asset to BTW sidechain from other blockchain This moving should be achieved by the SPV proof of frozen assets of main chain Beside with the support of relational database it is

existed in IoT which make it difficult to manage all the devices and identification of every nodes by a single authority BTW sidechain is an excellent solution for it Firstly it can deal with trustiness among different nodes It means that all devices connect to each other to be a distributed network and trade between devices can be verified by consensus algorithm and can be traced audited and analyzed Secondly different types of devices can be connected to different side chains and this natural partition mechanism that we mentioned above can prevent main ledger from explosive increment Let us imagine that a vending machine in a sidechain based IoT can not only monitor and report its own stock but also analyze historic trading data to select suppliers\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bto\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bsubmit\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8btender

system is a decentralized application platform which is designed to lower the threshold for developers such as using JavaScript as develop language supporting relational database to save transaction data and making DAPP development be similar with traditional Web application It is sure that these characteristics are very attractive to developers and SMEs The ecosystem of the whole platform cannot be improved until developers make a huge progress on productivity Also BTW platform is designed to be open for various fields not limited to some particular parts such as finance file storage or copyright proof It provides underlying and abstract API which can be combined freely to create different types of applications In consensus mechanism BTW inherits and enhances DPOS algorithm by which the possibility of forks and risk of duplicate payments would be significantly reduced Furthermore BTW sidechain mode not only can mitigate the pressure of blockchain expansion but also make DAPP more flexible and personal BTW system as a proactive 13 \x0clow cost and full stack solution will surely be a next generation incubator of decentralized applications 14 \x0c
