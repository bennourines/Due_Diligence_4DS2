GLOSSARY 74 \x0cCHAPTER 1 Concept 1 \x0cConcept Sessia\xe2\x80\x99s concept T he current crypto revolution greatly simplifies contact between businesses and clients Decentralization along with the use of digital coins and smart contracts opens up new opportunities for advertising campaigns and produces better outcomes than conventional promotional methods Sessia is a unique software solution for iOS and Android which helps businesses establish direct contact with their clients using the major advantages of blockchain technology Our number one objective is to remove all intermediaries between companies and customers including marketing agencies and social networks regardless of their location or origin We offer brands a revolutionary new approach to advertising which they can use to work directly with their clients spend their advertising budgets on them and reward them with cryptocurrency cashbacks anywhere in the world Sessia has managed to combine a marketplace with a social network enabling people to independently choose goods and services based on their friends\xe2\x80\x99 recommendations Businesses get a great opportunity to distribute their marketing budget among clients who can actually bring new customers rather than pay for the services of third party advertising agencies In Sessia customers are rewarded not only for purchasing goods and services in the app but also for their recommendations which are automatically published in our Feed after the transaction Friends place orders in the same companies or stores Sessia is a social marketplace In our ecosystem companies brands and stores can develop and utilize effective marketing tools to encourage customer activity and loyalty 5 Marketplace \xe2\x80\x94 an e commerce platform where the customer buys goods from numerous stores and companies The world\xe2\x80\x99s largest marketplaces include Amazon Alibaba and eBay \x0cConcept Kicks \xe2\x80\x93 Sessia tokens To make our services available anywhere in the world we issue tokens aka kicks They offer the fastest and most economical way to award cashback Please note that they are not just another cryptoasset but a valuable means of settlement exchange among all Sessia participants By simply developing our social marketplace we can drastically ramp up the intensity of digital coin use in the real economy Kicks will become the key digital currency for paying out bonuses and purchasing goods in the huge retail market The demand for kicks and consquently their liquidity and price depends on the number of services brands and clients For this reason we require a large budget to enter each country so we can rapidly create a sales force and a business support service there as well as organize various Sessia promotions for both companies and their clients Sessia is structured around a ready made market and a CRM platform specially developed for large retail companies The founder of this business has already invested $5 million in it Token sales started on May 16 2018 and their volume is strictly limited to 100 million (which is the equivalent of $150 million) We\xe2\x80\x99ve launched a lucrative promotion in May September 2018 providing considerable discounts for the purchase of kicks $3 million were collected from 2 200 private investors at $0 7 per 1 kick On March 18 2019 we\xe2\x80\x99ve launched a new kicks sale promotion It will last until July 2019 The price has been set higher at $1 5 per 1 kick since the app has now come out of beta testing and has acquired lots of new functions Kicks will be available for use starting on the first day of sale We\xe2\x80\x99re convinced that Sessia will play a major role in the development of cryptoassets and bring them closer to traditional markets Unlike many emerging digital coins our kicks are true utility tokens Not only do they allow users to award cashbacks anywhere in the world they also let you pay for Sessia purchases 6 Utility tokens \xe2\x80\x94 user tokens or app coins that allow future access to a company\xe2\x80\x99s goods or services \x0cConcept withdraw money from your wallet in fiat currencies or transfer it to friends

kicks for engaging new brands and clients to work with Sessia We strictly adhere to principles of transparency integrity effective management and we are committed to developing Sessia and increasing the capitalization of kicks About the project The development of Sessia began in Moscow in 2016 At that time an eponymous company was established in Hong Kong In 2018 the company registered its

businesses can publish their news and ads Companies are free to sell their products directly to Sessia by means of their own payment gateways If a company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have its own payment gateway it can use the Sessia payment gateway Sessia divides companies into two categories A first level partner can be defined as a partner who\xe2\x80\x99s ready to utilize Sessia but does not intend to accept payment for goods and services in kicks A second level partner is willing to work with Sessia and accept payments in kicks In addition to standard functions Sessia offers the following services to deepen the integration of its social marketplace with traditional markets A personal platform where customers will be able to sell each other services and goods for kicks A

the app user instantly becomes a participant of the loyalty program of the company and starts getting cashback which is awarded instantly 1 Make a purchase from any Sessiaaffiliated company 2 The seller scans the Sessia QR code from your smartphone 3 The seller scans your receipt After making a purchase and scanning the QR code your check is automatically published in the Feed which motivates your friends and subscribers to make a similar purchase for which you will be rewarded with a kickback Thanks to blockchain all records of invitations as well as cashbacks and kickback accrual are stored safely and are reliably protected from hacker attacks and changes 17 \x0cPrinciples of operation Receipts in the Feed Unlike other social networks Sessia enables consumers to access information about products bought by their friends and relatives As soon as a friend makes a purchase you receive a notification with all the information including a receipt scan This approach encourages customers to share information about the goods and services they purchase and the stores they trust Sessia automatically posts the information on the transactions made on the approved followers\xe2\x80\x99 pages On the left side of the page subscribers see an ad of the purchased product or service and on the right side there is the detailed transaction information Every publication can be liked discussed shared recommended and even used to go to an offline or online store If a friend makes a purchase using your post he\xe2\x80\x99ll obtain a cashback while you will get a kickback from his purchase The size of the kickback is determined by the seller 18 \x0cPrinciples of operation Cashback and kickback system Sessia\xe2\x80\x99s cashback and kickback system is a very effective way to attract and retain customers It\xe2\x80\x99s also very profitable as there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any intermediaries such as advertisting and marketing agencies By publishing receipts in the Feed a customer promotes and recommends brands and goods to subscribers and their friends That\xe2\x80\x99s why we are convinced that Sessia\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty program which involves kickback and cashback payouts with a flexible settings option will be very popular with businesses The user is free to invite other people to Sessia If user one invites user two they both automatically subscribe to each other\xe2\x80\x99s posts If user two makes a purchase using user one\xe2\x80\x99s post on his wall the former receives cashback and the latter gets a kickback from the merchant If a company is interested in increasing customer loyalty even more and also in attracting new referrals it can ramp up the number of levels of kickback payments and the flexible Sessia loyalty program will allow them to do this quickly and easily 19 \x0cPrinciples of operation Getting a kickback The more friends a client has in Sessia the more kickbacks they\xe2\x80\x99ll get from their (and their friends\xe2\x80\x99) purchases in cases specified by the store Because of this the client is greatly motivated to attract new subscribers to his Feed and encourage them to make purchases at any particular store The post is automatically published in your social network after making a purchase Each time your subscribers make purchases at the same store you\xe2\x80\x99re awarded kickbacks The receipt shows up on the right side of the screen Every subscriber who likes the post automatically becomes this store\xe2\x80\x99s subscriber Blockchain preserves all transactions including all invitations and feedback For instance you spend $20 at a burger place in New York and a friend of yours in Hong Kong comes across this post He eats at the same New York burger place later on As a result he receives the same cashback you did while you also receive a kickback from his order The newly awarded kicks can be spent on purchases anywhere in the world withdrawn or transferred to a friend 20 \x0cPrinciples of operation Benefits for clients For clients Sessia is a very convenient marketplace platform integrated into a social network People may choose stores products and services recommended by their friends and earn on everyday shopping Convenient marketplace Instant cashbacks You can quickly and easily order whatever goods or services you want The automatically updated ratings will help you pick the best Sessia affiliated stores while the geolocation search will help you spot bargains close to you From the moment your QR code is scanned during a purchase your cashback is awarded in less than a second Thanks to the use of cryptocurrency you are free to withdraw it anywhere in the world with practically no commission Recommendations you trust Blockchain protected e wallet Your friends\xe2\x80\x99 purchases automatically show up in your Feed People can comment on them and share them on social networks and also text them Because subscribers can see honest reviews of products and places it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier for them to make the right choice 21 This ensures reliability transparency and low transaction costs It also allows clients to withdraw funds as well as pay for purchases with cryptocurrency \x0cCHAPTER 3 3 Business model \x0cBusiness model Financial forecast and appraisal W e have developed a mobile app with its own social network payment gateways a built in global cashback system and other functions \xe2\x80\x93 and provided it for free to businesses of any size The vast majority of companies even the large ones lack sufficient resources to create such an app with all the functions required to retain their current customers and engage new ones Both a flower kiosk and a large hotel chain can be our corporate clients By the end of 2020 we expect to be working with at least 550 companies Since our business clients will already have their own customer bases we expect about 2 8 million people to be using Sessia According to our estimates in 5 years Sessia will have up to 150 million users of which 2 75 million users will have an average annual receipt of $500 This number is a conservative estimate however we are confident the figure will grow over time This will generate an annual turnover of approximately $1 375 billion and if the average cashback offered by the companies equals 10% and our average commission is 20% of the cashback then our revenue will amount to $27 5 million Over the course of 5 years we are planning to obtain over $2 5 billion in revenue We would be able to surpass these estimates if this year we manage to actively and simultaneously develop in such large markets as the USA Canada Hong Kong Vietnam and Korea This is the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99re launching kicks sale promotions We are convinced that Sessia will radically change the blockchain industry and the crypto market There will be many new companies that will purchase kicks If our calculations are correct by the end of 2020 companies will buy over $137 5 million worth of kicks to award cashbacks and kickbacks to their clients In this way new money will flow into the crypto world and the amount is quite remarkable 23 \x0cBusiness model A pessimistic forecast FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS \xe2\x80\x94 TO BE SAFE 2021 2020 Number of businesses 750 2 000 5 000 2 500 2 600 2 700 2 800 2 900 375 000 780

technologies cryptocurrency theory and applications and learn to apply their knowledge to real life conditions After finishing the course and passing the final exams students receive kicker diplomas Kickvard is another important channel for Sessia to engage sales managers who will sign up new businesses to the business version of the app We are also planning to create a self governing system of awarding community members for conducting transfers and surveys localization advertising and other useful actions It will provide brands with another convenient instrument for customer engagement The rating system will additionally motivate kickers to support and develop the Sessia community 27 \x0cBusiness model We are counting on popular bloggers to become the first kickers (28 Business model 28 Business model) since many of them are already advertising various goods and services We will propose that they publish QR codes while advertising goods on other platforms If the subscribers buy the goods promoted by the blogger then in addition to the regular compensation received from the seller they will also get kickbacks from selling goods to subscribers This approach is lucrative to all participating sides As the impact of advertising and the sales volume increase the blogger\xe2\x80\x99s reward for the work he or she is already conducting will grow and Sessia will gain another corporate client and a large number of new users In order to launch Sessia in different countries we are planning to use the following methods and approaches 1 Hiring a head of sales in each country who will hire 5 10 sales managers with experience in b2b and loyalty programs They will conduct calls and meetings with business representatives and sign them up to Sessia They will also help take the first steps set up their stores and then transfer the business client to the support division This method will be fundamental for entering the market in key countries on which we intend to spend up to 80% of our marketing budget 2 Offering to pay top models to visit 5 10 stores spas beauty salons restaurants etc daily After making a purchase the models who are style and trend leaders demand that their Sessia QR code is scanned In this manner new companies and new users will find out about us It\xe2\x80\x99s a very efficient and inexpensive way of simultaneously engaging businesses and promoting Sessia 3 We will offer various promotions to businesses to operate in Sessia and award more generous cashback For instance we can initially award businesses $500 $1000 for client cashback so that the companies have a chance to evaluate the efficiency of this approach We\xe2\x80\x99ve started the international promotion of Sessia in New York and are planning to continue in other major US cities At the same time work will be conducted in Vietnam Korea Japan Indonesia and Hong Kong Our priorities are the countries where the local legislation and business circles are particularly loyal

bank card or bank account If Sessia team decided to list kicks on a public exchange clients and companies will be buying and selling kicks at market rates 36 \x0cSessia\xe2\x80\x99s internal currency Circulation of kicks within the Sessia ecosystem An important aspect of the Sessia community is the circulation of our internal currency and the establishment of supply and demand mechanisms using kicks 1 Business connects to Sessia and sets up a loyalty program 37 2 Business buys kicks from Sessia to pay out cashbacks and kickbacks to clients 3 Client makes a purchase from this business \x0cSessia\xe2\x80\x99s internal currency 4 Business automatically awards cashbacks and kickbacks according to the loyalty program 5 Client pays with kicks for a purchase made at any Sessia online store 6 Or sells them to Sessia having received money to his bank card or account Kicks remain within the Sessia community and help establish mutually lucrative relations between companies and clients KYC verification We\xe2\x80\x99ve stipulated mandatory KYC verification for every buyer prior to selling the kicks KYC is an abbreviation that stands for Know Your Client This procedure aims to identify users and verify their identities In order to ensure the security of the Sessia ecosystem it\xe2\x80\x99s important that kicks will not be used in speculative and fraudulent schemes 38 \x0cSessia\xe2\x80\x99s internal currency What do you need to obtain Kicks In order to pass KYC verification you have to upload your photograph a photo of your passport or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license a selfie with your passport or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license a selfie with a credit card that you used to pay for Kicks After the verification procedure Kicks will be transferred to the Ethereum wallet designated by the user If a user does not have an Ethereum wallet we will create one and send the access info to the client Risk factors Prior to purchasing kicks please carefully review the risks listed below paying attention to any ambiguous factors and any other information in this document the model of kicks\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour in particular and the relevant remarks in different parts of the document We may not encounter only the risks and uncertainties described below Additional risks that we are not aware of or which we currently consider to be insignificant may have a considerable adverse impact on our business financial situation transaction outcomes and prospects for the future In this case kicks\xe2\x80\x99 market price may decrease and you will not be compensated fully or in part for the expenditures associated with their purchase We apologize for this pessimistic tone but life is life and anything can happen For instance the government may come up with a law that directly prohibits trading kicks or forces crypto exchanges to stop trading them We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly unable to influence such circumstances or protect you from them or their consequences 39 \x0cSessia\xe2\x80\x99s internal currency Risks associated with our business and operations If we do not manage to engage new users corporate ones in particular or our users refuse to work with Sessia and publish their receipts then our profits financial outcome and business will suffer severely The size of our user base (clients and companies) and the degree of user engagement are major factors of our success By December 31 2021 we intend to ramp up the overall number of monthly active users to five million Our financial outcome mostly depends on the successful engagement retention and involvement of active customers We presume that with the expansion of our base of active users and the increase in our market share the growth rate of the number of active users will decrease With a deceleration in the growth rate of the number of active users our business\xe2\x80\x99s efficiency will increasingly depend on our ability to increase the level of user involvement in the current and new markets If customers don\xe2\x80\x99t demonstrate confidence in our product and do not find it useful or reliable we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to attract and retain users or increase the frequency and the duration of their work with the app in other ways A number of other companies that rapidly gained popularity in the social media sphere subsequently faced a reduction (in some cases a rather steep one) of their user base or user activity There are no guarantees that their fate won\xe2\x80\x99t befall us regardless of the fact that our product differs from other social networks Any of the factors listed below can prevent us from retaining and engaging users or increasing their number Currently existing social networks with large user bases may attempt to independently implement our concept It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy and it takes time but they might succeed provoking the emergence of competition in this niche We might not be able to seamlessly integrate new corporate users and provide them with sufficient attention 40 \x0cSessia\xe2\x80\x99s internal currency We might face tax issues related to cashbacks and commission payouts in some countries Users might find our product useless or refuse to utilize it due to issues with confidentiality joint access to information security or other reasons Undesirable changes might be made to our products due to the requirements of legislation state bodies and court decisions (including compromise and settlement agreements) Issues of a technical or other nature might prevent the rapid and reliable distribution of our product or make it insufficiently user friendly Our rules and procedures for user data access and publication might be negatively perceived by users or by society in general If we fail to increase the number and activity of users our revenue financial results and prospects for a future upsurge will be severely damaged 41 \x0cCHAPTER 5 5 Sessia blockchain \x0cSessia blockchain B lockchain\xe2\x80\x99s main objective is transparency If you have questions for Sessia involving transaction history the correctness of loyalty award receiver (do you mean people Then it\xe2\x80\x99s receivers If you mean things it should be \xe2\x80\x98distribution \xe2\x80\x99) company reviews and the like you can verify everything in blockchain outside Sessia We have been developing our app on the basis of providing a solution that entails BigData and have been augmenting it with blockchain capabilities including decentralization immutability the built in support of token creation and transfer as well as all the information required by loyalty programs KICKS \xe2\x80\x94 a utility token An ETH based ERC 20 Token businesses can refill their Sessia account and award cashbacks to their clients clients can refill their Sessia wallets clients can spend their kicks at Sessia stores client can withdraw cashbacks awarded as kicks to the ETH blockchain Kicks transactions within Sessia The cost of Bitcoin and ETH transactions is high and they take between half an hour and several hours These conditions significantly restrict Sessia\xe2\x80\x99s ability to offer the intended functions to millions of users which is why we decided to take a different approach to utilizing blockchain technology We are considering the Tron or EOS platforms for the Master Contract Token in order to store the following types of transactions with kicks refilling the business account which is used to award cashbacks and kickbacks to clients 43 \x0cSessia blockchain payments for orders in marketplace stores using kicks awarding loyalty points to users Every user will have an automatically created address which contains their kicks transaction history Stage 1 Storing transactions in the blockchain network and the method of quick loyalty calculation and awarding Sessia provides the blockchain contract with the order amount list of loyalty receivers and cashback/kickback % for each The contract instantly calculates and awards kicks from the store\xe2\x80\x99s wallet to clients\xe2\x80\x99 wallets Stage 2 Access keys to the user\xe2\x80\x99s wallet are stored in Sessia until the user decides to change the wallet address to their own and in this case they will be the only ones capable of managing kickback withdrawal Stage 3 Deep integration of the Master Token Contract with Sessia\xe2\x80\x99s API and the transfer of loyalty calculation logic to the blockchain network contract The contract independently refers to Sessia\xe2\x80\x99s API for data Data storage in Tron In order to ensure the immutability of Sessia blockchain there will be a Tron blockchain based fixation mechanism Since Sessia ledger\xe2\x80\x99s irreversibility is ensured by Tron miners the level of irreversibility and accordingly the level of security is the same as on the Tron platform itself In order to optimize the cost of data recording in blockchain we will add data to store in tranches (one transaction contains several several operations) We will also store all the companies\xe2\x80\x99 reviews and likes for the entire time Our support service will be able to conceal a review for instance for ethical reasons but the initial review will not be removed and any user will be able to read it Everyone will be capable of tracking and controlling the structure (who invited whom to the company) according to which loyalty awards are calculated 44 \x0cSessia blockchain Kickvard certificates All certificates that confirm the completion of the online university course are stored in the Ethereum network in the Kickvard contract Cryptogateways Accept cryptocurrencies as payment for client orders in Sessia Already accepted ETH CPT KICKS Intend to accept BTC and other cryptocurrencies This crypto gateway will be accessible to business for free \xe2\x80\x93 indicating the address is sufficient Kicks stores that work only within the Sessia platform will act as a great starting platform for startups since all loyalty programs and analytics will be integrated in Sessia functions 45 \x0cCHAPTER 6 6 Key functions \x0cKey functions S essia provides an optimal set of indispensable and practical functions for e

geography Whether our project becomes large scale and profitable depends on the success of each of these Technology It all started with the creation of a client version of Sessia The app existed in its beta version for 2 years The fully functional 14 language client version was released in the fall of 2018 At the same time Sessia Business was developing and its initial release happened in Q3 2018 Now we are actively engaged in localizing the business version setting up cryptocurrency cashback integrating with cryptocurrency exchanges and developing the functional blocks that comprise the

most popular What posts and newsletters are required to increase customer demand Which customers should become VIPs We can provide the correct answers to these and other questions that businesses may have The app accumulates large amounts of data (Big Data) which is enough to turn Sessia into an indispensable business assistant Marketing Sessia has no clear industry priorities We started with the wellness industry testing the user version on three international brands related to wellness products and cosmetics However it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to successfully use it in HoReCa auto business e commerce entertainment industry customer services and other spheres of business thanks to the versatility of our app Geography The focus of our activity has moved from Moscow (where the Sessia
