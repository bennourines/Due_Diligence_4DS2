of blockchain application CryptoKitties a virtual cat breeding game built on the Ethereum blockchain was launched on Nov 28 2017 In a few days the world witnessed the frenzied fashion of global blockchain digital cat breeding The sales volume of CryptoKitties on open market is up to 75 371 units by the end of 22 p m Dec 9 2017 with sales of 24 911 62 Eth amounting to US$11 739 500 33 The average price of each CryptoKitty is 126 11 dollars There is no doubt that CryptoKitties has become a phenomenal decentralised application (DAPP) on Ethereum The overnight success of CryptoKitties re\xef\xac\x82ects the fact that the blockchain industry is at the very beginning of qualitative change digital currency has experienced explosive growth in 2017 and the number of digital wallets has increased to more than 20 million from less than 5 million at the beginning of the year At present Coinbase has more than 2 million users This skyrocketing quantity of users drives up user demands and the great popularity of CryptoKitties has fully revealed the strong user demand The introduction of iPhone gave rise to the realisation that phones are not designed for calling up only similarly the great popularity of CryptoKitties allows people to understand that the blockchain industry is not just con\xef\xac\x81ned to a means of payment but represents a new infrastructure of Internet in the future The great popularity of CryptoKitties indicates that the blockchain industry is starting to enter the \xe2\x80\x9cApp Big Bang\xe2\x80\x9d era 1 2 Social applications will be the real killer application of blockchain Social applications are the most basic and most important form of Internet since the birth of Internet According to the development history of mobile 8/ 46 \x0cinternet from 2008 to 2017 the rise of mobile social applications including Facebook Twitter WeChat Instagram etc and these can be viewed as a real turning point of the transition from traditional Internet to mobile Internet From then on the activeness and realisation potential of mobile Internet grow up in a manner of geometric jump With the explosive growth of digital currency users such geometric growth will reappear in blockchain world The rise of active individuals will be followed by social demands among users thus digital currency users should be equipped with their own communication platform Solution of QunQun Platform In order to enrich the social applications of blockchain on the one hand the threshold for the formulation and operation of blockchain applications should be lowered on the other hand useful and product experiences which exceeds expectations should be provided for social and community applications The \xef\xac\x81rst issue is that not everyone is capable of independently developing a blockchain based Internet community The threshold to create and operate a blockchain community is quite high Therefore a one stop solution is provided by the QunQun Platform for anyone to create a unique community without any thresholds Meanwhile with the help of QUN Token Incentive Mode the operation threshold can be reduced effectively with a short startup period In view of the application experience in blockchain the solution provided by the QunQun Platform comprises a bottom layer using a decentralised blockchain accounting book to record the ownership information of social products and deal with the transaction of social products by virtue of smart contracts so that the ecosystem economy of community will be transparent 9/ 46 \x0cand clear while the application layer shall make use of ef\xef\xac\x81cient centric development architecture so as to fully guarantee the good performance of all read and write operations as well as to effectively avoid the problems of long con\xef\xac\x81rmation duration high cost and congestion inducing thus the smooth and interactive experience of community products can be guaranteed at the extreme QunQun Platform is conceptualized by the members from Qihoo 360 and the original members from the founding team of Huajiao Live The team is good at creating Internet products which exceeds expectations Product scheme 3 1 What\xe2\x80\x99s QunQun Platform QunQun Platform is a blockchain based incentive community platform (the QunQun Platform) Users may create their own theme community on the QunQun Platform without any coding or deployment People can obtain QUN incentives from QunQun incentive pool by operating their own community on the QunQun Platform or participating in the contributions of other communities In order to promote the community ecosystem a new community will be generated every 6 minutes after the formal online opening of the QunQun Platform and anyone can create an initiatory community by paying to the QunQun Platform a community platform toll in QUN (the initial price for such toll would be 49 99 QUN) Each community has a unique door plate (Keyword) which is convenient for the access and memory of community members The ownership of community will be recorded by blockchain account book and cannot be tampered Communities can be traded freely in QunQun market 10/46 \x0c3 2 Community form of QunQun QunQun Platform provides an innovative Social Community Like an autonomous \xe2\x80\x9cTwitter\xe2\x80\x9d each community is independent of each other Members in the community can perform dynamic releases and follow each other All dynamic releases of members can be collected on the in site public Timeline channel In order to deal with the islanding effects of communities and promote content circulation and social development of the community on the QunQun Platform the QunQun Platform provides a unique cross site interaction mechanism by which users can stroll to other communities and \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer\xe2\x80\x9d anybody with an interest to the community as well as synchronously read the dynamic releases and perform interactions with the off site Timeline channel 3 3 App store of QunQun The QunQun Platform will offer a community app store that would provide abundant functions and entertainment applications for all communities The app store will be made available for third party developers who may develop apps and sell them on the QunQun Platform and receive QUN through the revenue sharing model All transaction will be recorded on blockchain account book to ensure the open and transparent accounting 3 4 Exchange market of QunQun community Community managers will be able to obtain QUN daily by managing and operating their own community The value of a community would grow with the increase in number of users The QunQun Platform would also provide a community exchange market The key information of each community such as proof of activity revenue information number of users and activity of users will be recorded on the public blockchain as evidence of the value developed by each community Communities with high activity will generally 11/46 \x0cfetch higher prices 3 5 Product architecture of QunQun Figure 1 business model 3 6 Product elements of QunQun 3 6 1 Account system The QunQun Platform provides a complete account system Users can join the community on the QunQun Platform through mobile phone registration Each user will be equipped with an exclusive digital identity and the QunQun digital wallet with these information recorded on the blockchain in the QunQun Platform network 12/46 \x0cThrough the use of digital identity users can access the ecosystem on the QunQun Platform without restrictions and enjoy various blockchain based community functions provided by the QunQun Platform When entering a community users are required to add their identity in the community which indicates that users can join multiple communities and have a standalone identity in each community and they can also participate in the construction of communities Eventually all identities can be mapped to the exclusive digital identity that the QunQun Platform has provided for users 3 6 2 Timeline Figure 2 Timeline 13/46 \x0cAs a basic function of the QunQun Platform all content published by a user will be collated and presented on a \xe2\x80\x9cTimeline channel\xe2\x80\x9d There are three types of Timelines in each community Interested site and off site Interested It is used to display the contents collated from other users in areas which the user has indicated previous interest Site It is used to show the real time dynamic release of all users in the community and the information is arranged in reverse chronological order Off site It is used to show the content of foreign community members transferred by members of the community 3 6 3 Content distribution QunQun allows users to publish the contents in different media formats text images videos and even live broadcast A greater variety of media formats will be available in the future such as links long text sign in Q&A item transaction etc 3 6 4 Interaction function Interaction module includes Like comment incentive forward transmit share etc 1 Like When consuming content in Timeline users can give their favorite contents \xe2\x80\x9cthumbs up\xe2\x80\x9d according to personal preference The off site Timeline also allows users to give likes on their favorite contents and the information can be accumulated into the disseminating data of the original content 2 Comment When browsing content users can interact with the creator or other users based on the content through the comments section The off site content in this community is also equipped with the function of comment and 14/46 \x0cinteraction 3 Incentives Users can directly incentivise creators of high quality content with QUN The amount of QUN incentive (less small transaction costs of transacting on the blockchain network) will be owned by the content creator neither the QunQun Platform nor community sitemaster/management team will get a share of this direct QUN incentive In order to improve the incentive function (as compared to a blockchain transfer) users of the QunQun Platform will be able to have a \xe2\x80\x9cquick incentive\xe2\x80\x9d function through the use of a built in wallet 4 Forward Users can forward the content of interest to fans / followers so as to reinforce social relationships 5 Transmit As the unique function of the QunQun Platform the \xe2\x80\x9cTransmit\xe2\x80\x9d function is a basic function to realise cross site function As the member of a community users may still view the contents of other communities After \xef\xac\x81nding other communities on the QunQun Platform users may browse through other communities as tourists based on the \xe2\x80\x9cpassing account system\xe2\x80\x9d Users who are interested in contents of a community and who want to share it with other members of their own communities may use the \xe2\x80\x9cTransmit\xe2\x80\x9d function (only available on the QunQun Platform) to share the content and creator to their own communities The transmitted contents will be displayed on the off site Timeline 6 Share When consuming content in the community users may share high quality content to third party social platforms for their friends on other social 15/46 \x0cplatforms The third party sharing function on the QunQun Platform supports several mainstream social platforms such as Facebook Twitter Wechat QQ Weibo etc 3 6 5 Find With the growth in the community and ecosystem the increase in number of site masters / managers and users will de\xef\xac\x81nitely result in a larger number of communities Therefore users should have certain mechanisms to assist them in \xef\xac\x81nding their communities of interest The QunQun Platform will incorporate a \xe2\x80\x9cFind\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism in time to allow users to connect with interesting communities users and contents 3 6 6 App Center There are two categories of applications in the App Center The \xef\xac\x81rst category comprises various functions and applications developed by the QunQun Platform while the other comprises applications developed by third party developers with the tools provided by the QunQun Platform To enrich the functions of community create more entertainment channels as well as to activate the community the site master/management team may add or open the necessary applications according to the community\xe2\x80\x99s requirements 1 Applications developed by the QunQun Platform With the purpose of improving the operational ef\xef\xac\x81ciency of each community the QunQun Platform provides each community with abundant tools used for community construction and operation For example a \xe2\x80\x9cCommunity Data\xe2\x80\x9d App provides the statistical analysis function for new user data held out data user behavior data and all content related core data that has received interest during community operation 16/46 \x0cMeanwhile the QunQun Platform will provide a variety of community robots (Bot) to assist the site master / management team For example Headline Bot can automatically generate the key contents of the community and \xef\xac\x81nd out the contents that are in line with the interest of community members as well as assist the site master / management team to more easily construct the community It is envisaged that the variety of Bots will play a vital role in development of content on the QunQun Platform and community activation 2 Other application provided by third party developer In line with the decentralisation concept of blockchain technology the QunQun Platform will launch an open platform for third party developers while gradually improving its blockchain technology Any competent developer may develop and provide a variety of third party applications (e g various tools social networks and games for community) based on the open API provided by the QunQun Platform Incentive mechanism QunQun has set up a special ecosystem incentive mechanism which uses the native Token (QUN) of the QunQun Platform as the only mechanism for the payment of incentives A double layer incentive mechanism based on the unique POA (POA) + POC (Proof of Contribution) algorithm is formulated on the platform and used to incentivise the participants who make contributions to development of the community and ecosytem The Incentive Pool system would perform a calculation of incentive distribution every 24 hours According to the calculation result QUN incentives will be automatically distributed to the personal wallet of each participant 17/46 \x0cFigure 2 Schematic diagram for double layer incentive mechanism 4 1 Incentive Pool Incentive Pool is a Token pool exclusively used to incentivise users who contribute towards development of the ecosystem Incentive Pool will be replenished daily according to the incentive elastic coef\xef\xac\x81cient 4 2 Community incentive distribution Proof of Activity Incentive Pool will perform the \xef\xac\x81rst layer incentive distribution by using POA (Proof of Activity) which means that QUN in the Incentive Pool shall be distributed to each community based on its activity The calculation of POA is as follows Incentive Poll will calculate the valid DAU valid posts valid number of post valid page views valid number of page view valid likes valid number of like valid comments valid number of comment the average number of posts view the average online duration peak concurrent users and number of new users of each community every 24 18/46 \x0chours The activity Amof each community is k Am = \xe2\x88\x91 ai Fi i=1 Herein k the number of factors while Fistands for the value of all factors proving the community activity obtained by using normalisation algorithm ai is the weight of different factors The daily allocation is new currency of R All existing communities shall be included in the distribution Accordingly the overall incentive Rmobtained by each community shall be Rm = Am n \xe2\x88\x91j=1 Aj *R Herein n is the number of communities within the whole ecosystem by the end of distribution After a community receives the POA distribution from the Incentive Pool the QUN received will be distributed to the site master/management team and users participating in the development of the community based on a certain percentage The initial distribution ratio of site master/management team to users would be 40% 60% The site master/management team may be entitled to adjust the distribution ratio with users participating in the development of the community so long as it ratio payable to the site master/ managemement team does not exceed 50% The remaining QUN should be distributed as user incentives to users participating in the development of the community construction according to the Proof of Contribution calculation (described below) 19/46 \x0c4 3 Users incentive distribution Proof of Contribution In addition to site masters users in a community may also receive QUN distributed to the community daily Users incentive will be distributed to each active user according to POC (Proof of Contribution) algorithm QunQun can calculate Level Ln for each user by calculating the behaviors of browses likes comments incentives and forwards obtained by the content after creating and publishing as well as the behaviors of post view and the browses likes and comments to others\xe2\x80\x99 post k Ln = \xe2\x88\x91 aiOi i=1 Herein Oi is the value of single behavior\xe2\x80\x99s number obtained by using normalisation algorithm it not only includes the active behaviors such as likes comments post etc but includes the passive behaviors such as being interested being liked post being viewed post being commented etc ai refers to the weight of each behavior Different behaviors will have different thresholds for Oi within a \xef\xac\x81xed period of time If being performed after exceeding the threshold the behavior will no longer affect user\ s level The community would receive QUN as incentives from the QunQun Platform via POA mechanism every 24 hours Part of the obtained QUN will be distributed to the creator and management team of the community The other part will be distributed to incentivise users who make intraday contributions to the community by virtue of POC mechanism The intraday contribution of community users Cn shall be calculated by calculating the number of single user\xe2\x80\x99s active behavior S and passive behavior within the same day and their weights 20/46 \x0ck k Cn = \xe2\x88\x91 ai Si + L \xce\xb2 \xe2\x88\x91 i\xe2\x88\x91 j i=1 i=1 l j=1 Herein Si is the value of single active behavior\xe2\x80\x99s number obtained by using normalisation algorithm while ai refers to the weight of the active behavior \xce\xb2i is the weight of single passive behavior while l refers to the number of users who perform the single passive behavior During the calculation of passive behavior weight distinction is conducted to the levels of users who perform the passive behaviors In simple terms if someone with higher level performs the behaviors such as like comment etc to a post then the post creator will obtain higher contribution However the number of each behavior is calculated for only once Rm refers to the monetary incentive obtained by the community via POA After the proportion of community operators being deducted the incentive which may be obtained by an ordinary user rnis rn = Cn t \xe2\x88\x91s=1 Cs *(1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x83)Rm Herein \xcf\x83 refers to the proportion that management team shall receive while t is the number of members in the community by the end of distribution Ecosystem 5 1 QunQun Lab Foundation LTD The QunQun Lab Foundation Ltd (the Foundation) is the entity which develops and maintains the QunQun Platform 21/46 \x0cThe Foundation will continuously promote the application of blockchain technology to social applications through the development of an open and dependable social application platform continuously improve blockchain technology and build the largest and most active community platform in the blockchain digital world and at the same time provide a greater selection of better community tools and products for the whole ecosystem and enlarge user experience so as to create continuous user activity in the community on the QunQun Platform 5 2 Site master/management team (Social Community holder) A site master/management team is the owner of single QunQun community Anyone or any institution may subscribe to an initiatory community on QunQun and become the owner of the community simply by paying 49 99 QUN As the operator of a community the site master/management team shall be responsible for the content and activity of the community Site master/ management team shall be in charge of user acquisition maintenance of users community activation production of high quality contents enabling positive discussions and creation of communication atmosphere As the solid basis of all site master in the ecosystem the QunQun Platform will incentivise site master/management teams with QUN according to the operation of all communities and based on the unique POA (Proof of Activity) mechanism 5 3 User Users can be regarded as the cornerstone around which the ecosystem and community on the QunQun Platform is built After registering on the QunQun Platform users may join any community that they are interested in Users may publish image text and videos participate in 22/46 \x0cthe community construction as well as interact with other users in the community Users who create high quality content will be able to receive POC incentives (paid in QUN) daily Users are the major driving force of consumption in the ecosystem and will be required to pay QUN in exchange for various services / products on the QunQun Platform (e g payment of incentive purchase of content purchase of apps purchase and/or playing games) 5 4 Developer Developers play an important role in the diversi\xef\xac\x81ed ecosystem on the QunQun Platform The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to drive the whole community ecosystem based on blockchain technology and build an open and dependable social application platform Not only will the Foundation provide basic technical support anyone or institution possessing developmental capability can develop the third party applications for the ecosystem on the QunQun Platform 5 5 Advertiser Advertisers are an important part of the economy on the QunQun Platform With the growth of various communities the QunQun Platform will gradually introduce eco friendly advertisers into the community Part of the advertising revenue will go to the Foundation and applied in accordance with its objects while the rest will be paid to the Incentive Pool in the form of QUN Outlook The QunQun Platform aims to become the largest and most active community platform in the blockchain digital world With the rapid promotion of digital currency users and penetration of this market it is envisaged that 23/46 \x0cthe model of the QunQun Platform will gradually ful\xef\xac\x81ll its true potential and obtain geometric growth \xef\xac\x81nally In order to continuously support the development of the community on the QunQun Platform it is planned that the commercial revenue of the QunQun Platform will mainly come from the following ways 6 1 Sales and transactions of virtual goods The QunQun Platform QunQun will develop and design various virtual goods on the community platform (e g forms of community themes skins paid virtual items as well as various personal virtual images for individuals) Some of these virtual goods may be obtained for free while the rest will be sold in exchange for QUN There will be a transaction market on the QunQun Platform which is able to support transfers between users as well as the transaction of various virtual goods The QunQun Platform will charge a commission in QUN for these transaction costs 6 2 Application and game revenue sharing The QunQun Platform will provide tools for third party developers to provide applications and SNS games for the community and charge a portion of the revenues of these applications and games as fees 6 3 Advertising revenue Advertising is one of the critical revenue streams for the QunQun Platform With the help of intelligent and reliable blockchain advertising and value analysis systems the QunQun Platform combines advertising with a community incentive model effectively connectsingthe advertisers with users so as to maximise the interests of all parties The average revenue per user (ARPU) metric for digital currency users is 24/46 \x0cseveral times that of traditional mobile Internet users which is expected to assist the rapid development of the QunQun Platform Technical realisation There are three layers included in the overall technical architecture of the QunQun Platform client community platform and underlying architecture Figure 3 Architecture diagram of overall technology 7 1 Client Client refers to various terminal products which the QunQun Platform has provided for users to meet their different demands (including iOS Android H5 etc) The QunQun Platform will also provide a full featured RESTful API Any developer may develop ef\xef\xac\x81ciency tools or games based on 25 hese API 25/46 \x0cWhen fully developed the QunQun Platform will provide a site master/ management team with a community management tool (Dashboard) which includes theme templates function options management of application plugin etc 7 2 Community platform Clients can access the services provided by the QunQun Platform via RESTful API In order to provide RESTful API with high availability high concurrence and high performance the components such as load balancing log storage service monitoring message queue authorisation checking account uni\xef\xac\x81cation and data statistics will be established within the QunQun Platform Account module provides basic accounting service for the ecosystem on the QunQun Platform The Account module is designed to be compatible with an Ethereum account in an optimal manner Such a uni\xef\xac\x81ed QunQun account will be able to ensure security of funds as well as allow users to enjoy all services quickly and easily Users may view information of other communities within the APP and also but interact with users from other communities (e g functions such as liking commenting) Statistics module aims to record and save all core operations of the QunQun Platform so as to perform various data analysis The data analysis includes calculation of community activity calculation of user contribution calculation of developer sharing etc The QunQun Platform will provide various tools for developers to develop the third party applications that are suitable for the ecosystem on the QunQun Platform based on the various interfaces provided by the QunQun Platform After the launch of the developer platform the QunQun Platform will offer technical documentation and sample programs so as to help developers get started quickly 26/46 \x0c7 3 Underlying architecture The underlying technology architecture of blockchain + IPFS will be adopted by the QunQun Platform 7 3 1 Blockchain Part of QunQun\ s core services is formulated on the basis of blockchain technology The blockchain of QunQun is developed based on the integration of Ethereum public chain at present The native chain of the QunQun Platform (QunQun Blockchain) which is designed to be more suitable for social communities will be launched in the future 1 Account Mark of user\ s sole digital identity 2 Token The native cryptographic token designed to be used on the QunQun Platform (QUN) is based on ERC 20 standard Users may check their QUN balance through the QunQun Platform or any application which supports ERC 20 standard Before the launch of QunQun Blockchain to get around the technical barrier the QunQun Platform will issue the representative token on the Ethereum blockchain and perform a transfer once the development of the QunQun Blockchain is complete This transfer will have no effect on the usage and digital assets of users 3 Smart contract The \xe2\x80\x9csmart contract\xe2\x80\x9d of Ethereum is Turing complete Various constraints shall be written into the smart contract in QunQun ecosystem The realisation of some community related contracts is shown as follows Community information 27/46 \x0cAnyone can establish a community by paying certain amounts of QUN to the QunQun Platform In order to mark the uniqueness and ownership of that community community information and ownership will be written into the smart contract of the QunQun Platform The creation and transferring of community are shown as follows \xe2\x80\xa3 Create a community Anyone can establish a community by paying QUN Community information and ownership will be written into smart contract of QunQun The sample code of contract is as follows //Community data structure struct siteInfo { string name string status bool is_exist address owner uint32 price } uint32 SITE_CREATE_PRICE = 50 mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf // account balance mapping (bytes32 => siteInfo) public site_info // community list event Transfer(address indexed from address indexed to uint256 value) /** * Create a community */ function createSite(address owner bytes32 site_key string name) 28/46 \x0cpublic returns (bool success) { //Check whether the identity is already taken require(site_info[site_key] is_exist == false) //Check balance ORIGIN_PRICE refers to the cost of creating a community The initial price is 49 99QUN require(balanceOf[owner] >= SITE_CREATE_PRICE) //Set the community ownership site_info[site_key] is_exist = true site_info[site_key] owner = owner //Set the status as running site_info[site_key] status = running //Set the community name site_info[site_key] name = name // Deduct expenses QUNQUN_ACCOUNT refers to the account of community platform _transfer(owner QUNQUN_ACCOUNT SITE_CREATE_PRICE) return true } \xe2\x80\xa3 Purchase a community If users want to purchase a community available for sale they can perform the fee purchasing and ownership transferring independently by virtue of calling smart contract The sample code of contract is shown as follows /** * Purchase a community */ 29/46 \x0cfunction buySite(bytes32 site_key) public returns (bool success) { //Check whether the community is for sale require(sha3(site_info[site_key] status) == sha3( for_sale )) // Check whether the account balance of contract caller is adequate require(balanceOf[msg sender] >= site_info[site_key] price) //Account transfer _transfer(msg sender site_info[site_key] owner site_info[site_key] price) //Ownership transfer site_info[site_key] owner = msg sender return true } Apart from the above functions the smart contract of QunQun will also save the core operational data such as user scale active reservation eco incentive etc Ecosystem rules The shared proportion of POA incentives that is shared by site master/ management team and community users Rules for revenue sharing between the QunQun Platform and third
