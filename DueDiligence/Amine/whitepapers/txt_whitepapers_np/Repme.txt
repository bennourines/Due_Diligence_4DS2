b 1st draft Updated Aug 24 2018 Repme Transparent linking and social recruiting will dominate the global HR industry WHITEPAPER www repme io \xc2\xa9 All rights reserved by repme \x0cPage RepMe (RPM) coin RepMe is the brand new \xe2\x80\x9cincentivised\xe2\x80\x9d endorsement based networking and social media blockchain community LinkedIN meets Facebook PR agency recruitment agency and talent agency all rolled into an autonomous d\xe2\x80\x99App system designed to filter and introduce qualified networks to engage and cultivate mutually beneficial social and commercial relationships The problem Introverts and extroverts alike we are a species that either must engage in or desire interaction whether for personal or commercial or obligatory reasons Unfortunately we have constructed social barriers and gatekeepers we have developed insecurity and lack inclination or time We have businesses to run money to save and a life to look after We have trust issues\xe2\x80\xa6the business world is sick of being hit by telemarketers and in the social realm we always think someone approaching us has their own agenda\xe2\x80\xa6 The problem\xe2\x80\xa6We have emotions and have limited time Imagine if you could remove emotions and time expenditure from the entire process and interact with someone for the very first time with surgical precision about why you should connect and whether or not there is availability or mutual interest Imagine if you could find employees through your network and interact directly Imagine if you could directly contact employers business partners investors old friends new friends anybody Imagine if you could get paid and earn a living simply from the people you know and network with 01 \x0cPage In step RepMe \xe2\x80\x93 a blockchain operated management system taking out all of the guess work emotional obscurity and time sensitivity of introductions and networking Why is this important With HR spending in the trillions each year on personnel and tech \xe2\x80\x93 the industry itself to date has been very slow to introduce optimising software and at present state is still a relative pre 2010 legacy market Commissions and costs of head hunting and recruitment haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed ranging from $1 $10k and even more for top tier personnel The obscurity however is the fact that while costs and processes haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed much the dynamic of the landscape has considerably Standard recruitment and networking success has largely become reliant on social networking and qualified referral from peers LinkedIn\xe2\x80\x99s success to date is largely due to this social trend Instead of a stranger at a recruiting agency pitching their client base it\xe2\x80\x99s an endorsement or a recommendation from a close peer via social channels With this very obvious trend organically taking effect its strange that no company to date has been able to commercialise a global working solution Repme as in \xe2\x80\x9crepresent me\xe2\x80\x9d is creating a dynamic user friendly portal that turns every person in your network into a prospect recruiter and pays you BTC ETH or RPM tokens simply for the people you know endorse and recommend 02 \x0cPage How does it work Simple Using a smart contract operated decentralised mobile optimised application users can simply see through their network what extended contacts they have They can then communicate with their own peers or via one of their peers and incentivise the ability to open up a communication line to someone in their network This will be a powerful tool for business recruitment head hunting opportunities and simply for making friends and dating They then can either send out a group bounty using tokens to be able to connect with the type of personnel they need or they can precision request introduction with the personnel they wish to connect with and incentivise current contacts and strangers to endorse the meet This is one of the most basic use cases There are considerably innovative and exciting processes our platform enable Lets look at some of the most basic scenarios for alpha version 1 0 due to release Q4 2018 1 Boy wants to meet girl \xe2\x80\x93 Girl is 3 associations away Boy sends a heart icon with a request for green light to proceed through first contact who then forwards to second contact who then decides if that is cool The heart reaches the girl \xe2\x80\x93 she decides if she wants to say hi 2 Entrepreneur wants to make a business deal \xe2\x80\x93 He sends the Proposal or gift icon through his contacts to try to hit the desired contact \xe2\x80\x93 he can incentivise this run with coins Letting every one in the chain endorse him and in return receiving tokens for the hassle 03 \x0cPage 3 Marketeer wants to reach out to celebrity \xe2\x80\x93 Through 5 channels \xe2\x80\x93 You pay the recipients and they agree to make the connection with an endorsement To make it even better you can see the celebrities and offer tiered bonuses for people who make the match 4 Job offer \xe2\x80\x93 business owner wants to approach a prospect employee \xe2\x80\x93 he can simply incentivise his own staff and network providing him an army of recruiting agents for a fraction of the cost of traditional recruitment methods 5 Gym buddy \xe2\x80\x93 Simply need someone to spot you \xe2\x80\x93 place a bulletin on the repme map for seeking gym buddy at these times per week Other enthusiasts can hit back with fee requests or just make contact for free 6 Tennis coach artist or learn the guitar or any other hobbie Simple \xe2\x80\x93 just fire out an icon representing the particular field and see who bites Or if willing to pay \xe2\x80\x93 send out a bounty offer for the whole network within your geographic limits Simple right This is the most basic form of our new smart d\xe2\x80\x99application We have a whole host of upgrades to turn our native d\xe2\x80\x99app into a sophisticated networking tool and will continuously be presenting the developments via our open source Github depository and via updates in our community on telegram and twitter Initially as we work towards the mobile application the technical system is very fundamental as explained in the below schematic Please note this is merely the first version and we are keeping it light and simple to ensure we have technical manoeuvrability to build the most robust finished product 04 \x0cPage Changes in network ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK Deploy smart contracts Developers Tailored networking d\xe2\x80\x99apps Mobile application 05 \x0cPage Write smart contratcs To ensure optimal reach and opportunities a user profile will contain valuable personal and professional information This information is owned by each individual As the information is sensitive we have constructed very robust security measures Procedural security measures \xe2\x80\x93 All sensitive information is encrypted \xe2\x80\x93 Global setting protections \xe2\x80\x93 Two factor authentication \xe2\x80\x93 Facial recognition and Finger print identification Furthermore all communication data is transmitted through encrypted transport layer security connections During development we take smart contract auditing very seriously This is not just for autonomy and security but it also prepares our system to make it more applicable and flexible in the long term For this endeavour to start we will be using the services of Quantstamp Internally however we perform a coding standard validation as per standardization and perform code review incorporating black box test methodology before deployment of these new dapps 06 \x0cPage The primary industries repme is positioned to disrupt are the following \xe2\x80\x93 Human resources &amp Recruitment \xe2\x80\x93 Head hunting \xe2\x80\x93 Online dating \xe2\x80\x93 Commercial networking While also creating a new platform to optimise friend seeking hobbyist networking and social networking in general We are also currently developing an innovative online dating app with a very simple technical structure that simply plugs right into our primary dapp Offchain personality matching engine ReMe d\xe2\x80\x99app User 1 User 2 07 \x0cPage We are already exploring the developmental cost and timeframes for an offchain personality matching engine that can communicate with our dapp and the ethereum platform The potential implications of this are huge An offchain matching engine allows the decentralised application to operate without the heavy computational power required while maintaining a decentralised user account model Basically it brings about radical performance benefits without bloating the core application For us to succeed we need to deliver a better solution than our centralised incumbents Using the power of computer simulating neural networks we are designing a new machine learning pattern habit and facial detection data centre The first application is for the dating functionality to better peer users based on habits activities peers and facial features The first prototype is currently under testing The reason we are starting with dating is to use the free dating service features as a way to deliver a large enough data feed so that we can start building out a solution for applying it in the head hunting and recruitment solutions Imagine casting auditions models actors and the likes with a click of the button to immediately present a range of options precision suited for certain roles We also believe that this will be a powerful tool for the future of recruitment as data suggests the industry is heading this way and employment based on the look of someone applies to many verticals particularly with front of house staffing requirements This entire project will optimise the HR process globally 08 \x0cPage <<Image Pro UI>> Presentation <<activity>> Security <<activity>> User Management Set preference Sequence Displays Result
