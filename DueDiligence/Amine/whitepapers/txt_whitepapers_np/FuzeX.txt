that brought us the first transparent secure and decentralized currency through Bitcoin has opened the floodgates for incredibly innovative business solutions through smart contracts on networks such as the Ethereum Network Through this a large number of businesses have minted a growing group of people with significant wealth tied to cryptocurrencies However as it stands the process to translate the wealth accumulated in cryptocurrencies to real life experiences for cryptocurrency owners to enjoy is unfortunately painfully inconvenient The activities of purchasing transferring and exchanging cryptocurrencies to widely accepted \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d are complicated slow and unstable The real world usability problems associated with cryptocurrencies have encouraged a number of companies to tackle this challenge While many of the contenders in this space have approached it with a seemingly logical prepaid plastic card solution their use cases are limited to just a few cryptocurrencies and acceptances are limited to just a small number of Merchants thus hampering wider adoption In this regard FuzeX is looking beyond the standard approaches The team at FuzeX is seeking to deliver an innovative user experience as well as solving the cryptocurrency usability problem by introducing the FuzeX Ecosystem 05 \x0cVision The FuzeX Team strives to make all forms of currency payment (fiat rewards and cryptocurrencies) secure reliable and User/Merchant friendly With the wider acceptance of blockchain technology and its innovative financial solutions cryptocurrencies are closer to being recognized as \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d more than ever After all it has all the features of what is accepted as \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum all share the following characteristics that help define \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d Scarcity Durability Authenticity Easy Verification Storage Fungible Portability Divisibility Difficultly Counterfeiting Usability However when it comes to the usability characteristic of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d cryptocurrencies face a serious challenge Our vision at FuzeX is to break down the \xe2\x80\x9cnice to own but difficult to spend\xe2\x80\x9d problem with cryptocurrency and help bring to completion its journey as a widely recognized and accepted form of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney\xe2\x80\x9d We seek to solve this usability issue of cryptocurrency by combining our experience in payment solutions and blockchain technology with our technical know how in software and hardware development Fiat Currency Currency without intrinsic value established by Government regulation or law 06 \x0cThe FuzeX Ecosystem The FuzeX Card In building FuzeX we draw from our experience and expertise in having already successfully developed brought to market sold and shipped 30 000+ Fuze Cards (magnetic strip and barcode enabled) which are smart e cards that enable users to embed up to 30 credit debit or reward cards in one The FuzeX Card will include all the features of the Fuze Card with the additional benefit of multi cryptocurrency integration The FuzeX Card is identical in size and thickness to a standard credit or debit card and consists of an EMV chip a dynamic magnetic strip an E Paper Display (EPD) three input/option buttons a rechargeable battery and a charging terminal EMV Chip Secured Charging Terminal Rechargeable Battery Front E Paper Display Dynamic Magnetic Strip Buttons Back 07 \x0cFeatures of the FuzeX Card Store manage and use up to 30 credit debit reward and cryptocurrency accounts Built in buttons to power on/off enter pin codes make selections and authorize payments on the FuzeX Card itself E Paper Display (EPD) to view balances across accounts barcodes for reward card scans and QR codes for blockchain addresses EMV (IC Chip) for multi cryptocurrency payments Near Field Communication (NFC) for credit and debit card payments Barcodes for reward payments QR Code for cryptocurrency wallet addresses for P2P transfers Bluetooth connection between FuzeX Card and FuzeX Wallet to ensure security (Users have the additional option to securely lock the FuzeX Card when the Bluetooth connection is disconnected) Remote wipe technology to clear data from the FuzeX Card Battery life between 45~60 days Plus a sleek slim rechargeable portable battery bank Once users have connected their various accounts (credit debit rewards or cryptocurrency) to the FuzeX Ecosystem through their FuzeX Wallet app they will be able to pay with their FuzeX Card without the trouble of having to pull out their smartphones Furthermore the FuzeX Card pairs with the FuzeX Wallet to function as a hard wallet storage of private keys Fragmented private keys are encrypted and stored between the FuzeX Card and FuzeX Wallet The private keys are only accessible by unlocking the FuzeX Card (via a pin on the card) and FuzeX Wallet (via an account password) As devices become increasingly more important in a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity this two factor authentication process helps combat fraud and brings together fragmented financial platforms in to one simple solution 08 \x0cThe FuzeX Wallet As the hub for the FuzeX Card and account management the FuzeX Wallet allows users to store spend receive and transfer tokens Features of the FuzeX Wallet Enables registration (includes KYC) for FuzeX Ecosystem Register and manage various cryptocurrencies Send receive and exchange cryptocurrencies (cryptocurrency amount and respective fiat currency value is clearly displayed with real time exchange rates) Check account balances transaction history and exchange rates Only registered devices can access the FuzeX Wallet to ensure security Interactive map and address of the last location that the FuzeX Card was used (prior to Bluetooth disconnection) to help users locate and retrieve their lost FuzeX Card Android and iOS application for smart phones Two factor authentication (PIN on FuzeX Card and password on FuzeX Wallet) for the purposes of secure private key management KYC Know your Customer The process FuzeX will use to verify the identity of our users 09 \x0cThe FuzeX Exchange CryptoCurrency Legacy Payment Blockchain Network Network (Issuer] A Hot Wallet A Hosted Wallet User Key Exchange Key RACE A RACE RACE A B Isolated Key B The FuzeX Exchange The FuzeX Exchange is the core backend platform bringing world wide cryptocurrency adoption to reality Our goal is to allow users to spend cryptocurrency on their FuzeX Card as they would do on any regular credit card and for Merchants to receive fiat currencies (USD Euro Yen and any other local currencies) as they currently do In fact besides the eye catching futuristic look and feel of the card Merchants will not know the difference We accomplish this by enabling whichever cryptocurrency the FuzeX Card User selects to be released in the respective fiat currency to Issuers based on the relevant market exchange rate Our FuzeX Card will work in conjunction with EMV POS terminal standards In doing so we eliminate the unreasonable overhead required in order for each cryptocurrency company to establish contracts with each separate vendors To bring to market our solution for cryptocurrency usability sooner FuzeX will first partner with existing exchanges (Q2) and Issuers (Q2) For partner exchanges the FuzeX Card offers a unique solution that streamlines cryptocurrency adoption and increases their user base Alternatively for the Issuers the FuzeX card provides new access to an expanding billion dollar industry Following this development FuzeX will then build out its own Centralized FuzeX Exchange 10 \x0cFeatures of the FuzeX Exchange Hold a multitude of reserve cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to facilitate real time exchange (exchange rates derived from aggregated market rates) between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies for payment transactions Function as a hosted wallet that is secured by 3 multi signature security keys (User Key Exchange Key and Isolated Key for recovery) *Transactions execute only when 2 of the 3 security keys are deployed Integrate with Issuers/Legacy Payment Networks (e g MasterCard Visa) to confirm sufficient fiat equivalent cryptocurrency balance in the Users\xe2\x80\x99 accounts during payment authorization and releases fiat payments to Issuers Acknowledge selected cryptocurrency for payment when the User holds the relevant button to confirm selection on their FuzeX Card If Users lose their User Key upon verification of identification they can create a new account and User Key FuzeX can then transfer the balance from their previous account to a new account using a combination of the Exchange Key and Isolated Key To maintain a balance of reserve cryptocurrency and fiat currency funds in the FuzeX Exchange the FuzeX Exchange will offer any excess cryptocurrencies it receives from users to the market (via other exchange partnerships) to maintain proper reserve funds for transactions Revenue received from selling and appreciation of cryptocurrencies in FuzeX Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s ownership will be used to hedge currency fluctuation risks 11 \x0cFuzeX Setup & Transaction Flow User & Network Transaction Flow Issuer & Payment Network Exchange Payment Request Purchase Summary Payment Request User Merchant FuzeX Card Cryptocurrency (3) Payment Card (3) Membership Card (3) Service or Product Purchased Setup 1 The User downloads the FuzeX Wallet (mobile app) creates an account to join the FuzeX Exchange and orders a FuzeX Card 2 The User transfers the desired amount of cryptocurrencies from an external wallet to the FuzeX Wallet 3 The User receives and activates the FuzeX Card using the FuzeX Wallet app Transaction Flow 1 The User makes a purchase by selecting his/her choice of cryptocurrency from the FuzeX Card using the built in buttons on the card 2 The User views the selected cryptocurrency balance and the respective fiat currency value given in real time exchange rates on the FuzeX Card When a cryptocurrency is selected and confirmed by the User (by holding down the designated button) the selection information is sent directly to the FuzeX Exchange 12 \x0c3 The User hands over his/her FuzeX Card to the Merchant to insert or swipe The Merchant\xe2\x80\x99s POS terminal sends a request to the relevant switch company or Issuer to verify the User and authorize the payment via the EMV payment networks (VISA MasterCard etc ) The Issuer (integrated with the FuzeX Exchange) checks the User\xe2\x80\x99s account for sufficient fiat equivalent cryptocurrency amount via the FuzeX Exchange If sufficient the Issuer authorizes the payment which simultaneously locks the spent amount of cryptocurrency from the User\xe2\x80\x99s account (If there is an insufficient amount the Issuer denies the payment ) 4 The Merchant then receives authorization for the payment and the purchase is complete 5 The User receives a courtesy purchase summary on his/her FuzeX Wallet app The User must approve transactions on the FuzeX Card when the cumulative spending balance surpasses $300 USD (limit adjustable) to finalize the transfer of cryptocurrency payment from his/her User account to the FuzeX Exchange 13 \x0cThe FuzeX Exchange Transaction Flow Exchange Issuers & Payment Networks Sell Excess Cryptocurrencies Exchange Partners Users When the User approves transactions on his/her FuzeX Card the cryptocurrency payment is transferred to the FuzeX Exchange which holds a multitude of reserve cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to facilitate payment transactions The FuzeX Exchange has two primary functions 1 To settle payments with Issuers by transferring to the Issuers the amount spent by users in the stated fiat currency from its fiat currency reserves 2 To sell excess cryptocurrencies accumulated to other partner exchanges 14 \x0cThe FXT Token Utility We want our FuzeX card holders to be able to use their cryptocurrency anytime anywhere Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum share all the characteristics of \xe2\x80\x98money\xe2\x80\x99 except for one \xe2\x80\x98usability\xe2\x80\x99 For all their benefits cryptocurrencies are notoriously difficult to spend in the \xe2\x80\x98real world\xe2\x80\x99 Our aim is to make cryptocurrencies as useful and as usable in everyday life as conventional fiat currency is now We want to encourage wider adoption and create a safe secure ecosystem that benefits merchants partners and users alike Short Term Utility In order to get the FuzeX Card delivered as early as possible we will partner with existing issuers and partner exchanges for the short term For the short term the utility of our FXT Token is limited in its use cases therefore it will initially be used as a membership token Using our FXT Tokens token holders will be able to do the following 1 FuzeX Card Purchasing FXT Token holders will be able to purchase FuzeX Cards by using their FXT Tokens 2 Annual Membership Fees Initially when we partner with issuers there will be an ongoing BIN (Bank Identification Number) sharing cost Therefore we will have a small annual membership fee for FuzeX Card users This annual fee can be lowered and paid by using FXT Tokens Therefore FXT Token holders will pay cheaper annual fees than non FXT token holders 3 Transaction Limits There will be a reasonable limit set per transaction for FuzeX Card users and this limit can be increased based on the amount of FXT Tokens held by the user This limit will be imposed by the Issuers due to the risk of the exchange rate from cryptocurrency to fiat 15 \x0cThis is the short term utility of our FXT Tokens until we create and build out our full FuzeX Ecosystem A key part of our project and payment platform is developing our own FuzeX Exchange but this will take time Having our own exchange is essential to adopting other cryptocurrencies for use with the FuzeX Card and maximising and expanding the utility of the FXT Token for our token holders 16 \x0cLong Term Utility Once we build our FuzeX ecosystem by integrating our partners who are co branding and working with us (to use their tokens with our FuzeX Card to make payments) our payment platform will then evolve to become a service platform Our FXT Tokens will then take on a more important role within our service platform ecosystem as a medium between tokens and a bridge between services offered by these tokens Once these tokens are listed on our FuzeX Exchange we can convert FXT Tokens to our partner tokens This means that all FXT Token holders will be able to use and access partner services with their FXT Tokens For example partners in our FuzeX Exchange who provide tokenised services such as travel accommodation medical legal coupons etc can have their tokens exchanged by us using FXT Tokens 17 \x0cPartner Advantages From a partner perspective as we purchase their tokens the actual utility model of their tokens does not change and the benefits are as follows 1 Firstly we provide payment capabilities for their tokens through our FuzeX Card and FuzeX Exchange 2 Secondly partners can access and offer their tokenised services to a huge pool of FuzeX Card holders FuzeX Exchange users and FXT Token holders 3 Thirdly we will provide a strategic price for their cobranded FuzeX Card if they are inside our ecosystem FXT Token Holder Advantages From a FXT Token holder perspective they can access a variety of services through our FuzeX Ecosystem using their FXT Tokens This will save time and also fees as our FXT Tokens can be exchanged fee free inside our FuzeX Exchange for other partner tokenised services Moreover by using our service platform users can benefit from a more competitive pricing structure and deals specifically targeted to FXT Token holders As our FXT Token value increases and more partners join our FuzeX Ecosystem the benefits of pricing and deals will also increase too as the exchange rate of our FXT Token strengthens 18 \x0cProduct Comparison FuzeX
