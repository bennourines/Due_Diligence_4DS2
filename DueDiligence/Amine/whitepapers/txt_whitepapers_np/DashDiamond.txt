 Introduction
 Whilst due recognition should be given to Bitcoin for blazing the trail for other
 cryptocurrencies to follow the sad reality is that almost 10 years later Bitcoin and
 other cryptocurrencies are still struggling with mass adoption A 2019 demographic
 survey by Finder com involving 2 000 adults in the US revealed that only 8% of
 American adults own a form of a digital asset Surprisingly despite the supposed
 popularity of cryptocurrencies the idea that digital assets are “useless” was given as
 the most popular reason for the absence of adoption according to the survey 
 In an earlier survey by YouGov involving around 1 200 US respondent it was
 disclosed that about 79% of Americans are familiar with the concept of
 cryptocurrencies Interestingly a clear majority (87%) of those who have heard about
 cryptocurrencies have not had any interaction with digital assets – meaning they had
 mined bought or sold any cryptocurrencies About half of the individuals in this
 category also noted that they had no intention of buying Bitcoin Once again it
 becomes clear that despite the significant progress cryptocurrencies have made so far 
 the road to adoption is still far away 
 Although cryptocurrencies have successfully proven that sending and receiving
 money is possible in a digital environment one of the primary issue bothering on
 acceptance is their usability in everyday transactions Is it convenient and easy to pay
 for a cup of coffee with Bitcoin Can I shop from my favorite online store with digital
 assets How long does it take for a transaction to be confirmed What happens if I
 need to request a refund How safe are my identity and digital assets These and
 many more are some of the questions that need to be answered if we are to see
 wide spread adoption of cryptocurrencies 
 Blockchain truly has the potential to revolutionize the world as we know it from the
 ay transactions are made to entertainment logistics food traceability and even
 governance amongst others Sadly a definite identity for cryptocurrencies is yet to
 emerge While skeptics view the industry as a bubble waiting to burst others view it as
 an investment option like the stock market And then there are those who see digital
 assets for what they truly are – a nascent technology with immense potentials 
 Dash Diamond aims to solve the problem of usability of cryptocurrencies by
 becoming the internet’s native currency Our core goal is to create an ecosystem that
 supports fast convenient and cheap global transactions Anyone from anywhere will
 be able to purchase goods from any country using DASHD and have them delivered
 to their doorstep 
 Our Solution Better than Cash &
 Credit Card
 “Dash Diamond is a global currency that you can use to purchase products from any
 country and have them shipped to your doorstep anywhere in the world It all costs less
 than a penny per transaction and no currency exchange is required ”
 On average credit card processing fees range from 1 7% to 3 5% per transaction 
 Credit card processor charges anywhere from $17 to confirm a transaction of $1000 
 Dash Diamond enables cheaper transactions than any credit card facility and faster
 confirmation time than other digital payments 
 Dash Diamond is a cryptocurrency whose core purpose is to become the native
 currency of the internet enabling secure and stable transaction over the web The
 blockchain combines features inspired by Dash and PIVX a masternode network 
 speed and governance accessions and other privacy protocols The network is
 decentralized incentivized and open source As a masternode coin Dash Diamond is
 environmental friendly in comparison with other cryptocurrencies that use the Proofof 
 Work algorithm 
 Key Characteristics
 •Masternodes
 •Proof of Stake
 •Secured Network
 •InstantSend
 •Near zero Transaction Fees
 Masternodes
 A masternode is a full node incentivized to run its own server Masternodes will be
 performing specialized tasks within the Dash Diamond network to ensure
 decentralization and network stability Each masternode server is theoretically
 expected to be online and functioning 24/7 (have a remarkable uptime) Servers will
 store and distribute in real time a full copy of the blockchain confirm that blocks and
 transactions are valid and perform other tasks like governance and SwiftTX 
 Dash Diamond has a two tier staking system The first tier is for ordinary staking and
 the second tier is an exclusive masternode tier Rewards are distributed is an 80/20
 masternode/staking ratio The requirement for operating a masternode is 1 000
 DASHD tokens 
 Fast and almost instantaneous transactions are powered by the masternode network 
 By improving on PIVX’s SwiftX technology Dash Diamond will be able to compete
 with fiat payments options such as credit and bank cards while surpassing other fast
 cryptocurrencies SwiftX is kept independent of the full blockchain and isolated to the
 operations of the masternode network 
 Diamond Nodes
 Diamond Nodes is a decentralize masternode hosting platform Dash Diamond will
 become the native currency of the internet by improving on the ease of investing in
 cryptocurrencies as well as their usability Data on Coinmarketcap reveals that there
 are over 2500 cryptocurrencies projects – a sizeable number of which are
 masternode coins 
 Masternodes have been touted as one of the best ways to earn passive income
 cryptocurrencies Diamond Nodes aims to become the largest repository of
 masternodes in the world providing a one click masternode hosting service Our oneclick
 solution will be so easy to use that anyone with little or zero tech knowledge will
 be able to deploy a masternode from anywhere We will also be integrating a shared
 masternode feature to ensure that users can start earning passively as soon as
 possible (even without having full collateral) 
 Diamond Bazaar
 Although remarkable progress has been made in the last decade with regards to how
 and where cryptocurrencies can be used we believe that the absence of sufficient
 “trusted” platforms to spend cryptocurrencies is a major hurdle stalling wide spread
 adoption Put differently people will not suddenly stop using fiat payment options
 when they are convenient and widely accepted As a matter of fact there are
 currently no alternative cryptocurrency marketplaces that can compete with
 established e commerce behemoths 
 Diamond Bazaar is a cryptocurrency powered multivendor marketplace The
 ecosystem is powered by DASHD and strives to become the most innovative and
 prominent e commerce hub strictly powered by crypto 
 Vendors from across the globe can list their products on the platform and accept
 DASHD as payment Our product offering will also be extended to brick and mortar
 businesses that will like to integrate a DASHD payment gateway This will further
 boost the utility of DASHD 
 For a start Dash Diamond has seen an opportunity and possible use case in the ecommerce
 industry A significant percentage of private consumers across the globe
 have at one point or the other made a purchase from an online store from buying
 from brick and mortar businesses with online platforms to web only online retail
 behemoths such as Rakuten or Amazon com In 2018 for example it was estimated
 that around 1 8 billion people worldwide purchased goods online Global e retail sales
 for the same year was estimated to be $2 8 trillion There are projections that this
 amount will grow up to $4 8 trillion by 2021 
 With the right infrastructure and marketing Diamond Bazaar will grow to become a
 world class crypto only marketplace The platform will connect vendors and buyers
 from across the globe
