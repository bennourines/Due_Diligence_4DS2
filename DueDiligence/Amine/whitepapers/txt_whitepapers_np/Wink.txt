distributed in the form of TRX which is a percentage of the revenue from the platform\xe2\x80\x99s operations The reward distribution will happen automatically with no artificial hoops for users to jump through DApp Tokens WINk will be an open non exclusive platform that supports applications running on different blockchains like TRON Ethereum EOS Binance Chain etc There will be no downside to playing a game that runs on a blockchain other than TRON In fact each DApp will have its own utility token that provides extra value DApp tokens will be uniquely designed to the specifications of each DApp developer and cannot be traded on any secondary market Although being unable to trade DApp tokens might feel unfavorable this decision was made to help the WIN token retain value DApp tokens will still capture long term value by giving users exclusive access to WIN token airdrops The airdrop schedule is coming soon and more benefits for accruing DApp tokens will be added continuously 11

\xe2\x80\x8bWink org\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bfor more information \xe2\x97\x8f Limited circulating supply \xe2\x80\x8bWhen WIN is initially released only a small portion of the token will be in

circulating supply of WIN will only be 20 99% of the total supply Tokens given to ANTE holders will comprise over 57% of the initial circulating supply Given WIN\xe2\x80\x99s vesting schedule the ecosystem will be given time to develop before experiencing an influx of new tokens Users will be given ample opportunity to buy or sell WIN and put themselves in the best financial position possible

Expanding game library \xe2\x80\x8bWINk will introduce new developer tools easier on boarding and support for games on all public chains Furthermore partnerships that bring in AAA quality games will add diversity to WIN\xe2\x80\x99s offerings We project that more games will lead to greater player engagement which benefits all stakeholders on the platform Given these considerations it is unlikely that ANTE holders will lose value when swapping their tokens either in the short term or the long term As the WINk platform grows we hope the original ANTE holders will continue to hodl WIN and become active stakeholders in the ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s new games and partnerships 13 \x0cPlease visit \xe2\x80\x8bWink org\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bfor more information Public Sale 5% The IEO will take

Effective on chain governance requires new technology such as DAOs cryptographic voting systems and collaboration interfaces to be built maintained and updated The WINk platform will take on this responsibility and provide highly effective tools for DApp developers to utilize within the WINk gaming ecosystem As a result developers will be able to focus on creating premium DApp experiences while allowing WINk to take care of the platform system ecosystem development and maintenance If all goes well the community will be the greatest benefactors from this system Users will be able to select from blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s most premium gaming experiences straight from their web browser and rest assured that their cryptocurrency is safe in an ecosystem built by an experienced engineering team and rigorously tested to be safe and secure WINk will build this ecosystem through a process of constant self assessment and development Additionally on chain governance will be used

DApp Store to drive more traffic to their games Pricing will be based on a combination of cost per mil or cost per location/time The revenue from these ads will be shown transparently and aggregated to the platform revenue A portion of these rewards will later be given to users based on their Win Power As any game developer would tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s all about getting users to your platform and then working hard to retain a healthy community As such user acquisition and retention has been a major roadblock for most blockchain gaming projects since development teams have started to explore the space Many projects across Ethereum EOS and TRON have failed due to the costs associated with finding a user base With many DApps centering around token economies and needing users to drive demand and liquidity solving the user question has become of utmost importance The TRONbet project was lucky to have first mover advantage on TRON and then leverage their experience in the games industry to maintain growth The WINk team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want low visibility and expensive UA to prevent more developers from entering the space Therefore the team will design the WINk DApp store as an opportunity for all projects in the space to acquire users more efficiently Community The community will be based off the existing TRONbet community which currently has over 16 000 engaged players We understand the importance of social components in gaming so there are quite a few major updates in the works Over the next year the development team will roll out a revamped account creation system a new chat system friends lists gift exchange and more Our goal is to foster a sense of community where users can come together to share ideas about gaming crypto or whatever else they
