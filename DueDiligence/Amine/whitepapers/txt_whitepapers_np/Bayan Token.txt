any purchase of crypto tokens is extremely risky Never spend this whitepaper Terms of Sale and all possible associated risks \x0cAbstract The advent of Blockchain technology has created both revolution and disruption globally Thousands of crypto currencies have been birthed since but most have no real product or value propositions bringing no higher purpose or real world benefits to society Naturally this has created cynicism and criticism amongst detractors and equally with investors This is where we at Bayan Token (BYT) come in Driven by a belief of \xe2\x80\x9cGood For Goodness\xe2\x80\x9d our value proposition is simple and humane Participate in good and goodness will come back to you To this effect BYT is grounded on strong Islamic beliefs with growth and value created through real and existing economic projects that will not only bring returns to our BYT holders BUT also bring \xe2\x80\x9cgoodness\xe2\x80\x9d and real world impact to society So we invite you to read on and consider participating in \xe2\x80\x9cGood for Goodness\xe2\x80\x9d \x0cTable of Content Abstract 1 Opportunity Gap Finding Good in the Bad 1 Our Vision Good for Goodness 2

Process 35 Team and Advisors 36 Appendix Shariah Pronouncement 3 6 7 36 \x0c1 0 Opportunity Gap Finding Good in the Bad To build our product and strong Value Proposition(s) for purchasers we have identified 3 key category shortfalls that we believe as the big opportunity gaps 1 Based on an EY report paper on ICOs until December 2017 over 84% of ICOs launched are cryptocurrency projects that are at an early ideation stage during the ICO period Token Holders \xe2\x80\x93 purchasers \xe2\x80\x93 not only bear the brunt of the cost of the projects but are also burdened by the higher risk of no profit return in the event that the project fails to realize its product 2 The report also pointed out that ICO valuations are often based on the \xe2\x80\x9cfear of missing out\xe2\x80\x9d instead of real project development forecasts and the nature of the token This leads to extreme token price volatility in the post ICO trading hence many tokens and cryptocurrencies are dead within months after the completion of the ICO 3 Despite the global Halal industry enjoying immense growth worldwide with Islamic finance reaching USD$162 trillion in global commercial banking assets investments have been slow going into the cryptocurrency market This is partly due to the unclear ruling of cryptocurrency within the Shariah scope resulting in a majority of the Muslim population worldwide being hesitant to venture into crypto currency Clearly the opportunity lies in delivering an axis of real projects with real economic value grounded in the power of the Muslim faith a faith that has also shown tremendous economic and financial growth as witnessed in the Halal and Islamic Finance Markets 2 0 Vision Good For Goodness This birthed our vision Participate in \xe2\x80\x9cGood For Goodness\xe2\x80\x9d In very simple terms our product is one born of good (Shariah Compliant) and because of that we are committed to deliver goodness (real value and real growth) through carefully considered and selected projects for our Token Holders and society as a whole As such BYT is structured with the following attributes \xe2\x80\xa2 Has intrinsic value and benefit in accordance with Islamic principles \xe2\x80\xa2 Has real economic benefit and impact \xe2\x80\xa2 Potential return in the form of virtual membership privileges \xe2\x80\xa2 Deeply aligned with Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) and Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) standards \xe2\x80\xa2 Technology based token and projects \xe2\x80\xa2 Provides great utility features thus ensuring growth & sustainability of the token 1 \x0c3 0 \xe2\x80\x9cGoodness\xe2\x80\x9d at every turn Bayan Token in a nutshell From the moment the Tokens are purchased BYT holders can expect a mechanism built and dedicated to delivering \xe2\x80\x9cgoodness\xe2\x80\x9d at every junction An ERC20 token built on the Ethereum platform BYT leverages Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s smart contract attribute The significant hashing power of the platform ensures the network is secure and efficient Additionally a token contract represents the ownership of 16 hours of access to benefits of Private Cloud Server Each server has 2 GHz of computing power 1GB of memory 5GB of SSD disk and 10GB bandwidth per month of data transfer 2 \x0c4 0 Value Propositions of Bayan Token 4 1 Born of Good Fully Shariah Compliant Given the opportunity already coming from the immense growth of the Halal economy BYT believes that Muslim believers and followers should be given every chance to invest in the momentum of cryptocurrency As such we have taken all measures and every necessary step to ensure that our token is fully Shariah Compliant and in accordance with all the goodness of Islamic principles Within the Islamic Finance sphere in order for something to be permissible as a means of payment it must satisfy two characteristics it must be valuable as well as reliable We are convinced that we have managed to structure BYT so that it has an intrinsic value and it satisfies the Islamic requirement This therefore paves the way for Muslim investors and purchasers and we have achieved this by way of the following A Cloud Computing One BYT will entitle the holder to 16 hours of access to a Private Cloud Server One cloud server is made up of 2 GHz of computing power 1GB of memory 5GB of SSD disk and 10GB bandwidth per month of data transfer Biz Objek Our Virtual Private Server provider The private cloud server allows users access to a wide range of tools which include private data storage of inventories invoices web server email server DNS server or any services hosted on a Linux platform They should comply with the general guidelines to ensure a Shariah Compliant transaction We will provide a guidance kit to token holders on how to utilise the cloud server if they decide to redeem the benefits instead of holding our tokens for capital gains 3 \x0cB Transparent Safe and Secure Eco system A healthy and robust crypto ecosystem will include several features including 1 Exchange and payment gateway 2 E Wallet and flow of purchasing and unlocking the token and pin matter 3 KYC protocol 4 Web development 5 Open API These features are maintained by our experienced developers to ensure the whole operation runs smoothly and efficiently Among our key responsibilities are to ensure that all Token Holders will have a peace of mind and can transparently and easily monitor their ownership of BYT As such we will set up a personal dashboard for all BYT holders allowing them to observe their BYT balance and transactions Furthermore to combat abuse or the illegal use of BYT such as to assist in money laundering activity terrorism financing and/or transaction all customers are required to be whitelisted through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process that needs to be completed by the Token holders This KYC process is also available in the dashboard of BYT 4 \x0cC Utility Value and Sustainability of Bayan Token To ensure sustainability of BYT\xe2\x80\x99s value we need to have an ecosystem where the token can be used and circulated in the market BYT ultimately satisfies Shariah Compliancy as it acts as a means of payment and most importantly is backed by a tangible asset that gives it value BYT offers Token Holders the ease of payment as well as a secure way to purchase goods at our Halal Mart (terms and conditions apply) Use at other online and offline shops will be informed later to the BYT Holders via their personal dashboard newsletter and also a BYT Telegram Channel As an added value Token Holders can receive exclusive offers such as privileges and discounted prices at several stores free gifts and other services etc As a case study we refer to the OmiseGo (OMG) ICO The following data based on the etherscan io data evinces as follows ICO End Date\t\t\t Total Cap \t\t\t Token Distribution Date ICO Price \t\t\t Jun 23 2017 $25 000 000 Jul 7 2017 $0 24 | 0 001188 ETH The data shows that the new coin was priced at USD 0 24 during the ICO but increased by 7 087 5% in value to USD17 25 as of 3rd May 2018 This is attributed to the fact that the issuer had created an exclusive ecosystem and community where coins\xe2\x80\x99 holders may transact and circulate their coins among themselves for services and goods This is the plan for BYT and we believe BYT\xe2\x80\x99s price at ICO of USD 0 80 may increase significantly within a year or less HALAL MART \xe2\x80\xa2 Each BYT to its smallest denomination of 0 01 can be used to make normal purchases at our Halal Mart This certainly ensures the token acts not only as a store of value but also as a transfer of value However there will be a certain limit of acceptance by these stores that will be determined by top management of each store from time to time \xe2\x80\xa2 The usability of the token at the store requires a certain upgrade of the stores\xe2\x80\x99 payment gateway that will be under the project of this ICO Therefore the readiness of the system may take up 6 to 12 months after the completion of the ICO 5 \x0c4 2 Being \xe2\x80\x9cGood\xe2\x80\x9d is Smart Bayan Token Smart Contract A smart contract running on blockchain would be visible to all the computers in the network It becomes a self operating computer program that acts as an executor or enforcer after fulfilling specific conditions For example imagine a scenario where an insurance holder is trying to claim payment for an economic loss A smart contract would ensure that all conditions are met \xe2\x80\x93 claim in terms of form submission evidence of incident investigation report and approval from insurance company \xe2\x80\x93 before releasing payment Furthermore private data are only accessible to certain parties who can check and verify the content Smart contracts are less prone to manual errors and the process of execution virtually eliminates manipulation and non compliance Similar to Bitcoin transactions computer nodes in the network come to a consensus about the code execution The network will record the execution of the contract and update the ledger and monitor the compliance of the contract A BYT contract represents ownership of 16 hours\xe2\x80\x99 worth of private cloud server space for each BYT Users can claim the usage of the cloud server via a smart contract where the smart contract will execute API to the cloud server provider At the same time any amount (minimum 0 1 BYT) claimed will be burned in the smart contract whenever the API is successfully executed The BYT issued by BYT Issuing Company through the Ethereum Blockchain ensures that the smart contract automatically transfers private cloud server space from the tokens to their owners once redeemed BYT can be denominated to 2 decimal points Therefore the smallest BYT amount that can be purchased is 0 01 BYT However the cloud computing service can only be redeemed starting at 0 1 BYT i e 1 6 hours of access Other examples a purchase of 1 20 BYT means the holder will be entitled to 19 2 hours and if 0 80 BYT is purchased the access would be for 12 8 hours The data is only useable in countries listed under the cloud computing services region Ethereum Smart Contract Issues BYT Issuing Company Contract CONTRACT Buy Token 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 20 <CONTRACT> </CONTRACT> Buy cloud space allocation Show updated space order allocation Cloud Server Provider Issue token by private cloud server space 6 \x0c4 3 Projects of \xe2\x80\x9cGoodness\xe2\x80\x9d Participation in Real World Projects with Real World Value and Impact Proceeds from the BYT ICO will be used to fund several projects that will ensure growth and momentum of BYT Beyond its utility factor the Token is also backed by real life profitable projects that will not only support the whole ecosystem but also deliver impact for society as a whole \xe2\x80\x93 essentially bringing goodness to BYT holders and communities in ways beyond pure financial returns And more importantly these projects already exist and are not merely fictional lofty ideas or at ideation stages The Projects include 1 Development of a sophisticated Shariah compliant Artificial Intelligence Equity Trader for Global Exchanges Currently the system is being completed and tested for the US Market and successful results have been obtained 2 Expansion of 100 to 1 000 stores of Halal Grocery Mini Marts across Malaysia and South East Asia region 3 Production and commercialisation of the cholesterol reducing Basella Alba leaf extract as a health supplement 7 \x0c5 0 The Underlying Projects 5 1 The Z2 Shariah Compliant Artificial Intelligence Equity Trader (AiET) Bringing Technological Goodness for Smarter Investments In the era of high end technology trading has to be innovated to leverage the fastpaced trading arena and to capitalize on global opportunities Considering the volatility and complexity of market behaviours today it is more important that we leverage the power of modern technology and various trading strategies and techniques that will result in above average trading returns This inspiration led us to the Z2 Artificial Intelligence Equity Trader or Z2 AiET in short A passion for figures and research drove a zestful market trader 38 years ago in 1980 to delve into researching and testing stock trading strategies to predict the direction of stock prices The research centered on the premier stock exchanges NYSE and NASDAQ Through sheer perseverance and dedication applying mathematical and statistical formulas thousands of hours of flipping from tool to tool stock to stock market to market and with rigorous back testing on years of historical data and actual trading of stocks have eventuated in the discovery of strategies that are unique as they can be applied to any instrument be it equities futures or any other and across the global markets Modern day technology and the Internet gave ways to exhaust the capabilities of these strategies by converging powerful technical analysis software premium analysis tools and dynamic market scanning applications This led to the development of the Z2 platform a fully automated and semi automated strategy trading system that has time and again proven successful The cutting edge system provides the best investment and trading opportunities by streamlining the whole process of making investment decisions to produce more efficient profitable trades It\xe2\x80\x99s core characteristics are as such 1 Swift in analyzing and identifying prime investments 2 Consistent trading opportunities 3 Reduce human errors in decision making process 4 Disciplined approach without human discretion 5 Eliminate human emotions in trade execution and monitoring 8 \x0cZ2 PROTOCOL Designed for efficient filtering complex alerts and automated execution to support professional trading the Z2 platform is set on 4 major operating protocols 1 Z2 STRATEGY \xe2\x80\x93 REVOLUTIONARY Z2 employs 5 proprietary strategies that are analytical techniques developed through absolute devotion to discover a revolutionary approach It employs mathematical and statistical models trading rules based on price and volume transformations intermarket and intra market price correlations These strategies then identify trends tendencies and trading opportunities Being proprietary sharing of information on these strategies is restricted Z2 Coding \xe2\x80\x93 Advanced technical and fundamental analysis program developed and refined over a period of 10 years 9 \x0c2 Z2 SCANNER \xe2\x80\x93 INNOVATIVE The Z2 Scanner is a tool that allows the scanning of entire markets and their vast network of data to locate stocks that meet the Z2 STRATEGY screening criteria This high powered innovative tool employs the proprietary strategies and ravages through an extensive database of technical and fundamental data to identify potential trades All these are carried out in a matter of seconds and as such limit the time required for analysis The return result of this protocol is an astounding pool of prime stocks dynamically ranked and presented as trade potentials Picture below Z2 Scanner in Progress Picture below Z2 Scanner Results 10 \x0cThe A list stocks are then set onto Z2 AutoTrader a complex algorithmic platform based on arti\xef\xac\x81cial

money management incorporated 13 \x0cWHAT IS NEXT FOR Z2 Z2 AiET strategies are unique as they can be applied to any investment product across global markets The application of the Z2 AiET could be at any location globally as long as there is an Internet connection After the NYSE and NASDAQ we intend for Z2 to explore different markets and different products in the more vibrant exchanges around the world One of these markets is in the cryptocurrency market At the time of writing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is over USD$390 billion with Bitcoin leading the market at USD$149 billion One unit of Bitcoin is currently worth more than USD$8800 with its highest value of USD$19 000 reached in December 2017 Ether a known competing altcoin of Bitcoin has a market capitalization of just over USD$62 billion and is valued at $630 Ripple is in third place with a market capitalisation of USD$34 billion Bitcoin Cash a cryptocurrency that is separate from Bitcoin is growing at an unbelievable rate with a market capitalization of USD$8 billion within one day of conception making it the fourth biggest cryptocurrency in the market According to market reports the 24 hour trade volume in the cryptocurrency market has surpassed USD$50 billion and is nearing the daily average trade volume of New York Stock Exchange 14 \x0cLSE NYSE & NSDQ TSE SSE CHINA BURSA Z2 SYSTEM FSE HKSE SHZEN SE EURO NEXT TORSE The Z2 AiET software technology will not be initiated from scratch as the technology has already been researched years ago tested and proven to give double digit returns It now only requires several final developments to ensure it is at the highest level of efficiency and accuracy before it can be deployed The proceeds from the ICO will be used to back up the progress The Z2 AiET project is classified as a sustainable and responsible investment in nature and also socially good as it can generate a stable and reliable way of investing Additionally it creates a healthy ecosystem for BYT and is of great value to the Token Holders as the company will be investing a certain amount of collected proceeds in the system and expecting a quick return where some potential entitlements will be distributable to the holders 15 \x0c5 2 Development of a Halal Mart Network Delivering Goodness for Society by Tapping onto the potential of the Halal Economy Let\xe2\x80\x99s first look at some staggering numbers important statistics and universal truths 1 A Formidable Muslim Faith Powered Economy \xe2\x80\xa2 According to Thomson Reuters the overall size of the Islamic economy is $1 9 trillion in 2015 and with a projected CAGR growth of 8% the market is expected to reach $3 trillion by 2021 \xe2\x80\xa2 According to Pew Research Center the global Muslim population is expected to rise to 2 2 billion by 2030 making up 26 4% of the total world population \xe2\x80\xa2 Anecdotally there has been a proliferation of Islamic product advertising even in the Western countries For example we see a lot of Olympic female athletes asserting their rights to wear hijab as well a growing number of Muslim representations in other media such as movies and TV shows 2 Offline Presence Online Convenience \xe2\x80\xa2 A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers said physical stores are still relevant in the current economy especially with regards to groceries where 70% of the purchases are still done in store Conversely online commerce is the preferred choice by many to purchase books music movies video games and toys \xe2\x80\xa2 Seven Eleven Japan Co Ltd operates franchises and licenses some 64 319 stores in 18 countries as of January 2018 In May 2017 its market capitalisation was USD$37 billion and its total revenue grew from 5 84 trillion yen to 6 04 trillion yen \xe2\x80\xa2 99 Speedmart is a Malaysian owned network of convenience stores with humble beginnings in 1987 and has since grown to become a 1 000 strong national network as at 12th August 2017 \xe2\x80\xa2 In 2017 an estimated 1 66 billion people worldwide purchased goods online and global e retail sales in the United States amounted to USD$2 3 trillion (Source Statista) Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s e commerce market is expected to reach USD$1 3 billion in 2018 with an annual growth rate of 17 9% resulting in a market volume of USD$2 531 billion by 2022 With all these hard facts and proof points we intend to invest in the development and expansion of physical Halal Mini Marts across Malaysia based on an existing Elzar Mart model It will be a platform that offers a range of goods and groceries at very competitive and affordable price to ease the financial burden of the poor low and moderate income earners Simultaneously we intend to strengthen our position by operating an online platform that will focus first on urban areas 16 \x0cThis is significant for the Halal Market and offers a healthy competition to non halal supermarket and mini market operators Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s position as one of the biggest Halal hubs is an attractive selling point to investors small to medium retailers and most importantly conscientious consumers For BYT holders they can utilize their tokens by purchasing goods at our online platform and/or at any of our physical stores Mobile applications and our own payment gateway will be developed for customers\xe2\x80\x99 convenience and to guarantee prices remain competitive At any given time BYT holders must follow the following terms and conditions in order to purchase goods at Halal Mart \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 The exchange rate that will prevail is the respective country\xe2\x80\x99s Central Bank\xe2\x80\x99s exchange rate with extra 10% as cost of service There will be a maximum limit of transaction for each Halal Mart This amount will be determined and announced at a later date from time to time PricewaterhouseCoopers Study of Relevancy of Physical Stores 17 \x0cTHE PLAN FOR PHYSICAL STORE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION Depending on proceeds from the ICO we are looking at an expansion of at least 100 to 1 000 physical stores of Halal Mart across Malaysia and SEA countries such as Brunei Singapore and Indonesia within 3 years and that is through potential mergers with successful stores as well as inviting smaller vendors to join our platform We will operate our own warehouses that function as distribution centres at three zones East Coast Klang Valley and Southern Coast Each mini mart will have at least 2 000 4 000 stock keeping unit (SKU) in a store covering frozen food sundries canned food household items toys stationery fresh food ready to eat food dried food fruits certain medicines health supplements cosmetics bleach and soap shampoos toiletries and some electronic products The size of each store will be around 1500\xe2\x80\x933000 sqft with at least five doors of chillers and three to six sets of 4 foot freezers Additionally we will be developing an effective and systematic transportation and warehouse infrastructure to ensure the sustainability of the project in years to come TARGETED EXPANSION AREAS (MALAYSIA) WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS Perlis 2

Melaka 4 stores Johor 10 stores 18 \x0cELZAR MART AN EXCELLENT AND EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF THE HALAL MINI MART The Elzar Mart will become our base model to build an effective and efficient Halal Mini Mart chain The Elzar Mart leverages on a very organized systematic and efficient POS system in maintaining its inventories stocks and monitoring sales report and performances which we can easily adopt for the chain of Halal Mini Marts thereby reducing the learning curve costs while maximizing set up and driving momentum of development and expansion Sales live

Extract as a Health Supplement Goodness from Mother Nature that goes straight to the heart The third and final exciting project is the commercialisation and production of a new compound for health care Based on strong chemical and lab research the Basella alba leaf extract is suggested for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia Hypercholesterolemia is the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood An increased level of cholesterol can raise the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke According to a study by the World Health Organization hypercholesterolemia is estimated to cause 2 6 million deaths annually and 29 7 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in the global population In Malaysia coronary heart disease and stroke are two of the top causes of death In a report published by WHO in May 2014 deaths caused by coronary heart disease reached 29 363 deaths and stroke deaths were 15 497 Currently statins are the only drug administered to patients as a prescribed medicine to treat cardiovascular diseases in the early stages for those with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease However according to a study on the side effects of statin though they are generally well tolerated it can cause potentially severe side effects such as myopathy or rhabdomyolysis and polyneuropathy Long term consumption of statins causes severe adverse effects such as muscle and liver damage rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure Additionally a 2010 research review found that statins did not prevent mortality among people who were at risk of developing heart disease only those who already have a history of heart diseases or heart attacks Due to these side effects attention is now directed towards alternative medicines of plant origin The present study provides preliminary data that suggested the Basella alba leaf extract is capable of lowering bad cholesterol levels In addition the compounds of the leaf extract have been reported to possess beneficial effects in treating hypercholesterolemia and its related diseases Studies in vivo models could give further insights into the effects and roles of B alba as an alternative therapeutic agent in the prevention and management of hypercholesterolemia We believe that the development of a health supplement using the Basella alba leaf extract has the market potential to become a natural alternative to statins not only in the domestic Malaysian market but also globally In the future we plan to establish lab facilities in order to develop the Basella alba compound as a drug that can be prescribed in medical facilities 22 \x0c5 4 Other Projects More good and viable projects will be added up later as and when they can be confirmed as feasible and profitable All of these projects must be able to generate income and more profits and hence will be used to stabilize and bring growth and momentum to BYT\xe2\x80\x99s value 23 \x0c6 0 Token Crowdsale SYMBOL BYT SOFT CAP ETH in equivalent

company is incorporated in Singapore Singapore has emerged as the third largest ICO market after the US and Switzerland three countries perceived to be \xe2\x80\x9cICO friendly\xe2\x80\x9d Since mid 2017 Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued guidance on the issuance of digital tokens in Singapore to safeguard investors and prevent money laundering and related fraud Two announcements from the MAS made at the end of 2017 defined the challenges cryptocurrencies posed One of them MAS announced a series of guidelines designed to regulate the currency specifically Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) laying the groundwork for further advancement in this area Referring to A GUIDE TO DIGITAL TOKEN OFFERINGS issued by the Monetary Authority Singapore ( http //www mas gov sg/ page 8) \xe2\x80\x9cCase Study 1 Company A plans to set up a platform to enable sharing and rental of computing power amongst the users of the platform Company A intends to offer digital tokens (\xe2\x80\x9cToken A\xe2\x80\x9d) in Singapore to raise funds to develop the platform Token A will give token holders access rights to use Company A\xe2\x80\x99s platform The token can be used to pay for renting computing power provided by other platform users Token A will not have any other rights or functions attached to it Company A intends to offer Token A to any person globally including in Singapore Application of securities laws administered by MAS in respect of an offer of Token A \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 A holder of Token A will only have rights to access and use Company A\xe2\x80\x99s platform and the right to use Token A to pay for rental of computing power provided by other users Token A will not provide its holder any other rights or functions attached to it Hence Token A will not constitute securities under the SFA Company A\xe2\x80\x99s offer of Token A will not be subject to any requirement under the SFA or the FAA \xe2\x80\x9c After careful consultation with experts we believe that BYT complies with the above case study and hence does not constitute a security under the SFA and also will not be subject to any requirements under FAA 30 \x0cB)

The sale of BYT shall be governed exclusively by the terms and conditions of the BYT sale defined in a separate document and any information in relation to the BYT in this white paper is merely of descriptive nature There are key risks and restrictions relating to BYTs and the BYT Issuing Company network In general BYTs are utility tokens and do not confer directly or indirectly any rights or claims against BYT Issuing Company or any third party By accessing this white paper you acknowledge understand and agree that \xe2\x80\xa2 While BYTs may be traded on exchanges and through brokers note that BYTs may only be used in the BYT Issuing Company network \xe2\x80\xa2 BYTs may have certain value due to the internet data that it contains but it is possible to lose the data and any investment in BYTs may also be entirely lost \xe2\x80\xa2 There is no guarantee or representation of value or liquidity for the BYTs and the value of BYTs may be significantly influenced by digital currency market trends unrelated to BYTs or the BYT Issuing Company \xe2\x80\xa2 BYT Issuing Company and any of its affiliates have no obligations or are liable for 1 the transferability of the BYTs 2 the liquidity of BYTs and/or 3 the availability of any market for BYTs through any third parties \xe2\x80\xa2 Due to regulatory uncertainties or restrictions selling restrictions apply to any resident or citizen of countries where the acquisition of utility tokens or cryptocurrencies is prohibited or restricted 32 \x0c13 0 Risk And Mitigation Process LEGAL ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION To address this issue and risk we have done our best efforts to ensure that BYT does not constitute a share for it does not confer ownership interest in any corporation nor a debenture or a unit of collective investment scheme Hence according to \xe2\x80\x98A Guide to Digital Token Offering\xe2\x80\x99 issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) BYT as we understood will not constitute securities under Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and will not be subject to any requirement under the SFA or the FAA this is based on the characteristic of BYT which is close to case study number 1 (page 8 in A Guide to Digital Token Offering of Singapore) FAILURE TO REACH MINIMUM CAP DURING ICO This would be lead to inability to run the projects efficiently However should this happen we will give priority to the most profitable and lower cost projects with best possible return and that project should be the Artificial Intelligence Equity Trader and the Halal Mart BIO TECH PROJECT UNABLE TO COMPLETE DUE TO LACK OF FUND We are aware that this project requires a lot of funds as it needs a piece of land about 10 \xe2\x80\x93 20 acres to grow Basella Alba leaves It also requires a plant to process the leaves and another set up cost As such to mitigate the risk we can also grow the crops in a smaller size of land and may also be only rented from certain land owners Furthermore we may as well be asking the third party factory to produce this supplement by using their facility but with close observation and monitoring from our team This we believe can lower the cost of failure (if occurring) We will be doing this at the start of the project until the product already clocks a success only then the bigger scale of production will be sought PROTECTION OF OUR NETWORK AND WALLET OF BYT HOLDERS FROM EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL HACKERS In order to mitigate this risk we will hire a group of white hackers to run a security test on our system Additionally we have also appointed an expert advisor who has vigorous experience in cybersecurity to continuously observe and advise on security matters for at least one year 33 \x0cFUND MANAGEMENT RESTRICTION AND THE AiET MAY BE UNFIT FOR BIG SCALE Our experts and researchers have tried the system for many years using a small and medium amount of money up to USD 10 mil The result shows that there is no real concern as the bigger the fund the more counters will be invested and there will be no confined engagement to a stock during trading Hence we believe that the big scale of money will not lead to a negative result but surely will increase the accumulated profit AiET MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED FROM TIME TO TIME TO AVOID HICCUPS DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF MARKET\xe2\x80\x99S PATTERN Our expert will work closely with the technology and consistently monitor for any hiccups that may happen This is not alien to those experts as they are already used to such hiccups during 10 years of testing Hence we believe that we are set to do manual adjustment if needed LIQUIDITY & OWNERSHIP RIGHT ISSUE Even if digital tokens are tradable in a secondary market in practice there may not be enough active buyers and sellers or the bid ask spreads may be too wide You may not be able to exit your token investments easily In the worst case scenario where no secondary market exists you may not be able to liquidate your token holdings at all The valuation of digital tokens is usually not transparent and highly speculative Where digital tokens do not hold any ownership rights to the seller\xe2\x80\x99s assets some digital tokens would not be backed by any tangible asset Such tokens would be merely speculative investments and their traded price can fluctuate greatly within a short period of time There is a high risk that you could lose your entire investment amount In the worst case scenario the digital tokens could be rendered worthless As for BYT Tokens we already mitigated this risk by ensuring that each token at least contains a tangible asset that could be redeemed and furthermore utilisable at several registered stores online and offline which will be ready with its payment system in the near future Hence there would be a smaller risk to the Token Holders even if they are unable to liquidate the BYT to fiat since they will still be able to utilise it at the registered shops or claiming the space of the cloud server for their personal usage CREDIBILITY AND IDEATION STAGE ISSUE The seller of digital tokens may not have a proven track record making it hard for you to establish its credibility As with all start ups the failure rate tends to be high In our case our team believe that this risk of the project has been mitigated since the majority of the underlying projects are our existing businesses We also use tested technologies which is managed by experienced individuals and team having been verified on a smaller scale We are now targeting to expand our footing and share the fruits of labour to a larger crowd It is no longer at ideation stage or \xe2\x80\x98planning from scratch\xe2\x80\x99 by inexperienced people 34 \x0c14 0 Team and Advisors Our list of team members and esteemed advisors can

the corn so that people might see it He who deceives is not of us \xe2\x80\x9d (Recorded by Muslim) All these evidences require an asset to be transparent has value for its being exchanged with purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s valuable money as such each Bayan token has been certified and guaranteed to have real values and hence fulfils the requirement of the valid subject matter in Islamic transaction \x0cBYT is Mal Mutaqawwam \xe2\x80\x93 It is really considered as a recognised wealth that has a real commercial value since each token is represented by a combination of multiple usufructs and benefits as follows \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 It contains 16 hours of benefits of a private cloud server Recognisable value by crypto believers and hence worthy to be traded on the Cryptocurrency Secondary Market We realised that some segment of crypto believers consider a cryptocurrency to have its own value due to the technology superiority itself to us though this may not be acceptable to some however it may still be considered as secondary supporting justification on the existing value It will be carrying the real value when the token is targeted to be usable at several registered shops This will make the token to have the value of the goods available in the stores PARTIES a] The BYT does not have an anonymous owner A responsible team has publicised their identity and hence alleviating an uncertainty level in the whole structure b] The token issuer has made it clear that all customers need to be whitelisted through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process which is a significant move to circumvent money laundering and terrorism financing activities and clients CONTRACT RELATIONSHIP The contract between the Token Holder and the Issuing Company is as follows 1 During Pre ICO stage (where the token and its benefits are still under construction) The contract It is an al Ijarah al Mawsufah fi al Zimmah or also known as Salam fi al Manafi\xe2\x80\x99 or Advance Lease contract henceforth BYT holders are considered to be paying an advance rental for the prescribed benefits (refer the \xe2\x80\x98subject matter\xe2\x80\x99) from the private cloud server 2 During the ICO and after ICO (where the token is ready together with its benefits already tied up via smart contract) The contract A normal Ijarah between the issuing company and the BYT buyer As and when the token holders want to utilize the benefits they can redeem via smart contract and the system will automatically execute API They then can immediately enjoy the space for 16 hours per BYT \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 The time of 16 hours per BYT will commence during the redemption by the token holders and not at the time of token purchase This token is not based on a partnership contract This is not based on any investment contract \x0cADDITIONAL FEATURES a] The BYT Holder Virtual Membership Card with future entitlements such as discounted price for goods and services We believe this is permissible and not constitute a prohibited type of discount card as the membership is receive upon purchasing the BYT Token at its original price furthermore the virtual membership card is represented by the BYT token itself The prohibited type of Discount Card is when the subscription of the card requires subscriber to pay an exclusive or additional price to own the card this is irrelevant in the case of BYT b] There is also no problem for the uncertain future entitlements as those entitlements are considered as \xe2\x80\x98hibah\xe2\x80\x99or gift from the issuing company to token holders It is known that gharar in gift is considered as tolerated minor gharar LEGAL We have understood that the BYT does not constitute a share for it does not confer ownership interest in any corporation nor a debenture or a unit of collective investment scheme Hence according to \xe2\x80\x98A Guide to Digital Token Offering\xe2\x80\x99 issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) BYT as we understood will not constitute securities under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and will not be subject to any requirement under the SFA or the FAA This is based on the characteristic of BYT which is close to case study number 1 (page 8 in A Guide to Digital Token Offering of Singapore) TRADING Shariah Compliant Trading Item \xe2\x80\x93 It is evidenced that the token is backed by specific usufructs which is intangible in nature as such the traded BYT is not a debt (cash) whenever trade occurs Each time the usufructs of the BYT are emptied due to the usage or time allowance has expired the BYT will perish from the system and no longer available for trading This practice is permissible and complying with the valid Ijarah parameters We are also of the view that when traded the relationship between seller and buyer is that the BYT holders sub leasing the usufruct which embodied in the BYT to a third party in which also permissible Wallahu\xe2\x80\x98alam RISK a] We believe that the risk and volatile trading behaviour of the cryptocurrencies at the trading platform is based on demand and supply and for BYT it is clearly optional to the token holder whether or not to participate Hence it is beyond the responsibility of the issuer apart from it does not affect the permissibility of the issuance of the token since the level of risk has been clearly spelt out in its white paper b] Additionally the token issuer has put huge efforts to discourage unnecessary trading by shaping the token to have real benefits and utilisable to purchase real goods \x0cc] Trading such a neutral digital asset is comparable the normal trading shares which already being made permissible by majority of the Shariah scholars and conferences d] We also believe that the risk of the project has been mitigated due to the fact that the majority of the underlying projects are existing businesses and tested technologies managed and operated by experienced individuals The projects have been established in a smaller scale previously before targeting to expand It is no longer at ideation stage or planning from scratch by inexperienced people PROJECTS We have also scrutinized the projects in which underlies the token and satisfied that all of the projects are Shariah Compliant and will continuously be observed to follow the rules of Shariah by our team Insha Allah As for the AiET Z2 system all of the stocks traded will be using the FTSE Shariah benchmark where the information will be provided by ideal ratings company Additionally the benefits of the servers also limited to Shariah Compliant usage and filtered automatically by a programed system Based on the above justifications and to the best of our knowledge in our opinion it is permissible for customers to either purchase the BYT trade it at the secondary market or use it at the registered stores Wallahu\xe2\x80\x98alam Allah knows best Sheikh Dr Sa\xe2\x80\x99id
