 11 Partners and Investors 28
 Since Atari first pioneered the video gaming
 with the introduction of Pong in 1972 
 technology and human computer interaction
 concepts and design continue to advance in the
 ensuing decades 
 Video gaming has grown from a homebrew
 community into a worldwide cultural
 phenomenon allowing the development of
 incredibly passionate and engaged gaming
 communities For example Tencent Games’
 multiplayer online battle arena competition 
 Kings of Glory demonstrates the ascendance of
 the medium the mobile platform hosts over 80
 million daily active players (DAU) and 200
 million monthly active players (MAU) as a result
 of unique design and seamless social network
 integration 
 Video gaming popularity has also translated into
 a formidable gaming industry no less
 mainstream than professional sports According
 to the Global Games Market Report by Newzoo 
 2 2 billion gamers across the globe are
 expected to generate $108 9 billion in game
 revenues in 2017 The industry trend is expected
 to continue and to accelerate 
 Meanwhile recent advances in 3D modeling
 and virtual reality technologies have inspired
 developers to blur the boundary between the
 real and the virtual world For instance the
 01
 Pushing the
 Boundary
 between the Real
 and Virtual World
 Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series by Rockstar
 Games allows players to take on the role of a
 criminal in a big city with scenes so lifelike that
 every game in the series has been both lauded
 and criticized for its graphic and uncanny
 portrayal of reality 
 Despite these technical innovations modern
 large scale multiplayer games suffer from a
 number of significant limitations Most games
 today are calcified by developers and designers
 with predetermined game play and finite
 variability Flexibility and evolution within games
 are limited No matter how good a game initially
 is the lack of evolution of the game eventually
 causes players to lose interest 
 Additionally due to the current centralization of
 game creation the rules and rankings in the
 existing games are not transparent or fair and
 often incite complaints among players against a
 centralized corporate game maker 
 In essence the participating game players lack
 ultimate control to make requested changes 
 while the corporate game designers and
 developers hold the ultimate arbiting power
 within the game The game players are
 relegated to a subservient position while game
 developers and designers act as de facto
 masters 
 The advent of blockchain technology now
 allows us to overcome these limitations and
 empower the game participants One Game can
 create a decentralized virtual world in which the
 game participant is the ultimate owner creator 
 and arbiter 
 02
 One Game introduces a decentralized and selfevolving world of infinite variability governed by
 creators gamers and players based on a set of
 consensus protocols that reward and incentivize
 the contributing actors As a radical paradigm
 shift the participants in One Game control their
 own reality in an infinite self evolving game 
 03
 What is One Game 
 Chapter 1
 One Game is a decentralized virtual world built
 on top of blockchain technology the first of its
 kind One Game has no predefined gameplays 
 game design or objectives and is an open
 gaming and creation platform owned by
 creators and players allowing creators of
 varying skills to create their own reality in this
 world One Game offers considerable design
 flexibility ease of use and tremendous creative
 freedom along with community based
 decentralized governance 
 Unlike traditional and centralized gaming
 companies One Game is a decentralized world
 controlled by and evolving through its
 community The fruits of its community’s labor
 in this virtual world accrues to the One Game
 community not a centralized company 
 To this end One Game introduces two sets of
 consensus algorithms integrated into the One
 Game source code Proof of Popularity and
 Proof of Competitiveness in order to create a
 decentralized measurement for developers and
 players and to give the participants voting
 power based on individualized scores that
 reflect their contribution to the One Game
 ecosystem 
 By contributing to the development and
 evolution of One Game developers and gamers
 are rewarded with in game utility tokens OGT 
 which allows them to further participate and to
 trade in the economy of One Game 
 04
 Finally One Game evolves over time through
 system upgrades and is governed by
 decentralized consensus This will be explored
 further herein 
 At this time One Game will provide a framework
 of fundamental components that enable the
 creation of the virtual world based on a
 framework roadmap One Game will also
 release three products (Avatar Wallet Open
 Platform and Master Game) as planned in the
 product roadmap to serve as example
 applications and to inspire the community into
 building even better applications 
 Players can connect to the One Game world
 through a PC client VR headset or mobile
 device supported by a base layer infrastructure
 and engines driven by a cryptocurrency
 ecosystem 
 With the participation and creation of
 individuals One Game will become the Oasis as
 described in Ready Player One The boundary
 between the real and virtual world will
 disappear as the virtual world can evolve and
 potentially surpass the real world by
 incorporating intelligent design and artificial
 intelligence 
 05
 The One Game framework is defined as a set of
 primitive components of the proposed virtual
 world The goal is to create a platform for
 developers to build virtual content and for
 players to play games The platform consists of
 the following components 
 A Avatar Wallet
 The One Game Avatar is the One Game identity
 assigned to each user While the avatar may
 appear to be initially primitive it can evolve over
 time and is in fact highly customizable 
 The One Game Avatar has certain features that
 can be modified by the players including
 physical appearance such as facial features
 and skins behaviors and intelligence In the
 section 5 A the role of genes on avatars will be
 further described in detail 
 One Game
 Components
 Chapter 2
 The One Game system not only allows game
 players to access the system through
 authentication of username and password but
 also assigns them with avatars as their graphical
 representation in the virtual world of One Game 
 Just as Parzival appears to be an improved
 version of Wade Owen Watts One Game Avatar
 will be an improved version of the game player
 in the One Game virtual world 
 C Game Assets
 In One Game’s innovative in game economy 
 players own and can use their Game Assets not
 only in their own land parcel but also can use
 the Game Assets in other games These Game
 Assets are usable across the entire One Game
 world 
 Games Assets define the visible entities in the
 world of One Game such as human characters 
 animals vehicles and buildings 
 Players may find free or purchasable assets
 from the One Game Asset Store to use in game
 play Players retain ownership of these assets
 and have the freedom to transfer Game Assets 
 Developers can create new assets for
 themselves or for the community and sell or
 share these assets in the One Game Asset Store 
 Transactions will be conducted using OGT
 tokens the in game utility token of the One
 Game world 
 At this time it is of interest to note that there is a
 special type of the game assets is the NonPlayer Characters (NPCs) Unlike the avatar
 characters directly controlled by the players 
 NPCs come alive with the help of AI algorithms
 and gamer training and can join different
 games NPCs will be further described in the 5 B
 section 
 B Land System
 The land system in One Game is based on land
 parcels on which users design game scenes
 and game rules 
 The One Game system allows the generation of
 unlimited amounts of virtual parcels of land 
 with sizes ranging from 2 000 pixel x 2 000 pixel
 to 2 000 000 pixel x 2 000 000 pixel A
 developer needs to pay a small fee in OGT in
 order to generate new parcels of land on which
 he can create games and scenes Once a player
 acquires a land parcel he or she is to own and
 transfer it 
 A map editor will be launched to allow
 developers to create new land and edit
 landscape textures and features Initially 
 individual parcel of land is disjointed by default 
 However developers can collaborate and
 connect their respective parcels of land to
 create cities on which they build large scale
 games 
 06
 07
 Land Editor alters the land’s topographical
 appearance such as elevation and landscaping 
 − Assets Editor enables developers to import
 3D models from 3rd party modeling software
 (for example Maya or 3DSMax) and convert the
 models into supported formats and add
 skeletons as needed 
 − Avatar Editor creates and modifies avatars
 features behaviors and genetics makeup 
 − Scripts Editor edits scripts in order to control
 properties and events related to land assets or
 tasks 
 The goal is to enable novice developers with
 limited or no experience to make simple games
 using easy to understand editor user interface 
 as well as to provide advanced functionalities
 and options with a full set of scripts and
 libraries to allow professional developers to
 create remarkable and professional games 
 D Gaming Scripts
 Gaming Scripts are used to help developers
 define customized gaming rules on their land
 parcel and to generate new rules 
 Developers can use scripts to override the
 default physical appearance design new
 gaming narratives make NPCs come alive
 through AI algorithms or define the starting and
 ending conditions of their games on their land
 parcel 
 The script libraries will consist of a library of Lua
 scripts and in the future extend to Javascript 
 Developers can use these scripts as they are or
 modify these scripts to meet their needs as they
 wish 
 E Developer Tools
 Game or content creation in One Game will be
 facilitated through the following Developer
 Tools 
 A daily lottery will be held inside the wallet and
 based on some rules players are given
 opportunities to win varying categories of virtual
 items some of which can be apply onto their
 avatar or used on their land parcel 
 The Avatar Wallet further rewards player for
 holding OGT in their wallet much like Gas from
 NEO Players are rewarded by holding OGT in
 their Avatar Wallet by receiving virtual goods 
 Moreover by integrating with social networks 
 players can socialize and engage with their
 friends through their avatars share their selfies 
 and gift virtual items 
 The primary motivation for creating the Avatar
 Wallet product is to attract users to the One
 Game platform however a non goal or a byproduct of this app will be enabling regular
 people to understand blockchain and
 cryptocurrency through gamified user interface 
 creation of avatar and sending virtual gifts 
 One Game
 Product Timeline
 Chapter 3
 Based on the components introduced in the
 previous section the virtual world of One Game
 will be delivered to players step by step 
 according to the following product pipeline 
 A Avatar Wallet
 This product is designed as an HTML5 based
 app targeting mobile devices It extends the
 Avatar Editor mentioned in the previous section 
 and will serve as the entry point of One Game’s
 virtual world 
 Like regular wallet apps it allows users to
 deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies
 including Ethereum and One Game Token (or
 OGT ) What’s unique in this app is that users
 can view and customize their One Game
 Avatars which is their representation in One
 Game 
 08
 C The Master Game
 The Master Game is a sandbox game available
 on the Open Platform and focuses on creating
 the origin world of One Game The Master Game
 introduces a set of rules of interaction among
 gamers 
 The goal of The Master Game is to showcase
 the features and functionalities of the platform 
 This game will be used as a way to teach
 gamers and developers of the extent of
 possibilities that exist This game will allow
 others to fork its code much like forking from a
 code repository into their own versions and to
 make game design changes as they like 
 The game will make the best use of the One
 Game framework and encourage more and
 more players to become developers and for
 developers to see what is possible in terms of
 game design and become capable developers 
 09
 B The Open Platform
 After building the initial user base with the
 Avatar Wallet the One Game foundation will
 launch Open Platform in order to provide an
 SDK and Developer Tools to game developers
 from around the world and to allow them to
 build games using the avatars and game assets
 available on the Open Platform 
 Developers can publish their games to the
 platform and receive rewards from the
 Incentive Program (see 7 C) players can play
 various games recommended by the platform 
 using the avatars created in the Avatar Wallet 
 and receive rewards too Virtual items that
 players won in the lottery or different games
 will be available universally among games in
 the platform 
 From the technical point of view the Open
 Platform is a wrapper of all One Game
 framework components but it also provides
 some additional features 
 A lobby for players to browse and search for
 parcels with games created by developers 
 − An embedded messenger that allows players
 to communicate with other players 
 − A leaderboard for players or developers to
 track their ranking in different games (see 5 A
 and 5 B) 
 10
 − Cities as a whole are ranked and members
 can receive platform rewards in OGT according
 to their respective contribution to the city
 − Trading virtual resources in different cities the
 player can profit from active trading of scarce
 virtual goods
 − Launching a competition or even warfare 
 where one city can plunder virtual items and ingame currency from other cities
 More details of the Master Game will be
 announced in the future 
 In the Master Game players can create a city on
 a land parcel or join land parcels with those
 being created by other players and explore the
 games in the city 
 Some early functionalities to be developed in
 the Master Game include 
 Building and developing the city
 − Hosting mini competitions inside the city to
 attract more players to connect their land
 parcels to the city
 − Receive rewards from selling tickets and
 transacting virtual items 
 11
 The One Game architecture is outlined below 
 The client side consists of multiple interfaces
 that connect to the virtual world for game
 players and Developer Tools for game
 developers Initially the One Game team plans
 to focus on mobile devices by launching the
 Avatar Wallet and the Open Platform and then
 extend to support other clients 
 The server side is built on Deepbrain Chain
 (DBC) which is a low cost flexible and
 decentralized AI computing platform The
 motivation for choosing this platform is that One
 Game requires significant computing resources
 and includes the implementation of AI
 algorithms while Deepbrain Chain provides the
 viable decentralized solution for these use
 cases The server side consists of two
 components smart contracts on Deepbrain
 Chain and mining services deployed on
 Deepbrain Chain’s computing platform 
 One Game Architecture
 Chapter 4
 − Land System keeps the full records of land
 creation land ownership and pricing history 
 Land ownership is acquired through purchasing
 using OGT 
 − Asset System traces the status of all the
 game assets such as the status of avatars 
 B Hosted Service by Miners
 In the simulated mining process miners deploy
 services to Deepbrain Chain’s computing
 platform 
 Main Server includes fundamental
 components of the system including game
 lobby asset store and scenes 
 AI Algorithms include algorithms for
 pathfinding genetic recombination and
 mutation and the behavior and decision making
 of the NPCs 
 Numeric Computing manages game physics
 and collision detection 
 Scripting Engine compiles and executes
 scripts created by developers 
 12
 Any user can become a miner by downloading
 One Game’s source code from an open sourced
 repository and uploading the compiled binary
 to Deepbrain Chain’s computing platform to
 execute In this way through Deepbrain Chain
 hosting network miners provide computing and
 storage solutions to One Game and are
 rewarded One Game Tokens through simulated
 mining process 
 Game results and user ranking are implemented
 on the server side The gaming clients only
 conduct rendering and computations that do
 not affect the game results or user rankings 
 A Smart Contracts
 One Game’s core system is built on top of
 Deepbrain Chain as smart contracts 
 The core system contains the following key
 components 
 − Miner’s Registration Center where miners
 register themselves and service client side
 requests that are routed to the mining services 
 − Incentive Program manages how One Game
 token rewards are generated in the system and
 how the rewards are distributed to miners 
 developers and players based on consensus
 rankings 
 The computing platform of Deepbrain Chain
 also guarantees that once a version is deployed 
 it will be kept in a sandbox safely and will not be
 modified by any external programs or actors 
 D Game Engine
 Ideally One Game aims to create an
 implementation entirely based on open sourced
 solutions however most commercial game
 engines are close sourced at this time 
 For now for our prototypes Unity3D and Egret
 are chosen as the game engines Later One
 Game will open source the source code and the
 communication protocols Ultimately if there
 are better game engines One Game will
 consider migrating to a different solution
 E Early Stage Technology Stack
 The Avatar Wallet and other early stage
 products of One Game are created with semicentralized architecture 
 The reason for using such a solution initially is
 that the team plans to rapidly re iterate on the
 product based on feedback from the users and
 community After the product is stabilized the
 products will be migrated to decentralized
 architecture described in Section 4 A 4 C 
 13
 When the client sends requests to the server it
 looks up for the corresponding service’s IP
 address from Miner’s Registration Center and
 sets up a peer to peer connection with the
 service 
 When the requests from the client side exceeds
 the capacity of the existing miners the Incentive
 Program (see 7 C) will raise the mining rewards
 to attract more miners On the contrary when
 there are less requests from the client side the
 Incentive Program will lower the mining
 rewards which will result in a decrease of
 number of miners 
 C Version Management based on Consensus
 and Security Mechanism
 In One Game’s mining process anyone can
 become a miner without any permission which
 means miners have the freedom to host
 different versions of the service and they can
 provide forked ones improved by open source
 contributions 
 However to mitigate possible security concerns
 and to protect the system from potential
 security hazards on one hand the system
 records and registers all the binaries’
 fingerprints in the Miner’s Registration Center 
 on the other hand a voting process is designed 
 such that game developers and game players
 can form a committee and decide which open
 source version is the elected version The
 theory of the voting process is explained in
 detail in Section 6 
 Content Delivery Layer
 User generated assets are stored in blob
 storage such as AWS S3 
 A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used in
 order to speed up requests and reduce latency
 of static assets from global user base 
 Data Store Layer
 Postgres database are available on cloud
 servers 
 Redis is used any high frequency server side
 in memory data using different kinds of data
 structures 
 Real Time Layer
 Socket io is used to handle real time client toserver communication through websockets 
 WebRTC is used to setup peer to peer
 connections between users 
 14
 Currently the following technology stacks are
 designed for the Avatar Wallet 
 Rendering Layer
 LayaBox renders 2D and 3D
 scenes Computing Layer
 Nginx serves as the load balancer to distribute
 traffic 
 Node js server instances sit behind a reverse
 proxy 
 Blockchain Layer
 Web3 js API connects to Ethereum blockchain
 through Infura 
 Key transactions and checkpoints are
 recorded in Ethereum Blockchain using smart
 contracts 
 Only encrypted communication over HTTPS is
 enabled to ensure the security of user
 information 
 Monitoring services are enabled to enable
 high availability 
 Over the course the goal is to migrate the
 above design to a fully decentralized
 architecture and to make use of any superior
 new technologies of the rapid developing
 blockchain world 
 15
 Privacy and security of user data are critical to
 the success of a cryptocurrency wallet The
 Avatar Wallet adopts the following security
 strategy 
 The private key of any user generated wallets
 are double encrypted using a password
 managed by the server admin and a password
 managed by the users To decrypt the private
 key both passwords are required 
 The databases are periodically snapshot 
 Any user uploaded confidential information 
 such as Know Your Client data are encrypted 
 and will be destroyed permanently from the
 current database and from the backups based
 on regulations of various jurisdictions 
 Two factor authentication is available and
 recommended to all users They can use
 temporary access code sent to their mobile
 devices to strengthen the security of their
 personal accounts 
 Any large amount of digital assets is
 transferred to cold storage which is
 disconnected from the Internet to prevent any
 unauthorized access 
 All database operations will be conducted
 through ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to
 prevent SQL injection attacks 
 16
 Self Evolution of
 One Game
 Chapter 5
 To build a complex virtual world solely relying
 on inputs from human beings (whether it is the
 One Game team or the third party developers)
 is not sufficient One Game needs to self evolve
 with the help of Genetic Algorithms and other
 Artificial Intelligence algorithm 
 A Implementation of Genetic Algorithms
 One Game developers will provide various
 types of game assets and scripts to the platform
 over time while game players will provide an
 ongoing stream of data through game play 
 As One Game assets and scripts are highly
 modularized the combination of different
 modules will generate infinite gaming
 possibilities and variations 
 One Game’s Developer Tools allow developers
 to map asset modules with genes every gene
 carries a phenotypic trait 
 By paying a fee in OGT game players can apply
 genetic mutations or combinations onto assets
 owned by them Game players may continue to
 iterate on the genetic combination process until
 they satisfied with the generated final result 
 After multiple rounds of developers’ and
 players’ inputs and feedback the platform will
 evolve with surprising results via this
 evolutionary process One Game grants players
 and developers godlike abilities of
 personalization and creation 
 By integrating reinforcement learning and other
 mathematical models our goal is to let NPCs
 take input from the players and optimize their
 decisions based on what they have learned 
 One Game’s integration with genetic algorithms
 and other Artificial Intelligence algorithms
 combines knowledge in biology mathematics 
 and computer science 
 This white paper has set out the basic concept 
 framework architecture protocols and features
 of One Game and OGT One Game’s dedicated
 tokens but blockchain technology is evolving at
 a bewildering pace We expect One Game to
 also evolve rapidly and will upgrade our
 platform from all the stakeholders of the One
 Game world 
 17
 B Integration of Other Artificial Intelligence
 Algorithms
 Deep learning algorithms can be utilized in the
 process of world creation It will save human
 players from the tedious routine work such as
 adding clothes to avatars altering landscapes 
 placing roads and streets in a city especially the
 work that required pixel level dedication 
 By training AI to learn how human players or
 developers set up land parcel deep learning
 models can be trained to take over these tasks 
 thereby greatly simplify the base level of work
 required for developers to set up the land
 parcels By lower the initial cost of creation 
 more creators both less experienced and
 advanced can participate in world creation and
 enjoy the process of creation Moreover virtual
 content can be created in a faster pace 
 Reinforcement learning is another algorithm
 that can be used to improve the gaming
 experience in One Game 
 For example NPCs in One Game serve unique
 functionalities by providing assistance to the
 gamers and the community at large NPCs in
 most games are managed by a pre defined
 decision tree giving players the feeling that the
 NPCs are ƗintelligentƘ This is the current socalled ƗGame AIƘ 
 18
 Decentralized governance relies on consensus 
 One Game uses Popularity Rank (R ) and
 Competitiveness Rank (R ) as the consensus
 mechanisms R and R measure the activeness
 of developers and players and the platform will
 periodically recompute R and R for each
 developer and player 
 These two consensus mechanisms enable
 decentralized governance by eliminating a
 central arbiter and empowering the creators
 and game players to control the evolution of the
 platform based on voting 
 A Popularity Rank defines the popularity of the
 land created by developers 
 
 Here R (l i + 1) and R (l i) respectively represent
 a land l’s Popularity Rank in the current period
 (period i + 1) and the previous period (period i) k
 is a number between 0 and 1 and represents
 the weight of the current period P is the set of
 all the players that visited land l in the current
 period and p represents a single player t(p l)
 represents the time that a single player p spent
 in land l and T(p) is the time that player p spent
 in all the land in the current period 
 A developer d’s Popularity Rank R (d i) equals to
 the sum of all of d s land s Popularity Rank
 R (l i) where l represents a single land and
 L(d) is the set of all the land created by d 
 B Competitiveness Rank defines players’
 performance in different games created by
 developers 
 Here R (p i + 1) and R (p i) represent a single
 player p’s Competitiveness Rank in the current
 period and the previous period k is a number
 between 0 and 1 and represents the weight of
 the current period L is the set of land that
 player p visited in the current period and l
 represents a single piece of land s(l p)
 represents a single player p’s performance
 score in land l and S(l) presents the sum of all
 the scores from different players in land l 
 Please note that the Popularity Rank R (l i) of
 the previous period is used as a weight in the
 formula In other words players need to gain
 scores in more popular games in order to better
 increase their Competitiveness Rank

 C Version Upgrade Based on Proof of
 Popularity and Proof of Competitiveness
 The platform will choose
 N developers with the
 highest Popularity Rank and
 N players with the
 highest Competitiveness Rank as the judges to
 form a committee 
 When the One Game development team
 updates the platform it will be presented
 through smart contract to the committee who
 will make the new version official upon 2/3 of
 the judges approval 
 Theoretically third party developers can also
 develop new versions and submit these 
 Eventually it is the committee that ultimately
 decides when and how the platform upgrades 
 D Ranking Based Management of Negative
 Content
 The issue of filtering for violent or inappropriate
 content is based on community curation The
 ranking system will be further adapted to
 reduce the ranks of negative content based on
 community feedback and obscure such content
 from users 
 One Game works with accredited attorneys on
 legal matters such as copyrights and age
 restrictions One Game will provide parent
 control feature to create a safe virtual
 environment for children and provides guidance
 on age restriction rating rules based on existing
 industry standards of rating organizations such
 as Pan European Game Information (PEGI) and
 Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) 
 One Game believes that the decentralized selfgovernance will provide a framework for
 ensuring a safe VR experience for minors c p
 20
 Participants in One Game can fully participate in
 economic transactions among users To this
 end One Game introduces One Game Token
 (OGT) which allows instant global transactions
 among participants 
 OGT is a fungible component of One Game In
 the virtual world of One Game the economy is
 based on the fungible token of fixed supply 
 which also carries utility value in the One Game
 world 
 A Introducing One Game Token (OGT)
 One Game Token (OGT) is an ERC20 compatible
 token initially issued on top of the Ethereum
 blockchain and then swapped to Deepbrain
 Chain token There is a finite supply of OGT and
 the amount in circulation is pre defined 
 B OGT Usage
 OGT is the in game utility token OGT can be
 used to purchase land parcels virtual goods
 and services in the One Game world By
 purchasing OGT new gamers and developers
 will be able to participate in the One Game
 world and engage in its economy immediately 
 The following summarizes some use cases of
 OGT 
 − Creating and maintaining land
 − Paid options in games developed by
 developers
 − Buying and selling assets in Asset Store
 − Rewards for developer and players
 − Fees for using computing and storage
 resources
 OGT is a digital asset that is transferable ingame as the native currency and game fuel and
 is also transferable outside of One Game
 platform As the One Game platform matures 
 the value of OGT in theory moves in tandem
 with the value of the platform However we will
 not be facilitating any secondary trading of OGT
 as our intention is for players and developers to
 use OGT in the One Game world and contribute
 to the growth of the One Game world 
 C Incentive Program
 There is an incentive pool reserved for the
 miners the developers and the players Every
 year 10% of the tokens in the incentive pool will
 be distributed as rewards At the same time the
 proceeds received from land creation and
 genetic mutation will be returned back to the
 incentive pool 
 Tokenized In Game
 Economy and
 Ecosystem
 Chapter 7
 Although the OGT price fluctuates based on
 market supply and demand developers may
 issue virtual goods with a fixed conversion rate
 to fiat currencies as described below 
 A protocol will allow developers to refer to one
 or multiple oracles that connect to the APIs of
 cryptocurrency exchanges to access the
 contemporaneous OGT price and then variably
 price their virtual goods based on an end value
 conversion to a fixed fiat currency value 
 Developers can price goods variably in OGT
 conversion rates while maintaining a stabilized
 value bounded to fiat currencies For example if
 the current price of one OGT is $0 01 and a
 game developer issued his own virtual X set at a
 price of $0 10 then in One Game players need
 to pay 10 OGT to purchase one X When the
 token OGT price increases to $0 02 the pricing
 of the virtual goods automatically adjusts and
 thereby allows players to purchase one X with 5
 OGT through use of the oracle 
 Currency fluctuation is a risk for developers
 because they earn OGT from the games and
 the token price may fluctuate due to market
 changes Developers may if they wish hedge
 this fluctuation risk through use of derivatives 
 but this is a private and personal decision on the
 part of the developers As explained in Section
 7 B (OGT Usage) OGT are intended to be the
 native currency for the One Game world and is
 not legal tender or is not intended to be a
 financial instrument If players or developers
 wish to sell their OGT or buy additional OGT
 they cannot obtain from mining or as rewards 
 they may do so but such buying and selling are
 to be carried out as separate arrangements
 among themselves or other holders of OGT 
 21
 If the size of the pool in the ith year is S(i) and
 the proceeds received by the pool is R(i) then
 the pool size of the i + 1 th year will be 
 Assuming that R and R are the lower bound
 and upper bound of the proceeds received in
 each year such that 
 
 The pool size of the i + 1 th year have the
 following lower and upper bounds 
 When i approaches infinity 
 
 and
 
 It means the pool size will eventually reach a
 dynamic equilibrium 
 As described in section 4 B the simulated
 mining process guarantees that there are
 always necessary but not excessive computing
 and storage resource provided in the system
 such that miners receive enough incentives to
 participate The remaining rewards will be then
 distributed to developers and players with an
 amount proportional to their Popularity Rank
 and Competitiveness Rank 
 D OGT Pricing Mechanism
 The conversion rates among OGT fiat or other
 cryptocurrency are decided purely by supply
 and demand OGT s price will increase when
 more developers and players join the platform
 due to scarcity of OGT In total there will only
 ever be 10 billion OGT tokens issued 
 L H
 OGT Allocation
 Chapter 8
 22
 In total there will be 10 billion OGT issued The

 The following paragraphs only summarize the
 risks associated with One Game and OGT If you
 wish to purchase OGT please refer to the
 Terms of Sale for OGT before purchasing any
 OGT to understand the risks of purchasing and
 owning OGT 
 1 Risk of lack of supervision Digital asset
 trading including OGT is highly uncertain due
 to the lack of strong supervision in the field of
 digital asset trading Meanwhile any electronic
 token has the risk of volatility in price and
 manipulation of its price 
 2 Risk of supervision Regulation of blockchain
 technology has not been consistently enacted
 and applied globally particularly in respect of
 digital tokens and cryptocurrencies It is difficult
 to predict how or whether regulatory agencies
 may apply existing or future regulation with
 respect to OGT and this may affect its price and
 marketability should you want to sell your OGT 
 3 Team risk At present there are many teams
 and projects in the blockchain technology field 
 and the competition is very fierce There is a
 strong market competition and project
 operation pressure Whether or not One Game
 project can break through many excellent
 projects and become widely recognized is not
 only linked to its own team capacity and vision
 planning but also linked to external factors
 such as competitors and even oligarchs in the
 market There is a possibility of vicious
 competition 
 4 Risk within team One Game brings together a
 team of both vigor and strength attracting
 senior practitioners in the field of blockchain 
 experts in the field of artificial intelligence and
 experienced technical development personnel 
 etc The team of One Game boasts stability and
 cohesion of the team which are crucial to the
 overall development of the project In the future
 development nonetheless note that it is not
 possible to exclude the possibility that the team
 will be negatively affected by the departure of
 the core personnel and conflicts within the
 team 
 5 Project overall planning and development
 risk The One Game initiative team will spare no
 effort to achieve the development goals
 outlined in this white paper and extend the
 growth space of the project Because the white
 paper may be adjusted as the details of the
 project become updated there could be
 information asymmetry if not every OGT holder
 and future players and developers do not
 become aware of the updates at the same time 
 which might negatively affect the subsequent
 development of the project 
 Risk Disclosure
 Chapter 13
 31
 6 Project technology risk First of all the project
 is based on cryptographic algorithm and the
 rapid development of cryptography is bound to
 bring with it potential risks Secondly while
 blockchains distributed ledger systems 
 decentralization consensus based nodes which
 are supposed to be tamper resistant and other
 technologies support the core business
 development One Game team cannot fully
 guarantee the success all of these technologies 
 Thirdly during the process of project updating
 and adjustment there may be loopholes which
 can be remedied by releasing patches but the
 extent of the impact caused by the vulnerability
 cannot be fully ascertained ahead of time 
 7 Risk of Hacking and Security
 Weaknesses Hackers or other malicious groups
 or organizations may attempt to interfere with
 the Platforms and OGT in a variety of ways 
 including but not limited to malware attacks 
 denial of service attacks consensus based
 attacks Sybil attacks smurfing and spoofing 
 One Game may face some unexpected risks 
 Participants should fully understand the team’s
 background know the overall framework and
 ideas of the project make reasonable
 adjustments to their vision and participate in the
 collection of tokens rationally before
 participating
