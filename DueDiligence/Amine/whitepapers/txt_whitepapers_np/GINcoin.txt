b GINcoin the turnkey masternode coin \x0cGINcoin Overview GINcoin with its GUI based Masternode deployment platform enables crypto investors to set up their own Masternodes regardless of their technical skills and experience in working with servers and programming languages \x0cForeword About GINcoin cryptocurrencies and Masternodes \x0cForeword What is a cryptocurrency What are Masternodes A cryptocurrency or crypto currency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange Cryptocurrencies use cryptography hence the name to secure transactions control the creation of additional units and verify the transfer of assets From a technical point of view a masternode is a computer server with a publicly available IP address The control mechanisms of cryptocurrencies are decentralized and managed through a blockchain a form of public transaction database that works as a distributed ledger Masternodes are active members in a coin\xe2\x80\x99s transaction network that meet certain criteria the most important of which is a set amount of collateral capital locked in a dedicated wallet The decentralisation aspect is what sets them apart the most from most other types of currencies especially fiat currencies A Masternode is simply a cryptocurrency full node or computer wallet that keeps the full copy of the blockchain in real time \x0cForeword What are Masternodes Wallets Similarities to savings accounts Nodes vs Masternodes There are types of wallets that can be used Throughout their short history masternodes have been compared to savings accounts they play an important role in the coin network and those who create and maintain them get rewarded for their efforts much like a bank offers savings with varying interest rates to encourage people to hold their money with it Masternodes are considerably different in their functionality than normal nodes \xe2\x97\x8e Hot wallets Hot wallets are stored on the server itself and are connected to the internet This makes them more susceptible to being broken into than cold wallets \xe2\x97\x8e Cold wallets If a wallet is stored on a computer that\xe2\x80\x99s not always connected to the internet or on a storage device like the Ledger Nano Apart from keeping a copy of the full blockchain in real time and relaying blocks/transactions just like a full node does on the Bitcoin network Masternodes fulfill other functions as well \xe2\x97\x8e \xe2\x97\x8e \xe2\x97\x8e \xe2\x97\x8e Increase the privacy of transactions Enable users to instantly send funds to one another Participate in governance/ voting Some serve the role of a treasury in some coin networks \x0cForeword Why are Masternodes good for Crypto Increased decentralisation Decreased energy costs Better security Through the functions mentioned above Masternodes ensure cryptocurrencies remain as decentralised as possible counterbalancing the inherent centralisation mining pools introduce At the same time Masternodes help increase the scalability of the network and can be used as a means of voting on a coin\xe2\x80\x99s developmental decisions much like what happens in your usual corporation when shareholders are asked to weigh in on policy or direction changes On top of all of this Masternodes are useful because they compensate for proof of work\xe2\x80\x99s POW limitations and ensure a network\xe2\x80\x99s security with much lower energy costs In a sense a POW based coin that supports Masternodes is a mixed breed between a pure POW one and a POS proof of stake coin Because Masternodes require capital to be deployed their owners are directly interested in keeping the network as secure as possible As such Masternodes are designed to keep miners in line for instance Dash Masternodes keep a close eye on the POW network the miners and reject/ orphan blocks if they don\xe2\x80\x99t match the current version of Dash or if they detect reward tampering \x0cState of affairs Market caps & growing interest \x0cState

problem(s) Masternodes and people are complex machines \x0cThe problem(s) GINcoin aims to solve two big issues that are currently holding Masternode coins back and impeding their rightful ascent Deploying and running a Masternode requires significant technology know how a Deep understanding of the blockchain b Launching & maintaining a server c Setting up of masternode software Setting up a Masternode requires considerable financial efforts and as detailed below trust The two problems force investors to rely on Shared Masternode groups and schemes usually lead by a developer willing to do the work in exchange for a share of the Masternode or its generated rewards This forces a trustless system to work in a trust dependent way and not few are the cases where ill intentioned individuals scam investors and keep the collateral for themselves \x0cGINcoin Trustless Codeless Masternode Deployment \x0cGINcoin Trustless Codeless Masternode Deployment Overview Masternodes PrivateSend GINcoin was built as a direct consequence of the problems stated before With its GUI based Masternode setup the only hurdle investors may be faced with when looking to own a Masternode remains the financial one securing enough collateral to actually deploy the node However not even that will remain a valid problem for much longer our roadmap includes shared Masternode support for all partner coins Similar to Dash GINcoin uses a two tiered network miners the first tier handle creating new blocks whereas the PrivateSend InstantSend and Governance functions are handled by the second tier network made up of Masternodes At its core PrivateSend is a service that mixes users coins with others\xe2\x80\x99 coins before sending them to a wallet to ensure their anonymity It is based on CoinJoin to which it adds multiple modifications such as relying on masternodes rather than on a single website chaining by mixing with multiple masternodes and restricting the mixing to only accept certain denominations and passive mode The maximum allowed for a PrivateSend transaction is GIN just like with Dash GINcoin is a peer to peer cryptocurrency that on top of Bitcoin s features supports instant transactions InstantSend private transactions PrivateSend and Masternodes It is based on Dash Masternodes require GIN as collateral to prevent sybil attacks wherein a peer to peer network\xe2\x80\x99s reputation system is compromised by entities with forged identities The collateral can be spent at any time but that subsequently eliminates the masternode from the network \x0cGINcoin Trustless Codeless Masternode Deployment InstantSend Reliant on the Masternode network InstantSend is allows for near instant transactions through it inputs can be locked to specific transactions and verified by consensus of the masternode network Conflicting transactions and blocks are rejected If a consensus cannot be reached validation of the transaction occurs through standard block confirmation InstantSend solves the double spending problem without the longer confirmation times of other cryptocurrencies e g Bitcoin Blockchain technical information Mining algo Neoscrypt

Deployment Platform The coin itself is a close sibling of Dash\xe2\x80\x99s Where GINcoin truly shines is its codeless masternode deployment platform The platform itself is web based and relies on open source technologies such as Docker Kubernetes Node js Angular js and Linux Setting up a Masternode is simple and straightforward as shown in the screenshots below which cover the first two steps \x0c\x0cInternal economy Self sustaining Beneficial to other coins The coin itself will derive value from the platform that it maintains Aside from free trades on exchanges GIN will be used by our community to cover As such GIN not only relies on other Masternode compatible coins but also helps them grow faster by enabling investors from all walks of life to create maintain and invest in

deploying their own masternode s regardless of their technical abilities Our ultimate goal is to democratise the way masternodes are created and as an effect prove crypto is here to stay by making it more secure and more user friendly than paper money \x0cLet\xe2\x80\x99s do this You can find us on \xe2\x97\x8e contact@gincoin io \xe2\x97\x8e https //discord gg/RTgVNxR \xe2\x97\x8e https //twitter
