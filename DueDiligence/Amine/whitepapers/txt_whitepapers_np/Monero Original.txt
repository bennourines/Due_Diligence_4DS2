 Monero Research Lab Abstract
 This research bulletin describes a plausible attack on a ring signature based
 anonymity system We use as motivation the cryptocurrency protocol CryptoNote
 2 0 ostensibly published by Nicolas van Saberhagen in 2012 It has been
 previously demonstrated that the untraceability obscuring a one time key pair can
 be dependent upon the untraceability of all of the keys used in composing that
 ring signature This allows for the possibility of chain reactions in traceability
 between ring signatures causing a critical loss in untraceability across the whole
 network if parameters are poorly chosen and if an attacker owns a sucient
 percentage of the network The signatures are still one time however and any
 such attack will still not necessarily violate the anonymity of users However such
 an attack could plausibly weaken the resistance CryptoNote demonstrates against
 blockchain analysis This research bulletin has not undergone peer review and
 re
 ects only the results of internal investigation 
 1 Introduction
 The CryptoNote protocol has a problem my anonymity depends on your anonymity 
 If I use 5 6 or 18 of your outputs when I compose my ring signature then you can
 see the true signer If you spend all 5 6 or 18 outputs with no foreign outputs
 used as mixins in your ring signatures you reveal yourself as the spender and
 now any observer can also see the true signer of my transaction This may not
 be malicious if you spent your outputs non anonymously for legitimate business or
 legal reasons Hence any party with a large proportion of the UTXO set may gain
 knowledge of the traceability of others transactions and reveal that information
 to the network at will One may fancifully interpret this problem as an abstract 
 cryptocurrency implementation of Gresham s Law bad money drives out good If
 the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set is filled with a lot of transactions that
 aren t really anonymous there are fewer ways to make untraceable ring signatures 
 At this point it must be noted that even in this scenario the one time key pairs
 (so called \stealth addresses ) used in CryptoNote protocols are not violated in
 this scenario and so the anonymity of users is still not directly violated Rather 
 this attack violates the untraceability between one time ring signatures but this
 development is still somewhat worrying Hence even non malicious entities can
 
 c Monero Research Lab Page 2 of 8
 execute this attack on accident malicious entities can spam the network to own
 lots of the UTXO set and malicious entities can break untraceability for others 
 An attacker s intent may be perhaps in the interest of a pump n dump scheme
 by undermining the credibility of a currency perhaps in the interest of spying on
 other users or perhaps in a disinterest in paying the extra cost of adding more
 foreign unspent transaction outputs to their ring signatures In all cases despite
 the a priori hope that any particular user should always be interested in using a
 large number of mixins for a ring signatures as a matter of principle both in the
 interest of personal security and the common good we should have no expectation
 of this in practice A version of the tragedy of the commons may take place and
 cause traceability throughout the network for everyone due to a subset of users 
 However we should also keep in mind the forest not the trees since any user
 can always compose a trivial ring signature with no additional outputs immedi 
 ately exposing outputs down the line there is a second order problem here A new
 transaction has been exposed creating exposure risk for any ring signatures that
 used the newly exposed transaction as an obfuscating mixin Is it possible that a
 chain reaction could occur even if a malicious entity stops actively attacking early
 in the history of the coin This research bulletin was written to analyze this prob 
 lem determine the plausibility of a conservative route of such an attack and assess
 network parameters to ensure graceful degradation of untraceability 
 2 Setup for a Passive Attack
 Everyone who has had a college probability class has come across the following 
 even if you don t know how to solve it 
 An urn contains N marbles of two possible colors We have NB black marbles
 and NW white marbles where NB + NW = N is fixed We draw M marbles
 from the urn What is the probability that all of the marbles we drew from
 the urn are black What is the probability that all of the marbles are white 
 If 0  m  M what is the probability that we have m black marbles and
 M ô€€€ m white marbles 
 When phrased this way we immediately jump to the hypergeometric distribution 
 The probability mass function
 ô€€€NB
 B
 ô€€€Nô€€€NB
 Mô€€€B

 ô€€€N

 can be used to compute the probability that all the marbles in my hand are black
 (set B = M) and we can use convenient formulae available in any number of free
 online textbooks or wikipedia or whatever in order to compute the probability of
 any particular occurrence It s one of the nicer distributions 
 We play the following game if all the marbles I draw are black I ll toss a new
 black marble into the urn while I replace my handful Otherwise I ll toss a new
 white marble into the urn while I replace my handful As it is with marbles so it
 is with CryptoNote coins It may help to envision each marble as an atomic unit
 (the CryptoNote analogue to a Satoshi) tracked in the UTXO set of a CryptoNote
 
 c Monero Research Lab Page 3 of 8
 network The color denotes who is in control of the marble black if controlled by a
 malicious entity white if otherwise 
 Let s say Lisa wishes to send some money to Milhouse (which would add a marble
 to the bag) The UTXO set that Lisa draws from in order to make her ring signatures
 will contain N transaction outputs of which NB are controlled by Burns (the black
 marbles assume the rest are white) Then the above formula is exactly what we
 need Lisa composed her ring signature withM  N mixins[1] (she drew a handful of
 marbles to decide the color of marble to add to the urn) and if all are controlled by
 Burns Well then if Burns spends his outputs with no mixins[2] Lisa s transaction
 will also be exposed Furthermore forget Lisa any ring signature that used only
 Burns signatures can actually now be considered part of Burns controlled set in
 terms of untraceability even if Burns does not control the private keys Notice that
 in this scenario we are having a chain reaction occur Burns reveals only his own
 transaction outputs but he in turn reveals Lisa s output The four assumptions
 we have made are
 (i) Burns controls an initial proportion of an otherwise unknown UTXO set 
 (ii) all new transactions generate their ring signatures drawn from the current
 UTXO set in a uniform unordered way without replacement 
 (iii) all new transactions use exactly the mandatory minimum mixin level (handful
 size M) and
 (iv) Burns gains control of new transactions if and only if their ring signatures are
 solely composed with Burns controlled transactions (i e Burns stops putting
 new transactions in the system at time t = 0) 
 We can change our assumptions to strengthen or weaken the attack in our scenario 
 For example the attack is weaker if some transactions use more than the mandatory
 minimum The attack is stronger if Burns can also gain control of transactions
 by generating them himself i e he is not some passive actor in the background 
 However this seems to be a reasonable middle ground scenario if we interpret it in
 the following way Burns initially controls a portion of the UTXO set before a 
 ood
 of ostensibly honest transactions are composed quite suddenly so what happens 
 Protecting the network against a large scale degradation in untraceability under
 this scenario is simply a matter of smart engineering If we can protect the network
 against large scale degradation under worse scenarios all the better but we shall
 start here This could be considered a \Christmas Day attack both because our
 simulations are set up to mimic a sudden in
 ux of economic activity before a truly
 malicious attacker can respond (for ease of coding) and because the attack can be
 executed by an ostensibly innocent individual simply spending their money non 
 anonymously for perfectly legitimate reasons 
 Since the hypergeometric distribution is so nice what can we expect out of this
 game Well let us analyze the results for a single new transaction Assuming M is
 the minimum number of mixins across the whole network what is the probability
 that all M mixin signatures are controlled by Burns If this probability is large 
 then new transactions are very likely to be \controlled by Burns even if he has yet
 [1]We define a mixin as a foreign output included in the transaction 
 [2]Which it again must be emphasized may be an ostensibly innocent act not an
 attack 
 
 c Monero Research Lab Page 4 of 8
 to reveal the transaction outputs he controls That is to say the more CryptoNote
 transactions controlled by a single malicious party the weaker the untraceability
 trait of new transactions becomes Consider the following numerical example 
 Suppose we have N = 103 transaction outputs in our anonymity set (not counting
 the real output belonging to Lisa) and that Burns controls pN of these transactions
 for some 0  p  1 Denote by Pr(p) the probability that any one ring signature
 (using three mixins) is signed solely with outputs belonging to Burns This proba 
 bility describes roughly whether or not Lisa s new marble will be black or white 
 Table 1 contains sample values of Pr(p) for this example 
 p pN Pr(p)
 10ô€€€3 1 0
 10ô€€€2 10 7 22  10ô€€€7
 10ô€€€1 100 9 73  10ô€€€4
 0 5 500 0 125
 Table 1 If Burns controls pN transaction outputs from an anonymity set of N = 103 outputs 
 we display the probability Pr(p) that Lisa s output is traceable from Burns point of view 
 assuming that Lisa uses three mixins in the construction of her ring signature That is to say at
 the beginning of a large scale simulation if Burns controls half of all transactions we can expect
 him to \see about 12 5% of new transactions 
 How do we interpret this table If Burns controls only a single output in the
 anonymity set there is no way three distinct outputs in a ring signature can all be 
 long to him If Burns controls ten outputs there is only a probability of 0 00000722
 that Lisa s ring signature is really controlled by Burns This is so small that on av 
 erage it would take about 13 8 million signatures from this anonymity set to start
 seeing collisions If Burns controls 100 outputs there is a probability of 0 000973
 that a signature made by Lisa is controlled by Burns so we should start seeing col 
 lisions after around 100 000 signatures Finally if Burns controls half of all outputs 
 then 12 5% of all new transactions will have a ring signature composed entirely of
 his outputs so Burns will only be gaining 1 in every 8 new transactions and so
 Burns share of the UTXO set will shrink over time unless he takes action 
 In Table 2 we produce the same values as for Table 1 but with only two mixins 
 In this case if Burns controls half of the outputs the consequence is that every one
 in four new outputs will really be controlled by Burns If Burns controls 10% of
 the outputs only 1 out of every 1000 new transactions will be controlled by Burns 
 Clearly not as great as 3 mixins but still not terrible even if Burns controls half
 of all transactions there is only a 25% chance that a new ring signature will belong
 to Burns Hence his share of the UTXO set will shrink over time unless he takes
 action

 Table 2 If Burns controls pN transaction outputs from an anonymity set of N = 103 outputs 
 we display the probability Pr(p) that the new output is revealed during an attack assuming that
 Lisa uses two mixins in the construction of her ring signature That is to say at the beginning of a
 large scale simulation if Burns controls half of all transactions we can expect him to \grab 
 about 25% of new transactions

 3 Monte Carlo Methods and Results
 Hold tight for some notation We choose parameters NB0 NW0 and M where NB0
 denotes the initial number of black marbles owned by Burns NW0 denotes the
 initial number of white marbles and M is the minimum mixin level We play the
 game iteratively We record the initial proportion of unspent transactions owned
 by burns as P0 = NB0=(NB0 + NW0 ) before beginning On the ith iteration we
 are adding the Ni = (NB0 + NW0 + i)th marble to the bag We draw a uniform
 random number u from (0 1) and compare it to the hypergeometric mass function
 as described before If u 
 ô€€€NBi
 M

 =
 ô€€€Ni
 M
 
 then the next marble will be black so we
 iterate NBi = NBiô€€€1 + 1 Regardless of the choice of u we iterate Ni+1 = Ni + 1
 and if we need to compute NW we can simply subtract After some iterations say I
 iterations usually enough iterations to double or quadruple the UTXO set we stop
 the game and consider the proportion of black marbles PF = NBI =NI However 
 since we are only concerned with how many of the new marbles were black (not how
 many in total are black) we will watch as our metric of success for Burns attack
 the value b PF = (NBI ô€€€ NB0 )=I number of black marbles Burns gained during the
 game divided by number of marbles added to the bag 
 The above process constitutes one simulation For each choice of parameters
 (NB0 NW0 M) we get a result b PF which was determined as a result of a sequence
 of random experiments and is such a random variable So we run 37 trials and
 take the sample mean and sample variance from these experiments We initially
 looked at the 95% confidence intervals but they are so narrow that we may as well
 ignore them in the end We simulate a UTXO set growing from 5000 transactions
 to 20000 Hence we plot (20000PF ô€€€ 5000PI )=15000 that is the proportion of os 
 tensibly honest transactions that Burns grabs Figure 1 illustrates our simulation
 results for NB +NW = 5000 and M = 1 2 3 and 4 mandatory minimum mixins in
 the event that the UTXO set quadruples with honest transactions (that is 15 000
 new transactions need new ring signatures) The horizontal axis displays the ini 
 tial proportion of the UTXO set controlled by Burns varying from 0 0 to 1 0 the
 vertical axis displays the final proportion of the new transactions in the UTXO set
 controlled by Burns varying from 0 0 to 1 0 Note that any number above zero on
 the y axis represents a loss of security 
 It s clear that b PF is monotonically increasing as a function of P0 = NB=(NB +
 NW) but that the situation improves for greater numbers of ring signatures Notice
 that there are some dynamical systems problems built into our data If you graph
 PF vs PI (rather than our b PF vs PI ) then you can interpret this as a discrete 
 time dynamical system s evolution function to see that Burns share must go to
 zero over time for any mixin  2 We can expect in the 1 mixin scenario for the
 urn to stochastically jump up and down the y = x line without appreciably in
 expectation moving in any direction in a random walk However as long as we
 require M  2 mixins any chain reaction will burn itself out so to speak Burns 
 share of the UTXO set will shrink to zero over time unless he takes action Our
 results suggest that any mandatory mixin  2 will allow the system to recover from
 a passive attack quite quickly The code we used to generate data can probably be
 improved but is located at http //goo gl/dGj5TZ and we used Google Documents
 to generate figures

 Figure 1 This figure displays with apologies to the color blind the \success of an attack 
 executed by Burns We see that for increasing numbers of mixins success uniformly decreases
 accross the board To refresh the reader who probably jumped directly to this graph here s the
 scenario Evil guy Burns starts with an initial proportion (x axis) of the UTXO set which has
 5000 transaction outputs inside of it Then a 
 ood of 15 000 new honest transactions hits the
 network from Lisa to Milhouse and from Homer to Marge and so on causing the UTXO set to
 quadruple in size After this event Burns could spend his initial proportion PI of the UTXO set
 with no mixins and consequently break the untraceability of a proportion of the 15 000 ostensibly
 honest transactions We display this proportion b PF as a function of PI For 10 mixins Burns
 requires 55% of the UTXO set to capture any of a quadrupling event at all and requires 87% of
 the UTXO set in order to capture even 1% of a quadrupling event with these parameters 
 4 Critical Mass Slow Chain Reactions Active Attackers Further
 Questions
 Recall that we set out to ask the question \can a critical chain reaction occur 
 and the related question \what network parameters can we choose to ensure that
 any plausible chain reaction burns itself out So what do we need for a critical
 mass Consider the urn problem again What happens to the composition of the
 urn as this game evolves as we toss new black or white marbles into the urn as we
 draw more Remember black marbles are the ones that will be revealed if we draw
 all black marbles that means the next marble we add to the urn must be black 
 A critical mass scenario is one in which if there are enough black marbles in the
 urn then Burns starts grabbing more and more and more black marbles If ever
 PF > PI we could expect some sort of critical mass but this does not occur Except
 in numerical edge cases PF  PI With 2 and more mixins our chain reactions
 become truncated very rapidly 
 Chain reactions act slower and slower as mixins increase Thus a single mixin
 is inappropriate for any currency problem because an anonymous malicious user
 may spam the network with transactions they control in the hopes that they even 
 tually control greater proportions of the UTXO set This would essentially make
 all transactions from then on fully traceable (at least from Burns point of view) 
 and Burns doesn t have to take a single action after his initial seed transactions
 are planted in the UTXO set This fixed initial cost for the attacker leading to
 
 c Monero Research Lab Page 7 of 8
 a never ending stream of information in the form of traceable transactions from
 other users is clearly a catastrophic economic failure This is so important we are
 putting it in italics any CryptoNote coin that allows for only 1 mixin is vulnerable
 to a slow chain reaction in which the owner of very few private keys can violate the
 untraceability of much larger number of other users Requiring a mixin of at least
 2 for all transactions save for transactions that are willfully spent with 0 mixins
 will keep these chain reactions probabilistically to a smaller length Indeed any
 number greater than 1 will do to force these chain reactions to burn themselves out 
 rather than to spread to the whole network and the higher the better Of course 
 a protocol enforced network wide mandatory minimimum mixin of M = 10 would 
 presumably cause a blockchain bloat which can hinder adoption which has it s
 own security benefits in terms of network size Hence there is likely some optimal
 size of mandatory minimum mixin We do no more than to suggest M = 2 as a
 protocol enforced mandatory minimum and to advise users to use as many mixin
 signatures as their little hearts desire 
 Note that our scenario might be different if we change parameters of our model or
 if we change our assumptions to include active attackers Let s discuss parameters
 real quick We can consider the addition of each new marble as nudging Burns 
 passive ownership probability one way or another Unless Burns grabs almost all
 incoming transactions his share of the UTXO set will be depleted over time How
 do our parameters change this process Recall that our parameters are 
 1 NB0 = Number of initial atomic units controlled by Burns in UTXO set 
 2 NW0 = the remaining atomic units in the UTXO set and
 3 M = mandatory minimum mixin enforced by network protocol 
 However we are really interested in PI = NB0=(NB0 + NW0 ) and N0 = NB0 +
 NW0 We have seen above how PI and M in general change the outcome of the
 experiment As N0 gets big Burns share will start to slow down Meaning even if
 Burns is grabbing all of the incoming transactions he s getting a reduced rate of
 returns in terms of overall proportion of the UTXO set that he owns We can think
 of the UTXO set size as a mass As it gets bigger it gets harder to change its state 
 Another \hidden parameter here is \how many new transactions are being
 added We swept this under the rug by simply saying \okay the UTXO set is
 going to quadruple from it s initial size reducing our parameter space a little bit 
 and in so doing we have reduced the importance of N0 as a parameter Indeed we
 know how N changes so we can easily compute slope of any statistic T(N) with
 respect to \change in population size and call that the sensitivity 
 S =
 T(Nf ) ô€€€ T(No)
 Nf ô€€€ No
 =
 T(4  No) ô€€€ T(No)
 3No
 which when close to zero suggests no relationship and when far from zero suggests
 a strong relationship (positive or negative) We could just as easily compute the
 slope of the log of the statistic with respect to the log of the population and call
 that the sensitivity 
 S =
 log(T(Nf )) ô€€€ log(T(N0))
 log(Nf ) ô€€€ log(No)
 =
 1
 4
 log
 
 T(4  No)
 T(No)
 
 
 c Monero Research Lab Page 8 of 8
 in this version of sensitivity we don t even see Nf as part of the formula simply
 the multiplicative factor Nf =No = 4 However we feel it is unnecessary to present
 a full scale parameter space analysis of this model 
 Now let s discuss changing assumptions One apparently small tweak we could add
 to this simulation is to change assumption (iv) In order to model a more aggressive
 attacker rather than a \Christmas Day accidental reveal sort of attack we could
 implement a probabilistic assumption like
 (v) Burns gains control of a new transaction as the result of a sequence of Bernoulli
 trials With a fixed probability q Burns generates a transaction that he knows is
 his and with probability 1ô€€€q a foreign transaction appears and generates a new
 ring signature that may be solely composed with Burns controlled transactions
 (i e Burns still participates in the economy)
 or we could implement a dynamical model where a malicious Burns tries to maintain
 a minimum proportion of the UTXO set by spamming transactions to the network
 whenever his proportion drops his secretly determined percentage 
 (v) Burns gains control of a new transaction as the result of a sequence of non 
 autonomous Bernoulli like experiments With a probability q(B N) dependent
 both on the number of UTXOs controlled by Burns B and the total UTXO
 set N Burns generates a transaction that he knows is his and with probability
 1 ô€€€ q(B N) a foreign transaction appears and generates a new ring signature
 that may be solely composed with Burns controlled transactions 
 Any function q(B N) that Burns can try to make close to 1 when B=N is smaller
 than Burns preference will allow Burns to grow his share of the UTXOset Of
 course the easiest simplest strategy for Burns would be to just spam the network
 as fast as possible with his own transactions But with fees this isn t free 
 We bring up parameters and assumptions because the work is not really done
 on this problem We have discovered what we as network engineers need to know
 in order to ensure graceful degradation pick big mixins However there are really
 interesting questions still lurking under the surface One of us solved this problem
 with graph theory one of us with probability Note that as time goes on a UTXO
 is more likely to be chosen for mixins but is also more likely to have been exposed
 from previous users revealing their transactions by spending them with 0 mixins 
 complicating the wisdom of choosing UTXOs for the ring signature from a uniform
 distribution Technically for any sort of \critical mass sort of problem there s
 going to be a steady state problem lurking under the surface and we definitely
 have some dynamical systems stuff 
 ying[3] about in this problem Maybe some
 ambitious undergraduate wants to pick up where we leave off and contribute to the
 cryptocurrency community by expanding on all of this
