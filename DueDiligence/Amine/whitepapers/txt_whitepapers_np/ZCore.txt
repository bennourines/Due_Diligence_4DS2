MASTERNODES ROADMAP TEAM LINKS COMMUNITY GLOSSARY \x0c1 INTRODUCTION Cryptocurrencies which are both a digital bearer asset and a payment system like the first cryptocurrency were developed with the main purpose to make possible exchanges between people in the digital environment in a totally decentralized way in other words without the intermediation of a trusted third party usually a financial institution In this context it is evident that in addition to make possible direct exchanges from person to person in the digital environment which is widely known as peer to peer (P2P)1 there is an expectation that these transactions will also be truly simplified from a perspective of practicality and usability in a way that anyone able to operate a smartphone and a messaging application will also be able to perform transactions with cryptocurrencies making this part of their daily routine Although the cryptocurrencies have in general successfully achieved the purpose of serving as a medium of exchange between people in the digital environment it is certain that still remains the expectation of making this process truly simplified allowing for all people with much or less technology skills full access to the emerging cryptocurrency market and its many benefits which it is important to note are not only limited to cryptocurrency transactions and the possibility of safeguarding your own money without the need for a third party confidence but also access to exclusive services and investments of this peculiar market It is precisely with this vision to simplify and facilitate at various levels and aspects how people interact with the world and the technology provided by the cryptocurrencies that ZCore (ZCR) was born in March 2018 that even with few months of full activity already has an engaged community of more than 10 000 participating members and a powerful system for blockchain services some already in full operation such as the ZCore Ads service a platform for sponsored ads in communication applications with more than 15 million downloads and 2 million monthly active users and payment in ZCore and the ZCore Masternodes System (ZMS) a platform specially created with the objective of making the experience of investing in masternodes of various cryptocurrencies as simple as possible since this task required before significant technical knowledge of programming and commands undoubtedly a huge obstacle for users with less technological knowledge that wish to have access to this type of investment [1] Term used in computer network architecture that indicates point to point connection Also commonly used to define value transactions that occur without an intermediary In this case a buy/sell of cryptocurrency between two people without using a brokerage house \x0c1 INTRODUCTION The good news is that the revolution started by ZCore which is just beginning will not be limited to the ZCore Ads and ZCore Masternodes System services The boldness extends to the challenge of delivering to the crypto community in October 2018 a powerful Decentralized and Distributed Governance structure that through masternodes voting will guide ZCore\ s future on important issues and will also evaluate and finance the best projects presented by any person or group in the community with the goal of leveraging currency growth and thus promoting ZCore\ s ongoing and dynamic development in a highly competitive market Not enough in January 2019 ZChat The ZCore Crypto Communicator will be launched the ZCore\ s official communication application which in addition to serving as an instant communicator of sending and receiving text messaging audio file and video will also has the functionality of a built in multiple cryptocurrency wallet through which it will be possible to make cryptocurrency transactions with the people in your contact list in a simple practical and effective way Considering that currently 2 billion people do not have access to banks and financial services according to UN data2 there is a sense of the immense growth potential for the cryptocurrency that will overcome the challenge of providing a multiplatform application with the characteristics of ZChat The ZCore Crypto Communicator reaching not only this population of 2 billion people today without access to financial services but also a public dissatisfied with the services provided by financial institutions and which is only waiting for a simple practical and effective way of enjoying the numerous benefits provided by the innovative cryptocurrencies technology [2] https //nacoesunidas org/onu 2 bilhoes de pessoas nao tem acesso a bancos e servi cos financeiros/ \x0c2 PRESENTATION What Is ZCore Crypto ZCore was born out of a desire to create a cryptocurrency that is truly accessible to everyone and revolutionize the cryptocurrency market We believe that a truly useful currency is one that is easily used by anyone Blockchain Technology ZCore (ZCR) is 100% open source with PoW (Proof of Work) mining based on the NeoScrypt algorithm and maximum supply of 18 million coins Structured in a robust network with Masternodes and reward of 10 ZCR per minted block every 90 seconds Fast and Safe ZCore is a cryptocurrency with a secure network to perform online transactions via InstantSend and PrivateSend with

advertising plugin in mobile applications with automated payment through ZCore cryptocurrency Already impacting more than 15 Million users monthly Website https //zcore network/adsz php \x0c3 2 ZCore Masternodes System The coinmarketcap currently represents (as of August 1 2018) a total market capitalization of approximately 300 billion dollars1 This number is quite expressive but considering that this market according to US Senator Mark Warner could reach 20 trillion dollars2 more than 60 times the present value it is possible to have an idea of the still immense potential of growth of the cryptocurrency market in general and in particular a new coin such as ZCore (ZCR) with powerful blockchain services among them the ZCore Masternodes System (ZMS) a complete platform for the investors in masternodes that allows for a daily value of only $0 25 with payment in ZCR already including the cost of maintaining the VPS the fast installation of masternodes of several coins in a friendly environment with monitoring dashboard and notifications in real time in other words without the need of technical knowledge of programming and commands Among the various classifications applicable to cryptocurrencies it is possible to separate them into two distinct groups those that like Bitcoin have network architecture formed by normal nodes and those that like the cryptocurrency Dash implemented a more robust network structure based on masternodes (super nodes) In a decentralized and distributed network such as the Bitcoin network and other cryptocurrencies a normal network node (server) has the basic functions of maintaining a complete copy of the blockchain and validating the new blocks and transactions A masternode in addition to performing these functions from a normal node also provides instant and private transfer options via InstantSend and PrivateSend functions respectively which can only be provided by a server that is always active on the network 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and also contributes to the system of governance of the cryptocurrency through its participation and vote on relevant issues which due to its importance is automatically and periodically remunerated by the network itself which makes the masternodes a very attractive investment option This type of network architecture based on masternodes has been increasingly adopted by the new cryptocurrencies so that according to data from the site MasterNodes online there are already more than 400 coins with this type of network structure totaling a market capitalization of approximately 3 billion dollars and thus with this same perspective of growth of more than 60 times the result would be a future volume of 180 billion dollars A good example of the exponential growth of cryptocurrencies with masternodes can be seen in the growth statistics of the number of masternodes in the last 5 months Since February 21 2018 when the monitoring carried out by the site MasterNodes online started there was an impressive increase of more than 300% in the total number of active masternodes from 63 703 to 204 9463 thus demonstrating the strength of this new segment within the market of cryptocurrencies of which ZCore is part And it is precisely this universe of more than 200 000 masternodes more than 400 cryptocurrencies and their respective owners which ZCore Masternodes System aims to meet in an innovative and efficient way through a simple and practical interface [1] https //www livecoinwatch com/a [2] https //www express co

architecture to serve as a payment system without the need for a trusted third party and whose technology was first presented in 2008 in the discussion forum The Cryptography Mailing by a programmer (or group of programmers) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto Blockchain it is the technology that came together with Bitcoin and that is the foundation of the technological structure of all cryptocurrencies without which they could not even work It consists of a decentralized database distributed by numerous servers (nodes) in the form of a chain of blocks In this database are recorded as is done in a ledger all the transactions carried out in the cryptocurrency network Blocks these are the links that form the blockchain of a certain cryptocurrency in which information about transactions carried out on the network (debit and credit registers) is inserted each block being the equivalent of one page of an immense ledger In the blockchain of Zcore is added on average a block every 90 seconds Collateral is a certain amount of crypto coins that an investor must deposit and keep intact as a reserve in a separate wallet of his property so that he is then able to set up a new cryptocurrency\ s masternode whose network is structured with this type of server In the case of Zcore the amount required by the system is exactly 5 000 Zcores Cryptocurrency it is both a digital bearer asset and a payment system in the digital environment of the internet and it allows people to carry out transactions directly between themselves (operations known as peer to peer or P2P) in other words without the need for intermediation of a third party usually a financial institution Dash it is the first cryptocrrency to develop and adopt the network architecture based on masternodes (super nodes) and not on normal nodes as it happens in the Bitcoin network which consequently makes the network in general more robust and resistant to possible attacks especially because of the expected commitment of the masternodes to be always active 24 hours a day and 7 days a week Exchange it is a service provider on the Internet through which a complex technological system which can be centralized or decentralized is offered to the registered users an environment of negotiations in which they can carry out exchanges between numerous cryptocurrencies or even exchanges between cryptocurrencies and fiat money and according to the intensity of the buying and selling forces the quotations are formed in currency pairs such as the ZCR/BTC pair (Zcore versus Bitcoin) Instant send is a function provided by the masternodes which if activated by the user of the network with the payment of a small additional fee allows the instant sending of crypto coins to the receiver even before inserting the transaction record in a block of the blockchain Masternode in addition to performing the functions of a normal node (server) in other words maintaining a complete copy of the blockchain and validating the new blocks and transactions it also provides the users of the network with the options of instantaneous and private transfers which can only be provided by a server that is always active on the network 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and also contributes to the cryptocurrency\ s governance system by participating and voting on relevant issues Mining it is a complex process in which with the use of hardware with significant computing power in the context of a set of rules and logical procedures perfectly defined by a certain algorithm (mathematical formula) the solution of a mathematical problem is sought proposed In the network of Bitcoin and Zcore when reaching the solution of this problem one for each block of the blockchain obtains the so called Proof of Work and consequently a reward in cryoto coins for the miner or group of miners that find it It is in the mining process that the new blocks of the blockchain are formed in which all transactions of the network are recorded P2P Term used in computer network architecture that indicates point to point connection Also commonly used to define value transactions that occur without an intermediary In this case a buy/sell of criptocurrency between two people without using a exchange Pool is a voluntary grouping of miners who unite for the purpose of cooperating with each other joining their individual computer processing forces thereby increasing the likelihood of success in the task of obtaining the so called Proof of Work and their the respective reward in crypto coins which when achieved is divided among the miners of the group in proportion to the hashing power with which each one contributed PoW an abbreviation for the expression Proof of Work which consists of a protocol that is easily verified by the nodes (servers) of the cryptocurrency network a data that satisfies a predetermined requirement and is difficult (costly time consuming ) of producing In practice several attempts and errors occur in the so called mining process before a valid proof of work is generated Private send is a function provided by the masternodes which if activated by the user with the payment of a small additional fee allows the sending of crypto coins to the receiver in an anonymous way and thus provide another mechanism for preserving privacy in the network Rewards the remuneration received by the masternodes in crypto coins by the network in which they act as a server automatically and periodically due to the importance of the work they perform 24 hours a day and 7 days a week which makes the masternodes a very attractive investment option Wallet this is basically a digital recipient in which a user can store his or her crypto coins just as he would store cash and coins in a normal wallet which recipient has one or more unique and public receiving addresses generated by the cryptocurrency\ s blockchain and managed through a mobile application a computer program or a cloud system on Internet \x0c
