The Team 20 Founders 20 Advisors 23 \x0cZMINE Team is a group of computer engineers who are interested in encryption and decryption technology gathered to develop an advanced system for cryptocurrency mining In 2017 we started a unique business model called WRYGC (We Rent Your Graphic Card) The main concept is that everyone can bring their own GPUs to our mining operation We will operate and split the cryptocurrency received from the mining operation between GPU owners and us without any additional management fee Due to the huge interest in cryptocurrency mining and our rapid growth business we currently have more than 10 000 GPUs operating in our facility Strek Co Ltd the largest graphics card distributor in Southeast Asia acknowledged our potential The company became our strategic partner with its CEO joining our board of directors With our unique business model and strong partnership we saw the opportunity to issue \xe2\x80\x9cZMINE Token (ZMN)\xe2\x80\x9d to fundraise the purchase of a great number of GPUs in order to meet our customers\xe2\x80\x99 demand as well as to meet the conditions of the GPU\xe2\x80\x99s factory which requires a large deposit amount and a long period of lead time for the delivery of a large batch of GPUs ZMINE Token will be available for purchasing and exchanging for GPUs installed in our system later Buyers will become the owners of GPUs and will possess all the rights of a GPU\xe2\x80\x99s owner The company also has the policy to buy tokens back at every price and burn them all at a pre defined time in every month ZMINE Token will bring you a great opportunity to join our journey to become the largest cryptocurrency mine in the industry together We are very confident that our ZMINE token will be the best investment you have ever made before We look forward to having you join us on this exciting journey 1 1 \x0cCryptocurrency has been predicted to be an intermediary to replace cash in the future by using Blockchain technology as the backbone to verify the accuracy of each individual\xe2\x80\x99s money transaction One important factor that makes cryptocurrency trusted by users is its independence from anyone or any organization in terms of validation and policy This characteristic of Cryptocurrency allows all transactions to always be accessible for validation and cannot be modified if a transaction is already deployed The creditworthiness of the depository institution will disappear as soon as the cryptocurrency is widely used because there is no need of the intermediary in money deposit process Cryptocurrency and Mining \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome the innovation of currency\xe2\x80\x9d Currently the cryptocurrency is regarded more likely as an alternative asset or a speculative investment than as an exchange intermediary Replacing a traditional currency with cryptocurrency may require some time some advancement in technology to accommodate the tremendous amount of future transactions and users\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge Although the cryptocurrency has not been fully accepted as a medium of exchange the cryptocurrency has already been accepted of having its market value Another method to invest in cryptocurrency is the cryptocurrency transaction confirmation which provides two way incomes transaction fees and the block rewards This activity is known unofficially as \xe2\x80\x9cmining\xe2\x80\x9d This idea derived from gold mining A computer generates a random number to brute force mathematic equations to win a prize The first successful solver will be awarded The idea is similar to gold mining those who are stronger and work better tend to have more chances to get the reward 2 1 \x0cWHO ARE WE \xe2\x80\x9cWork with Passion Start from Zero\xe2\x80\x9d We are a group of computer engineers who were brought together by the shared interest which originated from a thesis we wrote during our bachelor s degree about Cryptographic Encryption and Decryption The thesis later encouraged us to buy Bitcoin in the year 2013 at the price of 120 USD/BTC and start mining in the same year WHO ARE WE \xe2\x80\x9cWork with Passion Start from Zero\xe2\x80\x9d 2018 At present there are more than 10 000 GPUs being controlled by our system 2017 The in house mining system shows good results The renting GPUs system was established (WRYGC) and became very popular among our customers 2016 Returned to the mining \xef\xac\x81eld and invited friends to develop a mining system 2015 Ethereum network awareness 2014 Started mining with GPUs and purchased cloud mining services The contract was later terminated with the loss of 15 000 USD because the mining incentive was less than electricity cost 2013 First time buying Bitcoin at 120 USD per BTC 2012 Began researching about Bitcoin 2007 Graduated from Chulalongkorn University Computer Engineering thesis Encryption & Decryption Online File System Real Hardware Real Mining In 2016 we began to recruit our friends who were interested in advanced technology to establish a new business We started off by using our own savings money to purchase the equipment With our primary interest in technology our experiences and ability to develop computer programs we designed and developed programs to increase the efficiency 3 1 \x0cof hashing power such as Mining Software Pooling Server and Rig Management System After one year in the business we evaluated our mining system and discovered that with our customized system we can improve the hash rate and generate much more profit than general home mining In 2017 we launched the WRYGC (We Rent Your Graphic Card) business model where customers bring us their own GPUs and let us manage under the GPU rental agreement The total revenue will be shared among the company and GPU owners Since our service has already covered other operational costs there is no need for customers to worry with any other issues such as staff electrical systems network performances insurances backup devices peripherals and most importantly opportunity costs GPU owners can track their daily mining status from the daily updated statistics available on our mining portal on the website Over the past 12 months we have successfully proved to our customers who rented out their GPUs to us that our performance and their incomes are at a satisfactory level The success lies in the fact that we currently operate more than 10 000 GPUs with the total value of more than 100 million Thai Baht The reason that we chose GPUs as our primary rig rather than ASICs is because of its flexibility and ability to adjust the programs to fit the requirements We can extract the performance of GPUs to work much more effective than general home mining Although ASICs are featured in its simplicity no complicated adaptation or management required as they are ready made from the factory they still lack flexibility The mining efficiency turns out to be similar for every miner The competitive advantage for ASICs miners depends on only the size of devices which also means the capital However for GPUs the mining efficiency depends on the system and mining method developed by miners In addition GPUs have been used long before the business of cryptocurrency mining was born The equipment has existing market value for many other usages such as E Sport or AI industry which require the use of high performance GPU as well 4 1 \x0cWRYGC Model 1 C ustomer s deposit their Grap hic Ca r ds with us \xe2\x80\x9cUnique Model\xe2\x80\x9d 2 All Graph ic Cards are

yptocur r enci es a s incent i ves Due to the unique quality of the GPUs which has various features and flexibility to work we chose to use GPU as our main mining rig However only the GPU itself is unable to complete the system There are many other components required such as CPU Ram SSD Motherboard and more specialized equipment for example PCI Express 1 to 16 Lane Riser High Efficiency and Output Power Supply Unit Those who are interested to invest in a large scale they must also invest in the infrastructure including the cooling system building electricity network and server Therefore we have a vision in terms of these costs subsidization Therefore we developed WRYGC business so that people who want to invest in mining can bring their GPUs to our company and let us manage under our mining contract For other components the company is going to take the responsibility With the features of this business model it is easier and more convenient for customers because they own their GPUs all the time The company only acts as a joint investor with customers With this unique business strategy we currently have more than 200 customers Moreover from 9 months of operating statistics we had transferred more than 170 BTC resulted from our mining operation back to our customers 5 1 \x0cSWOT Analysis SWOT Analysis S STRENGTHS The current systems have been fully developed and can be operated

still very small comparing to the money and capital market in the global economy but has high potential to expand and generate more profit in the future Threats The reliability of the cryptocurrency has not been accepted by all countries in the world The uncertainty of government opinion towards cryptocurrency Shortage of GPU and the bargaining power of manufacturers Since we have encountered with several mining problems over the past 2 years from taking care of just our own machines to taking care of more than 10 000 units of customer s GPUs we have been continuously developing the programs and systems to tackle those problems With our experiences we realized the big obstacles include the fact that customers cannot find enough GPUs in the market and sometimes cannot decide which models and prices of the GPUs that are suitable for mining Also some cases customers bring a lot of GPUs resulting in the huge amount of our investment fund in order to purchase other necessary equipment For this reason we see a great opportunity to apply our experience with today s technology to address these obstacles by issuing an ERC20 based ICO named ZMN (ZMN Token) so we can gather the money from our sponsors to order GPUs with suitable model and price from various manufacturers Also the expansion of mining farm to support the increasing number of GPUs in the upcoming future includes the development of the system which will be able to handle more mining rigs We also have expert project advisors who specialized in their fields Moreover any customers who are interested in WRYGC system are able to buy GPUs which were installed in our facility by using ZMN token 8 1 \x0cCurrent Facilities and Capabilities Z MI NE Total area 16 000 sq m FAC I L I T I ES \xe2\x80\x9cEverything has been ready\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Currently We have GPU units installed more than 10 000GPUs High roof up to 26 meters For area size reference only Able to accommodate up to 100 000 GPUs Electric transformer installation is able to support up to 5 000 KVA and can be extended to 13 000 KVA Medium voltage 12kv) 24/7 experience technicians monitoring with the potential of space electrical system structure and an expert team These advantages make our business expands rapidly 24/7 security at front gate 24/7 security system and facility\xe2\x80\x99s insurance Real Hardware Real Mining Our warehouse is located in Bangkok perimeter area with a high ceiling higher than 5 storey building (about 26 meters) The total building area is approximately 16 000 square meters which are larger than the size of two standard football fields connected Recently the electric transformer has been installed to be able to handle up to 5 000 kVA and up to 13 000 kVA (medium voltage 12KV) In terms of security from the door to the mining area there are 24 hour security guards to prevent unauthorized guests from entering the facility Inside the building there is a CCTV system operated to monitor indoor and outdoor areas In terms of facility safety we also have insurance that insured 170 million Thai Baht and will be increased according to the amount of installed GPU 9 1 \x0cCurrently we have installed more than 10 000 GPUs Moreover in terms of staff competency we have experienced technicians to monitor the machines 24 hours all year round With the potential of the space electrical system structure and an expert team we have potential to grow to accommodate up to 100 000 GPUs or approximately 1 000 million Thai Baht in value to meet the demand We also have the connection with people who are interested in expanding to promising locations such as Chiang Mai Khao Yai neighbouring countries and other suitable countries as well 1 0 1 \x0cOur Technology \xe2\x80\x9cFocus on R&D Ef\xef\xac\x81ciency is the Key not size\xe2\x80\x9d In the mining system many people believe that electricity is the main factor that determines whether the mining process will generate more or less profit As an experienced miner we found that the cost of electricity is just one variable factor that affects the profit If we aim for a sustainable profit a good R&D and maintenance are the most important keys Therefore it can be seen from the statistic of cards that customers brought us Comparing the ROI even all coins were divided in half the card owner\xe2\x80\x99s share is still not different from amount received from home mining Although sometimes the outcome could be a little less but in the practical customers who bring us their own GPUs and participate in our system is going to earn a better return This is because we have a team to take care of the mining process at all time and spare devices ready to change if any damage occurred Moreover we also offer a variety coins mining We study and track the updates for coins that will start to market in the upcoming future in order to select the coins that will provide the best return from mining To achieve the plan we develop the technology to use internally as the followings 1 Rapid Mining Rig Deployment System With the rapidly increased number of machines and the variety of OS used in mining procedures such as Windows 7 Windows 10 Linux Ubuntu ETHOS it becomes time consuming and requires the specialists to install the operations Therefore we designed a specialized system which allows any staff to assemble the machine connect it to the network and then just press a few buttons and the operating system will be set up automatically ready to run within few minutes With this system we can deploy many miners in a short period of time 1 1 1 \x0c2 Integrated Solo Mining System Our main advantage as a large mining farm is the ability to do solo mining technique where the clients in the internal network communicate with the servers only The clients do not need to connect to the external internet at all Ability to work with internal traffic only has the advantage that there is no need to share the speed with the external mining pool which directly impacts the latency values Also there is no need to pay the service fees to the mining pool operators 3 Forward Pro\xef\xac\x81t Prediction System Having a massive hash rate under our control could result in the network difficulties of the coin which we are mining in a specific period In order to avoid this problem we have to calculate the quantity model and performance of each GPU to appropriately allocate GPUs in mining process for the most benefit Our calculation will look into the future because a coin that we choose to mine now will be mature and able to use later (some coins require more than 24 hours) Therefore we must always calculate and analyze the value and the risk of coin switching 1 2 1 \x0c4 Individual GPU Mining Pro\xef\xac\x81le Optimization GPUs which are currently available in the market even with the same brand and model when it comes to mining the performance of each unit may be different In our system before fully operating in the real situation all GPUs have been performance tested to find out their best capabilities and determine the optimum preset for each coin type 5 24/7 GUI MultiMap Monitoring and Noti\xef\xac\x81cation System In a large scale mining farm 12 000 GPUs in this scenario to report the performance of each and individual GPU is the hassle issue Having only text identification could delay the investigation identification and problem troubleshooting Therefore we develop the graphical surveillance program which displays the results in a graphic format so that frontline employees can understand the problem and identify the location of the problemed GPU quickly It also has an alert system that detects problems and reports to the system administrator With the interoperability between systems and people all the work can be done faster and more efficiently 1 3 1 \x0c6 Automated Keep Alive Mining Detection In addition to the software used to monitor and maintain each GPU we also develop the specific hardware that can monitor the status of the miner at all times If the Keep Alive system detects unresponsive machines the system will automatically restart itself or turned off/on for continuous operation 7 Decentralized Mining Management System In developing the automatic coin switching system to maximum profit we designed and developed a program to control the assigned mining rigs to switch to mine other coins This independent mining system was designed to work even without the operation of the server for the flexibility and prompt operation 1 4 1 \x0cVision \xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand the same view as ours \xe2\x80\x9d To establish the mutual understanding between clients and us From a long research of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency technologies together with our experience of over 5 years we find that miners play an important part of Blockchain Whether it be creating a transactional system or producing any application all have miners as a system component which is why we focus on this factor This can lead to further integration in the future such as the creation of digital coins to be used as a symbol of a country\xe2\x80\x99s fiat currency or even the development of the Blockchain as a distributed database system to replace the currently used database which is centralized or traditional The rapid growth of popularity in cryptocurrency is the original concept of creating a cryptocurrency trading platform to make it more convenient for cryptocurrency users The company can trade its own coins derived from its mining activities on this website The website also acts as a marketplace for other users and creates fair competition in the cryptocurrency industry We are miners who believe in the potential of Blockchain and distributed data storage system We are aware that the size of the mining farm is not the most important factor in the mining performance For this reason research and development is our priority Our vision and concept which is the result of our experience is to focus on miner development by educating researching upgrading and controlling the quality to maximize the performance and decrease the energy consumption rate of the miner with the process called GPU Optimization The relationship between the system development and marketing strategy is also important Our main focus is on the system research and development as we strongly believe that an effective system itself is the foundation of the future growth and also has more benefits in the long term development than focusing in a marketing strategy 1 5 1 \x0cWorking Plan \xe2\x80\x9cEf\xef\xac\x81ciency is the key\xe2\x80\x9d R es ea r c h a n d Devel op m en t (10%) B u y Min in g E q u ip m en
