launching a hybrid cryptocurrency exchange that blends the best of centralized and decentralized technology with high liquidity excellent customer support and private transactions for its users WIth a working alpha in production the Beldex team is on track for launch of the exchange in Q4 of 2019 Serving the APAC region at first then expanding throughout the world Beldex fulfills a real market need for a user friendly hybrid exchange where people can trade in cryptocurrency and have a high level of utility for the token PROBLEM The cryptocurrency market is dominated by difficult to use exchanges coins that aren\xe2\x80\x99t truly private and a lack of attention to the customer experience One of the major Exchange Binance is dominating the market increasing acting as a centralized entity that is trying to monopolize the market The recent advent of IEOs is a clear signal that exchanges are beginning to act similarly to large financial institutions in concentrating power under one roof For people who are looking for more privacy and a great service there\xe2\x80\x99s a niche opening up Large investors will always get great care from whatever institution they use But for medium and small investors those who want privacy of their transactions and people without access to banking and people who want to have a one stop shop there is a widening gap The opportunity to provide people with a full solution of wallet exchange and a highly useful medium of exchange is one that can transform communities MARKET Transactions in cryptocurrency continues to increase and there\xe2\x80\x99s a real market need to reach a 1 variety of investors Furthermore the number of coins on the market is increasing everyday yet many exchanges offer a small range of cryptocurrencies to trade Especially when it comes to niche markets it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming difficult for people to find one exchange where they can get high liquidity and a large number of cryptocurrencies at reasonable fees The cryptocurrency market capitalization is more than $315 billion as of the writing of this whitepaper and is predicted to 2 reach as much as $40 Trillion 1 2 \xe2\x80\x8bhttps //www hiveex com/hiveex

an advanced hybrid Digital asset exchange for the last year and is releasing the full exchange in autumn 2019 The privacy coin has the highest level of privacy available as described in the technical section of this whitepaper Our company is devoted to providing a coin that is truly private so that people can transact safely and with no fear of who has their data and transaction information The exchange and wallet are designed as the first stage into the adoption of the privacy coin technology for those people who want to participate in the new economy throughout the Asia Pacific region The exchange provides a full range of cryptocurrencies and utilizes both Beldex and other cryptocurrencies for the exchange fees The wallet is a multicurrency wallet that works in partnership with both the exchange and online retailers who can accept the Beldex coin for their services MISSION BELDEX\xe2\x80\x99 mission is to make it easy for a wide demographic of people to benefit from the innovations that digital cash enables today Our mission is to put cryptocurrency into the hands of people who can benefit the most from using and make it as easy to use as any other type of exchange VISION Beldex has the vision of becoming a one stop shop for a variety of financial services making it quick and easy for people and businesses to conduct transactions with cryptocurrency including trading and investing with full privacy so that the users own their own data and are not subject to the intrusion of governments or big businesses Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 7 \x0cCOIN TECHNOLOGY The Beldex coin uses a variety of privacy technologies to ensure the maximum privacy for users of the coin BELDEX COIN Beldex \xe2\x80\x8bis a mined proof of work token with masternodes as a mining opportunity to the community Originally a fork of Monero Beldex has integrated PrivateSend privacy protocol from DASH and few more key privacy features like ViewKey from ZEC to improve the original

Elliptic curve Curve25519 CRYPTONOTE ELEMENTS Although a full node incentive scheme could be implemented on top of any cryptocurrency Beldex uses the Monero source code because of the high level of privacy it affords to transactions Monero is an evolution on the CryptoNote protocol which uses ring signatures stealth addresses and RingCT giving users the ability to sign transactions and obfuscate amounts while maintaining plausible deniability For the Beldex ecosystem to maintain privacy it is important to provide a medium of exchange that underpins the internal economy and also minimise the risk of temporal analysis when interactions occur across Beldex\xe2\x80\x99s independent layers For example when engaging in layer one transactional services users should never lose the privacy guarantees they receive from the second layer and vice versa RING SIGNATURES Ring signatures work by constructing a ring of possible signers to a transaction where only one of the signers is the actual sender Beldex makes use of ring signatures to obfuscate the true history of transaction outputs Ring signatures will be mandatory for all Beldex transactions (excluding block reward transactions) and uniquely a fixed ring size of ten is enforced on the Beldex blockchain This means that each input will spend from one of ten possible outputs including the true output STEALTH ADDRESS Beldex makes use of stealth addresses to ensure that the true public key of the receiver is never linked to their transaction Every time a Beldex transaction is sent a one time stealth address is created and the funds are sent to this address Using a Diffie Hellman key exchange the receiver of the transaction is able to calculate a private spend key for this stealth address thereby taking ownership of the funds without having to reveal their true public address Stealth addresses provide protection to receivers of transactions and are a core privacy feature in Beldex Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 9 \x0cRINGCT RingCT was first proposed by the Monero Research Lab as a way to obfuscate transaction amounts Current deployments of RingCT use range proofs which leverage Pedersen commitments to prove that the amount of a transaction being sent is between 0 and 264 This range ensures that only non negative amounts of currency are sent without revealing the actual amount sent in the transaction Recently a number of cryptocurrencies have proposed implementing bulletproofs as a replacement to traditional range proofs in RingCT because of the significant reduction in transaction size Beldex will utilise bulletproofs reducing the information that nodes are required to store and relay thereby improving scalability MASTER NODES Although Beldex implements novel changes on top of the CryptoNote protocol much of Beldex\xe2\x80\x99s networking functionality and scalability is enabled by a set of incentivised nodes called Master Nodes To operate a Master Node an operator time locks a significant amount of Beldex and provides a minimum level of bandwidth and storage to the network In return for their services Beldex Master Node operators receive a portion of the block reward from each block The resulting network provides market based resistance to Sybil attacks addressing a range of problems with existing mixnets and privacy centric services This resistance is based on supply and demand interactions which help prevent single actors from having a large enough stake in Beldex to have a significant negative impact on the second layer privacy services Beldex provides DASH first theorised that Sybil attack resistant networks can be derived from cryptoeconomics As an attacker accumulates Beldex the circulating supply decreases in turn applying demand side pressure driving the price of Beldex up As this continues it becomes increasingly costly for additional Beldex to be purchased making the attack prohibitively expensive To achieve this economic protection Beldex encourages the active suppression of the circulating supply In particular the emissions curve and collateral requirements must be designed to ensure enough circulating supply is locked and reasonable returns are provided for operators to ensure Sybil attack resistance BLOCK REWARD Distribution of block rewards in Beldex is conducted through proof of work a robust and well studied system for the creation of blocks and the ordering of transactions Miners collect and write transactions into blocks and collect fees for doing so As a consensus rule in Beldex each block contains multiple reward outputs of which only one goes to the miner The Beldex block reward is set to a constant value as 2 BDX Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 10 \x0cMining Reward \xe2\x80\x8bAs well as collecting transaction fees 10% of the block reward is awarded to the miner that constructs the block Master Node Reward \xe2\x80\x8bThe second output in each block (90% of total reward) goes to a Master Node or two Master Nodes if a relay is selected Master Nodes are rewarded based on the time since they last received a reward (or time since they registered) with a preference for nodes that have been waiting longer Each time a Master Node registers with the network it assumes the last position in the queue If the Master Node maintains good service and is not ejected from the queue by a swarm flag it slowly migrates to the higher positions in the queue Nodes at or near the front of the queue are eligible for a reward and once awarded the node again drops to the last position in the queue and begins working its way back up Beldex implements novel changes on top of the \xe2\x80\x8bCryptoNote protocol\xe2\x80\x8b (\xe2\x80\x8bASIC Resistance\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bDynamic Block

COLLATERALISATION Master Nodes must prove to the network that they are holding the required collateral Privacy features inherent in Beldex\xe2\x80\x99s design make this difficult specifically the inability to audit public address balances or to use viewkeys to see outgoing transactions Beldex makes novel use of time locked outputs which allow Beldex coins to be time locked until the blockchain reaches a defined block height Until this defined height the Beldex network will invalidate attempts to spend these time locked outputs Beldex utilises this process to prove that an amount is being held by a specific Master Node preventing shuffling of collateral To register as a Master Node an operator creates a time locked output of the required amount which unlocks after a minimum of 21 600 blocks have elapsed (approximately 30 days) In the extra field of the transaction the Master Node operator includes the Beldex address which may receive Master Node rewards This address will also be used as the public key for Master Node operations such as swarm voting Wallets may avoid using these Master Node registration transactions as mixins as their true amounts and destination are disclosed and therefore are not useful in providing extra anonymity to a transaction Before each node joins the Master Node network other nodes must individually validate that the said nodes collateral outlay matches the required amount as per the decreasing collateralization requirement Although collateral transactions expire after 30 days the wallet will have an opt in automatic re collateralisation feature CRYPTONOTE ALTERATIONS As a cryptocurrency Beldex is functionally similar to its fellow CryptoNote coins However there are key differences beyond the addition of Master Nodes and the associated functionality that comes with them ASIC RESISTANCE An Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is a computer chip that is built specifically for a single function In the context of mining ASICs are used to compute for specific hashing algorithms They pose a risk to decentralisation because they outpace all other mining methods Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 12 \x0care manufactured by specific companies have very limited distribution channels due to the specialised nature of the hardware and they require significant capital costs to develop and operate profitably There are potential benefits to ASICs such as the capital cost requirements that miners must undertake to invest in algorithm specific hardware which makes it less likely that they would behave in a manner that undermines their own investment by acting dishonestly However the distribution and manufacture of ASIC chips with mature hashing algorithms is still centralised around a few large companies These companies can refuse shipment to certain areas decide what regions and customers get the best performing ASICs and they can structure limited runs and manipulate prices To prevent ASIC miners from monopolising the network hashrate many cryptocurrencies developed ASIC resistant hashing algorithms like Scrypt and Ethash [25][26] Until recently Monero used the CryptoNight hashing algorithm which requires large amounts of L3 cache to operate In theory this should have made it difficult to produce an ASIC chip due to large memory requirements However in 2018 Bitmain released the X3 a CryptoNight specific ASIC that could effectively mine at ten times the speed of a graphics processing unit (GPU) [27] Other hashing algorithms have suffered similar fates with Scrypt Ethash and Equihash all now being mined by ASICs To combat the use of ASICs Monero proposed a strategy of hard forking every 3 6 months to slightly change the CryptoNight hashing algorithm (the first fork moving to CryptoNightV7) The capital and time required to build an ASIC is significant and with highly specific hardware designs slight tweaks in a hashing algorithm should invalidate the chip design wasting the time and capital investment of ASIC manufacturers However this approach introduces its own issues If changes made to the algorithm are insufficient to prevent ASICs being reprogrammed then the network can become vulnerable to hashrate centralisation until another hard fork is possible Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) should also 12 be considered in ASIC resistance strategies where infrequent slight changes to hashing algorithms can be easily reprogrammed for FPGAs Another concern is that regular changes to core consensus mechanisms introduce the chance of unintended bugs and generally centralise the development of such changes around a core team of developers Beldex incorporated a version of CryptoNight called CryptoNight Conceal which maintains ASIC resistance against CryptoNight ASIC miners as well as cloud mining (like nicehash) CryptoNight Heavy differs from CryptoNight V7 in a number of ways it provides decrease in scratchpad size to 512kb and a change in the way implodes and explodes are handled These changes differentiate it from the largest target for ASIC miners which is Monero\xe2\x80\x99s CryptoNight V7 and also provide a more robust protection against ASIC development until a more permanent solution is proposed Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 13 \x0cDynamic Block Size Like other CryptoNote coins Beldex does not have a fixed block size Instead the block size changes over time growing to include more transactions as the network reaches higher transaction throughput The Beldex block size scales by observing the median block size over the last 100 blocks and slowly retargets the maximum size of any new blocks accordingly The long term concern in other cryptocurrencies is that large block sizes burden the nodes that store and verify transactions As block sizes grow nodes that run on lower grade hardware are unable to process and propagate new blocks leading to centralisation of the node network among those with a commercial interest in maintaining nodes This can be concerning because distributing the blockchain across many nodes allows for the state of the chain to be confirmed among many different parties adding to its validity and censorship resistance In Beldex a portion of the block reward is given to Master Nodes that process and propagate blocks as full nodes Because Master Nodes with insufficient bandwidth and performance are dropped from the Master Node network the reward pool self enforces a minimum performance requirement This incentive structure not only ensures that the node count remains high but that the said nodes are of a sufficient performance level to successfully share blockchain data across the network irrespective of how large the blockchain grows or how demanding the bandwidth requirements are Even so transaction size optimisations are still required to ensure that the network scales efficiently so as to keep the Master Node operating costs down so that a high node count can be sustained in the long term Ring Signature Size Ring signatures are used to hide real outputs amongst others in any given transaction The size of a ring signature refers to how many mixins are used to construct the ring Monero currently has an enforced minimum ring signature size of seven with six mixins used alongside the real unspent output in a transaction The effect of larger ring sizes has been sparsely studied however in paper 0001 (published by the Monero Research Lab) the effect of differing ring sizes was analysed versus an attacker who owned a large number of outputs on the blockchain It was found that higher ring sizes reduce the timeframe in which a malicious attacker who owned a large number of unspent outputs would be able to perform effective analysis of transactions Mandating larger ring sizes also protects against a theoretical attack known as an EABE/Knacc attack where a third party (i e an exchange) can perform limited temporal analysis on transactions between two users Additionally Monero has no maximum ring size enforced by network consensus rules Many wallets like the Monero GUI wallet cap the ring size at 26 However a user is free to manually create a transaction with whatever ring size they wish as long as it is above a ring size of seven This is problematic since most wallets have a default ring size of seven Increasing a Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 14 \x0ctransactions ring size above seven makes it stand out Further if an individual s transactions were to always use a non standard ring size in Monero (ten for example) a passive third party could analyse the blockchain and infer patterns using temporal analysis Beldex improves on both of these problems by statically enforcing ring sizes and setting the ring size to ten Statically setting the maximum ring size protects users who construct rings with more than nine mixins and setting the ring size minimum to ten more effectively prevents an attacker who owns a large number of outputs from discerning the true outputs spent in a ring signature Larger ring sizes also increase the default churning effectiveness non linearly becoming more effective as ring sizes grow In the current transaction scheme increasing the ring size to 10 would lead to a 2 6% increase in the size of the transaction However when Bulletproofs are implemented it will account for about a 8 13% increase in the size of a transaction This is because of the overall reduction in transaction size caused by Bulletproofs Increasing the minimum ring size may present a problem on a network that lacks architecture to support larger sized transactions due to the increased overhead With Beldex however this burden can be carried by Master Nodes that are incentivised to operate and provide sufficient bandwidth AI TECHNOLOGY Beldex is collecting data to develop prediction algorithms to enhance the platform These future driven developments will benefit all users of the platform \xe2\x97\x8f Security Normative user behavior is tracked so that suspicious activity can be identified As user data is collected the system knows how particular users typically transact and can identify anomalies \xe2\x97\x8f Trading and prediction Algorithms will be able to accurately track market movements and provide algo trading as well as hedging for the Beldex exchange itself reducing the custodianship risk that is sometimes associated with crypto exchanges Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 15 \x0cBELDEX EXCHANGE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET Since the invention of Bitcoin the cryptocurrency market has skyrocketed both in value and trading volume Many market experts expect cryptocurrency to replace or outpace other types of financial assets because of the superior way in which tokens and cryptocurrencies can represent value Bitcoin is used as a hedge against other types of investments creating a balanced portfolio because it appears that the cryptocurrency markets run counter to the traditional investment and forex markets Transactions in cryptocurrency continues to increase and there\xe2\x80\x99s a real market need to reach a 3 variety of investors As shown by CoinMarketCap while the market experienced a dip in 2018 it is rapidly recovering Furthermore the number of coins on the market is increasing yet many exchanges offer a small range of cryptocurrencies to trade Especially when it comes to niche markets it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming difficult for people to find one exchange where they can get high liquidity and a large number of cryptocurrencies at reasonable fees

CRYPTO EXCHANGES TODAY In the initial geographies users are limited in the exchanges they use In Malaysia the leading exchange is Luno which offers no altcoins only Bitcoin and Ethereum While there are more than 50 exchanges listed only 2 of them list more than 10 tokens or coins Despite crypto friedly regulation the situation is quite limited when looking for a real trading platform for trading 4 investment and exchange Furthermore very few e commerce retailers have adopted the use of cryptocurrency Digital cash provides a huge opportunity for the people in many regions However retailers and online merchants have yet to adopt this form of currency over cash Creating a user friendly ecosystem with a wallet APIs for ecommerce providers and an exchange including peer to peer transactions will open up the opportunities The layer of privacy on top of these solutions is essential to adoption as many people are looking at how they can have the convenience and anonymity of cash in their transactions For a variety of reasons people don\xe2\x80\x99t want all of their transactions recorded by centralized companies and organizations without their permission Therefore having a privacy coin is the key to adoption in a variety of markets Today there are hundreds of crypto asset exchanges and every week we hear about more of them entering the market However the market is tremendously

crypto/digital asset market faces a number of challenges addressed by BELDEX \xe2\x97\x8f Individual privacy is not respected and people have to trust their private details to a variety of companies who may or may not respect their privacy \xe2\x97\x8f Public legers mean all transactions can be traced again violating people\xe2\x80\x99s privacy People have the right to make private purchases and trades and the current system does not respect this \xe2\x97\x8f Many exchanges feature a very limited number of cryptocurrencies to trade and few exchange pairs \xe2\x97\x8f Exchanges do not have good customer service and the use of the exchanges is difficult This causes user frustration loss of funds and low adoption rates \xe2\x97\x8f To use cryptocurrency users need to use a variety of tools and vendors wallet exchange and coins People can\xe2\x80\x99t find all the services they need in one place \xe2\x97\x8f Although regulation is in place to legalize crypto in many geographies those markets are underserved when it comes to user friendly exchanges and wallets \xe2\x97\x8f The crypto market is growing rapidly and it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to meet market demand with new solutions \xe2\x97\x8f Crypto exchanges today do not offer good support for the average customer Support is through email most commonly which is highly problematic In transactions where prices are changing on a minute by minute basis customers don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait a day for an email exchange \xe2\x97\x8f Liquidity is limited on exchanges because the exchange can only trade using the liquidity from users on that specific exchange Without integration to larger exchanges it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to guarantee that people will be able to trade in the currencies they want Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 19 \x0cSOLUTION Beldex is releasing the Beldex hybrid exchange which provides a very high level of security and privacy to exchange users focusing on APAC region Beldex is creating an ecosystem around the Beldex privacy coin and Beldex exchange to ensure a financial system that benefits all participants Users of the Beldex ecosystem will enjoy the immediacy and privacy of cash through electronic means The Beldex ecosystem ensures a high level of utility for the coins through a wide network of partners and commercial entities that accept the Beldex coin The ecosystem includes \xe2\x97\x8f Beldex coin A privacy coin based on the most advanced privacy protocols used by today\xe2\x80\x99s cryptocurrencies ensuring user privacy with configuration for greater levels of privacy \xe2\x97\x8f Beldex exchange A hybrid centralized/decentralized exchange integrating privacy peer to peer trades a wide range of coins and trading pairs and integration with the Beldex coin and wallet \xe2\x97\x8f Beldex wallet \xe2\x97\x8f Beldex commerce ecosystem Integration with ecommerce partners for use of the Beldex coin and wallet as well as set of APIs for integration of the wallet and coin for vendors wishing to accept the Beldex cryptocurrency BELDEX EXCHANGE The Beldex exchange is a hybrid centralized/decentralized exchange integrating privacy peer to peer trades a wide range of coins and trading pairs and integration with the Beldex coin and wallet The exchange itself is the result of more than a year\xe2\x80\x99s development of the latest technologies taking the best from both centralized and decentralized technologies The benefits of our development efforts are in the unique features that Beldex can offer today as well as the future developments that are planned in our roadmap The exchange puts an emphasis on \xe2\x97\x8f Huge selection of exchange currencies and exchange pairs By connecting with large exchanges Beldex can offer the widest variety of trading crypto assets and pairings Rather than focusing on bringing in new coins Beldex focused its attention on connectivity and partnerships Beldex will also be partnering with innovative projects to provide exchange of assets not found in other exchanges \xe2\x97\x8f Liquidity of crypto assets Rather than relying on exchange specific asset trades through partnerships with other exchanges Beldex allows liquidity at the market rate This type of decentralized trading combines the liquidity of all of the Beldex partner exchanges for a superior level of liquidity for all trading pairs and assets Beldex Whitepaper \xe2\x80\x94 20 \x0c\xe2\x97\x8f Customer support Beldex provides 24/7 human chat support Rather than chatbots or email responses customers on the exchange can chat with a real person who will answer their needs immediately This level of support is a standard for all other market trading platforms but in the crypto space it\xe2\x80\x99s a rarity When it comes to money people want real immediate answers and Beldex provides that \xe2\x97\x8f Privacy and security Beldex uses a privacy coin that can be used for a variety of transactions All transactions in Beldex are completely private Security will be through biometric login for authentication assurance and for the ease of login Rather than having to remember passwords and keys and 2 factor authentication people use their retina scan fingerprint Not only is this more secure but it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier on people than other forms of login \xe2\x97\x8f Competitive transaction fees The exchange will be focusing on volume and conservation of operational costs in order to provide low fees for crypto asset transactions Using the Beldex token will provide additional fee discounts to users \xe2\x97\x8f Instant Lending against your crypto asset in wallet system with minimal percentage of interest fee and long terms pay back duration \xe2\x97\x8f Stake your coins while holding your staking coins on
