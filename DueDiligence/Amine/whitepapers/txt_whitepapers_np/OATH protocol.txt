leading technologies and theories namely theoretical computer science mathematics algorithms cryptography game theory and economics Blockchain brings to the world a promising decentralized internet new ideas and business opportunities To protect the decentralized communities and keep them running we need a highly secure and trustable system Smart contracts generally remove the barrier of trust between users They reduce the intermediary costs that may exist in the transaction process With unsupervised self executing \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts \xe2\x80\x9d individuals can do business and collaborate without ever meeting or knowing each other The design and concept of smart contracts applies to many different scenarios such as e commerce insurance home rental banking financial services import and export and many others Smart contracts however have been neither widely accepted nor utili ed due to several limitations difficulties in contract preparation inability to verify off chain information functional limitations lack of on chain governance and dispute resolution and pseudonymity Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 2 / 50 \x0cCORE ISSUES DIFFICULTIES IN CONTRACT PREPARATION Smart Contract is written in a computer programming language such as Solidity C++ et al Few users have the requisite knowledge and experience to write a correct and secure smart contract This creates an extremely high bar for potential smart contract users UNABLE TO ERIF OFF C AIN INFORMATION Smart contracts cannot effectively verify or authenticate off chain information for real world businesses therefore creating loopholes for contract fraud FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS Because a smart contract is a self executing program written in a computer programming language it works according to the terms and conditions originally written in the code This limits its ability to resolve disputes not included in the codes LACK OF GOVERNANCE AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION Decentralization is the key feature of a blockchain application When a dispute arises it is difficult for both parties to find a credible third party to resolve the dispute n the decentrali ed world it is particularly difficult for traditional courts or arbitration institutions to enforce the rules and resolve the disputes Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 3 / 50 \x0cSEUDON MIT Identity protection is one of the most prominent features of blockchain Blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s identity protection however also enables potential manipulation of the system and even fraud Although all blockchain transactions are public and immutable one\xe2\x80\x99s identity is concealed (i e all transactions are not anonymous but they are pseudonymous) and disreputable users may simply change their identity and commit fraud over and over again Those core issues we mentioned above are extremely important for smart contracts We will have to resolve them so that smart contracts can be safer and more useful CASES IN POINT BLOCKC AIN E COMMERCE C C Party A Seller of a pre owned luxury handbag in \xe2\x80\x9clike new\xe2\x80\x9d condition Party B Buyer Party B purchased a pre owned luxury handbag from Party A on an e commerce blockchain platform After receiving the handbag Party B argues that the bag is not in \xe2\x80\x9clike new\xe2\x80\x9d condition and requests to return it Party A argues that the photos provided on the platform clearly show the condition of the bag which matches the provided description Party A refused to refund Both sides hold their own views and cannot reach a resolution BLOCKCHAIN INSURANCE SERVICE Party A Blockchain health insurance service provider Party B Patient Party B signed a smart contract with a blockchain health insurance service provider When Party submits a claim for compensation from Party A it is difficult for Party A to determine the truthfulness of the claim For a decentrali ed service provider it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to decide whether the customer\xe2\x80\x99s claims are in compliance with the terms of the insurance or whether the amount claimed is in accordance with the circumstances Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 4 / 50 \x0cBLOCKC AIN S ORT TERM RENTAL Party A Landlord Party B Tenant Party B rented a house through a blockchain \xe2\x80\x98airbnb alike\xe2\x80\x99 platform After the lease ended Party A found that the TV was damaged and asked for compensation Party B insisted that he is not responsible of the damage and refused to pay As there is no centralized customer service the two parties cannot effectively resolve this dispute BLOCKCHAIN COPYRIGHT PROTECTION Party A Blockchain Content Copyright Platform User Party B Copyright Owner Party A registered IP on a blockchain based copyright protection platform The actual copyright owner Party finds out that his copyright is pirated and appeals to the platform ue to the lack of an arbitration mechanism the merits of both parties\xe2\x80\x99 claims cannot be determined easily BLOCKCHAIN BET OR PREDICTION Blockchain prediction platforms have become wildly popular People like to use the platforms to predict game results campaign results and even the weather t is however difficult to determine the authenticity of some of the controversial results without external input As the above cases illustrate a comprehensive smart contract system and a fair dispute resolution mechanism are much needed in the blockchain community Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 5 / 50 \x0cOATH PROTOCOL OVERVIEW OATH is a blockchain based alternative dispute resolution protocol It is an infrastructure layer between chains and dApps By using a decentralized juror community with a complete new consensus mechanism Proof of Common sense OATH provides a robust fair transparent and extensible dispute resolution protocol OATH serves as a blockchain governance system that provides an effective warranty for smart contracts f one side is dissatisfied with an outcome resulting in a dispute there will be a decentrali ed third party with no con ict of interest to resolve the dispute The availability of a dispute resolution mechanism improves the reliability of smart contracts and provides a dependable protection mechanism for blockchain users OATH acts as an insurance protocol for dApp users protecting them from undesirable counterparty behavior Once the OATH protocol is initiated OATH jury community will vote on the verdict to resolve the dispute OATH protocol will greatly improve users\xe2\x80\x99 credibility and ensure that all contracts are guaranteed by an objective system and that in case of a dispute the parties have an unbiased objective jury handling it OATH can also provide verification of real world information which is presently a big issue for blockchain As a standard protocol any dApp that utilizes OATH may request any kind of real world information from our jury community our jurors will provide information and the rest of the jury community will vote to verify the information\xe2\x80\x99s authenticity and accuracy Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 6 / 50 \x0cROOF OF COMMON SENSE OATH Protocol introduces a new consensus mechanism Proof of common sense It is not used by nodes to confirm the on chain data nstead it is a consensus mechanism that is used within the OATH jury community OATH jurors only need to rely on their common sense to decide cases based on contract terms evidence and testimony They do not need to be experts in any field or area As blockchain users they have sufficient knowledge to evaluate the evidence and determine the case outcome OATH jury is a community of regular blockchain supporters and dApp users Not only will they help regulate the chain or dApp they support but they can also provide their knowledge and service to other ecosystems They will be rewarded for using their common sense to resolve disputes SOLUTIONS OATH will provide extensions for multiple smart contract programming languages allowing users to agree on dispute resolution solutions and default claims agreements when writing smart contracts or blockchain applications OATH will also provide an infrastructure layer for dApps so that developers can directly integrate OATH protocol At the same time OATH will also provide a smart contract construction interface that will greatly reduce barriers to using smart contracts By providing common contract templates OATH will improve the usability of smart contracts in a variety of scenarios The templates will include many typical applications and scenarios such as e commerce copyright protection OTC transactions and others OATH protocol will be built into the template and include a dispute resolution plan compensation agreement and other related fields All smart contracts written through the OATH smart contract interface are automatically secured by the OATH protocol The heart of the OATH protocol is our jury community They protect the integrity of smart contracts that incorporate the OATH protocol by adjudicating any potential disputes The OATH jury community will also serve to link news events and predictions between blockchains and the real world Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 7 / 50 \x0cDIS UTE RESOLUTION MEC ANISM In the Anglo American common law legal system the jury operates with distinct blockchain characteristics The jury is usually comprised of 12 jurors (each country\xe2\x80\x99s particular details vary slightly) randomly selected from the general adult population At trial the judge presides over the proceedings and resolves questions of law and procedural issues The jury is tasked with the responsibility of resolving issues of fact at the judge\xe2\x80\x99s direction based on presented evidence and based on the facts deciding the outcome of the case After the closing arguments in court the jury has the opportunity to privately deliberate and discuss the evidence presented in court According to the judge\xe2\x80\x99s instructions relating to the law the jury then decides based on the evidence presented in court which side prevails and returns a verdict The jury pool is comprised of citizens who are randomly selected from the general population without any additional requirements of knowledge or skill Jurors use their common sense and understanding to evaluate the arguments and evidence presented by the parties and render a verdict Random selection results in a diverse jury composition and the jury\xe2\x80\x99s diverse backgrounds and experiences ensure that the facts are considered from different viewpoints resulting in a fair verdict At the same time the randomly selected jury fairly represents the general population and the verdict based on their consensus fairly represents the consensus and understanding that the general population would reach based on the same evidence The jury system aligns with the decentralization of the blockchain democratic idea All community members share the consensus that underlies the verdict and the decisions are made by randomly selected representatives of the community The OATH dispute resolution protocol therefore is modeled on the common law jury system and utilizes blockchain cryptographic algorithms random algorithms associated with categories and attributes credit level and case tracking technology OATH jurors from different backgrounds and variant professions guarantee to provide resolution of contract disputes by contents evidence testimonies and debates Blockchain technology will ensure the authentication of smart contracts agreements and immutability of the evidence provided by both parties dentities of the OATH jurors are kept strictly confidential and encrypted to make sure that their decisions are objective and free from external in uence urors will provide information relating to their relevant categories like age gender nationality occupation and educational level OATH\xe2\x80\x99s categorized random Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 8 / 50 \x0calgorithm then randomly selects jurors based on those categories OATH will also assign a credit level to jurors to assess and reward the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 behavior Jurors will get higher ratings for correctly voting for the prevailing party On the other hand serial wrong judgments will reduce jurors\xe2\x80\x99 ratings Higher credit level results in higher awards and better odds of being selected for disputes OATH will establish relationship attributes for jurors to reduce the probability of joint participation in cases This means that the same group of jurors is unlikely to be selected to resolve consecutive disputes preventing the jurors from colluding on their votes The OATH platform allows the contracting parties to control the process by allowing them to set parameters for the dispute resolution process such as the number and categories of jurors and the number of votes necessary to prevail The verdict will be transparent and the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 votes and reasons of voting will be made public once the case is closed The decisions are appealable The case details and dispute resolution result will be encrypted and saved on blockchain Cases are classified and indexed as well for future reference subject to the privacy policy OATH protocol aims to provide a warranty for blockchain contracts and improve their reliability preventing the blockchain and smart contracts from being plagued by unresolved disputes Along with the blockchain development the OATH protocol will launch additional services for blockchain security and governance built on the principles of decentrali ation justice reliability and efficiency Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 9 / 50 \x0cADVANTAGES BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY A fair robust transparent and extensible blockchain governance protocol can greatly improve the reliability of dApps and blockchain QUICK AND EFFICIENT In the event of a dispute OATH dispute resolution cases can be generated automatically if signed and confirmed by any party with no additional process required oth parties will then have five days to provide relevant evidence and the jury will have two days to review and decide the case In most cases it only takes 7 days to render the verdict JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS OATH takes advantage of the transparency and reliability of the blockchain to make sure that the contents of each case cannot be modified or deleted t also helps keep the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 identities are kept in strict confidence to preserve objectivity and prevent external in uence n addition OATH algorithms ensure that jurors selected for each case are from diverse backgrounds OATH provides several options for the contracting parties to set the criteria of the dispute resolution process For example Number of jurors (odd number from 11 to 101) Percentage of votes needed to prevail (51% 100%) Categories of jurors required (e g gender age nationality language occupation education background credit level etc ) During the voting process neither the jury nor the parties can see the votes After the verdict has been rendered the votes and jurors\xe2\x80\x99 reasons therefor will be released publicly Any party may appeal the result The appealed from outcome will not be disclosed to make sure that the new jurors are not biased The results of the appeal will also be included in the credit level evaluation system for jurors Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 10 / 50 \x0cMANAGEABLE COST Users will deposit OATH tokens to facilitate the dispute resolution plan in their smart contract which will serve as the arbitration fee for disputed cases If the contract is successfully executed the deposit will be returned to both parties without any additional cost In the event of a dispute the arbitration fee will be awarded to the jurors who correctly choose the prevailing party To have enough jurors willing to provide their time and effort to resolve cases once the case is initiated OATH will notify its jurors about key details of the case such as arbitration fees number of jurors required and so on Once they receive the notification the jurors may decide whether they want to participate in the the case If not enough jurors accept the case OATH will reject the resolution plan and require the parties to change the plan details to incentivize juror participation for example either by increasing award to jurors or reducing the number of jurors required This allows the parties to control and manage the cost of resolving their dispute EFFECTIVE EXECUTION When constructing a smart contract both parties may set a default compensation plan in advance n the event of a dispute once the results are confirmed by both parties (or neither party objects) OATH will automatically send the result back to the smart contract and it will automatically execute based on the the rules originally defined by both parties TRACKABLE CASES OATH will encrypt the contents of smart contract disputes and store them in the OATH blockchain This will create an immutable case record and increase the security of smart contracts allowing jurors and other interested parties to review the previously decided case verdicts at any time Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 11 / 50 \x0cUSER FLOW 01 OATH Extention Deposit OST OATH works as a smart contract extension and protocol Through OATH both parties can add the Smart Arbitration Plan (SAP) and set dispute resolution parameters to their smart contract at the time of its creation SAP will require a deposit of a set amount of OATH tokens (OATH) to resolve potential disputes 02 Once the smart contract is deployed OATH tracks the contract progress In the event that each party is satisfied with the result the case is closed and the SAP returns the deposited OATH The SAP information is then encrypted and placed on the OATH chain Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 12 / 50 \x0cIf either party initiates a dispute the 03 SAP gets converted into a Smart Arbitration Case (SAC) and the deposit into an award fee After that both parties may set the following criteria for the dispute resolution process Number of jurors (odd number from 11 to 101) Percentage of votes needed to prevail (51% 100%) Resolution fees (by default amount of OATH deposited into SAP) Categories of jurors required (e g gender age nationality language occupation education background credit level etc ) All these settings will be encrypted and saved on the OATH chain 04 OATH chooses the jurors using the Categorizing Random Algorithm based on their categories and attributes within SAC settings Two thirds of the jurors will fit the categories set by the counterparties (One third each and if the number of jurors in full compliance is insufficient the rest shall be filled by those partially qualified) The remaining third will be randomly selected through the OATH algorithm excluding the Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 13 / 50 \x0ccategories specified by both parties OATH will identify twice the required number of jurors and notify them of the basic SAC details such as the total number in jurors percentage of votes needed to prevail award fees and so on Juror candidates may decide whether to accept the case on the based on the provided information The jury is filled on a first come first employed basis i e after the three major category groups (both parties and the OATH platform) have enough jurors no more jurors will be accepted to the jury f there is an insufficient number of jurors willing to take the case both parties can modify the SAC to attract more candidates e g by increasing the award fees or lowering the total number of jurors required The counter parties will have 05 five days to upload their arguments and supporting documents (text pictures videos etc ) During this period either side may apply for an extension paying an additional deposit in proportion to the extended days For example a five day extension requires an extra 100% deposit of OATH Token Jurors can comment on the provided materials and ask follow up questions or request additional evidence To incentivize participants to address critical points and participate in the discussion community will reward their interactions by awarding token bonuses and credit scores Jurors\xe2\x80\x99 identities are concealed to ensure that they remain objective and free from external in uence throughout the process 06 Once the evidence has been fully submitted jurors will have three days to vote and provide rationale for their votes Both parties and jurors may access the votes and written opinions only after the case is closed and certain information (like jurors\xe2\x80\x99 identities) will remain confidential urors who correctly identify the prevailing side will be awarded dispute fees as well as credit scores Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 14 / 50 \x0c07 After the votes are collected the case resolution result will become public The result will include the votes rationale for voting prevailing party and selected jurors\xe2\x80\x99 categories so that the parties and juror community may have a clear understanding of the result Jurors who correctly identified the prevailing side will receive weighted awards according to the credit level formula Judges are incentivized to achieve higher credit levels because as one\xe2\x80\x99s credit level increases so do the awards Parties will have five days to either confirm or appeal the verdict f both parties confirm the verdict or fail to appeal within that timeframe OATH will send the result back to the smart contract and the smart contract will execute automatically according to the result Either side may initiate an appeal which requires an additional deposit to facilitate another round of dispute resolution In case of an appeal OATH will open a new SAC repeating steps 3 7 above Appealed from case results will not be disclosed to new jurors to prevent bias Appeal fees are higher and appellate juries will be comprises of jurors with higher credit levels so that the most experienced judges are invited to decide the case on appeal Each SAC is programmed to accept up to two appeals and the final appeal result will be automatically returned to the smart contract Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 15 / 50 \x0cUSE CASES OATH offers dispute resolution services for a wide range of commercial contracts covering a variety of subject matters For instance OATH can effectively settle disputes on e commerce platforms including B2C and C2C We also help secure cryptocurrency and blockchain transactions that may present unequal trading risks Oath\xe2\x80\x99s use cases include but are not limited to the following dispute resolution examples BLOCKC AIN E COMMERCE DIS UTES Party A Seller of a pre owned luxury handbag in \xe2\x80\x9clike new\xe2\x80\x9d condition Party B Buyer Party B purchased a pre owned luxury handbag from Party A on an e commerce blockchain platform After receiving the handbag Party B argues that the bag is not in \xe2\x80\x9clike new\xe2\x80\x9d condition and requests to return it Party A argues that the photos provided on the platform clearly show the condition of the bag which matches the provided description Party A refused to refund The platform incorporates the Oath Protocol and the dispute resolution agreement contains the following conditions The dispute is decided by 21 jurors no category requirement with prevailing ratio set at 60% If Party A prevails the payment is automatically released to Party A If Party B prevails the payment is automatically refunded to Party B once the item is returned to Party A Once Party B initiates the dispute an SAC is created automatically Party A uploads relevant photos communication history with Party B as well as a statement detailing the condition of the item Party B also uploads relevant evidence to the evidence pool Once the jury reviews the evidence over 60% of the jurors side with Party A eliminating the need for a refund Once both parties confirm the dispute resolution result OATH returns the result to the smart contract which then automatically transfers the money to Party A Jurors are allocated their award and the case is closed Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 16 / 50 \x0cNEWS VERIFICATION Party A A group interested in accurate news reporting Early news reporting is oftentimes vague and con icting due to the lack of verified information and the abundance of unverified rumors from multiple channels OATH allows Party A to crowd verify the facts To generate interest Party A initiates an SAC and deposits OATH tokens to reward evidencecollection and verification OATH users submit the facts and information they are aware of and other users vote to confirm the veracity of the submitted information BLOCKCHAIN INSURANCE Party A Blockchain health insurance company Party B Insured individual Blockchain technology facilitates innovative insurance models and OATH works really well with those models providing a fair and efficient decentrali ed claims verification service Party A and Party B signed a smart insurance contract that uses OATH as a service provider for coverage determination To obtain insurance payment Party B the insured initiates an SAC for the insurance claim Party B needs to upload all relevant evidence to support the claim such as pictures medical appointment confirmation medical billing statement and diagnosis and so on The smart insurance contract contents are automatically added to the SAC evidence pool Based on the contents of the contract and provided evidence the jurors will vote to decide whether the insured\xe2\x80\x99s claim is covered and he or she is entitled to the payment Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 17 / 50 \x0cTECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ARCHITECTURE In blockchain smart contracts are executed on a closed environment virtual machine which is an isolated system that has no interaction with external environment This means that smart contracts are unable to communicate directly with external world or obtain any outside information To address this issue an Oracle may provide off chain data to trigger the data source to execute smart contracts The Oracle may receive queries from the contract by monitoring specific events and the data is returned by the callback method by the Oracle Therefore OATH will employ an Oracle to bridge the gap between the public chain and the OATH platform OATH protocol will provide smart contract extensions for mainstream public chains (including but not limited to Ethereum (ETH) QuarkChain (QKC) EOS io (EOS) etc ) that contain the APIs related to OATH dispute resolution services OATH Oracle smart contracts will also be deployed onto public chains as bridges between smart contracts and external OATH services hen a smart contract with built in OATH protocol and filled AP s is successfully deployed to the public chain it will send relevant Queries to the OATH Oracle on that chain The OATH monitoring services will receive the relevant Query Event that the OATH Oracle sends out OATH services will encrypt and store associated information in its blockchain (i e establishing resolution plans putting on record resolution Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 18 / 50 \x0ccases etc ) If any data such as the case result needs to be sent back the data will be transmitted via external services to the OATH Oracle which will then send the data to the relevant smart contract in API callbacks To ensure the information\xe2\x80\x99s reliability and security OATH provides trustworthy techniques for proofs based on TLS Notary TLS Notary is primarily in accordance with the secure transport layer protocol T S used to guarantee confidentiality and data integrity between two communication applications ts advantage comes from its independence from the application protocol and higher level protocols can be transparently distributed on the TLS protocol TLS consists of three basic phases Key algorithms supported by peer negotiation Public key exchange based on private key encryption and authentication based on P certificates and Confidential data transmission based on public key encryption Throughout the transmission the TLS master key can be divided into three parts the server the auditee and the auditor During the process data sources from the OATH node serve as the server side OATH services serve as the auditee and a specially designed open source service deployed on the cloud platform serves as the auditor Everyone can review and verify the data provided by OATH in the past through this auditor service to ensure the integrity and security of the data Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 19 / 50 \x0cOATH BLOCKCHAIN The OATH chain contains one case ledger and one PFS for file storage The case ledger contains all case information such as contracts verdicts voting reasons selected jurors etc OATH will also have an PFS to store case related evidence files The IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a network designed to create a content addressable peer to peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system t replaces traditional domain names with content addresses so that users don\xe2\x80\x99t have to consider names and paths of file storage Placing a file on the PFS chain yields a unique hash value calculated

hash value hen PFS is requested to calculate the hash value of a file it will use a distributed hash table to find the node where the file is located then retrieve the file and verify the data contained therein PFS is a general purposed infrastructure with few storage limitations in which large files are divided into small sections that can be downloaded from multiple nodes at the same time PFS is a exible fine grained distributed network that is well suited to the requirements of content storage and distribution If evidence is contained in the case information ledger there will be additional PFS Hash roup data that contains PFS Hash ey for all related evidence files An encryption algorithm will generate the private key for the PFS stored file whose contents will not be disclosed to ensure the security and confidentiality The case information will be formed by several linked blocks such as SAP block which contains encrypted contract contents contract currency billing addresses of both parties etc SAC block which contains its own hash value information about the jurors who decided the case IPFS Hash Group of the case evidence etc SAC verdict block which contains the hash value of the SAC block encrypted voting results voting processes etc Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 21 / 50 \x0cNODES The OATH Chain nodes adopt the consensus mechanism of PoS Each node is responsible for storing case information and evidence files The nodes also run OATH\xe2\x80\x99s external services such as Oracle uery Event monitoring services and juror selection algorithms The monitoring service on the Nodes monitors query events sent out by the OATH Oracle and conducts corresponding operations through the information contained within All nodes will be monitoring collectively and after receiving the Event information the nodes will compare and confirm it with nearby nodes Once more than half of them are confirmed a Node will be selected by the PoS Node selection algorithm\xe2\x80\x99 to start running the relevant services For jurors\xe2\x80\x99 selection algorithm OATH uses the categorized random algorithm which will randomly select jurors based on certain categories The random seed is constructed by current Timestamp with the latest block index and random numbers generated from Random org Adding random numbers from Random org increases the randomness and security of the algorithm OATH will provide two user clients a web app and a mobile app The web app is mainly responsible for case presentation initiation evidence upload voting result presentation etc The mobile app will have similar functions to the web app providing an additional convenience of push case notifications to the jurors Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 22 / 50 \x0cJURY SYSTEM KYC & IDENTIFICATION Users may apply to serve as jurors on the OATH client To do so they will need to submit certain information like gender age nationality language professional background occupation etc For the purpose of providing fair and reasonable dispute resolution services initially OATH will have a Jury Community Management (JCM) team The JCM team will examine the identities and qualifications of juror applicants and set initial credit levels according to the applicants\xe2\x80\x99 backgrounds The JCM team will also run promotions to incentivize a robust juror community e g bonus awards for new jurors joining the community bonus awards for maintaining a successful track record etc As the number of jurors increases the community will conduct this process autonomously Community jurors with high credit levels can review the backgrounds and identities of new applicants recommend candidates vote for approvals and determine initial credit level through comprehensive scoring They will be rewarded by tokens for successful approvals and when their referrals correctly decide a certain number of cases Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 23 / 50 \x0cCATEGORIES & ATTRIBUTES Every juror in the OATH community is assigned Categories and Attributes Categories contain their personal information and serve as keys for classification and more scattered random screening Attributes are designed to avoid possible collusion or fraud and are adjusted based on the juror\xe2\x80\x99s case history and the platform development Categories include age gender nationality language major occupation education etc Because fair resolutions require consensus of the general public OATH will pool jurors from diverse backgrounds to decide each case Users will provide the relevant category information in their applications Once the information is submitted it can be modified via a subsequent application that requires approval by the juror community Attributes re ect the map of dynamic relationships between jurors tracking whether any two jurors have participated in the same case OATH will record this collaboration relationship and prioritize jurors with no recent attributes in recent cases This map is constantly adjusted avoiding potential collusion and fraud that may to occur in continuous groups Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 24 / 50 \x0cUROR SELECTION ALGORIT M To select jurors OATH uses the modern version of the Fisher ates shuf e algorithm presented by Richard Durstenfeld in 1964 and popularized by Donald E Knuth in The Art of Computer Programming The algorithm is used to generate a random permutation of a finite sequence in other words the algorithm shuf es the sequence The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat it continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no elements remain The algorithm produces an unbiased permutation every permutation is equally likely The modern version of the algorithm is efficient it takes time proportional to the number of items being shuf ed and shuf es them in place n the first step the Fisher ates algorithm generates a random sequence of all jurors n the second step the jurors are divided into three groups (two category specific groups and one random group) based on the conditions specified by the parties ecause the party specified conditions might not be mutually exclusive it is possible that the same juror fits both category specific groups n that case the juror is placed into the group with fewer members or if both groups have the same number of jurors the juror is places in the first matched group f a juror does not match either party\xe2\x80\x99s specified categories the juror is placed into the random group Once all three groups are filled the process is completed The complexity of the algorithm is O(N) which is proportional to the number of jurors 1

\x0cJUROR CREDIT LEVELS OATH introduces a Credit Level System to encourage and enforce reasonable and fair decision making by the jurors The system has 20 levels and jurors with higher credit levels earn more heavily weighted token awards for services performed on the platform New jurors after C verification and evaluation by a number of statistical methods are assigned an initial credit level from 1 to 5 Jurors may level up once they reach certain point thresholds and jurors accumulate points through active case participation and correctly deciding case outcomes Jurors\xe2\x80\x99 credit levels and scores can be expressed as follows In which L \xe2\x88\x88 [1 20] is the credit level P stands for the credit score \xce\xb5 (t ) is the standard step function satisfying the description of the standard saving signal and Fibo stands for the Fibonacci sequence the credit level numerical table is as follows Changes in credit scores are determined by several factors in each case of dispute

on credit scores Voting for the winning party earns 2 points whereas voting for the losing party subtracts 2 points To maintain the fairness and stability platform will greatly decrease the credit scores of jurors who make continuous wrong choices 2 Response Time Timeliness also affects one\xe2\x80\x99s score Jurors have to render verdicts within the prescribed period Voting within that period earns 1 point Failure to make a decision within the prescribed period results in a null vote which may affect the case outcome Overtime decisions therefore subtract 2 points from the score and repeat failures to render timely decisions will result in heavier penalties 3 Appeals Although no juror can satisfy all expectations and fit everyone\xe2\x80\x99s concept of justice jurors are motivated to render objective and unbiased verdicts The appellate review handled by higher leveled jurors sufficiently reduces the potential for bias If the appeal is denied (and the original result is upheld) prevailing jurors\xe2\x80\x99 votes will earn an additional 1 point to reward them for correctly deciding the case outcome If the original result is overturned however former prevailing jurors will lose 3 points and jurors whose votes align with the appellate result will earn 2 points Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 27 / 50 \x0c1 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 7 5 5 12 8 6 20 13 7 33 21 8 54

case in which he was awarded 2 points The choice was made within the specified time for which point was awarded credit points in this resolution Bob obtained 3 points in this case Assume that this dispute case is appealed and higher leveled jurors will be selected Although Bob has no right to participate he will still receive an extra point if the appeal is upheld In the end he obtained four credit points for his involvement for the verdict Draft version 2 6 0 subject to further revisions 28 / 50 \x0cFor Example Bob earns 2 credit points for voting for the prevailing party and an additional point for voting within the prescribed time frame earning a total of 3 points for participating in the dispute resolution case If the case is appealed and the result is upheld on appeal Bob
