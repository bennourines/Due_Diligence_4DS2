Vulcun received funding in early 2015 but never took off 2 4 Market Problem Analysis Sports i Gaming \xe2\x96\xaa For the last 50 years i gaming has been an iterative excitement free wager on specific outcomes at the end of a match (win/draw/loss or over/under) \xe2\x96\xaa The market is big but the average player\xe2\x80\x99s age has been rising With new entrants being minimal it has caused the number of members to be static \xe2\x96\xaa Younger audiences such as millennials are much more used to instant interaction via the internet and mobile apps resulting in lack of interest in slow and boring i gaming \xe2\x96\xaa Millennials are more attracted by the fun of participating in a sports event than the monetary reward \xe2\x96\xaa The fact that major casinos are running social casino sites (online casinos where players can play alongside or against friends on social media) and that the sports betting industry is taking up esports betting reinforces the aforementioned points 10 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper 11 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper Fantasy Sports \xef\x82\xaa Fantasy Sports had seen its inception and growth in North America but did not gain much traction in Europe or Asia \xef\x82\xaa It requires a lot of time and effort to be able to find the most cost effective players to include in a roster within the salary cap \xef\x82\xaa Game changing moments during the actual games are not reflected in real time severely limiting relatability \xef\x82\xaa There is a very skewed reward system where 92% of total prizes are won by only 1 5% of players and most others lose their money \xef\x82\xaa The need for constant monitoring analyzing and drafting makes it inapplicable to sports played by individuals or esports Esports Esports Fantasy and Esports Book \xef\x82\xaa Limited applicability The revenue model of existing esports businesses is limited to only using sponsored ads in game streams \xef\x82\xaa Gaming has already become a form of media content so there is a need for new and more interactive play that is more fun and rewarding \xef\x82\xaa The absence of standardized esports leagues and teams makes it difficult to analyze data and make a strategic choice in creating a virtual team in fact there is no firm that has succeeded in this area \xef\x82\xaa Existing sports i gaming companies have adopted esports betting in order to capture millennials but the gameplay is still simple predicting the outcome of the game \xef\x82\xaa Today\xe2\x80\x99s esports fantasy games that do not reflect the real time events (e g Kill Deaths and Assists) are not exciting enough to appeal millennials 12 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper 2 5 Why They Are Changing Now Just as social casinos have taken a strong foothold in the casino industry sports i gaming and fantasy sports are undergoing earthshaking changes brought on by explosive growth of esports Power of Free to Play Regulated U S iGaming vs Social Casino Market Online Casino (Unit

New Form of Social DFS 2018 (Source NJ DJE NV Control Board DE Lottery Company Reports Eilers Research LLC ) \xe2\x96\xaa Traditional on land casinos that are stuck in static growth have introduced social casinos as a way to attract millennials Social casinos now threaten to overthrow traditional casinos even attracting gaming companies to the industry \xe2\x96\xaa The sports industry is going through similar changes and esports are causing these changes to accelerate \xe2\x96\xaa As a result sports i gaming and fantasy sports companies must start providing more interactive user interfaces and game logics to give players the fun and exciting experience that they seek instead of focusing on the reward itself 13 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper 3 Innovations of RankingBall 3 1 What is RankingBall RankingBall is a play by play strategy prediction game We spent the last four years analyzing the pros and cons of fantasy sports sports i gaming and esports platforms in North America and Europe We took the data and worked to incorporate all the pros into one innovative gaming platform RankingBall quantifies the numerous real time events that happen in a game and reflects them in a scoring system In addition its interface is modeled after bingo one of the most popular games around the world reducing the learning curve for players to near zero 3 2 Market Solution and Leading Features \xef\x82\xaa With RankingBall players can easily connect their play by play predictions to live events on TV streamed online or mobile or in a stadium \xef\x82\xaa We are ready to disrupt the sports/esports gaming market by targeting millennials and focusing on their wants real time interaction more exciting and strategic game UI & logic optimized scoring & reward system and dynamic data visualization \xef\x82\xaa RankingBall is optimized to make the gameplay fun in and of itself rather than focusing solely on monetary rewards \xef\x82\xaa We\xe2\x80\x99re the first platform of our time to make real time interaction possible by integrating live data To do this we had to optimize each data source the game logic our scoring system and the broadcast delay for each sport and broadcaster Existing sports i gaming and fantasy sports have so far failed to do this \xef\x82\xaa The world\xe2\x80\x99s first esports real time data feed makes spectator gaming (second screen) possible This adds a new layer of fun to streaming \xef\x82\xaa Our new and innovative reward system and spectator games are built on a cryptocurrency economy \xef\x82\xaa Blockchain technology makes RankingBall\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized player matchmaking and rewards system possible These are integrated into smart contracts allowing RankingBall to expand into P2P skill matching games and create a new ecosystem for esports media game developers and ad sponsors 14 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper 3 3 Track Record \xef\x82\xaa RankingBall was originally developed as an interactive sports platform that brings together sports betting live streaming the fan community and marketing channels in partnership with sports media \xef\x82\xaa It was intended as a second screen prediction game where players could watch live events on mobile phones and participate in a real time betting for big events such as the Olympic Games World Cup Football etc \xef\x82\xaa RankingBall generated revenue by turning regular viewers into gamers and helping sports media gain wider viewership \xef\x82\xaa We applied the same business model to seasonal sports like baseball football(soccer) and basketball making RankingBall an independent platform in effect KBS Sochi Olympics landing page KBS Sochi app promotion page (http //olympic kbs co kr/sochi) (\xe2\x96\xb2 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics Service with

\xe2\x96\xaa Players can easily navigate the game using a familiar bingo card interface \xe2\x96\xaa RankingBall is applicable to nearly all forms of sports/esports and players/teams \xe2\x96\xaa We\xe2\x80\x99ve finished beta tests with traditional sports (baseball soccer basketball American football golf) and esports (LOL PUBG CS GO) Sports Bingo Game (\xe2\x96\xb2 2017 MLB Baseball and EPL

performance team and team events When the prediction is true the corresponding tile gets dubbed in real time Play By Play allowing you to track your progress against other contestants At the end of the event each contestant\xe2\x80\x99s rank is calculated based on the scores earned from the dubbed tiles and bingo scores (row column diagonals) Rewards are paid out in virtual money (RBS) cryptocurrency (RBG) or cash based on the contest type There are four contest types \xe2\x91\xa0 Tournament (ranked) \xe2\x91\xa1 Head to Head (1 on 1) \xe2\x91\xa2 Top 50 (top 50% win) \xe2\x91\xa3

the gameplay is the same as the sports bingo but reflects the unique rules and format of esports \xe2\x96\xaa Esports matches revolve around repetitive events like Kills Deaths and Assists whereas traditional sports have a wider variety of events which each happen less frequently \xe2\x96\xaa As a result repetitive events are assigned to a single tile When they happen successively a point multiplier is triggered Product Screenshot (Official Version) \xef\x82\xaa Sports Baseball and Football (Soccer) (\xe2\x96\xb2 2018 MLB Baseball Service Screenshot) 18 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper

\x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper 3 5 Competitive Advantages Technical Advantages We believe that RankingBall is at least two years ahead of our competition based on the last four years of development beta testing and current market dynamics \xef\x82\xaa Real time data Real time sports data feeds have only been around for a very short time Real time data feeds for esports don\xe2\x80\x99t exist yet Traditional fantasy sports and sports i gaming depend on post game data i e wins draws losses they fail to reflect live in game data Real time data feeds require immense data analysis cleaning and classification as live data often includes errors and changes Simulation data cannot capture these exceptions \xef\x82\xaa Real time Bingo Game Logic No other fantasy sports daily fantasy sports or esports games provide our unique bingo interface In order to reflect a live game in a bingo format participants must be able to strategically synergize the right players for the right times We spent years of trial and error creating a scoring system that takes into account the statistical occurrence and significance of in game events Additional R&D went into weaving in different aspects of different sports and events \xef\x82\xaa Data Classification Different data providers have different data formats and each data set has different depth price and speed We had to develop a thorough screening and testing process to weed out providers with invalid or unusable data Finding the right data provider for each sport requires one to two seasons of observation and testing An additional season is spent on developing and optimizing the platform for each valid data set 20 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper \xef\x82\xaa Latency for each media Each medium has a different latency or delay for live broadcasts even for the same event Typically it takes 10 to 15 seconds from on site recording to reach your TV screen and another 20 to 25 seconds for the data to be encoded and streamed online or on mobile apps RankingBall has made multiple tests to synchronize the data for our players We spent the last two years going to live sports events to test and develop a solution for the latency challenge In conclusion the technology that goes into the RankingBall platform requires years of data analysis field tests and iterations to optimize it for each sport This makes for a high barrier of entry for any potential competitors \xef\x82\xaa RankingBall Function & Data Flow (Source RankingBall IP \xe2\x80\x93 Function/Data Processing Flow) Business Advantages \xef\x82\xaa Upper hand on the competition Most sports i gaming and fantasy sports companies operate with very similar models (e g game logic reward structure and marketing strategy) The static market combined with established models make it hard for them to adjust and adopt new systems such as game interface logic rewards media relation etc The same is true for adopting new technologies like blockchain and real time data handling They lack basic understanding of and experience with social games (free to play) and what drives people to play them (fun over reward) They also lack expertise in live streaming and the use of a 21 \x0cRankingBall Gold White Paper second screen Real time betting platforms only work when every independent variable works together perfectly These variables include the interface game logic scoring and reward system and media partnerships RankingBall has successfully solved the aforementioned problems after years of trial and error and we are already preparing our services for real time interactive games social games esports and decentralized matching games with blockchain technology \xef\x82\xaa Win win relationships with major global partners We\xe2\x80\x99ve already secured partnerships with major sports media in Korea (KBS KBSN SBS) to run beta tests for baseball and soccer More sports including golf basketball and volleyball are in progress PlayerUnknown\ s Battle Grounds (PUBG) one of the hottest online games in the world right now has agreed to provide our services beginning in May 2018 This is a welcome addition to other major titles we have to offer including LOL DOTA2 and CS GO Synergy with local broadcasters and sports media ensures stable partnerships and efficient marketing Broadcasters benefit from more ad revenue driven by higher viewership and greater traffic Our services meet the needs for more interactive and engaging broadcasts for major outlets like ESPN CBS NBC and FOX (70% of premium members for these sport channels sign up to get an upper hand in fantasy sports) \xe2\x86\x92 RankingBall encourages live viewership leading to efficient mass marketing We can provide a white label product and share profits in partnership with major sports betting companies like Bet365 Betfair Bewin Fanduel and Draftkings \xe2\x86\x92 Targeted marketing for sports betting enthusiasts Easy access and potential partnerships with established

Paper 4 1 Token Issuance Objectives RankingBall has developed an innovative gaming platform which will disrupt the traditional sports and esports gaming industries This comes at an ideal time coinciding with the emergence of blockchain technology and the crypto economy which are acting as disruptors across a wide swath of industries Until now gaming companies have spent enormous time and money to comply with local rules regulations and licensing requirements related to gaming payments KYC and AML before they can launch their businesses By issuing our Ethereum based RankingBall Gold (RBG) token and linking our Ranking Ball Silver (RBS) virtual money to fiat currency we solve many of the issues related regulations across multiple regions This allows us to create a new player contest system with an entry fee and reward structure In addition to the in platform token economy RankingBall offers a loyalty program in partnership with external platforms with token economy We believe this will allow RankingBall to not only lead the sports/esports gaming frontier but also create a whole new ecosystem that connects gamers sports/esports media and game developer/publisher 4 2
