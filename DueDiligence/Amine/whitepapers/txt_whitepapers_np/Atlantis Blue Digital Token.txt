WHO WE ARE We are the miners that extract the stones We are the artisan workers that polish and craft the stones We are the distributors that take the stones to the market For many years our families have been in the same line of work and now it is our turn to carry on and find a better way forward for the benefit of all parties involved including the customers 2 WHY WE CAME ABOUT We united as a group (Miners Association Artisans Association Channel Distributors & Exporters etc ) under the banner of The Atlantis Blue Project to self regulate and add positive control measures in order to ameliorate the conditions in our community which are negatively affected by a few problems that will be addressed in this document and which we believe are the cause for the lack of progress in all of our livelihoods In our group you will find lawyers miners artisans distributors biologists certified accountants Cooperative Of Larimar Services La Filipinas Cooperative Of Bahoruco Larimar Association Las Mercedes and many more persons or entities that will remain behind the bright lights but nevertheless will contribute greatly to the success of this project This document does not

STONES OF ATLANTIS EXCHANGE 3 OUR PHYSICAL ASSET Larimar is a blue pectolite and an extremely rare gemstone It can only be found in one location in the whole planet a mountain which used to be a relatively inaccessible area in the province of Barahona of the Dominican Republic The first mention of the stone is in a request to mine Larimar in 1916 however it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until 1974 that the stone really made its day view In 1974 Norman Rilling a member of the U S Peace Corps and Miguel M\xc3\xa9ndez a Dominican found pieces of Larimar on the seashore The name Larimar was created by Mendez who combined his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s first name Larissa with the Spanish word for sea Mar Local inhabitants of the region and their ancestors had long been aware of the stone Early theories suggested that Larimar was produced by the sea and later it was discovered that it is a product of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s volcanic movements Island legends said that the stones could be collected easily on the beach but one day there were no more blue Larimar stones left Locals explored upstream and found a rock formation which appeared to be the source of the blue stone This legend holds truth Mendez and Rilling in 1974 would follow a river upstream and find sources of the blue stone Most small blocks of Larimar are in situ meaning they exist in the very place where they formed However due to soil erosion some pieces brake off and are moved by rainfall down the slopes of the hillsides to rivers The river deposit them in the Caribbean sea and this is why some pieces wash up on the seashore The Larimar stone is formed when hot gases push crystallized minerals up though volcanic tubes In order to mine and excavate the stone miners must identify these tubes and dig deeper and deeper into old volcanoes Larimar most popular use is in jewelry but natural healers\xe2\x80\x99 penchant for the stone only serve to increase the demand Larimar is considered a healing stone that is said to be finely tuned to the human body particularly to the throat area It is said that it increases speech and communication skills and This document does not constitute or form part of any offer invitation or solicitation of any investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering invitation or purchase of securities in any jurisdiction \x0csupports the body\xe2\x80\x99s natural healing process Larimar is also known as the Atlantis Stone or the Blue Stones Of Atlantis because of Edgar Cayce the famous sleeping prophet who was a Spiritual master that lived in Trinidad and Tobago and founded many Yoga Centers across the world He claimed that some islands in the Caribbean including the Dominican Republic were part of the lost continent of Atlantis He went further to say that on one of those islands a blue stone with healing powers would be found a description that corresponds to Larimar Today there are thousands of people naturalists and persons practicing alternative and holistic healing methods who use Larimar to assist and reinforce healing processes Larimar\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful blue color is often considered the embodiment of the beautiful blue colors of the sea and sky found in the Caribbean Its origin and appearance are but two small attributes that are helping spread the Larimar fever around the world 4 STELLAR NETWORK OUR DIGITAL HOME Our home will be the Stellar network To find out more about Stellar please visit this link Stellar is an open platform for building financial products and applications to connect the world After much research we decided that Stellar was the perfect digital platform to launch our tokens due to its reputation and secure network Unlike many of their competitors their infrastructure is ready to deal with scalability issues and the price per transaction is very attractive This document does not constitute or form part of any offer invitation or solicitation of any investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering invitation or purchase of securities in any jurisdiction \x0c5 OUR DIGITAL TOKEN Atlantis Blue Digital Tokens or ABDT for short is the name of our token / digital coin We have given much thought to the number of coins we would create and after many discussions the group agreed that it would be best to hand majority control to the free market as soon possible This is the reason that we are selling 75% of the tokens during the initial ICO phase The coin breakdown is as follows Total number of tokens 400 000 000 Number of tokens to be sold during 1st ICO 300 000 000 1 TOKEN = 1 GRAM OF LARIMAR of *AVERAGE* GRADE (AA+) We speak of the Average Grade of Larimar because like other semi precious gems it has different ratings AAA+ is the highest grade and A represents the lowest (AAA+ AAA AA+ AA A) In order to protect Atlantis Blue Digital Token holders future coin offerings will never be sold at a discount The selling price will always be whatever the market has established at that point in time 6 MISSION Our mission first and foremost is to create value for our token holders Second our purpose is to make sure that those that work the hardest get a fair share of the revenue this economy generates This document does not constitute or form part of any offer invitation or solicitation of any investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering invitation or purchase of securities in any jurisdiction \x0c7 PROBLEM As Larimar becomes more popular so have the old unethical problems that plague the mining industry of precious and semi precious stones The proliferation of fake blue stones (Larimar) the illegal exportation of the gems the price discrepancies in the international market are the ones we aim to quickly fix 8 SOLUTION After the ICO of the Atlantis Blue Digital Tokens we will be able to accomplish many things The first thing we will do is build and establish the AB Warehouse (Atlantis Blue Warehouse) which will be the single point of receivership of the stones from the mines This will make sure that there are no leakage into the black market and prevent the illegal exportation and smuggling of the rough stones The stones will be brought in weighted and graded before they take their next journey on to the artisan camp Absolutely no sales will be made from this locale The second step we will take is to build the AB Artisan Camp This will be the single point of legalization for the stones through the cutting and polishing (it is illegal to sell the rough stones) After this process the stones will enter a legal status for sale and international distribution This will ensure that the Artisan Worker Association have job security since the stones must past through this station before they see the market It is here also where most of the stones will be stored The final step that we will take is to build the Atlantis Blue Exchange This will be the single point of distribution for the local and international market Aside from the organization that this will bring to our sector one of the most important benefits is that our community will finally be This document does not constitute or form part of any offer invitation or solicitation of any investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering invitation or purchase of securities in any jurisdiction \x0cat the forefront of the payment activity thus ensuring that the miners get a fair portion of the revenue generated by the sale of the stones and tokens The Atlantis Blue Exchange will also serve as the sole registry for authorize resellers Customers will be able to check the resellers\xe2\x80\x99 websites to verify that they are an Authorize Atlantis Blue Dealer This seal will link back to our website\xe2\x80\x99s registry and confirm the status of the resellers We believe we can accomplish all of the above tasks within three months of the ICO\xe2\x80\x99s completion 9 DYNAMICS OF OUR ECONOMY Consumption of the blue stones have more than tripled over the last two years alone Obviously this has caused a price appreciation in the international market Although it is common to have the physical form of an asset dictate the price of its digital form we have decided to reverse this trend and let the digital form of the asset dictate the price of the physical one Reason for this decision is that we predict that the digital consumption of Larimar will represent 90% of the market and therefore it is prudent to have the bigger market decide its price When someone buys Atlantis Blue Digital Tokens in essence they are purchasing one gram of Larimar in rough form This gram is going to make its way from the mines to the Atlantis Blue Warehouse then to the AB Artisan Camp and finally to the Atlantis Blue Exchange Should a token holder decide to exchange his tokens for blue stones there are two ways to get it done 1 Token holder sends request to the AB Exchange and transfers the amount of tokens that he or she would like to the exchange (2)The AB Exchange will then deduct 18% from the total value of the tokens This represent the sales tax that must be paid to the This document does not constitute or form part of any offer invitation or solicitation of any investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering invitation or purchase of securities in any jurisdiction \x0c2 3 Dominican Government and then it will ship the remaining value in Larimar It is also important to know that the shipping will be deducted from the total value of the tokens as well as any insurance the customer wishes to add onto the shipment Token holder shows up in person at the AB Exchange in the Dominican Republic then transfers his tokens to us we will then continue the process as outline after (2) in step one above Tokens that are exchanged for blue stones of Atlantis will be segregated for accountability purposes and will never be reissued or resold again There will be an 8% administration fee when the exchange is done remotely and a 6% fee when the exchange is done physically This cost is used for the upkeep of the Atlantis Blue Exchange 10 CONCLUSION The Larimar market is already a multi million dollar industry and with your support of the asset based token not only do we believe that the value and appreciation will increase but it will also help ensure that those at the point of origin of this entire ecosystem get an equal share of the bounty The mining operations of this project have been active since 1971 Thanks to the technology brought forward by the crypto community we will now be able to greatly enhance these operations and fix the problems that have been keeping it from further development This document does not constitute or form part of any offer invitation or solicitation of any
