Results 63 Distribution Pattern of Tokens 64 1 \x0cThe Problem The problem is captured and explained by Nobel prize winning economist George Akerlof in his 1970 paper The Market for \ Lemons\ Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism In the paper he describes the mechanics of markets where one party (the sellers) know significantly more about the product than the other party (the buyers) This is also known as markets with asymmetric information The used car market is an example of this When selling a car the seller typically knows significantly more about the vehicle than the buyer This is a problem for the buyer as it opens them up to potential fraud To hedge against the risk of buying a so called \xe2\x80\x98bad\xe2\x80\x99 car they reduce the price they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to pay for the vehicle This could lead to the entire used car market to disappear Here\ s how it happens o A buyer cannot fully distinguish a good car from a bad one so they lower the amount they are willing to pay for the vehicle to compensate for possible unknown risks This reduces the average price of the vehicle 2 \x0co This leads to higher priced \xe2\x80\x98good\xe2\x80\x99 cars to leave the market deteriorating the overall quality of the secondary market o The repercussion is a further reduction in price of available vehicles As a result \xe2\x80\x98medium\xe2\x80\x99 quality cars are also pushed out of the market o If the cycle continues the quality of available cars will continue to deteriorate until the buyers pull out of the market completely This is due to the perception that all second hand vehicles are of poor quality o As a result this will lead to the complete disappearance of the market and can only be stopped by introducing more symmetrical information This is the nature of markets with asymmetric information The Solution VINchain A survey conducted among market participants indicated a need for access to reliable secure and transparent historic operational vehicle data 3 \x0cThe VINchain project fills this need and solves the problem of asymmetrical information in the used car market by creating a decentralized immutable transparent secure and reliable vehicle lifecycle repository VINchain is a decentralized blockchain database that records all relevant information pertaining to vehicles For each vehicle a blockchain passport is issued which will be stored in a distributed registry VINchain is also capable of producing reports that can be ordered immediately by buyers sellers and other market participants Information about the vehicle is accumulated in the databases of all system participants (manufacturers insurance companies service stations banks and leasing companies dealers etc ) during the entire period of its use The blockchain passport of the vehicle is connected to the vehicle identification number (VIN) and placed in the VINchain blockchain system This information is transparent and accessible to everyone with access to the system To protect the accuracy of information the blockchain technology and data hashing through the SHA 256 cryptographic algorithm (sha 2 family) is used This guarantees reliability and security of data 4 \x0cEvery day hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold around the world and each buyer wants reliable information about the technical condition of the car This is an important safety security and financial issue Unfortunately there is no single database of vehicles Though there are commercial databases they do not solve this problem as their information is stored centrally and there is a risk of inaccuracy Commercial databases are closed and do not exchange information As a result the buyer of the car risks their own safety and financial loss The VINchain project plans to attract international consulting agencies to the system audit which will produce a detailed report of the reliability of the information provided by VINchain The mechanics of the VINchain system work as follows A request for data is received The entire chain is searched for relevant data Reports are created and provided in a structured form Members of the relevant registry receives a fee for providing information Buyers and sellers of used vehicles will both benefit from the removal of information asymmetry on the used car market Knowing all of the information available on a given vehicle will create trust in the process and the buyer will potentially be willing to pay more For the seller disclosing the 5 \x0ccomplete history of the vehicle may increase the value of the car at the time of sale If buyers know the full operational history of the vehicle they have a guarantee that the vehicle retains a certain level of value The same cannot be said about a vehicle with no report This concept can be demonstrated with the following example A buyer has to choose between two identical vehicles one with a full operational history report and one without In this scenario the buyer is likely to choose the vehicle with the full operational report over the other even in cases that the report indicates past damage and/or repairs This is due to the report providing an accurate reflection of the vehicle\ s history Every market participant has the right to know the true history of a vehicle being sold The VINchain project will fill this niche to the benefit of all In the future this technology can be scaled to segments of the fixed asset market such as yachts construction machinery and real estate 6 \x0cProject Goals Change the global market of used cars by making it honest transparent reliable with equal access to information for each participant Project Objectives 1 Create a block with different levels of access and information protection Data security access level should meet the needs of government agencies 2 Unite participants in the automotive industry such as manufacturers insurance companies dealers service stations and developers of navigation systems into a single ecosystem for data exchange purposes 3 Create an infrastructure and provide direct access to the database for each market participant 7 \x0cVINchain Team Everyone in our team is

in the mobile app When the registration is approved the buyer is allowed to check the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s Blockchain passport availability by entering the VIN number of the vehicle The service provider verifies the Buyer\xe2\x80\x99s request by checking the availability of the data in all service providers\xe2\x80\x99 databases and gives the Buyer a short report free of charge This short free report is a preview of the quantity of information that is contained inside the full report If the buyer is satisfied with the abbreviated report they can proceed and purchase the full report If the Buyer decides to make a purchase they pay with a pre defined method of payment and in turn receive the full version of the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s Blockchain passport 26 \x0cBasic Usage and Client Economics VINchain intends to implement a token to smooth the processing of car information queries on the VINchain system An end user will pay VIN tokens in exchange for all information related to a VIN number that is available onchain The information queries are designed to rely on extremely simple token economics for the client facing aspects of the payment system In order to have a successful token system it is necessary to leverage simple economics Widespread adoption of any system comes most easily when the process is simple enough for end users to easily understand and trust it For a user that wishes to retrieve information from the VINchain system the transactional costs will always be in VIN tokens In addition it is a long term goal of the project to leverage the economic control of having a usage coin in order to reach a stable token price relative to traditional state backed currencies Market volatility should be linked to the fluctuation of car history data and not speculation The VINchain token will primarily be a usage or utility token leveraged to create a stable transaction rate and to allow fluid fee payments and profit distributions for all information providers Unlike traditional vehicle history options it will be possible for certified mechanics and other participants in the chain of control to submit car information that would previously have been overlooked due to lack of insurance reporting As more information providers are verified VINchain will allow for more widely crowdsourced information on vehicle histories 27 \x0cInformation Provider Economics When a user exchanges a token for information on a vehicle all active participants in the network are compensated with part of the token Initially token allocation will primarily be linked to events An event is anything specific that has happened to a vehicle Events include things like change of ownership and accidents Every time a user is provided with information on a vehicle they are given the option to indicate whether the information is useful We believe that a binary decision on value or utility allows for a more user friendly experience while generating even more data Long term algorithms will be designed to find similarities in useful information in order to accurately determine fee allocation for information providers To achieve this a modular oracle element needs to be established off chain to report on the value of an event at any time As previously stated this will initially value all events equally until a large enough store of data has been established and an effective algorithm has been determined Once events are weighted dynamically using an algorithm that determines their usefulness individual information providers will be compensated proportionally to the value of information they Until then a similar proportion will be used for all events Only the first provider will be compensated An additional transaction fee will be levied for each information query (10%) 28 \x0cVINchain App During the process of development a mobile application and website will be created for dealers insurance companies and manufacturers in addition to a flexible API The application will have extensive utility as it will provide users with the best offers on car maintenance discounts on service and even assist in refueling and washing Additionally the app will help find a vehicle in a huge parking lot or even remotely control their vehicle The application will also collect statistics pertaining to personal driving style tell the user how to drive more economically and offer discounts on insurance premiums Keeping all of this collected information on the blockchain will confirm its reliability and allow owners to increase the value of their car at the time of sale 29 \x0cThe website will be a portal for companies marketplace to create that will an ideal contain all relevant information pertaining to any vehicle including usage statistics and history reports The site will also give users the ability to interact with all of the participants of the VINchain ecosystem By having access to this information contractors will be able to send customers only those offers that are relevant and genuinely interesting to them Dealers will be able to better analyze vehicles they are considering to acquire with access to full genuine verifiable history reports Because users are prompted by maintenance reminders the system will also increase the amount of vehicle maintenance service requests These tools will enable you to do the following 1 Use a wide range of opportunities to analyze consumer data and behavior in order to leverage sales activities get comprehensive customer satisfaction reports engage new customers and improve the loyalty of existing ones 2 Get predictive data of the next dealer visit in order to raise the effectiveness of timing of the vehicle service proposal 30 \x0c3 Drive the content in the application to improve consumer communication and increase spare parts sales Control of Information Transmitted by Users In order to create a system with full transparency users (vehicle drivers) will be able to control the following \xe2\x80\xa2 Determine the category of information they share \xe2\x80\xa2 Adjust the frequency at which the information is collected \xe2\x80\xa2 Choose which offers and discounts are interesting and relevant to them and their needs 31 \x0cFunctions of the Mobile Application for Users \xe2\x80\xa2 Earn Tokens Users will earn tokens through normal everyday use of their

history of loyalty discounts from all our partners The process of rewarding users with tokens receiving and confirming information 34 \x0cAs part of data management we are developing a special website for dealers auto manufacturers (OEMs) companies that analyze data to improve road safety and insurance companies This website will allow users to analyze a large amount of data and compile custom reports on the use of a vehicle Artificial Intelligence creates incredible opportunities for reading and analyzing data coming from different sources The system will help increase sales growth reduce costs for mechanics and increase efficiency We will collect information about customers\xe2\x80\x99 preferences and provide recommendations in real time Opportunities for OEMs and companies analyzing

website more convenient for your needs Possibilities regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning Since we will collect vehicle data from a large number of sources and offer various services and cars for purchase in our application we will be able to analyze the user\ s interest driving style choice of service stations and use of discounts Using this data we can help to increase revenue by offering drivers from different categories specific sets of products and services including appropriate accessories new cars and assistance with future service visits With the help of data analysis by artificial intelligence and machine learning marketing data will be available in a structured form which is convenient for use and analysis This will help to create similar segments of users analyze their use of tokens to obtain discounts and payments and obtain reliable data on the use of the car which cannot be changed or modified 36 \x0cOpportunities for insurance companies According to McKinsey & Company between 5 and 10 percent of all claims worldwide are fraudulent Dishonest insured customers commit fraudulent accidents having agreed in advance with repair shops to eventually receive compensation According to the FBI spending on non health insurers exceeds $40 billion per annum Appeals and claims management forms 39% of total insurance costs Most insurance companies use secret methods to manage claims These factors often lead to inefficiency in transaction costs Analyzing the user\xe2\x80\x99s driving style history of breakage and frequency of accidents insurance companies will be able to provide personalized insurance terms We are developing a special scoring system that will allow us to assess the risk of the occurrence of an insured event as well as provide the API of the system for the implementation of data for insurance companies Due to this insurance companies will be able to provide a discount on the basis of their analysis directly to the client in their application The use of blockchain technology will help alleviate fraud By obtaining a VINchain vehicle report data can be found in real time Moreover such requests can be paid for with VIN tokens Insurance companies in turn will be rewarded for adding data on insured events 37 \x0cDue to this insurance companies will be able to reduce the processing costs of claims Opportunities for manufacturers of spare parts 1 Increase transparency in monitoring spare parts warranties 2 Reduction of refunds for fraudulent purposes Opportunities for dealers \xe2\x80\xa2 Dealers who are working with us in regards to information about car maintenance will earn VIN tokens These tokens will allow dealers to order vehicle reports (that are confirmed by the blockchain system) provided by our partners or sell these tokens on the exchange and receive additional revenue \xe2\x80\xa2 By utilizing the website dealers will gain additional leads in addition to a novel channel of communication with clients \xe2\x80\xa2 The use of a vehicle history report based on VINchain information will replace outdated and expensive reports from Carfax This saves money and improves the user confidence in the analyzed information encouraging the user to increase the resale value of the car 38 \x0cReducing the cost of maintaining additional infrastructure \xe2\x80\xa2 Due to constant connection with the Internet through the user\ s smartphone and updated updates received from the car the user does not need to call the dealer to analyze errors or update software In the era of digital technology and dependence on software this is a very important aspect of reducing costs along with the number of necessary professionals \xe2\x80\xa2 We will also offer permanent additional services such as updating maps and other functions of the car Opportunities for auto classified sites With the click of a button a seller will be able to provide a completely transparent history report for their car confirmed by VINchain This is extremely convenient for both buyers and sellers Even more importantly users will be able to choose the report provider that is most attractive to them 39 \x0cFlexible API The massive amount of data received and analyzed can be utilized in a variety of ways With this in mind we are developing a flexible API Write to us to find out more Such a huge amount of data brings up the question of data storage security The VINchain blockchain system will effortlessly cope with this task Each data request will be trackable and users will be able to trace down a party initiating the request a number of requests and a content of the request The artificial intelligence will be able to determine hacker attacks based on requests * Not available for all VINchain devices 40 \x0cConfirming data in partner reports One of the most important areas of our team\ s work is the improvement of car history reports There are many services that provide reports on the history of vehicles By joining the VINchain community the user will get the most complete and reliable biography of a vehicle and we will confirm the information with each of our partners Technical Breakdown Program Platform Graphene is a technology which is used for various Blockchain systems (Steem Bitshares Golos etc ) The Graphene platform is focused on the usage of third generation cryptographic secure decentralized registers which is blockchain 3 0 Graphene based systems are much more effective in performance than older generations such as generation 1 0 Bitcoin based systems or even generation 2 0 41 \x0cThe consensus algorithm \xe2\x80\x98Delegated Proof of Stake\xe2\x80\x99 or DPoS is extremely effective and is maximally secure Advantages of DPoS Protocol efficiency limits are up to 100 000 transactions per second The formation of a new block takes 3 seconds as compared to 10 minutes for Bitcoin Low transaction fees which get reduced even further in proportion to the growth of the token price Low ecological (electricity) and maintenance costs Anonymous voting mechanism Dynamic account privileges (allows to make a multilevel hierarchy) Token description The VINchain token is a utility token VINchain tokens do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake share security or equivalent rights or any right to receive dividends other payments intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the project described in this white paper and/or in VINchain or any of its affiliates 42 \x0cThe holders of VINchain token are only entitled to use VINchain products as described in this document if successfully developed or to resell the tokens Data Formation and it\xe2\x80\x99s Storage All the records from data providers is hashed and added into Blockchain Data providers hash their records and add it into Blockchain themselves signed by EDS Such a mechanism allows excluding any side parties from the chain what makes the service and data trustworthy for the final consumer The data itself is stored in service providers\xe2\x80\x99 databases but its hash in the Blockchain The validity of the information provided can be checked by the hash code Data hashing and adding it into the Blockchain makes it secure the Blockchain receives the data hashed the data hashed is signed with EDS hashed again compound into blocks These blocks are signed with EDS and hashed The decentralization makes the system even more secure The data providers are united into a single system (nods) and store their up to date hash copies of each service provider 43 \x0cThe decentralization makes it possible to restore the data from any other system participant in case of data loss The final consumers will not suffer from such kind situation as it also guaranties 24/7 access to the system The utility of the VIN token categorized by product VINchain App A person(s) who utilizes the VINchain app (\xe2\x80\x9cusers\xe2\x80\x9d) can earn VIN tokens in exchange for the information that they contribute to the VINchain system The users receive a small amount of VIN tokens every time their information is utilized by a participant in the network Utilizing a wallet users are able to provide access to their data to third parties \xe2\x80\x93 in exchange for tokens Service or product providers (\xe2\x80\x9cbusinesses\xe2\x80\x9d) need to send VIN tokens to the users in order to acquire access to the users information and to extend various offers pertaining to their business (e g insurance offers) The users will have the ability to acquire aforementioned services or products from these businesses by utilizing VIN tokens (or other crypto or FIAT currency) as a medium of exchange VINchain Reports A participant in the network has the ability to acquire a vehicle report about a particular car using the VIN tokens (or other crypto or FIAT currency) In this case the VIN tokens are needed in order to create a clear and decentralized 44 \x0creward system in which the value of a report is pegged to a normalized value e g VIN token VINchain API A person or a company will be able to acquire access to the VINchain API and thus get direct access the VINchain system by utilizing VIN tokens (or other crypto or FIAT currency) This will allow individuals and businesses to easily integrate our data into their systems VINchain White Label Approved data providers will be able to prove reliable VINchain information to their clients with the help of tokens VINchain Immutable Database To stop malicious attacks on the system and to prevent any manipulation of the information the access to the system will be available only after the payment with the tokens VINchain does not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9ctransferable security\xe2\x80\x9d for the above purposes VINchain tokens serve as a utility and only provide the opportunity to access the VINchain system The aim of the VINchain token is to make it possible for individuals and businesses to acquire access to reliable information as well as goods and services 45 \x0cHow to work with the VINchain service After authorization the service provider performs a request for a report by accessing the VINchain service via the API interface Upon receipt of the request the VINchain service performs a search for information using the VIN code of the car in the databases of VINchain service providers Each record will contain specific details on the information provider date VIN number accident reports change in ownership information and any other data on the use of the car In addition each record in the report will have two fixed hashes Once the user submits an information request they receive a preliminary check report to conform the availability of data on the specific vehicle The user then makes a payment using VIN tokens to receive a full access to all available information 46 \x0cScheme of interaction 47 \x0cVerification of the reliability of the information in the reports Each data provider will be able to get and add the information with the help of unique access certificate verified by the Project In addition there will be the 48 \x0cdata rating for each data provider As a result the provider will take responsibility for any information added Each data provider will be awarded with VIN tokens depending on the rating Information in the database of each service provider of the VINchain system is continuously hashed using the cryptographic algorithm SHA 256* and is recorded to the database In order to confirm the invariability of the information stored in the database of each service provider the VINchain service places the records hashes in the VINchain blockchain according to the rules with the use of the timestamp of the record The user receives a vehicle report connected to the VIN number The report contains all the information from all databases of all service providers in the VINchain system When generating a request for a VIN number the VINchain system parses information from the service provider databases then performs hashing of each record along with the entire report using the SHA 256 crypto algorithm If the hash of the provided record is identical to the hash of the record stored in the VINchain blockchain the information was not changed if the hashes are different the information provided is compromised ** ** By default the members of the service are not allowed to change the already entered data on the car whatever it is but with the help of 49 \x0ccryptography and blockchain technology we provide a guaranteed confirmation of the invariability of the information * The SHA 2 hash functions were developed by the US National Security Agency and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies in the Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS PUB 180 2 in August 2002 This standard also included the hash function SHA 1 developed in 1995 In February 2004 SHA 224 was added to the FIPS PUB 180 2 In October 2008 a new edition of the standard was issued \xe2\x80\x93 FIPS PUB 180 3 In March 2012 the latest version of FIPS PUB 180 4 was issued which included SHA 512/256 and SHA 512/224 functions based on SHA 512 (since SHA 512 works faster on 64 bit architectures than SHA 256) In July 2006 the standard RFC 4634 Secure Hash Algorithms of the USA (SHA and HMAC SHA) describing SHA 1 and the SHA 2 family was issued In July 2006 the standard RFC 4634 Secure Hash Algorithms of the USA (SHA and HMAC SHA) describing SHA 1 and the SHA 2 family was issued The National Security Agency issued a patent for SHA 2 under a royalty free license on behalf of the state Hash functions of the SHA 2 family were built on the basis of the Merkle\xe2\x80\x93 Damgard structure 50 \x0cThe initial message after the addition is divided into blocks each block by 16 words The algorithm passes each message block through a loop with 64 or 80 iterations (rounds) At each iteration two words are converted the rest of the words set the conversion function The results of processing each block are summed and this result is the value of the hash function Initialization of the internal state is the result of processing the previous block It is not possible to process blocks and to sum results independently Algorithms of the SHA 2 family (SHA 22 SHA 256 SHA 384 SHA 512 SHA512/256 and SHA 512/224) are allowed by the US law for use in some government applications including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols to protect information that does not have the stamp of secrecy The standard also allows the use of SHA 2 by private and commercial companies Economic Functions T The current request price current plans are to have this usage fee cost 1 VIN tokens NX The value ranking of event x attached to a specific VIN number X The event identification number the system generates these internally 51 \x0c\xe2\x88\x91N The sum of all value rankings of all events attached to a specific VIN number F The network maintenance fee each transaction incurs a fee to support future VINchain costs Data Storage and Access Every time the end user makes a request they pay T and have their front end populated with an easily navigable visualization of the event set for the requested VIN Events are stored off chain to tackle scalability issues and on chain functionality is reserved for (a) value transfer (b) data confirmation (c) event payout information and (d) hashes storage One of the advantages of car event history is that reported events should never be deleted or updated which allows for optimized read access upon payment 52 \x0cSmart contract When the report is formed VINchain forms and places the Smart Contract into the Blockchain attached to the VIN number The Smart Contract defines the payouts to the service providers based on the amount of data provided and its value The data providers sign the contract with a help of the poll (DPoS) The service provider (the report submitter) forms the payment transaction for Blockchainpassport and VINchain service provides the report The Smart Contract starts at the moment of Blockchain passport receiving what forms payout transactions for data providers which supplied the records The data provider sends the final consumer the vehicle history report in the most suitable form 53 \x0cUsage in
