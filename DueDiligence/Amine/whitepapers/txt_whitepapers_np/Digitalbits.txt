b Crossing the Chasm Enhancing Cryptocurrency Adoption by Leveraging a Transaction and Trading Layer for the Points Economy and Other Digital Assets Whitepaper Version 2 3 June 14 2019 Al Burgio Founder of DigitalBits aburgio@digitalbits io Abstract Blockchain technology is promoted as one of the great technological advances of our time and considered as a solution to many of the technical problems faced by industries in sectors such as finance automobile and retail Despite growing attention and utilization mass adoptions of cryptocurrencies has not happened yet So how do we cross the chasm from the vision phase to the actual use phase To do so blockchain technology has to target a pre existing legacy market that already posses billions of user accounts globally in a digital asset category Not to create a competing tokenize digital asset but instead to transform these legacy digital assets into tokens on a public blockchain with key functionality that benefits both consumers and the enterprise issuers of these digital assets This whitepaper fills the gap in the state of the art by presenting the DigitalBits blockchain powered infrastructure that builds a bridge facilitating the implementation of new technologies to support and enhance our every day life interactions as well as foster blockchain mass adoption The DigitalBits blockchain allows for easy asset tokenization using a transaction and trading layer for the point economy We present a loyalty and reward points focused running case detail the advantages of the system outline the requirements and goals as well as the architecture of the DigitalBits network and ecosystem In addition we present the on boarding process of digital assets and the asset tokenization which is an indispensable functionality of our platform Furthermore we introduce the novel idea of the token name certification service (TNCS) that prevents malicious network entities from issuing and distributing illegitimate tokens of assets that they are not associated with Finally we present the XDB token value proposition and the surrounding token economy ecosystem that fuels the platform Keywords Loyalty Programs Currency Digital Assets Tokenization Payment Remittance Blockchain Smart Contract Points Economy Brands DigitalBits \x0c2 1 Introduction The vision for cryptocurrencies has been embraced by many people around the world In 2017 the world saw a surge in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) with associated whitepapers that has driven tremendous enthusiasm for the futurist possibilities of blockchain technology and utility tokens [3][43] However as the end of 2018 is near many people are beginning to wonder When will many of these cryptocurrencies and utility tokens begin to gain wide real world use and adoption How do we cross the chasm from the vision phase to the actual use phase To do so blockchain technology has to target a pre existing legacy market that already posses billions of user accounts globally in a digital asset category Not to create a competing tokenize digital asset but instead to transform these legacy digital assets into tokens on a public blockchain with key functionality that benefits both consumers and the enterprise issuers of these digital assets Loyalty and rewards points (LRPs) presents a unique opportunity as the first digital asset category to leverage the DigitalBits blockchain and help drive mass growth of cryptocurrency adoption Such programs are established means to improve customer engagement and brand awareness Needless to say due to their recognized and tremendous potential these membership programs spread across several industries as for example travel retail financial services and so on A successful loyalty and reward program ensures that a customer keeps returning to a specific brand in order to make purchases and subsequently earn reward points thereby building loyalty and retaining customers over the years At the same time companies that effectively create launch and run loyalty programs underline their commitment to long term relationships with their customers [29] A 2014 report suggests that 91% of companies employ some form of customer engagement or loyalty program [18] resulting in 3 8 billion individual loyalty program memberships just in the United States [12] The average U S household participates in 29 different loyalty programs [11] whereas in the UK the average customer is a member of more than 14 different loyalty programs [14] According to a report from 2017 the estimated overall corporate liability for loyalty points exceeded $100 billion thereby representing a new unsurpassed high and an enormous business potential [6] However despite the widespread availability of these programs only a small fraction of their potential is used Consumers are generally discouraged by unnecessary barriers to accumulate and redeem their points and by changes to program rules or rewards Hence users get easily frustrated and millions of points are unredeemed Furthermore the lack of transferability and portability of most LRP programs affects their perceived value by customers since they are unable to transfer or trade those points at any time for other points they desire Of the $48 billion in total perceived value of points and miles issued in 2010 in the U S about $16 billion worth of LRPs were left unused [20] It is important to note that it is not just the customers putting up with the downsides of current state of the art solutions Loyalty program providers have high entry barriers to set up their own reward program Once they have created their own program providers suffer from high costs of maintenance Moreover even if they wish \x0c3 to achieve a certain level of compatibility with another membership program the underlying infrastructure is often incompatible Hence a more holistic and interoperable solution is required Blockchain technology also referred to as distributed ledger system is most noticeably known for providing the foundation of the peer to peer (P2P) cryptocurrency and payment system Bitcoin [34] but nowadays there a various different platforms out there e g [25][39][48] In the context of LRP programs blockchains have the potential to enable interoperable and holistic platforms for the next generation of loyalty programs Blockchain based LRPs can be easily transferred and redeemed even across other businesses or services In addition LRPs become interchangeable and can be exchanged for other loyalty points or even fiat currencies Finally a blockchain based solution significantly reduce development integration reconciliation and security costs for the program providers In recent times nearly a dozen companies announced their intent to launch blockchain based LRP programs to encourage customer engagement [38] However most of them merely translate the legacy LRP programs into a blockchain based solution with separated data silos and a lack of interoperability Others are built on first generation blockchains such as Bitcoin and therefore suffer technological downsides such as high transaction fees limited scripting languages or missing scalability In contrast we envision a solution that is not only limited to ease the creation transfer and exchange of LRPs on a blockchain but also offer an easy to use platform which allows the tokenization of all kinds of assets at the mere click of a button This as a result fosters the mass market adoption of blockchain technology This whitepaper addresses the detected gap by introducing the DigitalBits blockchain thereby answering the question of how to enable easy asset tokenization using a transaction and trading layer for the point economy In order to answer this question with a separation of concerns we pose the following sub questions What are the goals and requirements of such a system What is the architecture of the DigitalBits asset tokenization platform What are the system engagement processes for the stakeholders What is the long term vision of DigitalBits The remainder of this paper is structured as follows Section 2 introduces background information a running case as well as related work Section 3 focuses on defining functional as well as quality goals and the requirements of the DigitalBits system together with the positioning of stakeholders Next Section 4 analyses and outlines the resulting system architecture that we derive from the requirements Section 5 expands on the system engagement processes for the stakeholders Finally Section 6 concludes this work 2 Technical Background and Running Case In Section 2 1 we provide an introduction into LRP programs Afterwards Section 2 2 presents an exemplary use case \xe2\x80\x93 HotelBrand \xe2\x80\x93 that we use as a running case to detail the DigitalBits framework and solution throughout the rest of the \x0c4 paper Next the state of the art on blockchain based LRP solutions is presented in Section 2 3 2 1 Loyalty and Reward Points Programs LRPs are a means adopted by companies and brands to engage the consumer repeatedly develop a long standing relationship with the consumer and encourage the consumer to choose a particular set of products offered by a brand (or a group of brands) over other brands offering similar products In the current landscape there are two types of LRP programs One is a single business program in which the points are issued by the same business such as the Advantage program of American Airlines and Starbucks Rewards or Starbucks The second type is a multi business program in which the points issuer is a third party For example LoyaltyOne and its Air Miles program or Payback in Germany A variety of companies and brands have applied these LRP programs Studies show that roughly 80% of Americans belong to some type of reward program [47] The average US household belongs to 29 loyalty programs [5] and 71% of loyalty program members say that they are open to joining more programs [42] There were 3 8 billion individual loyalty memberships in the US in 2017 and 175 million loyalty memberships in Canada in 2016 [19] These figures reflect a 15% growth in the U S and 35% growth in Canada since 2014 2 2 Running Case HotelBrand is a fictional flourishing chain of hotels with a global presence Similar to other hotel chains HotelBrand has an ongoing loyalty program with roughly 30 million customers and approximately 40 billion points in circulation However owing to the fiercely competitive hospitality market HotelBrand is currently languishing at the 10th place Moreover it is facing heavy competition from a variety of innovative startups that are primarily focused on a sharing economy In order to enhance their market share in the upcoming years HotelBrand has identified that a key solution to strive in the market should be the overhauling of their LRP program with the objective to make it more customer centric A customer centric LRP program contains features such as ease of sign up and use i e allow the customer to easily collect monitor share and utilize the accumulated points High liquidity may result in higher customer engagement and an increase of the perceived value of the LRP program This encourages new customers in addition to their current clientele to avail their services over their competitors HotelBrand is naturally looking to expand and increase their worldwide reach and aspires to be the market leader Therefore they are interested in creating a platform that can dynamically and easily scale up with their ever ambitious goals However HotelBrand realizes that the following factors could the revamp of their LRP program \xe2\x80\x93 Infrastructure (including maintenance scale & security) High liquidity may result in a significant increase in the number of transactions that need to \x0c5 be performed on a daily basis They have to further take into account that there could be spikes in the amount of transactions during the day based on consumer behavior patterns A large part of the transactions are expected to be performed online Their infrastructure has to be upgraded in order to cater these demands A cloud based system is appealing however in addition to the huge cost this requires in house expertise in maintenance dynamic scaling and security \xe2\x80\x93 Consumer experience In order to accommodate the current trends to operate via mobile Apps an App rich in features and appeal has to be developed The major concern though is of consumer engagement Although Apps are easy to install the large number of them on a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s phone tends to suffer the same issues as that of multiple loyalty cards with a consumer \xe2\x80\x93 a lack of enticement for the customer The App might be yet another App on the consumers\xe2\x80\x99 phone and thus not used frequently \xe2\x80\x93 Costs & Time Regardless of prioritizing and choosing an in house or a cloudbased version the costs of creating and then maintaining such a program would be huge Moreover the launch of an overhauled LRP program also requires a lot of development time 5

HotelBrand Tokens or XDB tokens for fiat currency or other cryptocurrency \x0c6 HotelBrand is monitoring the hype behind blockchain championed as the solution to many prevalent technological problems Nonetheless early prototypes investigated by their teams revealed that blockchain based solutions have pitfalls such as huge transaction fees and time Recently HotelBrand is intrigued by the blockchain based solution offered by DigitalBits especially the manner in which it overcomes many of the limitations of the earlier generations of blockchain A key feature provided by DigitalBits is that the brand tokens are in alignment with HotelBrand\xe2\x80\x99s customer centric focus They appreciate that DigitalBits allows them to create a new LRP program at virtually no cost1 They also realize that the system can dynamically scale in order to handle their global consumers Moreover they realize that they can start off by using the basic app provided by DigitalBits and later invest on developing a brand specific app on top of the basic app by making use of its APIs and SDK The only cost they incur is a very low transaction fee2 a cost that is required to ensure the integrity of the transaction The fee is used to sustain the ecosystem HotelBrand therefore uses the money saved to pass on more benefits to the consumers and also increase their marketing and consumer engagement activities and more importantly focuses on their core product As depicted in Figure 1 HotelBrand obtains the minimum XDB tokens They then proceed to create a new token HotelBrand Tokens for their brand and specify the maximum tokens that they would like to have When ConsumerTom books a room at one of their hotels they transfer some tokens to ConsumerTom based on their own internal algorithm Consumer Tom is immediately able to see the increase in HotelBrand Tokens in her DigitalBits enabled App which she regularly uses with other brands Moreover she is glad not having to install yet another app or fill up a form for another loyalty card At a later point in time Consumer Tom would like to use some of her HotelBrand Tokens to avail a free room from HotelBrand and also convert the rest into tokens to avail a discount on her next flight Consumer Tom also periodically chooses to convert some of her tokens into XDB tokens to benefit from the growing value of the DigitalBits network 2 3 Related Work Currently most LRP programs exist in silos i e belong to a certain brand (or group of brands) and cannot be easily transferred or traded with Since each of them exists in custom built infrastructure it is practically impossible to merge or facilitate real time interworking among two different LRP program even when the brands wish to do so Moreover a peer to peer based platform that facilitates the transfer and trade between different LRP programs has not historically existed This problem does not merely arise from businesses desiring 1 2 they will have to obtain the minimum XDB tokens (DigitalBits native token) required to maintain the account which is currently set at 10 XDB tokens currently set at 1 XDB tokens for 100 000 transactions and can be changed only with consensus \x0c7 to hold on to their customers but also that the barrier to facilitate such a system is high Businesses that are keen on making their platform more open face hurdles of scale cost and time As a result customers are forced to carry different cards for each of the loyalty programs or install a new app for each of them on their phone Apart from the issue of overloading a wallet/phone one also has to weigh in the chances of a customer remembering if he or she is a member of the loyalty program or not The entry barrier for new players is also high when we consider the high costs time to launch maintenance/scaling efforts security and the need for skilled personnel DigitalBits Stellar Ethereum Blocktime (w/ Confirmations) 2 5s 2 5s 5m to 1h+ # of Confirmations 1 1

aforementioned problems However many of the blockchain based solutions are in fact Decentralized Apps (Dapps) built on Ethereum [48] This subjects them to issues such as high trans \x0c8 action costs verification time and low transaction processing rate Moreover since ETH3 continue to be created every day they are also subjected to inflation Solutions such as Qiibee [40] have a huge entry cost by binding the value of tokens to their native currency similar to how certain monetary systems used the gold standard [17] A key issue with Dapps is that they can support only one native token similar to many of the legacy LRP programs Therefore all participating brands have the same native coin with the same features and confinement to a silo Alternatively blockchain platforms such as Ethereum4 [48] Waves5 [23] and Stellar6 [31][45] allow users to create their own tokens DigitalBits a fork of Stellar shares many of the benefits of Stellar but differs in key aspects such as not subjecting its tokens to inflation and is developing a token name certification service and an automatic algorithmic token distribution Figure 2 presents a high level comparison between DigitalBits Stellar and Ethereum Waves which relies on Proof of Stake (PoS) provides similar features like Ethereum and is comparable in performance to Ethereum DigitalBits outperforms both Ethereum and Waves in terms of the number of transactions per second (10 000 transactions per second [7]) and the time to verify transactions (approximately 3 5 seconds [45]) Additionally it provides features such as legal compliance multi asset support and a distributed exchange 3 Goal Modeling and Requirement Engineering The previous section introduced the DigitalBits running case that we now use to deduce the functional and non functional requirements that our system must adhere to in order to address the drawbacks and limitations of current LRP programs To systematically capture the necessary requirements we use one part an Agent Oriented Modelling (AOM) methodology [46] i e goal models In the context of system development and software engineering good requirements follow certain characteristics e g requirements address one issue only and are completely specified without missing information and they must be atomic as well as without conjunctions [13][22][36] In addition the requirements have to be consistent and do not contradict itself or in correlation with other requirements The AOM methodology [46] is a socio technical requirements engineering approach It is used to model complex systems that consist of humans hardware agents and software agents in a changing environment (also referred to as distributed socio technical system) Essentially an AOM goal model presents the software and the tasks it can perform from an agent oriented view It therefore enables both technical and non technical stakeholders to capture and understand the functional and non functional requirements of a complex system As depicted in Figure 3 Role Goal and Quality Goal are the three key elements of an AOM goal model Roles of involved entities i e stakeholders are represented 3 4 5 6 Ethereums native token https //www ethereum org/ https //wavesplatform com/ https //www stellar org/ \x0c9 in the form of sticky men Sticky men represent both human entities as well as entities such as apps on their phones that act on behalf of the human entity The functional requirements are depicted as parallelograms and refer to goals of the modeled software system The non functional requirements are depicted as clouds and refer to quality goals of the modeled software system The AOM goal model follows a tree like hierarchy The root value proposition i e the main goal of the modeled system is at the top This root goal is decomposed into sub goals where each sub goal represents an aspect for achieving its parent goal [30] These sub goals are further decomposed into multi layered sub goals until the lowest atomic level is reached Roles and quality goals may be assigned to either the key goal or the sub goals and are inherited by all the lower level goals Role Goal Quality Goal Fig 3 Selection of AOM notation elements This section presents our AOM goal model to define the requirements of the DigitalBits system thereby highlighting the functional and non functional goals of the platform In Section 3 1 we first address the top level goal model comprising the value proposition and the directly linked functional and quality goals along with the relevant stakeholders Later Section 3 2 focuses on the lower level refinements of the model 3 1 Top Level Goal Model Figure 4 presents the top level AOM goal model of the system using the modeling method described above The main value proposition is to provide easy asset tokenization using a transaction and trading layer for the points economy and other digital assets thereby representing the root of the goal model The complex main value proposition is split into four sub goals representing the four main functionalities of the DigitalBits system The refining functional goals are enact plugins and Apps tokenize assets trade assets and pay and remit Furthermore relevant stakeholders pertaining to these high level functional goals are also highlighted in Figure 4 These high level functional goals are refined further in subsequent sections Besides the four sub goals of the top level AOM goal model we further identify thirteen quality goals Nine of these quality goals belong to the main value \x0c10 proposition and are inherited by all its sub goals The remaining quality goals belong to a sub set of the sub goals and are inherited by its child goals Easy to use Interoperable Scalable Decentralized Cost efficient Flexible Integrable Fast Provide easy asset tokenization using a transaction and trading layer for the points economy and other digital assets 3rd Party ServiceProvider Compliant Automated Enact plugins and Apps Tokenize assets Loyalty Program Provider other issuers Secure Multi hop Convenient Trade assets Pay and remit Consumer Fig 4 Value proposition and first level refinement of the DigitalBits goal model A scalable and decentralized system design is necessary for the envisioned platform to handle the large number of LRP program consumers and the resulting transactions The LRP program providers have a large consumer base with a worldwide presence and therefore the platform must be able to handle the verification of transactions in a fast and secure manner A secure service provision is crucial in terms of operational security e g protect provider as well as consumer accounts and personal data from unauthorized access secure data transfer within the system between entities or preventing data and information leaks The DigitalBits network is expected to support a large variety of LRP programs (and other digital assets) and must therefore be agnostic to the specific needs of an individual provider The ecosystem is also expected to include a large number of plugins and apps developed by third party developers and therefore must be designed to be interoperable and integrable in terms of hardware and software design It is also crucial to interoperate at runtime with information systems supporting other business functions Since the users of the platform are consumers who are not necessarily techsavvy it is important for the platform to be easy to use The consumers must be able to interact with the platform the plugins and apps easily in order to perform actions such as register for points collect points get an overview of their points and trade/sell points According to [36] easy usability also includes the support of proper error avoidance in order to \xe2\x80\x9canticipate and prevent common errors that occur during a collaboration configuration\xe2\x80\x9d \x0c11 A reliable enactment of all transactions and trades is mandatory to facilitate the previous goals The system must also strive to provide these benefits in a reliable and cost efficient manner Last but not the least the system must be designed in a flexible manner in order to facilitate a highly dynamic process that involves the enactment of diverse activities the participation of diverse partners and the exchange of diverse data [35] 3rd Party ServiceProvider Enact plugins and Apps (De) register Loyalty Program Provider other issuers Prepare enactment Execute Terminate Interact Consumer Send Tokens Receive Tokens Fig 5 Lower level refinements of the Enact plugins and Apps functional goal 3 2 Refined Goal Model The lower level refinements of the four sub goals are detailed below First Figure 5 presents the enact plugins and apps goal Applications and plugins have to be registered prepared for enactment executed and terminated Moreover they have to interact with various entities of the ecosystem depending on the use case e g receiving and sending tokens or other kind of data Since nowadays most blockchains offer Turing complete smart contract languages the variety of applications and plugins in our ecosystem is quite vast In the context of DigitalBits a variety of such services is developed and offered by 3rd party providers and might include services such as wallets or LRP programs While these are pretty standard apps more sophisticated applications will be offered as well e g the federation server and the token name service (see Section 4) The DigitalBits federation server are similar to the DNS system of the Internet but instead of resolving website urls to IP addresses the federation servers resolve token aliases to the specific smart contract token addresses The token name certification service (see Section 5) represents a certification service that will map token \x0c12 names to an entity and ensures a correct binding e g certify that the Company A token actually belongs to Company A and was not created by a malicious entity Figure 6 illustrates the refinements of the goal tokenize assets In order to tokenize an asset it is bind to a token that is created and subsequently issued on the DigitalBits platform As mentioned previously the token name certification service being developed can be used to certify issued tokens Finally the new digitalized asset has to be managed and be able to be integrated in applications and plugins of the platform A key quality goal of the requirement tokenize assets is legal compliance in terms of who can view and validate transactions Loyalty Program Provider other issuers Tokenize assets Compliant Create Tokens Issue Tokens Certify Tokens Mangage Tokens Manage plugins or App Interaction Fig 6 Lower level refinements of the Tokenize assets functional goal The third functional requirement trade assets is shown in Figure 7 The tokenized assets of Figure 6 are worthless if it is not possible to trade and exchange them with other parties Hence this functional goal covers on and off chain supply and demand administration as well as trade of tokenized assets Entities may register offers or requests on chain in order to attract business partners For other use cases a local supply demand management off chain is more suitable In today\xe2\x80\x99s highly digital world automation in trading assets is expected by the platform users Multi hop i e the ability to trade tokens by first converting them to a common token or fiat currency is a feature that adds value to the platform Convenience while making payments remittance and trading is an expected goal to enhance consumer experience \x0c13 Multi hop Automated Convenient Trade assets Loyalty Program Provider other issuers Consumer Manage supply/demand Trade on/off chain Register Seller Buyer Create offer Update offer Remove offer Query offers Matching Currency Conversion Fig 7 Lower level refinements of the Trade assets functional goal Consumer Convenient Multi hop Pay and remit Remit Choose currency Pay Pay Buy Sell Fig 8 Lower level refinements of the Pay and remit functional goal Finally the fourth functional requirement pay and remit (Figure 8) focuses on the payment and remittance functionalities of our solution The sub goal pay is further refined into selling and buying from or to merchants In the context of this model a merchant can also be another user offering a service or good The remit sub goal consists of selecting a currency and recipient for the remittance process The final functionality is the transaction itself and pertains the payment as well as the remittance process Again the quality goals of multi hop and convenience apply \x0c14 The presented goal model is used in the following Section 4 to derive our system architecture We do not list all details of the further refined AOM goal model in this whitepaper due to space constraints and in order to focus on the most relevant system components and features 4 DigitalBits System Design and Architecture The DigitalBits network consists of entities that perform different but complimentary roles in order to maintain the health of the network The key role is played by the nodes that run the DigitalBits blockchain based software and connect to one another These nodes are well supported by nodes that provide services such as compliance verification mapping and RESTful APIs Additionally APIs SDKs and wallets provided by DigitalBits facilitate businesses and third party developers to easily develop and deploy their custom apps and wallets Below Section 4 1 presents the high level network overview that consists of the various entities that play a vital role Next Section 4 2 presents the technology stack and finally Section 4 3 focuses on the system architecture itself 4 1 DigitalBits Network Overview Fig 9 High Level DigitalBits Architecture Overview Figure 9 illustrates an overview of the Digitalbits architecture The DigitalBits architecture consists of the key components described below 4 1 1 Frontier Frontier provides a RESTful API for the DigitalBits ecosystem It acts as the interface to applications that wish to access the DigitalBits network Frontier \x0c15 facilitates actions such as the submission of transactions to the network checking the status of accounts and subscribing to event streams It also ingests and re serves the data produced by the Digitalbits network in a form that is easier to consume than the performance oriented data representations used in the network Application developers interact with Frontier\xe2\x80\x99s Restful API via the web browser simple command line tools like cURL or the DigitalBits SDK DigitalBits maintains JavaScript Java and Go based SDKs for communicating with Frontier There are also community maintained SDKs for Ruby Python and C# The Frontier APIs and SDKs can also be used to build or enhance custom brand specific Apps and clients 4 1 2 Network Backbone DigitalBits Core DB Core DB Core DB Core DB Core DB Core DB Core DB Core DB Core DB Core Fig 10 Quorums i e circles of trust formed among DigitalBits core instances (represented as DB core) of various partner institutes and individuals The DigitalBits core instances can choose to belong to one or more quorums and utilize them in a hierarchical manner or based on the type of transaction that needs to be verified The nodes belonging to a quorum need not be located close to one another as can be observed in the blue quorum set \x0c16 The DigitalBits core is the backbone of the DigitalBits network The DigitalBits Core software interacts with a chosen subset of other instances of cores in order to validate and agree on the status of every transaction through the DigitalBits Consensus Protocol (DCP) which is based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) [4] Similar to Stellar\xe2\x80\x99s SCP DCP relies on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) Unlike the Byzantine Algorithm [9] the FBA does not have a single list of trusted validators i e a centralized list of trusted validators Instead an FBA allows for different quorums or sets of validators to co exist The nodes can determine the composition of the quorum in a decentralized manner As shown in Figure 10 DigitalBits core instances of different institutions can choose to participate in one or more quorums subject to the existing quorum members agreeing to grant it access The quorums facilitates the compliance process based on legal requirements Organizations may choose one or more quorums that satisfy their requirements Nodes or organizations could also choose to have a hierarchy of trust with the parameters that define the level of trust that a node accepts for each transaction In other words quorum composition and aspects such as simple majority vs 2/3 majority are defined for different classes of transactions similar to parliamentary systems in many parts of the world The benefit of hosting an own instance of DigitalBits core as compared to just running an App or client is many fold Transactions can be submitted without having to rely on a third party and the DigitalBits core can select its own instance of who to trust i e the quorum The more organizations and partners contribute instances of DigitalBits core to the network the more reliable and robust the network becomes Each organization can choose to run one or more DigitalBits core nodes which also participate as validators 4 1 3 The DigitalBits Network The DigitalBits network itself is a collection of connected DigitalBit cores run by various individuals and entities around the world Instances of DigitalBits core add reliability to the overall network Additionally they may choose to have a Frontier server for communication in order to access the DigitalBits Network The distributed nature of the network makes it reliable and safe All these DigitalBit cores within the network eventually agree on sets of transactions Each transaction on the network costs a small fee 100 nibbs (0 00001 XDB) This fee helps to prevent bad actors from spamming the network Fusechain also maintains archive servers with live backups of the current state in the network in order to facilitate new DigitalBits cores to come in sync with the current status of the network 4 2 Technology Stack Figure 11 illustrates the key components of the DigitalBits architecture namely the application server the bridge server the federation server and the compliance server Below we describe each of these key components In Section 4 3 \x0c17 we provide the overall architecture and a flowchart based description of how transactions are performed in the DigitalBits network Own Application Services (e g Points Program Wallets Explorer and etc ) Bridge Server Federation Server Compliance Server Ruby SDK Go SDK Community SDKs XDB wallet Node SDK Java SDK SDK Frontier API frontier DigitaBits Core Validator digitalbits core Fig 11 Technology Stack 4 2 1 Bridge Server The Bridge server is designed to support applications in easily performing transactions on the DigitalBits network The bridge server enables applications to use the federation and compliance servers to send and receive payments As shown later in Figure 15 when a sender wishes to perform a transaction the sender\xe2\x80\x99s client contacts its bridge server in order to initiate the transaction If required the bridge server then connects the federation server of the receiver and its own compliance server If all verifications are successfully completed the transaction is recorded in the DigitalBits network The bridge server on the receiver\xe2\x80\x99s side periodically monitors the DigitalBits network and spots transactions destined for its end point and then connects to the required federation and compliance servers as well as finally accepts the transaction The bridge servers then inform the respective end points about the result of the transaction \x0c18 4 2 2 Federation Server DB Federation ID DB Account ID Federation Server DB Federation ID < > DB Account ID DB Account ID DB Federation ID Fig 12 Federation Server Overview The federation server holds the mapping between the DigitalBits Account ID and the Federation ID and support lookup or reverse lookup to map from one type of ID to another In order to enhance the consumer experience and ease adoption by consumers DigitalBits associates an account with an email like human readable identification in addition to the standard public key based identification prevalent in blockchain [34][48] The human readable email like address allows consumers to easily use the Apps and clients without having to familiarize themselves with public key cryptography [15][41] The role of the federation server is therefore to provide a mapping service between the email like human readable address and the public key based address Figure 12 illustrates how an entity interacts with the federation server in order to either map a DB Federation ID (the email like address) to a DBAccount ID (the public key based address) or vice versa The DB Federation ID is of the form usernameyourdomain com For example a consumer named \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x9d could have a DB Federation ID \xe2\x80\x9cJoedigitalbits io\xe2\x80\x9d wherein \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\xe2\x80\x9d is his username and \xe2\x80\x9cdigitalbits io\xe2\x80\x9d is the domain name The username could also be an email id The domain can be any valid RFC 1035 [32] domain name The Apps or clients automatically perform the federation lookup (DB Account ID \xe2\x88\x92 > DB Federation ID) or reverse lookup (DB Federation ID \xe2\x88\x92 > DB Account ID) \x0c19 and thereby allow the users to perform transactions by making use of just the DB Federation ID 4 2 3 Compliance Server Compliance Server Fetch Info Callback Customer DB Sanctions Callback Sanction DB Ask User Callback Compliance DB Fig 13 Callbacks performed by the compliance server to the various databases at the sender as well as receiver side in order to obtain the necessary information to perform a compliance verification It is the responsibility of the anchor to handle regulatory compliance especially to adhere to Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations Complying with AML laws requires certaion enterprises and institutions (EIs) to know not only who their customers are sending value to but also who their customers are receiving value from However in some jurisdictions certain EIs are able to trust the AML procedures of other EIs In other jurisdictions each EIs must do its own background check of both the sender and the receiver The DigitalBits compliance protocol supports the exchange of compliance information to pre approve a transaction with another EI The customer information that is exchanged between EIs via the compliance protocol is quite flexible and typically consists of the full name date of birth and physical address Figure 13 illustrates the callbacks that are used to obtain information at the sender side and also to verify compliance in case a sender\xe2\x80\x99s compliance server contacts a receiver\xe2\x80\x99s compliance server to verify compliance before clearing a transaction The following callbacks are performed \xe2\x80\x93 Fetch info callback This callback returns all the information about a particular consumer on receiving the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s federation address \xe2\x80\x93 sanctions callback This callback is used to identify if any sanctions exist in order to receive money from the sender The HTTP response code it \x0c20 produces indicates whether the payment is accepted (status 200) denied (status 403) or if additional time for processing is required (status 202) \xe2\x80\x93 Ask user callback This callback is called in case a sender has requested information about the receiver The HTTP response code it produces indicates whether the information can be sent If the callback is a success the fetch info callback is called to obtain the information 4 2 4 Wallets and Apps Businesses and third party developers could easily develop custom Apps by leveraging the Frontier API and DigitalBits SDK DigitalBits also provides a native XDB wallet source code that can be directly used or easily adapted to create a brand specific wallet The bridge server facilitates easy access for the end points to the federation and compliance server 4 3 System Architecture Figure 14a presents a flowchart depicting the decision making process of a bridge server when it receives a request for a new transfer The bridge server would contact the federation server of the receiver in case a mapping from a DB Account Id to a DB Federation Id for the receiver is required It then verifies whether compliance is required for the transaction to be validated If compliance is required the bridge server contacts the compliance server to initiate the compliance protocol The bridge server then places the transaction as a pending transaction in the DigitalBits network Once the receiver accepts the transaction (see Figure 14b) the bridge server informs its endpoint The endpoint then modifies its account balances accordingly Figure 14b presents a flowchart depicting the decision making process of a bridge server on the receiver side The bridge server continuously monitors the DigitalBits network for any new pending transactions destined towards it On observing such a transaction the bridge server contacts the federation server of the sender in case a mapping from a DB Account Id to a DB Federation Id for the sender is required It then verifies whether compliance is required for the transaction to be validated If compliance is required the bridge server contacts the compliance server to verify if compliance was already obtained Accordingly the bridge server either accepts or rejects the transaction in the DigitalBits network If the transaction was positively verified and accepted the receiver endpoint modify its account balances accordingly \x0c21 (a) pdf (b) pdf Start Federation Required Start Yes Federation Server No

Jane\xe2\x80\x99s DB Account ID Afterwards it requests authorization from its compliance server The compliance server makes use of the DigitalBits compliance protocol to clear the transaction with the recipients compliance server and accordingly informs its bridge server The bridge server places this transaction in the DigitalBits network and wait for the transaction to be accepted Meanwhile the bridge server on the receiver side observes this pending transfer via a periodic polling mechanism Jane\xe2\x80\x99s bridge server verifies with its compliance server whether compliance verification has been performed for the transaction Accordingly the bridge server accepts or rejects the pending transfer on the DigitalBits network Both Tom\xe2\x80\x99s and Jane\xe2\x80\x99s bridge servers inform their respective endpoints of the validity of the transaction \x0c23 5 Stakeholders Engagement and Services Interaction DigitalBits blockchain powered infrastructure builds a bridge that facilitates the implementation of new technologies to support and enhance our every day life interactions as well as foster blockchain mass adoption Hence stakeholder engagements and service interactions are essential to the DigitalBits platform The underlying processes that enable engagement and interaction are the result of collaborating tasks and sub processes Based on the chosen LRP program running case from Section 2 we outline the exemplary detailed processes and benefits of involved stakeholder e g for tokenizing assets trading assets as well as validating and authenticating tokenized assets via certification service Consequently Section 5 1 details the on boarding process of digital assets followed by Section 5 2 that details the digital asset validation and authentication service Afterwards Section 5 3 outlines the built in decentralized multihop exchange of DigitalBits followed by Section 5 4 that covers the token value proposition Finally Section 5 5 focuses on incentives that foster the DigitalBits community 5 1 On Boarding Process of Digital Assets In previous sections we briefly outlined the general workflow of tokenizing an asset on the DigitalBits blockchain Even though this paper focuses specifically on the tokenization of LRP programs the underlying concept is more diverse and can be applied to commodities such as diamonds [37] and gold [2] or securities [24] In general tokenization is a method that converts the rights to an asset into a digital token that resides on a blockchain [8][21] and DigitalBits supports the tokenization of all types of assets In the context of our LRP program running case we may face two different scenarios when it comes to tokenizing those programs First the asset provider (or issuer) wants to set up a brand new program without any legacy dependencies Second the assets provider already has an existing legacy (non blockchain) LRP program that has to be migrated into the DigitalBits system While the first case is rather straight forward the second case is more complex In either case the asset provider (or issuer) is to choose an identification code for the new asset a combination of up to 12 letters or numbers that identify the asset in a human readable form Afterwards the asset is ready to be used on the network However before other users are able to receive the loyalty tokens of fictional HotelBrand company from the running case of Section 2 2 the users have to choose to trust it (or the fictional company may do this in batch for all its users if it is electing to initially hold custody of its members\xe2\x80\x99 accounts) since a DigitalBits asset is actually a credit Therefore users have to trust that HotelBrand can redeem that credit if necessary later on In the context of a LRP program the user usually trusts the asset provider e g a retail company Each account can create a trustline or a declaration that it trusts a particular asset In addition users can also limit the trust to a particular amount of tokens This security feature ensures that small asset providers with limited credibility do not \x0c24 hand out excessive amounts of tokens In the context of our running case such details will be dealt with when a new user decided to join the loyalty program By default users have to trust the issuer to participate in the program The loyalty and reward industry uses so called reward engines to manage the mapping between purchases and allocated reward points (e g staying in a hotel for five nights results in a reward of 25 loyalty points) Those mappings as well as the terms and conditions that apply when redeeming the points are managed by the reward engine and the assets\xe2\x80\x99 providers IT system As mentioned previously in Section 4 the asset providers bridge server facilitates the interactions between the DigitalBits network and the application services on the asset provider side Finally going back to the second scenario that we outlined in the beginning of this section assuming that HotelBrand wishes to migrate its existing program to the DigitalBits infrastructure The workflow is mainly the same a new asset is initially created on the blockchain and then the respective trust settings are performed However further application logic on the provider side is necessary to manage the migration process from the legacy platform to the blockchain solution There are three approaches to that issue First HotelBrand may create accounts (consisting of public and private keys) for each legacy user and equips the corresponding accounts with a number of tokens that is equal to the number of loyalty points in the legacy system The issuer can then create the keys and manage those accounts directly via the DigitalBits SDK or the frontier server A second solution could rely on the loyalty program bridging their existing database via their bridge server to handle any on chain actions In this case the LRP program continues to rely on the existing accounting database of the legacy system while handling blockchain events via the bridge server e g send and receive tokens Finally the third option is that in order to issue a new blockchain based loyalty and reward tokens to customers with legacy tokens these customers need to register with a DigitalBits account ID (as presented earlier in Section 4) As soon as an account has been registered the issuer transfers tokens equivalent or proportional to the points that the customer possessed in the legacy program The migration process may consist of different stages e g early access program proof of concept and cut over Point holders that wish to further use their accumulated points have to migrate before the cut over in order to ensure that they do not loose their points 5 2 Token Name Certification Service (TNCS) Validation and Authentication of Asset Providers In the previous section we elaborated on the process of on boarding a new asset to the blockchain and tokenizing the asset However whether a specific tokenized asset actually represents the analogue asset of the real world is unclear Ensuring a binding of the analogue value and its digital representation is a common problem in computer science and most thoroughly studied in the context of digital identities e g [1][33] How can Jane digitally prove to Tom that she is fact the owner as well as analogue representative of a specific digital identity An equivalent problem even though less complex than the human identity issue arises \x0c25 in the context of certificates for websites [16] Most common solution for website certificates and digital identities are so called public key infrastructures (PKIs) that are either organized in a centralized and hierarchical manner (so called certificate authorities CAs) or in a decentralized manner such as the PGP Web of Trust [49] Both concepts have different advantages and disadvantages that have been partially solved by moving the underlying ideas to a blockchain based platform [10][27][44] In order to prevent malicious entities from issuing tokens that represent a brand or company that they are not associated with we suggest a so called Token Name Certification Service (TNCS) be developed for validation and authentication of asset providers Service providers within the DigitalBits network might then offer services similar to SSL certificate authorities that maintain a mapping between token smart contract addresses and the identities of token issuers As a result it becomes difficult for a malicious attacker to impersonate a legitimate company or issuer and issue a counterfeit asset on their behalf The advantage for users and consumers is that they do not have to worry about buying/trading worthless counterfeit tokens that have the same name as the original but a different token address Hence it fosters security and convenience for users A blockchain based protocol that was designed to provide such services is the Asset Provider TNCS Provider 1 Challenge Request 2 Challenge Response Block 1 \xe2\x80\xa6 Block X DigitalBits Blockchain 3 Store challenge and result in blockchain Fig 16 Challenge response based validation and authentication process on a blockchain (Adapted from [27]) Authcoin protocol [26][27][28] that can easily be adapted to enable the TNCS on the DigitalBits network The protocol provides validation and authentication for secure identity assurance on the blockchain via a challenge response mechanism In general validation aims to prove that an entity has access to a certain resource (in our case access to a DigitalBits account that issued a specific token) while authentication continues the validation procedure by verifying the identity of the issuer and aims to confirm that the entity with access to the account is also the actual representative of the company Figure 16 illustrates the idea in the context of DigitalBits TNCS An asset provider (token issuer) wants the TNCS provider to approve the authenticity of their digital assets To do so the issuer requests \x0c26 a challenge that is then created by the TNCS provider Afterwards the issuer fulfils the challenge and sends the response back Challenge as well as response are transparently stored in the blockchain The chosen challenge depends on the use case scenario the required level of security and the given threat level of the involved entities In the context of a LRP program provider the challenge might ask the issuer to provide a company statement that proves that they issued the token and that they are in fact the company they claim to be 5 3 Decentralized Multi Hop Exchange Besides the tokenization and transfer of digital assets such as LRPs it also enables seamless transfer or trade of those assets on chain with others entities interested in receiving those assets This helps to solve many of the existing issues of non tokenized assets that often suffer from missing market liquidity In some cases it is possible to seamlessly trade these assets even if no direct market exists between two assets As a Stellar [31] fork this decentralized multi hop exchange works similar to the original 5 3 1 Matchmaking Users interested in trading LRPs or any other asset can create an offer to buy or sell an asset In order to make an offer the account must hold the asset it wants to sell Moreover the user is required to trust the issuer of the asset it is trying to purchase When an account creates an offer the offer is checked against the existing orderbook for that asset pair If the offer crosses an existing offer it is filled at the price of the existing offer If not the offer is saved in the orderbook until it is either taken by another offer taken by a payment canceled by the account that created the offer or invalidated because the account making the offer no longer has the asset for sale 5 3 2 Cross Asset Multi Hop Payments Let us assume that Jane owns points from Company A and wants to buy an item or a service from a merchant that only accepts points from Company B In this scenario Jane can create a payment in Digitalbits that automatically converts her points from Company A into points of Company B by querying the orderbook and converting among the points at the best available rate In case the orderbook does not contain any offers for such a conversion it is also possible to first convert it into another asset e g points from Company C and afterwards converting those points to the target asset class The number of intermediate steps before the final conversion is limited to a maximum of 6 hops and atomic7 Since cross asset payments and conversions are simple and seamlessly users are not required to hold any unwanted assets just for payment purposes Instead they keep their preferred LRPs of their favorite brand (or any other asset) only converting them if necessary 7 It will either succeed or fail and the payment sender will never be left holding an unwanted asset \x0c27 5 4 Token Value Proposition While previous sections focused on the architecture services and processes of the DigitalBits blockchain and ecosystem the following section details the value proposition of its native token the XDB token XDB serves three main objectives Firstly as a protective security feature Each account on the DigitalBits blockchain is required to stake a minimum of 10 XDB tokens to ensure an account is authentic and for the send function to be enabled on the network For example if Jane wants to send 20 Tokens to Tom her account must have a minimum of 30 Tokens to do so Moreover each transaction results in a minor transaction fee of 0 00001 XDB Both requirements serve as protective security features and prevent users with malicious intentions from flooding the network Secondly XDB enables transaction among non native tokens by acting as a bridge to facilitate trades between pairs of other digital assets which may not have a large direct market Finally DigitalBits XDB token can also be used for fast and low cost micro payments and remittances 5 5 Community Engagement The DigitalBits platform and the surrounding ecosystem aim to support mass adoption of blockchain technology Hence a community of various partners and users is crucial for the further development of DigitalBits The following section introduces plans for token allocations scholarships grants and donations that will facilitate the community engagement of the DigitalBits ecosystem As illustrated in Figure 17 at the launch of the network 32% of the XDB tokens will be reserved for an initial token sale and any that are unsold we will reserved for future use 53% of the XDB tokens will be reserved for rewards to users grants airdrops and donations to charity Lastly another 15% are held by Fusechain XDB I Ltd the founding contributor to the DigitalBits network reserved for the Team and advisors The initial allocation of 40 0% designated for rewards to users as well as donations to charities is separated into two pools The DigitalBits Algorithmic Pool (39 60%) and the Charity Pool (0 40%) The XDB reserved for the DigitalBits Algorithmic Pool (DBAP) is designated for give away based on DigitalBits blockchain use and determined by DBAP\xe2\x80\x99s algorithms and system currently under development This DBAP pool will be restricted and remain in reserve until this development is complete Transaction fees are also used to refill the pool XDB within the DBAP is released directly to users via their respective accounts on the blockchain when the rewards are earned Donations from the Charity Pool are given to designated charities at a ratio of 1 to 99 with the DBAP until the Charity Pool supply is exhausted For example if 990 XDB are released by the DBAP then 10 XDB are released from the Charity Pool Fusechain plans to identify designate and monitor charities to be recipients of the XDB released from the Charity Pool The Charity Pool will restricted and remain in reserve until the DBAP system is developed Finally we plan to give away a 5% allocation through the DigitalBits Research and Development Grant Program and 5% Partner Ecosystem Development Program from time to time The Partner Grant Program and Partner \x0c28 40 0% Algorithmic Pool (39 6%) and Charity Pool (0 40%) Restricted until algo launch within 24months 5 0% Distributed via partnership development program specifically driving benefit to DigitalBits 5 0% Distributed via R&D grants 3 0% Distributed via airdrops and bounties 15 0% 12 5% distributed to founders team and contractors and 2 5% to advisors (\xe2\x80\x9cTeam\xe2\x80\x9d) 32 0% Up to 32% to be sold in a token sale and the balance to be held for future use Fig 17 XDB Token distribution at the launch of the DigitalBits network Ecosystem Development Program are focused on encouraging prospective partners to develop and operate products services or solutions that are important to the DigitalBits network 6 Conclusion This whitepaper presents the DigitalBits blockchain powered infrastructure that facilitates the implementation of new technologies to support and
