Articles & Video Users earn 5 points for every promoted article they read and video they watch Timers on the page ensure that users are spending sufficient time viewing the promoted content 4 \x0cTokenomics The circulating 1UP token supply at launch (January 1st 2019) was <1 5 million tokens Tokens are brought into the circulating supply when a user exchanges points earned on Uptrennd into 1UP tokens at a ratio of 1 1 To mitigate the amount of tokens brought into main circulating supply Uptrennd uses 80% of advertising revenue to buy back tokens from third party exchanges These tokens are then placed in the Uptrennd \xe2\x80\x9cHolding Pool\xe2\x80\x9d If there are tokens in the holding pool when a user exchanges points for tokens the tokens are then withdrawn from the holding pool rather than from the cold storage wallet If there are tokens in the holding pool the main circulating supply will not increase If the holding pool begins to grow in size due to a larger incoming revenue than tokens being withdrawn Uptrennd will withdraw tokens from the holding pool into cold storage reducing the main circulating supply In addition to advertising revenue creating a stable balance for the main circulating supply Uptrennd has incorporated other methods to reduce the amount of tokens entering the ecosystem 1) Users spending points to level up their account 2) Users spending points to promote their post 3) Users spending points at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d Every extra one billion tokens minted and found in the main circulating supply will halve the amount of points per upvote This will slow the generation of tokens and increase scarcity IE 0 1B main circulating supply = 1 point per upvote 1 2B main circulating supply = 0 5 points per upvote 2 3B main circulating supply = 0 25 points per upvote 3 4B main circulating supply = 0 125 points per upvote 4 5B main circulating supply = 0 0625 points per upvote 5 6B main circulating supply = 0 03125 points per upvote The base price to purchase the 1UP token on Uptrennd com is $0 05 USD This base price will be maintained for one year Every year the on platform purchase price per token increases by $0 01 If the average price per token on third party exchanges increases above $0 05 for an extended period of time the price per token on Uptrennd com will also increase and maintain a 10% premium to cover fees For example if 1UP is being sold at $0 10 on exchanges it will be sold at $0 11 on Uptrennd com Having the price discounted on exchanges will also allow for incentives for increased liquidity 5 \x0cReal time Notifications When a user receives a point on the bottom left of the screen a small \xe2\x80\x9cup arrow\xe2\x80\x9d pops up When someone comments on their post \xe2\x80\x9cJeff has commented on your post in X niche\xe2\x80\x9d again small on the bottom left When someone replies to their comment \xe2\x80\x9cJeff has replied to your comment\xe2\x80\x9d

account b) Spending points to promote their post c) Spending points at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d To prevent upvote spam on the network The ability for all users on the website to

suggested to the user but is not mandatory The Future Currently Uptrennd is a web 2 0 platform that is not built on the blockchain After Uptrennd builds a strong userbase and sustainability a large upgrade to be a fully decentralized and on chain platform will occur When this occurs all tokens outside of the circulating supply will be burnt From that point forwards tokens will be mined/generated rather than pre mined as they currently are In addition Uptrennd will transfer from a central storage of video data and media to a decentralized IPFS storage system 6 \x0c
