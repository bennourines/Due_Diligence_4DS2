b \x0cNow this will be REVERSED \x0cMTC MESH NETWORK MTC Mesh Network connects one machine with another in the IoT It is a decentralized network protocol with its correspondence being conducted by mutual data exchange between communication modules installed in these machines like BLE and Wifi In the Mesh Network every machine such as mobile phone refrigerator automobile POS and robot can be a node And these nodes could communicate with each other without the traditional Internet because MTC is a totally decentralized Mesh Network protocol For blockchain network and IoT of the next generation MTCMesh Network performs as the basic Internet infrastructure That is once MTC Mesh Network is built all blockchain projects and IoT machines can exchange information and make transactions rapidly and conveniently in condition of no Internet MTC can support all blockchain projects such as Bitcoin Ethereu EOS Qtum and Achain to circulate in a safe and fast way and eventhere has no Internet Also MTC can support IoT equipment in transferring data In this way network congestion caused by large qualities of transactions would have been solved and expensive private network such as Lora and NB IOT is no longer needed for the IoT equipment in this way 80%of the cost for the construction of IoT will be saved In short it will becomethe mainstream network for decentralized near \xef\xac\x81eldcommunication andIoT in the future Page 01 \x0cMTC MESH NETWORK ARCHITECTURE Mesh Station Mesh Nodes Mesh Nodes Mesh Nodes Distributed Mesh nodes are globally synchronized Conveying data from the Mesh Ad Hoc Network through bluetooth or Wi Fi of each IoT terminal MTC network can convey information to all IoT terminals under the environment of BLE with one single bluetooth covering about 164 feet (Wi Fi 328 feet) and it can extend the Internet cover range unlimitedly through node to node information exchange In this way one to multiple terminal communication can be realized even when there is no public network After receiving the broadcast data any terminal in the mesh network that is connected to a wide area IoT node or Internet will synchronize broadcast data to Mesh Station Wide area transport layer eLTE NB lOT LoRa Internet Synchronous transmission/asynvhronous transmission That is to say if any device in the Mesh Network had the opportunity to get access to public network it will convey all data to Mesh station and synchronize all data to the Mesh Network system In this unlimited extending network you can make mobile payment play on line games

also one of the vital technologies to address the last Mesh Nodle Team and our MTC Mesh Network And in these mile logistics problem In the process of developing a new projects Mesh network are mainly applied by two forms network wireless is indispensable Wireless mesh network a dynamic self orgnized networking structure which can be MTC MESH One is the offline communication between different mobile expanded gradually can achieve cooperative communication with phones such as chatting playing games blockchain payment other networks enabling two or multiple devices to maintain Typical projects are Smart Mesh and Right Mesh wireless connection The other is specialized communication network for the IoT such Mesh Network is currently applied in occasions where the network as data collection of IoT devices and near field offline payment environment is complicated and near field communications are Typical projects are Nodle and MTC neede such as underground parking lot mine field disaster BlockChain Smart Mesh an ethereum based application can support all rescue and relief and the IoT controlling offline transactions and offline communication protocol by Combining the decentralized blockchain network protocol with the transacting ERC20 Tokens And it charges certain amount of decentralized infrastructure of Mesh networking technology will SMT tokens as commission while help clients who possess promote the birth of a new underlying communication protocol ERC20 assets with offline transactions and the communication protocol of IoT Page 05 \x0cMTC MESH NETWORK IOT STACK IOT BLOCK CHAIN MTC is a node to node network with unlimited extending distribute ledger blockchain Unlike the traditional blockchain Service Layer network whose communication data is often blocked because of limited size of blocks Its massive sub nodes can guarantee rapid communication and off chain transactions Meanwhile MTC encourages individual users to share network nodes with other IoT devices by awarding them MTC Data Format Tokens addressing problems like connecting Internet and data storage Protocol Layer One to multiple Mesh network at the bottom layer of the near \xef\xac\x81eld Mesh communication is based on many protocols like BEL and WiFi With the increase of Mesh Station which is Transport Layer organized by distributed nodes MTC Mesh network will become better and better It is compatible with IoT sensors and other mainstream blockchain network like Bitcoin Eth Eos and Ae Eventually it will build a fundamental network Connectivity Layer protocol for the IoT sector Page 06 \x0cMTC MESH NETWORK IOT NODES Linking every intelligent devices with MTC Mesh network to form a new basic network Not only the smart phone can be a node but also all the other intelligent devices around us can be nodes Page 07 \x0cMTC INTERNET OF THINGS MTC Mesh network can provide Mesh network for low power anti lost devices for children Sharing Mesh Network Resources With IoT to Earn MTC Tokens Traditional anti lost devices for children are poor in its localization technology and can only be used outdoors Due to its high power consumption feature the data updated in every ten minutes can only be used in less than one week After companies adopting MTC Mesh network they will get access to almost real time outdoor and indoor geographical location information Besides it has more than half a year\xe2\x80\x99s service life with the MTC Mesh low power consumption chip In reality a large number of IoT devices require network and LBS information to support them such as electricity gas shared bikes anti lost alarm smart trash can and street lamp They pay tens of millions money per year to get online communication services In the future IoT industry will save more than half of the online communication fees once MTC sharing Mesh network is applied Page 08 \x0cWIDE AREA COMMUNICATION 5km Low Frequency Network and Satellite Network MTC MX BEL 50m Networking PHONE Page 09 \x0cMTC MESH TOKEN and MTC MESH NETWORK First of all MTC Mesh Token adopts a smart contract based on ERC20 tokens which can be short for MTC Ethereum is a open source blockchain platform with public distributed blockchain It provides a distributed turing completeness virtual machine to support the operation of the smart contract MTC aims to motivate MTC node users or producers to purchase services in the MTC system For example the IoT enterprises can use the MTC network to link their IoT devices so that these devices can communicate with each other Clients will be rewarded with MTC tokens if they link their smartphones or Mesh Station nodes with the Mesh network The longer users link with Mesh network the more MTC tokens they will get MTC main network token will take the place of ERC20 Token which is based on Ethereum after MTC main network goes online MTC main network adopts a distributed way which is guaranteed by POS Proof of Stake so that users are able to set Mesh Station in the MTC network to protect the security of the whole network MTC mesh main network can support transaction of over 10 000 TPS and any payment with MTC tokens is free of Gas charge For example Arron pays Bob 5 MTC and Bob will receive 5 MTC This means the MTC platform charges no penny in the process of transactions The reason for that is because users have already earned profitable MTC tokens by sharing their network and storage space while they develop the POS Mesh Station Since the Mesh Station comes with POS Proof of Stake users do not need to build extra stations for MTC network In addition the fact that Mesh Station comes with BEL modules enables users to earn MTC tokens through collecting data of various IoT devices and reporting to IoT enterprises What\xe2\x80\x99s more every Mesh Station can share its own network and data storage with other users and in this way users can earn MTC tokens through offering data storage to IoT enterprises Page 10 \x0cMTC OFFLINE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT Living in an era when mobile payment is prevailing any third party payment platforms can not provide payment MTC MESH services normally when the Internet is cut off or the signal is weak However MTC makes the offline payment Radio Transactions Task to everynode become reality for the first time At first\xef\xbc\x8cMTC offline payment will confirm the transaction quickly through Mesh Nodes And then it will use the MTC Mesh network to convey transaction data synchronously to offline nodes MTC users can transfer 500\xef\xbf\xa5 500\xef\xbf\xa5 500\xef\xbf\xa5 their signed

which are linking the MTC network and pledge a certain capital respectively Mesh Node is a distributed node supporting all blockchain network In the environment of offline users can make use of MTC BTC and ETH and other block chain assets to make payment it is similar to the Lightning Network of Bitcion and Rainden Network of Ethereum It functions as guaranty and it enables clients to conduct timely micropayment If Arron cheated others the tokens he has Arron/Tom/Jack\xe2\x80\x99s refrigerator/Ruby builds an offline Mesh pledged at the Mesh Node will be deducted and given to Tom network by MTC App Arron Payed 5 Tokens to Tom Mesh Node is totally neutral It supports almost all mainstream like Bitcoin Eth Eod and AE performing as the public node Arron transmit the transaction information which is encrypted by signature to the whole Mesh network and all the four parties will When Arron and Tom conduct offline transactions all the four parties store the encrypted transaction data will store the encrypted transaction information And once the Internet is available any party can make synchronical verification of the data to Once the Internet is available or any node links to the Internet it guarantee security and prevent the data from being tampered will synchronize the cryptographic transaction information to all Mesh Nodes and then transaction data will be verified and completed Page 12 \x0cMTC NEAR FIELD NON SENSE PAYMENT MTC network helps IoT enterprises such as vending machine and sharable charger to conduct transactions without internet in this case costs on
