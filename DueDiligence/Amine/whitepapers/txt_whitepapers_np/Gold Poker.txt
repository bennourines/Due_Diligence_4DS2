currency which incorporates masternodes Gold Poker can be identified purchased or sold on exchanges under currency symbol GPKR GPKR set of advantages give it robustness in terms of governance and long term stability At its core GPKR is designed engineered and evolved the best practices and developments to ensure users\xe2\x80\x99 transactional security and privacy Gold Poker is safer to use than

transactions with near zero transaction fees The online poker industry is relatively young and the Gold Poker team\xe2\x80\x99s focal point is to overwhelmingly witness an uptick in interactivity

Poker Coin provides you with your own personal wealth security and the means to secure your current and future transactions privately and instantly PROOF OF STAKE Gold Poker uses Proof of Stake protocol instead of Proof of Work The aim of Proof of Stake or Proof of Work in crypto is the need to establish a consensus of the blockchain PoS is more efficient in keeping the network secure than PoW To achieve consensus PoS requires nodes running wallet software proving that it has coins in the blockchain for verifying a block of transactions Participating nodes receive several blocks proportional to their stake per set period as a reward This means that the more participating nodes the more secure the network becomes due to the increased difficulty of owning a majority of coins in the network The focus of Proof of Stake is on validation By putting coins into the wallet and staking those coins users contribute the network security by process of validating the blocks and thus are rewarded when the stake is the validator for that block Proof of stake means a much less harmful impact on the environment from staking as opposed to PoW which is a drain on resources 4 \x0cGold Poker coin is based on the Quark hashing algorithm and there is no hardware capable of mining Gold Poker as of right now With a block time of 33 seconds it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot faster than many other cryptocurrencies out there PoS reward of Gold Poker cryptocurrency is 0 3 GPKR per block Gold Poker coin has a unique feature that aims to empower its investors Each GPKR block that ends with the digit 3 (e g 3 23 143 363 1783 etc ) is considered to be a superblock and receives 3 extra coins per block Hence PoS reward per superblock is 3 GPKR MASTERNODES Masternodes are mighty elements of the Gold Poker network Masternodes are the backbone of the Gold Poker network and are as important as staking We can think of them as our very own private savings accounts as we put 33 333 GPKR into a locked wallet and in return we receive rewards With each masternode the ability to protect your privacy increases as the community network becomes stronger Masternodes are what help secure the community and relay transactions across the network Masternodes are nodes running the same wallet software on the same blockchain to provide extra services to the network GPKR\xe2\x80\x99s maximum supply is 33 333 333 coins and for running a masternode partners should lock 33 333 GPKR coins The block time is 33 seconds Users receive 2618 blocks per day 250 blocks out of 2618 are superblocks This means that in total we can have only 1000 Gold Poker masternodes RUNNING GOLD POKER MASTERNODE To run Gold Poker masternode a user must lock 33 333 GPKR coins and he/she will be paid a certain portion of reward for each block The node should be online to help secure the network and be eligible for a reward 5 \x0cThose GPKR coins can be spent or moved at any time which simply removes the masternode from service and makes it ineligible to receive rewards Running a GPKR masternode can serve as passive income for you over the lifetime of the masternode Masternode reward of Gold Poker cryptocurrency is 3 GPKR per block As mentioned above Gold Poker coin has a unique feature that aims to empower its investors Each Gold Poker block that ends with the digit 3 (e g 3 13 123 253 1673 etc ) is called superblock and receives 30 extra coins per block Hence masternode reward per super block is 30 GPKR GOLD POKER SUPER / LUCKY BLOCK For staking Gold Poker or running Gold Poker masternode users receive block rewards Gold Poker shareholders daily receive 2618 blocks 250 blocks out of 2618 are called superblocks or lucky blocks Masternode Reward is 3 GPKR and Pos Reward is 0 3 GPKR per block When a block ends with digit 3 for example 13 23 33 103 233 353 1073 2413 etc it is considered a super block and receives extra coins Superblock reward is 33 Gold Poker 30 coins for
