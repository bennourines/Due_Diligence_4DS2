b Whitepaper 2018 Revolutionizing REAL ESTATE Global Investments with Crypto 1|Page ECOREAL WHITEPAPER 2018 \x0cAbstract Global Real Estate is to attract private investors and other funders who are interested in financing sustainable development and land rehabilitation The market is not as accessible to investors who can afford it as it should in the age of decentralization and digitalization As capital markets are becoming global markets real estate markets are no exception despite the difficulties posed by venturing overseas no investor can overlook the potential international investment holds out This urges the need for a new decentralized solution to capitalize on this potential Ecoreal\xe2\x80\x99s objective is to introduce cryptocurrencies into this overly regulated and slow market to facilitate investments and transactions on a global scale We plan on achieving this through the utilization of the core principles of the blockchain fairness accessibility transparency and trust while applying them to an already existing fully operational with an annual income and a substantial annual profit This will allow us to operate in our clients\xe2\x80\x99 best interest essentially guaranteeing them an entry into domestic markets that are traditionally restricted to foreign crypto investments while enabling them to contribute to the sustainable development of local communities Ecoreal\xe2\x80\x99s next generation investment platform will revolutionize and democratize investment and property development globally by facilitating investors to capitalize on their cryptocurrency and invest in tangible high sustainable ROI Our aim is to give crypto holders direct access to opportunities in domestic and international markets where they can utilize their crypto funds in a secure efficient and cost effective way This provides a seamless quick and low cost way to own real estate revenue streams for investors without any of the regulatory burdens associated with it It streamlines real estate investment by offering a venue for the capitalization of cryptocurrencies and their conversion in actual physical property This model facilitates entry of investors into the market by offering them a chance to utilize their vast cryptocurrency wealth Challenges Existing investment models have immense barriers to entry These are in part caused by the lack of standardized models on the regulatory and financial side which make cryptocurrency investing in real estate unfeasible for most investors Currently there are three main problems in the market \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Traditional real estate investment processes (including traditional Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs) are inefficient slow and expensive while denying investors direct control of their funds Real estate investing regulations are prohibitive and limit the potential pool of investors Investment size restrictions price out most interested investors One of the biggest differentiators between real estate and other major asset classes is liquidity Compared to exchange traded securities real estate markets are not as organized or efficient as other markets which results in slow transaction times and less efficient price discovery mechanisms The result is substantial capital trapped in less 2|Page ECOREAL WHITEPAPER 2018 \x0cliquid investments often concentrated in certain geographic areas devoid of domestic investment opportunities While many investors with excess liquidity would welcome the opportunity to invest in real estate with crypto currency There are elements of this investment process that will likely require the assistance of specialists and third party professionals to close such transactions The investor needs a complete and easily understood picture of rules regulations and requirements governing investment In some countries the investment code is simply a guideline and the investor must research and examine other legislation including the tax code labour laws property laws and rulings and judgments from relevant authorities Traditional vs Crypto The question however will be how these sources of capital choose to invest While the traditional real estate market is offering a blind pool investors can choose to invest in the more liquid open ended market where some managers are working to create service offerings built around the architecture of blockchain and cryptocurrencies to allow for easy wealth transfer The traditional real estate market channels offer a certain degree of stability but they are slow expensive and cumbersome With so much crypto capital waiting to be invested in the real estate market it is becoming clear that investors need a safe quick and functional alternative to allow for greater diversification across their investment exposure As the number of international investors interested in real estate investment by crypto currency is expected to increase Investors are increasingly turning to digital currency to hedge against the weakening EUR and USD helping the cryptocurrency rally to beat every major currency stock index and commodity contract since 2016 Solution By leveraging our industry expertise the power of blockchain and the potential of the seamless integration of cryptocurrency markets Ecoreal provides a safe transparent and secure venue for cryptocurrency holders to diversify their investment opportunities and capitalize on their wealth Market Potential Sustainable real estate investment and development is attracting investors Our Goal

payments in the traditional real estate investment market are Speed processing In many countries investment in real estate development can take more than a month Where the purchase involves KYC and traditional loan application this period can extend to several months These timelines exclude the buyer\xe2\x80\x99s search for an asset on the market It takes extended periods to finalize transactions because of the processes involved in collecting verifying and authenticating documentations from different databases Cut costs In making real estate transactions transparent and fast transactions on the blockchain can also reduce the costs involved This is possible through the elimination of third party services used by traditional financial institutions Reduce fraud Even with long and cumbersome processes of verification fraud is a common problem in the real estate market Acts of fraud are committed by investors developers and even financing agents Ultimately Ecoreal will

relating to the Issuer Investment range and performance The Issuer will be dependent upon the Directors successful implementation of the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s investment strategy and of generating attractive returns This implementation in turn will be subject to several factors including market conditions and the timing of investments relative to market conditions which are inherent in the property development industry many of which are beyond the control of the Issuer and difficult to predict A key factor influencing the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s investment returns will be the performance of the Portuguese property market and the property market in the South Portugal where the Issuer anticipates a high proportion of its investments taking place Adverse conditions in the property market in the South of Portugal may affect the profitability of the Issuer Risks related to the Issuer\xe2\x80\x99s investment in the property market The Issuer is exposed to general development risks The risks

operations of the Issuer Property market may experience a possible downturn Properties including those in which the Issuer may invest in the future can be relatively illiquid investments and are typically more difficult and/or take longer to realise than certain other investments such as equities gilts or bonds This lack of liquidity may affect the ability of the Issuer to realise valuation gains and to dispose of or acquire properties in a timely fashion and at satisfactory prices in response to changes in economic real estate market or other conditions While the Issuer monitors and updates its strategy to reflect market conditions the current economic conditions could materially and adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to dispose of properties A decline in the 6|Page

Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member State For a transitional period Austria is required (unless during that period it elects otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries Several non EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland) If a 8|Page ECOREAL WHITEPAPER 2018 \x0cpayment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of or in respect of tax were to be withheld from that payment the Issuer nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Bond as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax Secured

Issuer will be able to pay them If the Issuer or the project were to become insolvent there is a risk that some or all the interest and investment return due on the Ecoreal Estate Tokens will not be paid The issuer TaHa Limited Registration Number IC/2811/10 RAKFTZ UAE LEI 25490038431V6IB49A17 VAT (TRN) 100261184400003 Suite 1 Al Harti Building Al Mina Road Bur Dubai P O Box 116168 Dubai United
