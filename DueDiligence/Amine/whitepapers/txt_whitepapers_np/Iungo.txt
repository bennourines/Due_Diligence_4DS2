RIGHT The emergence of a plethora of powerful personal and business internet applications has transformed how businesses and consumers operate Explosive growth in internet consumption is being propelled by rapid advances in internet related infrastructure and services Despite the explosive growth major problems still persist for users to get onto this information superhighway One of the problems with local providers and local connectivity is that it limits on the go usage Mobile data plans implement usage restrictions and relatively high fees WiFi connection problems range from annoying nuances such as localized captive portals and injected advertisement to dangerous issues such as malicious hotspots and open access points where more or less everyone can eavesdrop on your unencrypted traffic Industry bodies and local providers fail to address the issues of seamless connectivity and roaming WHY CAN\xe2\x80\x99T WIFI JUST WORK RELIABLY AND SECURELY IUNGO is a globally distributed wireless internet service provider built with the help of a worldwide community We are bootstrapping a community where everyone can assume responsibilities and benefit from the associated rewards for running parts of the service delivery infrastructure Members can contribute by installing Public Wi Fi access points on their premises and/or running parts of the service infrastructure Our network will rely on the existing physical Internet infrastructure to carry end user traffic and will form an overlay network with unified end user identification authentication and billing systems We will use the Ethereum network to build trusted transparent accounting and payment infrastructure Our mobile applications will enable low granularity service usage accounting and compensation for services rendered Additionally to the software solution hardware will be offered as an option with pre setup routers available for those seeking a consumer friendly plug and play experience IUNGO will not limit itself to the technical research and development needed to deploy the network at global scale but will also build worldwide recognition of the brand A TOKEN BASED ECONOMY POWERED BY A CLOSED LOOP OF INCENTIVES Supply side participants in the IUNGO Network will be incentivized to provide internet access both in places with high traffic of smartphone users and remote workers (town centers cafes airports) but also in remote places in the developing world where there was no internet coverage before \xe2\x80\x94 imagine for example an enterprising citizen of a remote African village sharing his satellite based broadband with his community via IUNGO The advantages for the consumers in the developed world are obvious fast secure instantaneous WiFI internet access wherever they are in the world No forms to fill in no risk of personal data being stolen no extortionate hidden roaming charges \x0cWIRELESS INTERNET USERS CUSTOMERS BENEFITS \xe2\x80\xa2

IUNGO provides complete marketing and brand recognition recommended price for their location and set their preferred price for the service On one side of the market we have the existing wireless internet companies operating in the field with closed managed walled garden proprietary technologies On the other side we have small and medium businesses running unsecured networks without any controls and without any material marketing opportunities With open protocols an incentivized business model and the power of collaboration with blockchain payments this market is ripe for disruption 2 MARKET OPPORTUNITY The Global Internet Service Providers industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the global economy Explosive growth is being propelled by rapid advancements in internet related infrastructure and services as the emergence of a plethora of powerful personal and business internet applications has transformed how businesses and consumers operate Rapidly rising demand for broadband internet access and continued investment in wired internet infrastructure have helped propel the industry forward According to IBIS World research the annual growth rate between 2012 and 2017 was 8 8% The majority of Internet service providers are multi billion dollar Telecommunications companies like AT&T Verizon and China mobile \x0cGLOBAL ISP 879 MARKET GROWTH 783 697 584 620 484 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2 1 REGIONALLY BASED PROVIDERS Most of these Telcos and ISP\xe2\x80\x99s are regionally based with no convenient services for today\xe2\x80\x99s new generation of freelance workers digital nomads travelers vloggers etc It is a significant problem for them to access reliable and sufficient internet services outside of their home country Wi Fi password hunting filling forms in airports and public spaces unknown security or payment options poor download and upload speeds and data usage restrictions causing not just inconvenience but a measurable and material waste of time energy and money 2 2 SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESS NEEDS WiFi is now a must have amenity for every consumer facing business but for venue owners providing a reliable WiFi service is difficult Today\xe2\x80\x99s market offers a wide range of guest WiFi solutions but they are neither cheap nor simple for a small business to use Hotspot management tools suffer from usage complexity user base disparity and zero brand recognition The WiFi experience and monetization models are subpar solutions at best lacking centralized management operational tools and usage stats There is no existing service which provides easy Plug & Play usage and marketing tools 2 3 NETWORK EXPANSION AND CAPACITY As the demand for mobile broadband services continues to explode mobile wireless networks must greatly expand their capacities Simultaneously the revenues generated from data traffic are falling In this context service providers are calling for network strategies that alleviate the CAPEX burden of satisfying this demand One effective method of spectrum reuse by which mobile networks may be able to accommodate this exponential growth in demand is to offload certain segments of their traffic onto Wi Fi networks \xe2\x80\x94 which are connected by fixed broadband \x0caccess lines directly to the Internet By migrating data traffic from expensive cellular networks to WiFi infrastructure WiFi Offload implies dramatic savings on infrastructural costs and also enhances the user connectivity experience while providing value added WiFi services Wi Fi offload allows the portion of data traffic emanating from the mobile device that is destined directly for the Internet to be injected immediately into the Internet for routing to its final destination This traffic never touches the mobile operator s core network Also Wi Fi offload uses unlicensed spectra Further Wi Fi has access to a very substantial amount of spectrum \xe2\x80\x94 with allocations of several hundred MHz in the 2400 MHz and 5000 MHz bands Because of the low permitted power of Wi Fi signals it is possible to make very substantial reuse of these frequencies To take advantage of this many mobile wireless devices are capable of connecting to local Wi Fi networks in addition to signals from cell towers WiFi is now a must have amenity for every consumer facing business but for venue owners providing a WiFi service that adds value beyond connectivity while complying with regulations is difficult Complete WiFi service packages offer centralized management and operation from the cloud easy integration into the service portfolio compliance with security and regulatory obligations and increased revenue Revenue could be increased directly by selling WiFi access or upselling it as a part of package Alternatively additional charges for WiFi are not applicable in some markets due to the broad availability and competitive prices for LTE But even in these situations small and medium companies would benefit from a complete managed WiFi services toolkit for marketing purposes 3 BUSINESS MODEL IUNGO will operate initially with a freemium concept We are used to having free WiFi (in the developed world) but instead of standard security for providers and users some premium services will come at a cost For users premium services will include VPN for Total Privacy Enterprise grade security for traveling professionals and extreme high speed For businesses the premium services will include Marketing tools like user emailing services and in app advertising Premium services will be paid for in IUNGO tokens by both users and providers via the IUNGO wallet Additionally our Open Source software will allow us to integrate third party apps and services for both users and business These third party services will also leverage IUNGO tokens for payment therefore creating an ecosystem of applications operating on top of the core IUNGO protocol framework IUNGO will charge a 3% transaction fee from WiFi service providers or Third party services Additionally 1% will go to the Service Gateway operator (anyone can operate service gateways) This one percent will be distributed equally between all service gateways in a situation where multiple gateways are involved in the transaction chain Additionally 1% may go to local evangelists as a referral bonus The remaining 95% (or 96% in cases when there is no referrer) of the end user payment will go to the WiFi service provider \x0cPayments for the service will be made with ING coins within the system Coins will be available on a variety of exchanges The service gateway will have integrations with major exchanges to get ING coins instantaneously in real time for a seamless user experience ING coin owners can either use tokens for the service or sell them on Exchanges Despite the increasing usage of the IUNGO network and increasing numbers of users the supply and total number ING coins remains limited so the value should grow in parallel with the growth in adoption and usage of the network The Wifi Internet price is not directly related to the ING price The price will vary due to a variety of market specifics and other factors The IUNGO token will be used as a medium of exchange between fiat currency and the service provided In crafting the overall monetary policy of the IUNGO economy and tokens themselves (ING) we had several factors to consider We had to create enough tokens to power a truly global network while balancing this with a relatively scarce total supply and a clear and transparent fiscal policy so that investors can rest assured that the tokens will healthily and smoothly increase in value as the volume of network users and providers scales globally To that end we have decided that after the Token generation and sale event (ICO) no additional ING tokens will ever be created Furthermore all tokens offered for sale in the ICO that remain unsold will be burned FREEMIUM BUSINESS

with all features for 15000 sessions a month costs 195 USD \x0c6 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION 6 1 OVERVIEW The IUNGO will provide public Wi Fi access Service providers will be deploying Wi Fi sites by installing and registering access points for public use Service consumers will be able to use the IUNGO mobile wallet application or the IUNGO website to locate sites providing access to the IUNGO network When in radio proximity to an active access point a consumer s device will access internet services and pay for services used There will be two levels of access security and two payment methods available High communication security and more flexible payment terms will be available to end users willing to install a IUNGO mobile wallet application A fallback browser based authentication and payment method will be available via IUNGO cloud wallet for those without the mobile application installed All payments will be Token based and cleared on the public Ethereum network Wi Fi access will be delivered by Wi Fi access points installed and operated by service providers (IUNGO community members) Access points will provide customer devices with physical access to the Internet directly via existing connections to Internet Service Providers or indirectly via transport gateways operated by service providers having carrier status (with legal immunity from liability in respect to content transferred) Due to limited hardware resources access points will offload all end user identity verification and payment transaction to service gateways Service gateways will store configuration and state information of all paired access points/site controllers and will provide database replicas of all deployment sites proxy reputation feedback data and in concert with wallets will participate in off chain state channel based micropayment transactions and will be interacting with the Token contract on chain Each service gateway will embed an Ethereum node and will interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum platform on behalf of the \x0cwallets Anyone conforming to the qualification requirements and IUNGO operations rules will be able to operate service gateways and reap the associated rewards Service gateway operators will be able to define their own schemes for how they compensate service providers for services rendered IUNGO ORG will be operating the service gateways taking fixed commission from actual payments received from consumers There is a trust based relationship between the service provider and service gateway operator Service providers can freely choose which service gateway to pair with Payments from wallets to service gateways will use zero trust state channel based payments Payments from service gateways to service providers will rely on trust between them You would not be mistaken if the IUNGO service gateway operations looks to you very similar to the Ethereum mining pool operations you have miners (providers) running mining rigs (access points) contributing work (giving access to internet) to a benefit of a pool (service gateway) The pool (service gateway) operator reaps reward for a block mined (services provided) keeps the commission and distribute rewards to miner(s) (provider(s)) This model enables creative and competitive reward distribution schemes to flourish 6 2 WI FI DEPLOYMENT SITES The deployment site is a physical location where access points will be installed by or on behalf of the site operator Access points will provide a physical connectivity layer to the internet Depending on the size of deployment site it may take one to many access points to provide a good quality service To address different deployment site scale requirements three deployment strategies will be pursued In very small sites off the shelf wireless routers running IUNGO provided custom firmware will be directly connected to local internet service provider A selected set of the wireless router models will be supported by custom firmware to act as IUNGO network compatible access points For \x0caverage sized sites up to 8 access points can be daisy chained to cover a larger area The access points will be able to detect daisy chained neighbors and auto configure the bridging mode to relay traffic to the next neighbor while the nearest one to the ISP will function as site controller Small and normal sized site access points will have a dedicated port to connect the site owner\xe2\x80\x99s network devices (like Point of Sale equipment video cameras etc ) which will be completely isolated from the wireless network For bigger sites (hotels exhibition venues) with many access points installed a dedicated IUNGO site controller will be used to manage the site Only enterprise class access points with original vendor supplied firmware and sufficient capabilities or IUNGO partner provided IUNGO network compatible access points will be supported in big sites to reduce the chances of hard to debug problems Additionally \xe2\x80\x94 subject to compatibility of existing access points/switches in an existing Wi Fi deployment site \xe2\x80\x94 a IUNGO site controller may be installed to add IUNGO network capability to an existing Wi Fi deployment site IUNGO network compatible access points and site controllers will be made available for purchase from IUNGO ORG partners Very small sites will have a single access point paired with a service gateway Average size sites will have only the access point directly connected to internet service provider and acting as site controller paired with service gateway On bigger sites only the site controller will be paired Two Wi Fi networks (SSIDs) will be served by each access point one open/unencrypted network and one authenticated/encrypted network Only open/unencrypted network announcement beacons will be broadcasted No network advertisement beacons will be broadcasted by access points until the control channel to service gateway is established to reduce waste of time / battery charge of consumers connecting to an access point without access to internet Unencrypted wireless network will greet users with a captive portal and will offer users to choose either to install a mobile wallet application (to become able to connect to the secured network) or to connect to a secured IUNGO cloud wallet to pay and continue using unsecured Wi Fi network service Authenticated and encrypted network will only serve customers who have a mobile wallet installed A custom firmware for wireless routers will run a Linux based environment build on top of OpenWrt project Wireless interfaces will be managed by hostapd daemon The IUNGO developed local RADIUS daemon will serve hostapd to authenticate mobile wallet users using an EAP TLS authentication scheme and will derive encryption keys for each Wi Fi client session Each RADIUS server (running in access point or site controller) will have a security certificate installed A captive portal agent will take over DNS/HTTP traffic on unencrypted wireless network interface and will redirect consumers to the IUNGO wallet page until network access restrictions are lifted API daemon will expose HTTPS based API used by mobile wallet and cloud wallet to communicate with service gateway serving a site and all other IUNGO services A control agent will keep live connection to a service gateway and will control user access to the internet based on commands received from the service gateway A similar set of software will be deployed on the site controller \x0cSERVICE PROVIDER RISKS \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Monthly payments Cheating/attacks by users (no payment for usage from IUNGO) \xe2\x80\x94 solution constant network improvements monitoring tools client support (investigate reported issues) Single payment gateway for initial V1 Service gateway takes risks (places customer money into blockchain) 6 3 ACCOUNTS & IDENTITIES Mobile and cloud wallets service providers and service gateways will have self generated cryptographic pseudo identities IUNGO will reuse the identity mechanism employed in the Ethereum network each entity will generate an Elliptic Curve key pair A truncated hash of public key will serve as an entity identifier and also as an account number on the Token contract A key pair will be used to sign and verify signatures to derive shared session keys for encrypted communications and also to calculate the identifier of the Token holder All payment messages generated by wallets and relayed to the Token contract on the Ethereum network will be signed to prove the Token holder\xe2\x80\x99s intent to proceed with the request described in the message body The Token contract will be able recover identity information from this signature and will use it to validate received requests 6 4 IUNGO MOBILE WALLET The IUNGO mobile wallet is a dedicated software application which enables seamless connectivity to the IUNGO network When permitted by the consumer it will connect to any IUNGO access point or public IUNGO web service and will download the dataset of any IUNGO Wi Fi sites available nearby The downloaded dataset will be cached by the application for later use The application user will be able to see all IUNGO enabled Wi Fi sites and associated information on the map The IUNGO mobile wallet will be able to login to existing IUNGO cloud wallet accounts using a remote identity or create and use a locally generated identity The cloud wallet account can also be used to backup/restore encrypted locally generated identities When use of a local identity is preferred the application will generate a cryptographically secure pair of keys and will create a self signed X 509 standard based certificate to represent end user client identity to TLS servers When enabled the wallet application will start monitoring signal levels of all available IUNGO access points Wallet users will be able to define automatic connection policies with parameters such as the highest acceptable price per MB/per minute lowest acceptable bandwidth whether to give away your verified personal information (like name/surname e mail address age phone number) in exchange for internet access subsidized by access point operator or to disable automatic connections altogether When in automatic connection mode the application will \x0ctrack the quality of the currently connected session and the quality of beacons received from other available access points It will automatically switch over to other access points with better signal/noise ratio and matching connectivity policy when such an access point becomes available within radio reach After associating with the preferred access point the wallet application requests provisioning of internet access by negotiating service/payment terms with service gateway via an API reachable via the access point and by paying each time the previously paid amount is used up The mobile wallet tracks session length and the amount of information transferred to share service usage information with the reputation service When in manual mode the wallet will present the user with all connectivity choices available and will connect only with the user\xe2\x80\x99s consent This application will gradually be made available on the majority of popular operating systems and platforms like android iOS Mac OS X Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux 6 5 IUNGO CLOUD WALLET The IUNGO cloud wallet is a web service created and operated by IUNGO ORG The cloud wallet service enables access to the IUNGO powered network when the mobile wallet application is not installed on the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s device or mobile wallet application is not available on device\xe2\x80\x99s platform The cloud wallet service will be freely accessible via public internet and via any IUNGO access point When accessing a service site a consumer will be given the choice to either use an existing wallet account or create a new one by filling in the account registration form After logging in to an existing or new account a single page JavaScript app will be loaded to present a graphical user interface It enables consumers to create additional identities top up their Token accounts tied to identities transfer Tokens between accounts and to pay for access on IUNGO enabled Wi Fi sites Users will be able to use this interface to top up their Token account by purchasing tokens with their credit card and possibly other integrated payment methods Additionally a criteria based searchable map of all other IUNGO powered Wi Fi deployment sites will be available in the web app In case no mobile wallet has been installed on the mobile device the consumers must explicitly direct their device to connect to the open IUNGO network When connected a captive portal software running on the access point will redirect all attempts to visit http sites to IUNGO\xe2\x80\x99s cloud wallet webpage After logging in to the secure cloud wallet the user will be presented with services available on the currently used access point and respective service prices The consumer will be able to choose their preferred service type (subsidized/paid per time/paid per amount of data transferred) and optionally set a comfortable amount to spend (which automatically limits time available or enforces a data transfer quota) The session duration and data amount transferred will be displayed during the active session Consumers will be able to stop the service delivery and additional payments at any time with the push of the button \x0cIn the background the web application running in the browser will establish (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) connections to both the Access point API and to the Cloud wallet API It then will start forwarding encrypted communication messages between the Access Point and Cloud Wallet establishing a relayed communication channel between the two The cloud wallet will use this communication channel to emulate a mobile wallet and will use the same API on access point to identify and authenticate the deployment site learn services available negotiate and pay for services rendered After all parties are identified and authenticated a direct channel between cloud wallet service and service gateway serving access point may be established to reduce latency overhead of indirect communications 6 6 PAYMENTS PAYMENT CHANNELS All payments in IUNGO network will be token based IUNGO ORG will generate IUNGO tokens some time after the ICO event Tokens will be backed by ERC20 compatible smart contracts on the public Ethereum network To facilitate faster payment cycles an of chain micropayment mechanism will be utilized In addition to standard ERC20 functions available for invocation the IUNGO Token contract will expose functions needed to set up and synchronize one way zero trust state channel based off chain micropayment channels To open a payment channel one party will freeze a selected amount of tokens for the benefit of a receiving party A selected amount can also be equal to zero This frozen amount can be increased on chain by the sending party at any time However there will be no way to return frozen tokens back to the sender\xe2\x80\x99s account By monitoring events emitted by the Token contract the receiver can detect payment channel creation events and track the amount of Tokens frozen When the sending party decides to send an amount to the receiving party it generates a signed offer \x0cconfirming an un revocable intend to part with specified amount of Tokens to the benefit of the receiver and sends this message off chain to the receiver The message contains the sender\xe2\x80\x99s address the receiver\xe2\x80\x99s address the per sender receiver pair tracked serial number of the offer the amount sent a hash of previous attributes the sender\xe2\x80\x99s digital signature over hash and an opaque unsigned bytestring to carry the reason for payment By reusing a serial number the sender can increase the amount sent and update the reason for sending until actively requested by the receiver to use new serial number for further payments To settle the state on chain the receiver must sign the best offer received from the sender and invoke the Token contract with the countersigned offer as an argument When invoked to settle the offer the Token contract will check if the settlement should be processed First both signatures are checked for validity and the signers match sender and receiver Then the offer serial number is checked to determine if it is greater than the last offer processed by the contract to reject repeated attempts to settle the same offer Subsequently the frozen plus balance amount of the sender\xe2\x80\x99s account is checked to verify it is greater than amount offered If all checks are passed the serial number of the offer is saved in the state memory of the Token contract the commission for IUNGO ORG is calculated the amount promised is deducted from sender\xe2\x80\x99s account and the amount minus commission is deposited to receiver\xe2\x80\x99s account The commission amount is deposited to the benefit of IUNGO ORG It should be noted that an offer and all signatures are passed as input to settlement function so that the contract can be invoked by any 3rd party willing to pay for the gas used and still produce expected results Service gateways will act as an intermediary between wallets and the blockchain and will cover transaction gas costs The zero risk guarantee does not come without some responsibilities on the receiving side The receiver should always track the amounts frozen and offered by the sender and refuse to accept payment offers not covered by the frozen amount if it expects zero risk of not being payed The zero risk payment scheme allows the sender to trade the costs of updating the frozen amount (by invoking the contract) on chain more often for less risk of leaving unused tokens frozen It also helps to reduce the contract invocation gas costs covered by the receiver by being more time tolerant The receiver can trade a lower gas price for a longer wait time that the transaction will spend in pending transaction pool without increasing the risk of not being paid The same payment mechanism can be reused for payment channels based on trust In a trust based payment channel case the sender does not freeze any tokens The sender sends signed payment offers in the same way it would be done in the zero trust scheme It is up to the receiver to track the amount left in the sender\xe2\x80\x99s account and select the best time to settle on chain In this use case the receiver is never guaranteed that the sent amount will be available for settlement \x0cPAYMENT CHANNEL NETWORK We anticipate that a limited number of parties will be willing to operate service gateway serving a more significant number of deployment sites used by a substantial amount of consumers The chances of the same consumer consuming services provided by the same provider are too slim to require a direct payment channel between the consumer and the service provider To reduce the total number of payment channels it takes to pay for the services it makes sense for consumers to open zero risk payment channels only to the benefit of service gateways Service gateways will create a zero risk payment channel mesh between themselves to facilitate expedited payments for their users Service gateways will open trust based payment channels to process these payments to service providers Two payment scenarios become possible direct and transitive In the direct payment scenario a single gateway has a payment channel to both the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s account and the service provider\xe2\x80\x99s account open In case a direct payment is possible it is up to service gateway to decide how the reward will be divided between the service gateway and service provider In the transitive payment scenario a serving gateway only has a channel to the service provider and payments from the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s account can only be organized with some assistance from the service gateway who has a payment channel with the consumer The implementation of transitive payments will be based on hashed time lock concept In case of a transitive payment scenario a \x0cservice gateway on the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s end can keep a protocol fixed 0 5% commission for assisting payments to come through 6 7 SERVICES The IUNGO network\xe2\x80\x99s functionality relies on several services When connected to any of the IUNGO network\xe2\x80\x99s access points the customer\xe2\x80\x99s mobile device can interact with some of these services even when internet access is administratively prohibited The freely available services include site location discovery and mobile wallet Site registry service All access points/site controllers will be paired with SGW\xe2\x80\x99s When an access point or site controller is paired with a service gateway the ( geographical WGS84 and street address based) location information of the deployment site and a list of all BSSIDs of each access point in the deployment site is provided by the service provider Additionally all available services and service pricing information is recorded after the pairing procedure is complete The service provider will be allowed to change service list and pricing information no more often than once in 24 hours Each service gateway will collect and share site registration data with other service gateways Every service gateway will collect site registration data from all other service gateways to render a complete list of all deployment sites available around the world This data will be made available to consumers via site locator service Reputation registry Access points will record user session details like start/end timestamps of each session the amount of data transferred and will report it to service gateways The mobile wallet service will also gather same session details and will send it to service gateways for comparison Service gateways will collect and relay session data collected from deployment sites and mobile wallet users to the IUNGO reputation registry The reputation registry will run mediation process and will use complete event detection on gathered information to detect and filter out possible reputation fraud It then will calculate a reputation score (including reputation score error range) for each site The reputation score for each site will be made available to service gateways The Site locator service provides access to the site registry database It will share detailed information of nearby sites with IUNGO consumers using the mobile wallet or visiting the IUNGO public internet site Site information includes physical geo location street address services available (subsidized paid per time paid per MB) and their respective prices IUNGO reputation score value with error range and a site description supplied by the service provider Certificate authority IUNGO ORG will manage Public Key Infrastructure used to secure access to the network IUNGO ORG operated Network CA will act as a trust anchor to wallets and mobile device Wi Fi WPA supplicants to ensure consumer\xe2\x80\x99s device is connecting to a legitimate access point (participating in IUNGO network) The Network CA will sub delegate certification rights to service gateways to issue certificates to access points/site controllers The certificate lifetime will \x0cbe limited to one month for access points/site controllers and 6 months for service gateways Certificate revocation published by Network CA will describe all revoked service gateway certificates 6 8 INFRASTRUCTURE ENTITIES Transport Gateway Service providers may be limited by service agreements with their internet service providers to not provide service to unknown 3rd parties and also can be held legally responsible for behavior of their end users To limit exposure to legal risk service providers may choose to redirect all end user internet traffic through a transport gateway operated by other parties and/or other countries There are many options with different tradeoffs of what kind of transport protocols should be used and what legal risk types need to be avoided We will conduct further research on needs and options related to how transport gateways will be integrated into the IUNGO network during the MVP phase Service gateways The service gateway is actually a collection of services acting in concert with deployment site hardware and other service gateways to enable a unified global user experience It plays a major role in the IUNGO network as a middle ground solution where most of the cost reduction and performance scaling benefits of a centralized service can be had without sacrificing diversity and service availability Each qualified service gateway operator will have a chance to come up with creative approaches to user onboarding reward sharing Token sale and other value added to stay competitive Running a service gateway comes with it\xe2\x80\x99s costs operators will need hardware resources to run the software low latency high bandwidth connection to internet and Ether to pay gas fees for invoking Token contract on Ethereum network Strict adherence to IUNGO operations rules covering allowed and disallowed operational practices will be enforced by IUNGO ORG in order to protect the legitimate interests of the service consumers The service gateway will at least run a node of distributed site registry reputation data collection agent one to many instances of site locator service an intermediate certificate authority a web based management site for service providers and an Ethereum node IUNGO will provide open protocol descriptions for all interfaces used and a dual licensed open source reference implementation of all software needed to run basic functioning service gateway A commercial license will be available for those seeking to create closed derivatives 7 CROWDSALE DETAILS The IUNGO crowdsale and the corresponding token creation process will be organized around smart contracts running on
