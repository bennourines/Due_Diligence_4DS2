The person introduced the victim to the crypto trading site called trusflow.com and taught them how to exchange cash for crypto assets and then transfer funds to the site for trading. The victim tested the site with $1,000 and believed they had made a profit.

Over a couple months, the victim deposited more money into their account on trusflow.com and believed they had made nearly $500,000 in profit. But when the victim tried to withdraw money from their account, trusflow.com demanded they pay a $100,000 “large volume trading commission” first.

"DAF Finance Financial Institute
OPNCOIN","Several Californians report a WhatsApp investment group called DAF Finance Institute. The group claimed to offer a new crypto trading product they had developed called “AI Profit Algorithms 4.0”, available through a crypto asset trading platform referred to as OPACOIN, OPNCOIN, or OPN-GO. The group claimed they had received funding for the product from legitimate sources such as FINRA, and that the product was in the final stages of testing. DAF Finance Institute promised members that the product would allow them to trade cryptocurrencies before the initial coin offering (ICO’s) and would help them make large profits after the ICO occurred. DAF said that the volatility of the crypto market brought potential for immense profit.

At first, the group gave members a $500 trial investment to use on the OPACOIN platform. Several Californians report watching their trial investments grow, and that they were even able to successfully withdraw the initial $500. After the trial investment period, DAF group members were encouraged to invest $5,000 on the site. One victim tried to withdraw their funds after trading with the $5,000 investment but was denied. Another victim invested $22,000 at this stage based on the promise that they would be fully reimbursed if their investment failed. However, when they tried to withdraw, they were told they could not because one of their trades was “executed late”.

After a few months of trading on OPACOIN, DAF members were encouraged to invest an additional $50,000. One victim signed a $50,000 investment contract with DAF Finance Institute, where DAF guaranteed a 300% return on the victim’s investment over just a three-month trading period. Another victim invested $50,000 into their account, but was told that their investment had completely failed, resulting in a total loss. This victim was encouraged to keep silent about their losses, and they lost access to the WhatsApp group shortly after.","Fraudulent Trading Platform

( cont.)","Another victim told the group that they wanted to invest, but did not have $50,000. This victim was told the group could lend them the money, and that the loan could be repaid with trading profits. But when the victim later tried to withdraw some of their profits from this $50,000 “loan”, the platform threatened that they needed to repay the loan with outside funds or be sued. That victim then withdrew enough money from their 401(k) retirement account to cover the “loan”, but suffered heavy withdrawal penalties in the process. The victim was promised that their trading gains would be sufficient to cover those penalties. However, when the victim tried to withdraw their profits a second time, they were told they first had to pay a 10% fee to cover taxes, and that this fee must also be paid using outside funds. At that point, the victim’s contacts in the group stopped communicating with them, and they have since been unable to withdraw their funds.

Meanwhile, after the $50,000 round, other members were pressured to invest $150,000 more toward ICO subscriptions on OPACOIN. One member did invest the additional $150,000, but when they tried to withdraw funds, they were told they had to first pay a $20,000 fee. That victim has also been unable to recover their funds.

The consumer deposited amounts of 122, 13,322, 1,322, and 322 USDT, each time receiving an equal bonus and accumulating 253,666 ESP tokens.

Issues began when the consumer attempted to withdraw 20,000 USDT; Erspce's app experienced downtime, and the site briefly went offline. When services resumed, all pending withdrawal requests were denied due to a supposed system error. Erspce then requested a 30 USDT deposit to facilitate withdrawals, which the consumer declined. Despite initiating a new withdrawal request, it remained unprocessed for over five days, exceeding Erspce’s advertised 72-hour timeline to honor withdrawal requests.

The consumer’s Erspce account interface showed a balance of about 40,000 USDT, but TRONSCAN reflects only $0.01, indicating that the funds were transferred out to an unknown wallet without the consumer’s knowledge. No funds have been recovered.","Fraudulent Trading Platform

The DFPI cautions that, traditionally, when interacting with someone you do not know through a social media or messaging platform, one potential indicator that the other party may be scammer could be an aversion on their part to engage in live interactions (e.g. meeting in person, having video calls). However, that alone does not confirm fraudulent activity, as scammers may use various tactics to manipulate their appearance, such as using actors/actresses to engage in live interactions on their behalf. In addition, please note that with ongoing advancements in AI, scammers may become increasingly adept at leveraging generative AI and deepfake technologies to manipulate their appearance and deceive potential victims.","Fraudulent Trading Platform

(cont.)","Over the course of a few weeks, Maria provided trade signals that appeared to produce consistent profits. Encouraged by the initial success and seamless withdrawals to their Coinbase account, the victim decided to invest larger amounts. Eventually, they deposited $32,000, aiming to reach the $50,000 threshold required to fully join the group. But in just 20 minutes, the victim reported that they lost the entire amount deposited into bdswissasias.com, apparently due to an open trading position going south.

The victim solicited help from the group to recover the lost funds. Over the next week, the victim rebuilt their balance to $40,000 after depositing an additional $20,000, followed by another $15,000. Following David's trading signals, the balance eventually reached $207,000.

But when the victim tried to withdraw funds, they were told their ""credit score"" had dropped by one point and they needed to pay a $10,000 ""recharge"" fee to restore it to 100 points. After complying, they were informed that the delay had caused their score to drop further, and now an additional $50,000 was required to bring the score back to 100.

The victim has not recovered any of the $100,000 they deposited on the platform. The website is no longer operational.

The first victim met “LinXinXin” and “Scarlett” online, who claimed to be “consortium administrators” for the crypto trading platform, h5.coinmate.vip.com and encouraged the victim to open an account. Over a period of months and under the instructions of LinXinXin and Scarlett, the victim deposited funds to the platform. All told, they transferred $650,000 to the platform and has not been able to recover any of that.

The second victim met “Leena” via text message. Leena claimed to be a Hong Kong native that moved to Boston to work for a prominent consulting firm. After a few conversations, Leena invited the victim to join an investing group on Telegram and open a trading account at h5.coinmatevip.com. The victim then transferred crypto assets to the platform. Over the course of three months, the victim participated with members of the group chat in various option trades on the platform. At one point, the victim believed their account balance had increased to $1.1 million. But when the victim tried to withdraw their money, the platform demanded an upfront fee of $133,000. All told, the victim transferred $330,00 to the platform and has not been able to recover any of it.

The third victim also reported being invited to join an “investment consortium” on Telegram. At the direction of the group chat, they opened an account and transferred funds to a UK-based trading platform called coinmatevp.com. After a few months, the investment group on Telegram disbanded, but the victim was still able to trade and their account experienced significant growth on the platform. But when the victim tried to withdraw funds, the platform demanded they pay “tax and consortium fee payments”. The victim paid, but coinmatevp.com informed them that their funds were frozen by the “World Anti-Money Laundering Task Force (FATF)” due to unusual trading activities and they would need to pay an additional $50,000 to confirm they were not involved in money laundering activities. At this point the victim realized that the platform is a scam and reported the incident. It is noted that the victim received the money laundering notification from coinmatevip, not the intergovernmental organization Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The victim has not been able to recover any of their money.

The “Fast Track” service required that the victim wire a deposit to the site equal to the amount they wanted to withdraw. The victim deposited the amount but was told that it was not accepted because the amount was not exactly equal to the withdrawal amount. The victim tried to deposit additional sums twice more, and each time was told the same.

After reading the messages on the group for several weeks, the victim reached out to the Professor to set up an account on tnegcoin.com.

Mollie helped the victim set up accounts on multiple legitimate trading platforms, and AMGEX Trading platform, teaching them how to buy crypto using their bank account.

Following Mollie's instructions, the victim bought $1,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and transferred them to the AMGEX platform for trading. After earning $250, Mollie showed the victim how to withdraw from AMGEX and transfer the funds back to a legitimate crypto exchange, which was then sent to their bank account.

Over a few months, the victim and Carmen developed an online friendship and conversed primarily through WhatsApp. Eventually, Carmen brought up trading cryptocurrencies as a way to alleviate the victim’s financial burdens and offered to guide the victim into the world of cryptocurrency investing. Carmen instructed the victim to set up an account on a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange to purchase Ethereum, transfer funds to a Trust Wallet account, and then directed the victim to transfer funds to the fraudulent trading website “darwave.com”. Over the course of a few months, the victim made repeat investments into the platform totaling over $30,000. During this time, the victim was assured that their money could be made back and at one point Carmen offered to send $41,000 of her own assets, plus an additional $8,000 that the victim previously sent to Carmen as a good faith measure, to supplement the victim’s investment on the platform. After the alleged transfer, the victim was led to believe that they had $234,000 USDT in their account balance as a result of the trade.

However, when the victim tried to withdraw, the website informed them that their account was suspended and that their assets were frozen. After contacting the website’s customer service, the victim was told that their withdrawal would only be approved when the victim provided an additional payment outside the platform to pay off the short-term capital gains tax on their profits. At this point the victim realized the fraudulent nature of the website and reported the incident. The website “darwave.com” is no longer operational.","Pig Butchering Scam

The victim was then contacted again by the original scammer. The scammer told the victim that she could help resolve the issue with Kenskr by lending the victim $7,000. However, the scammer told the victim that they would have to transfer $3,000 to the scammer before they would help.

coinproxus.com","A California victim reports a crypto asset scam that began after one of the victim's friend’s Instagram accounts was hacked. Unaware of the hack, the victim saw on Instagram that their friend had made a lot of money from someone named “Adriana Montez” who claimed to be making lots of money by investing in crypto assets. Adriana reached out to the victim and asked them to contact her. Thinking this was someone that the victim's friend knew, the victim contacted Adriana, who explained that she made money by investing in crypto assets through a platform that generated 10 times the capital in profits, and that she could cash out every day. Adriana continued to send text message via Telegram and eventually convinced the victim to send $2,000 via Zelle. Next, Adriana instructed the victim how to register and open an account on www.coinproxyus.com. Adriana uploaded a screenshot of the $2,000 that was supposedly deposited there and showed the victim their profits were increasing on the platform. Adriana encouraged the victim to cash out $100, the daily limit, which really showed up in his bank account. Adriana said that proved the account was fluid, that the platform worked, and that the victim would be able to get their money back. Adriana told the victim his account was only at the “Basic” level, and that if the victim upgraded to the “Bronze” level they would have access to unlimited withdrawals, just like their friend had done. Still unaware of the hack, the victim contacted their friend on Instagram who confirmed the process and stated that the victim would be so happy with all that money and not worry about anything. The victim asked their friend to give him a call, but the victim's friend replied that they were busy. Soon after, the victim's “friend” contacted them on Instagram and said he got a new phone number. Soon, Adriana contacted the victim and told him to transfer $3,000 onto the platform to qualify for the “Bronze” level. But when they did that, Adriana said they misunderstood and it was supposed to be $5,000. The victim asked Adriana if they could start taking out some of their profits, but she encouraged the victim to wait until the profits reached $20,000. The victim decided to try to take some of the daily $100 withdrawals to reduce the victim's balance, but this time they were unsuccessful. The victim then asked Adriana why they couldn’t withdraw the daily limit, and she told them the pay outs would only disturb the trades, so they had to be patient and wait until they reached their goal of $20,000 to cash out. The next morning Adriana told the victim their account balance had reached $20,689 and they could now withdraw their funds. But when the victim tried to do so, they received an email from the platform saying they needed to file a trading certificate and provide personal information. The victim reached out to Adriana to ask how to get their money back without providing their personal information but she never responded. The victim later found out their friend’s Instagram account had been hacked and that it was a scam. The website is no longer operational.","Hacking

"Sundell Ltd
Sundell FX
Sundell-fx.com","Two Californians complained separately about the gold trading platform, Sundell Ltd. (Sundell-fx.com).

The first victim was contacted on LinkedIn by “Amelia” who expressed interest in the victim’s home country of Korea and struck up a casual conversation about life experiences there versus the U.S. The conversations eventually switched to WhatsApp and they continued to talk about many subjects. The victim even had a video call with Amelia. At some point, Amelia told the victim she wanted to be the victim's mentor for financial investments, introducing them to “gold future trading” which they had never heard of. Amelia showed the victim a demo trading platform at Sunderll-fx, and said they could make a profit. Amelia kept asking the victim to transfer more money so they could make more profits. Eventually, the victims’ account showed a profit of $83,000 dollars. But when the victim attempted to withdraw some funds from the trading platform, their request was denied and the platform asked them to provide an Identification card and bank account for verification process. The victim called their bank, who advised against this. The victim’s account was eventually deactivated. The victim did some research and found out Sundell-fx was a scam platform and there were other victims who could not withdraw their money. The victim lost $141,000 to this scam.

The second victim provided screen shots and copies of emails from Sundell showing how elaborate the scam was. The website claimed that Sundell Ltd was a UK registered online trading platform providing online trading for cryptocurrency, various foreign currencies, and precious metals (gold, silver, etc.). Sundell Ltd also claimed it was registered as a money services business in the US.

This victim describes themselves as an overseas option trader and used the Sundell platform for trading gold options. They were able to make a few withdrawals, which made them feel comfortable, though the withdrawals represented less than 10% of their investment. The victim attempted to make another withdraw, but this time Sundell froze his account and demanded he pay a “UK personal income tax” on the entire amount invested. Not only that, but the platform said he couldn’t use his profits to pay the tax, but had to contribute new money, and further, they had to do this before the deadline of about a week or they would permanently freeze their account and take away their assets. The victim's account balance at the time was more than $16 million, and the tax they demanded was almost $800,000. The victim was unable to pay the money before the deadline, so their account was frozen and showed a zero balance. The victim lost more than $350,000 on the platform plus their expected profits, and the website is no longer operational.

The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) issued a Consumer Alert against Sundell-fx, and others, alleging they were part of a cryptocurrency scam ring operating out of Los Angeles and San Francisco. (See the link here: https://dfi.wa.gov/consumer/alerts/alleged-cryptocurrency-scam-ring-operating-out-los-angeles-and-san-francisco).

First, they required him to pay a 20% “tax” on his profits. Next, he needed to provide a copy of his government ID card and post a $10,000 (purportedly “refundable”) payment in order to verify his identity, after which they accused him of “insider trading” and said he needed to stake 50% of his $75,000 deposit, which would be returned if he was cleared of all charges. No money has been returned to him.

The second victim from California met a man online who offered to teach the victim how to trade in crypto options. After the victim created a crypto wallet and deposited money in Coinrus.com, the scammer had the victim convert his entire balance and trade only using the USDT stablecoin currency. The scammer manipulated trade results to make it look like the victim was making good profits with each trade. The scammer aggressively pressured the victim to add additional funds, and even agreed to transfer $70,000 USDT to the victim’s account after the victim nearly lost everything in a bad trade. The only condition was that the victim would need to invest an additional $20,000, which he did. When the scammer didn’t show up to a planned in-person meeting, the victim got suspicious and tried to withdraw his money, but his request was delayed by Coinrus.com. Later the victim was told that his account was “at risk” and he needed to pay $70,000 to resolve the issue. He declined to pay, and days later, his account history had been erased from the servers. He lost approximately $70,000.

A third Californian was introduced to Coinrus.com by someone he knew as “Yan Xiaoyu.” She and the victim had been trading in crypto for several months with excellent results. Once “Yan Xiaoyu,” who also uses the handle “@Anna255h” on social media, had gained the victim’s trust, she persuaded him to deposit more than $200K on the platform for their trades. The first few months went well, and the victim’s balance reflected a profit of more than $500K. He had successfully made two withdrawals totaling $30K from his account, but when he tried to make a third withdrawal, the website said he needed to pay $132K in taxes before he could get the money. The victim refused to pay the fees and has since lost all access to his account and he cannot reach customer service for the website. He did receive an email stating that they had taken control of his account and were donating his entire $731K balance to charity. All told, this victim invested and lost more than $200K.

A fourth victim met and befriended “Anna” online. After a couple of weeks, “Anna” introduced the victim to cryptocurrency trading, suggesting it would be an easy way for them to make money for their planned future together. At “Anna’s” urging, the victim transferred his $46,000 life savings to the account she told him to open and invested it. The victim’s account balance appeared to grow to more than $150,000 in less than a month, so he attempted to transfer it back to crypto, taking screenshots of the transaction. When he followed up on the transfer, he was told that he entered the deposit address incorrectly, and the website demanded 20% of the transferring funds as a fee for dealing with his mistake. The victim declined to pay the fees.","Pig Butchering Scam

The victim was able to complete two small withdrawal transactions from www.cmecoinvip.com, recouping a total of $150 of the money he invested at “Lilly’s” direction. After that, Lilly asked the victim to invest even more money, but he declined. All further attempts to withdraw his money were unsuccessful.

Angela then asked that they continue their conversation on Telegram, where she told the victim she was originally from Belarus but now ran her own Fashion Design company in San Francisco. She told the victim about her financial success and how well she had done with cryptocurrency.

“Angela” offered to teach the victim about trading in cryptocurrency, specifically with the USDT stablecoin, and told him about her uncle, who was purportedly a successful Contract Trader. As described to the victim by “Angela,” Contract Trading involved a complex analysis to maximize the return on investments ranging from $5,000 to $500,000, over short trading intervals lasting between 30 seconds and 5 minutes. “Angela” demonstrated the process by showing the victim that she had invested 50,000 of the stable coins for 30 seconds, appearing to earn approximately $10,000 profit. She insisted that the victim was lucky to have the opportunity to learn from her uncle’s system and convinced the victim to download a trading app called “Kuba” from the site www.kubhe.vip and install it on his smartphone. Shortly after he installed the app, he was directed to install an updated version from the website www.kubhy.vip/download.

“Angela” continued to identify the trading opportunities for the victim to participate in and convinced him that if they increased the amount of his investment, his profits would be even larger. As a result, the victim transferred over $49,000 to the trading app. When the victim attempted to cash out his profits, Kuna employees declined the transfer and would not release the funds until the victim paid an unspecified “tax” within 7 days. The victim refused and contacted his bank, who advised him to consider those funds irretrievably lost, because he would likely never see that money again.

After “Jenny” walked him through the process of registering for the trading platform and setting up his wallets, the victim made a couple of small “proof of concept” trades totaling several thousand dollars. Although skeptical, he felt more confident after he was able to withdraw $2,000 without any issues. After that, “Jenny” urged the victim to increase his investment for better profit. Investing another $200,000, the victim soon saw his account balance rise to $450,000.

After agreeing to form an investment “partnership” with the victim, “Jenny” appeared to invest $550,000 of “her own” money into the victim’s account, bringing the reported balance of that account to $1M. After more trading sessions, the balance increased to $4.7M, at which point the victim wanted to withdraw the proceeds.
Upon submitting a withdrawal request, the victim was notified by the trading site that his account was locked, and they would only release the funds if the victim deposited an amount equal to 10% of the balance of his account within 15 days. The victim made the deposit, and waited for his money to be released, but the trading site then told him that his account was locked again, unless the victim deposited an additional $400,000. The trading site then offered to put half of the money to unlock the account, if the victim paid the remaining $200,000.

Once all of these unexpected fees had been paid, the victim attempted to withdraw $150,000. He has repeatedly attempted to withdraw his money but has not been able to recover any funds.

She seemed very knowledgeable in finance and the victim trusted her to help set up an account with a defi protocol on the website: defi.wallet-usdt-eth-erc20.com. He initially put in $1,000.00 to test the system, and since it appeared to be working, he put in an additional $21,000.00. He though he got great results with the website showing mining rewards accruing in his account which were then deposited directly into his wallet on MetaMask. The wallet showed his initial investment funds as always available, and each day he got mining rewards (about 2%) that could be extracted and put into a wallet linked to a so-called “mining pool”. He chatted daily with Jenny about life and crypto. Then the website advertised a reward scheme that offered 12.5 Ethereum coins for every $100,000.00 invested into the platform. Jenny pressured him quite intensely for almost a month to invest so they could get the reward, but he couldn’t come up with the funds. At some point, he liquidated his IRA and put all the rest of his available money into the website account. His total investment at that time was about $37,000.00, and he believed he had earned rewards of $60,000.00. Then he got a message from the website offering a chance to double his rewards in 7 days. He sent the funds to another crypto address outside and was shown that his account had grown to $80,000.00. He wanted to withdraw his funds then, but when he tried, the website demanded he pay taxes of $12,700.00, so he did. Then, he was told he needed to invest an additional 50% of the total asset amount, (another $40,000.00) so that he could take out the $80,000.00 he believed he was in his wallet.

After a few weeks of “trading” on the site, Serena said it was time to withdraw the funds. but when the victim tried to do so, he got a message from customer support that he needed to pay taxes, and the website would forward them to the IRS on his behalf. The victim did not fall for this but shortly after the site disappeared with all his money, which was about $14,000. The second victim was involved in WhatsApp group chat, where the group was talking about profits, they made from trading on a platform called ICEX (Intercontinental Exchange). When the victim asked questions, a couple by the name of “Paul” and “Anna Chen Lin” took turns answering them, as did “Nanoor” and “Kawtargh.” Eventually the victim was invited to an online Discord and Telegram community chat group, where they shared a link to ICEX link. “Anna” demonstrated live trading on the icextee.top platform, Through the Discord Channel, the victim was then directed to create an ICEX account and Crypto.com trading account and was walked through how to trade. On his initial investment of $500, he was shown he made a profit of $3,000. After that, the victim took out personal loans totaling $140,000, and borrowed money from friends, hoping to increase profits. At some point, he believed he had made an $890,000 profit. But before he could access anything, he was first asked to pay an “Accounts Verification fee” of $17,000, then $6,000 for taxes.

She built up the victim’s trust and claimed to have an aunt who managed a successful cryptocurrency analyst group for a large investment company.

The victim made an initial investment, and after he made a profit, he was able to withdraw the crypto assets and even convert them to money. The victim then proceeded to invest more money. At some point, the FoundryPro.net platform told him that because the profits in his account were greater than his principal invested, he needed to pay an “absenteeism fee” to cover the mining costs. The victim paid that, then attempted to withdraw $1 million from FoundryPro.net and deposit into Binance.US. Although the FoundryPro.net website showed the transfer was successful, the money never showed up in his Binance wallet. When he complained, he was told he needed to pay a 5% “recovery fee” or $50,000. After this, he was told his FoundryPro.net account was “frozen” because he had requested too many withdrawals in too short a period. Then, he lost contact with both FoundryPro.net, and Xingzhao.

Victim reached out to “Cherry” and told her she was interested in investing. Cherry was very smart and said she mined for bitcoin. She also claimed to be an account manager and told the victim she would give her a high return on her investment. Victim sent $2,000 to purchase Bitcoin and transferred it to Cherry who told her she had set up an account with her trading company, 247tradegrowth.net. At some point, the victim’s account balance showed she had made a profit of $21,800. But when she attempted to cash out, the victim was told that she had to pay a withdrawal fee of $3,650. She then contacted Cherry, who convinced her to invest another $1,000 worth of bitcoin because he had done so well. After a week, her account showed a profit of $45,800. This time, when Cherry told her she needed to pay a withdrawal fee, the victim sent $3,700. She had to borrow the money and followed a list of instructions Cherry sent but was told her withdrawal was pending. She contacted Cherry again, who told the victim to give the “Support Team” access to her Instagram account including back up codes. The victim soon received a message from the Support Team saying she needed to pay more fees, up to $12,400 in order to upgrade her account to comply with SEC regulations as her account balance was so high. She called Cherry and pleaded with her that she needed her money back, but Cherry didn’t reply. At this point, the victim realized this was a scam and reset her Instagram account again. She found out from Instagram that the Support Team twice tried to access her account for more money. Later, she learned that her Driver’s License and Social Security Number had been placed on the dark web. She also learned that the friend who had contacted her about Cherry also had had their account hacked, and so it wasn’t even really her friend who first contacted her.","Liquidity Mining Scam

The victim purchased Tether USDT crypto currency from Crypto.com, then connected his offline wallet to the exchange and began trading USDT/Bitcoin futures contracts. The victim believed he was trading very successfully, so he transferred more money into the platform and believed his acquaintance was also crediting money into his account as well. The victim made a small withdrawal early in the process to ""test"" the process and his withdrawal went through. But after more ""successful"" trades, the victim attempted to make a larger withdrawal. At that point, the exchange informed him it did not allow such a large withdrawal, citing “anti-money laundering” protocol established by the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau,” which required him to trade at least 50% of their deposits in their trading account within 24 hours of attempting a withdrawal. So, the victim deposited more funds into his account, and was told his acquaintance had transferred money into his account as well, so he could withdraw the amount he wanted. The exchange called this process a “recharge.” Again, the victim believed had made more successful trades and now had enough money to make his planned withdraw as he met the minimum trade threshold. This time, the exchange denied the withdrawal request, again citing the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau” concern that his account was being used for money laundering, effectively freezing my account to withdrawals. The victim asked how he could prove he was not a money launderer and was told by the exchange he would need to deposit into his wallet the exact amount he had been trying to withdraw, which was $650,000. The victim contacted his trading partner/acquaintance, and she stated her account had also been frozen and that he would need to comply with the exchanges’ instructions. He asked customer service what to do and was told if he transferred the $650,000 and provided a screen shot of the balance, they would release the funds. The victim took out a loan and deposited about half of the $650,000 in two installments into what he believed was a safe account for such purposes. But as soon as the second deposit went in, without his consent or knowledge the exchange moved the money into his trading account. He protested but was told this was to secure his funds while he finished the verification process. And that the only way to access his money would be to deposit the remaining funds to get to $650,000, although they said they would allow him to trade in the account – just not make withdrawals. His money is now trapped, and he is concerned that there might be problems with the exchange. He is also suspicious about his acquaintance, who told him she followed the exchange’s instructions, borrowed money, and was finally able to withdraw her money and thus encouraged him to borrow more money as well.","Pig Butchering Scam
