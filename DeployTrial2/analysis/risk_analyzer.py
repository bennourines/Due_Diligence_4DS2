# Example Risk Analysis Prompt (Customize heavily based on requirements)
RISK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert AI assistant specializing in identifying risks within cryptocurrency projects based on provided documents. Analyze the following context documents thoroughly.

**CONTEXT DOCUMENTS:**
---
{context}
---

**TASK:**
Identify and categorize potential risks associated with the project described in the context documents. Focus on areas such as:
1.  **Tokenomics Risks:** Inflation, centralization of supply, utility flaws, vesting schedules.
2.  **Technical Risks:** Smart contract vulnerabilities (mention if audits are discussed), scalability issues, protocol design flaws.
3.  **Team & Governance Risks:** Anonymous team, lack of transparency, centralized control, unclear governance process.
4.  **Market & Adoption Risks:** Lack of clear use case, strong competition, poor community engagement (if mentioned).
5.  **Regulatory Risks:** Potential conflicts with regulations (based on project description, location if mentioned).
6.  **Security Risks:** Past incidents (if mentioned), lack of security measures discussed.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide a structured report summarizing the identified risks. For each risk, briefly explain the finding and reference the source document(s) if possible (e.g., "[Source: whitepaper.pdf]"). If no significant risks are found in a category based *only* on the provided context, state that clearly for the category. Do not invent risks or use external knowledge.
