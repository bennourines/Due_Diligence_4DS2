Ronin Network - REKT,624000000,03/23/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/ronin-rekt/,"Ronin Network -  Tuesday, March 29, 2022 Ronin -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh Poly Network has been toppled from the top spot. ~$624M stolen from Ronin Network. And nobody noticed for six days. When they did eventually realise, the Ronin team announced that: “We discovered the attack this morning after a report from a user being unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge.” Imagine how the Ronin team felt when they found out that the bridge had been drained nearly a week earlier. The new biggest cryptocurrency hack ever. But will the attacker be able to launder the loot? With the rising popularity of Axie Infinity, Ronin was launched as an Ethereum side-chain in Feb 2021 to provide the fast, cheap transaction throughput necessary for a p2e game to function. In order to maximise TPS, decentralisation and trustlessness were neglected in favour of a Proof of Authority model in which just nine validators put their reputation at stake, rather than processing any power or funds. Of these nine validators, a consensus of five is necessary to approve deposits and withdrawal transactions. Four of the validators are operated by Sky Mavis, meaning that in the event of a security breach, just one more signature was needed to control the network. Although the official Community Alert doesn't give details on how the Sky Mavis validators were compromised, it does point out the vulnerability that led to the attacker gaining control of the required fifth signature. The attacker was able to gain access to the additional validator due to an arrangement made between Sky Mavis and the Axie DAO in November last year. A gas-free RPC node was established to ease costs for users during a period of heavy network traffic in which the AXS price peaked. This required Axie DAO approving Sky Mavis validators to sign transactions on their behalf. Despite the arrangement only lasting until the following month, the whitelist access was never revoked, allowing the attacker who had compromised Sky Mavis validators to use the additional (Axie DAO) signature necessary to approve transactions. The attacker then authorised two withdrawals, draining first 173,600 ETH and then 25.5M USDC from the Ronin Bridge contract . The 25.5M USDC were swapped for ETH via other addresses before being returned to the main wallet. Perhaps in an attempt to complicate the chase, 6250 ETH have been transferred from the wallet, some of which has since been transferred to FTX and Crypto.com. The address was also initially funded from Binance, but KYC’d accounts are easily acquired. The rest of the funds remain in the attacker’s address: 0x098b716b8aaf21512996dc57eb0615e2383e2f96 This theft will be remembered not just for its size, but for the surreal lack of awareness shown by the Ronin team. It seems unthinkable that their key infrastructure was not monitored, with the only alert coming from a concerned user days later. In their official statement , Sky Mavis has said that “ Moving forward, the threshold will be eight out of nine ” validators to approve transactions. However this was enacted almost 11 hours before the incident was officially announced. No need to rush when it’s already been almost a week… Although most agree on its importance, decentralisation is sometimes seen as an academic, or moral distraction from the adrenaline of trading and the pursuit of profit. This case shows the real importance of decentralisation. Why hadn't the Ronin validator set been expanded further? As we saw with the Wormhole case , when deep pockets stand to lose out, a bailout is no problem. Axie is considered the market leader in GameFi, does this incident present that same level of risk to an entire ecosystem? If so, who’s bailing out $624M?

The hacker exploited the Proxy Lock Contracts of Poly Network on three different chains.

It's a privileged contract that has the right to trigger messages from another chain. It's a standard thing for cross-chain projects. It has a function named verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx that anyone can call to execute a cross-chain transaction. It (1) verifies that the block header is correct by checking signatures (seems the other chain was a poa sidechain or) and then (2) checks that the transaction was included within that block with a Merkle proof. Here's the code. One of the last things the function does is call executeCrossChainTx , which makes the call to the target contract. This is where the critical flaw sits. Poly checks that the target is a contract, but they forgot to prevent users from calling a very important target... the EthCrossChainData contract By sending this cross-chain message, the user could trick the EthCrossChainManager into calling the EthCrossChainData contract, passing the onlyOwner check. Now the user just had to craft the right data to be able to trigger the function that changes the public keys… The only remaining challenge was to figure out how to make the EthCrossChainManager call the right function. Now comes a little bit of complexity around how Solidity picks which function you're trying to call. The first four bytes of transaction input data is called the ""signature hash"" or ""sighash"" for short. It's a short piece of information that tells a Solidity contract what you're trying to do. The sighash of a function is calculated by taking the first four bytes of the hash of "" <function name> ( <function input types> )"". For example, the sighash of the ERC20 transfer function is the first four bytes of the hash of ""transfer(address,uint256)"". Poly's contract was willing to call any contract. However, it would only call the contract function that corresponded to the following sighash: Errr but wait... ""_method"" here was user input. All the attacker had to do to call the right function was figure out some value for "" _method "" that, when combined with those other values and hashed, had the same leading four bytes as the sighash of our target function. With just a little bit of grinding, you can easily find some input that produces the right sighash. You don't need to find a full hash collision, you're only checking the first four bytes. So is this theory correct? Well... here's the actual sighash of the target function: http://ethers.utils.id ('putCurEpochConPubKeyBytes(bytes)').slice(0, 10) '0x41973cd9' And the sighash that the attacker crafted... http://ethers.utils.id ('f1121318093(bytes,bytes,uint64)').slice(0, 10) '0x41973cd9' Fantastic. No private key compromise required! Just craft the right data and boom... the contract will just hack itself! One of the biggest design lessons that people need to take away from this is: if you have cross-chain relay contracts like this, MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN'T BE USED TO CALL SPECIAL CONTRACTS. The EthCrossDomainManager shouldn't have owned the EthCrossDomainData contract. Separate concerns. If your contract absolutely needs to have special privileges like this, make sure that users can't use cross-chain messages to call those special contracts."" On the Ethereum blockchain, the hacker stole USDC - 96,389,444 WBTC - 1,032 DAI - 673,227 UNI - 43,023 SHIBA - 259,737,345,149 renBTC - 14.47 USDT - 33,431,197 wETH - 26,109 FEI USD - 616,082 On BSC, the hacker stole: BNB - 6,613.44 USDC - 87,603,373 ETH - 299 BTCB - 26,629 BUSD - 1,023 On the Polygon blockchain, the hacker stole: USDC - 85,089,610 TOTAL VALUE LOST - ~$611,000,000 At the time of writing, the stolen funds are located in the following wallets: ETH: 0xC8a65Fadf0e0dDAf421F28FEAb69Bf6E2E589963 BSC: 0x0D6e286A7cfD25E0c01fEe9756765D8033B32C71 Polygon: 0x5dc3603C9D42Ff184153a8a9094a73d461663214 DeFi storylines are rarely straightforward, and this one is no exception. Even anonymous actors adore attention. Shortly after the exploit, an unexpected protagonist appeared, going by the name of hanashiro.eth. hanashiro.eth first gained attention when they sent the hacker a tip about how to handle USDT, for which they received 13.37 Ether from the hacker as a reward. Many others sent messages to the hacker afterwards, but none were quite as successful as hanashiro.eth. With a truly crypto native level of philanthropic showmanship, hanashiro.eth went on to donate their stolen money to a few of the foundational organisations which support our industry, such as Infura, Etherscan, and rekt.news . But not all of the funds were so freely accessible. Tether froze all of the 33M USDT that were stolen on the Ethereum chain. Their coin - their choice… A fact worth remembering if you use USDT. By this point the shit had really hit the fan; and all eyes were on Poly Network, who resorted to posting an open letter to the attacker begging them to return the funds. A single tweet asking a criminal to return six hundred million dollars... Maybe Gensler was right when he said we are in the “Wild West” phase of cryptocurrency. Consider the mindset of the attacker at this point in the story. Which do you think they felt more; euphoria, or terror? Stealing 600 million dollars whilst sat at your computer must be a surreal experience. The experience of then trying to launder that money must be equally intense. Aside from JPEGS, tornado.cash would be the obvious starting point, and that’s exactly where our hacker went. They sent themself a transaction containing the message; Wonder why Tornado? Will miners stop me? Teach me please Was that psyops or stupidity? In crypto it’s never quite clear... On the run with 600 million, and broadcasting messages to an audience of thousands. The hacker was growing too confident. When @WardBradt tweeted the following; Did the PolyNetwork Exploiter accidentally use the wrong sender address for this tx 0xb12681d9e ? The sender address is tied to FTX, Binance, Okex accounts. Suddenly the attacker's attitude changed. Surely a hacker who feels confident enough to attempt an attack of this scale wouldn’t make such a basic OPSEC error? Or maybe they used fake KYC documents… Either way, we began to see signs of fear from the attacker. The hacker began to suggest that they might return ""some tokens"" or even abandon them, saying that they were ""not so interested in the money"". Then the hacker considered the idea of creating a DAO to distribute the stolen funds. Finally, the pressure became too much, and the hacker announced that they were “READY TO SURRENDER” In an unexpected and unprecedented move, the attacker is now returning the funds to Poly Network. They announced that they were ""READY TO RETURN THE FUNDS!"" in an Ethereum transaction that was sent from the same wallet used for the attack. Before sending the first return transaction, the hacker created a token called ""The hacker is ready to surrender"" and sent this token to Poly Network who announced that they had set up a multisig controlled by ‘’known Poly addresses’’ . A summary of the hackers' communication with Poly Network can be found here. At the time of writing, the hacker has returned the following: On the Ethereum blockchain: $2.6M On the BSC: $1.1M On the Polygon blockchain: $1M Will the hacker continue to return the funds, or is this just another stunt? Can they really just return the money and be forgiven? Poly Network. 611 million. And you thought you knew all the big protocols in DeFi. This industry has grown bigger than our echo chamber can handle. This may be the first, but it won’t be the last hack of this size that we will see over the coming years. Yet the market seems unfazed, and rightly so. For better or for worse , crypto will make the news, and the world will have to take notice as our industry becomes the norm. This is just another inevitable part of the progress.

BNB Bridge - REKT,586000000,10/06/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/bnb-bridge-rekt/,"BNB Bridge -  Friday, October 7, 2022 BSC - Bridge -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” 2M BNB stolen in a hack as complex as Binance’s naming system. BSC Token Hub, the BNB bridge between the old Binance Beacon Chain and BSC, now BNB Chain… was exploited into minting two lots of 1M BNB directly to the hacker’s address. With a BNB price of $293 at the time of the hack, the stolen 2M BNB amounts to $586M (#3 on the leaderboard). However, the hacker managed to escape to other chains with just $127M before losing access to the rest of the funds. After noticing the “ irregular activity ”, DeFi’s 3rd largest L1 was paused for ~8 hours . However, what of all the users unable to access their own funds? What of those who may have needed funds in an emergency, or were potentially facing liquidation as their positions were out of their reach… ...for as long as Binance wanted. In a now deleted tweet , CZ said “ It's not about cash flow; it's crypto flow. ” while the attack was underway… Credit: samczsun , FrankResearcher The attacker exploited the BNB bridge into minting two batches of 1M BNB each, via falsified proofs of deposit on the legacy Binance Beacon Chain. The transactions occurred at 18:26 UTC and 20:43 UTC . The bridge uses vulnerable IAVL verification which the attacker was able to forge, specifically for block 110217401, from August 2020. Exploiter’s address: 0x489a8756c18c0b8b24ec2a2b9ff3d4d447f79bec As samczsun put it: In summary, there was a bug in the way that the Binance Bridge verified proofs which could have allowed attackers to forge arbitrary messages. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, but the damage could have been far worse For a detailed explanation, see the full thread . Rather than dumping the BNB directly and drawing attention to the price action, funds were deposited as collateral on BSC lending platform Venus Protocol. Amidst the confusion, the Venus team were keen to point out that their protocol hadn’t suffered an exploit, although their users faced a spike in rates as borrow liquidity was withdrawn. The tactic of borrowing rather than dumping initially led some to believe that this may just be a gigawhale moving funds around. However, as users began to notice high-slippage swaps and Tether blacklisting funds , it became clear that this was something more sinister. Likely anticipating that Binance would halt the chain, the exploiter raced to find liquidity to bridge and move as much of the loot as possible to other chains. SlowMist traced the movement of funds. First, the attacker supplied 900k BNB to Venus, borrowing a total of $147M in stablecoins, before bridging to Ethereum and L2s, Fantom (now making up over 10% of TVL ), Avalanche and Polygon networks. See SlowMist’s table below for a breakdown of the exploiter’s positions , including frozen USDT (totalling ~$6.5M). When the BNB team halted the chain, approximately 90 mins after the second transaction, the hacker lost access to the ~$430M still on their BSC address . The hacker’s addresses were initially funded from ChangeNOW exchange. Since the incident, Binance comms have gone into damage limitation mode. An official update states that “decentralised chains are not designed to be stopped”. But with just “26 active validators”, does BNB chain qualify as decentralised in the first place? And was it ever, really, credibly decentralised? The update also sets out some next steps, including governance votes to decide on whether to freeze or burn the stolen funds, and establishing Bug Bounty and whitehat bounty programmes. The number of “ community validators ” will also be increased in a “ move toward further decentralisation ” (or reduced responsibility). Covering the funds that found their way off-chain is a drop in the ocean for Binance. And as CZ makes clear , his size is size: “The current impact estimate is around $100m USD equvilent, about a quarter of the last BNB burn.” However, the Binance CEO has also distanced himself from the incident, tweeting that he is “ not that involved in the technical side of BNB Chain. Far less than Vitalik with ETH. ” possibly attempting to convince any regulators looking for a DeFi scapegoat that their attentions should be directed elsewhere… If the chain could have been paused this time, why not for all the other BSC hacks we’ve covered? And how will this look in the eyes of regulators, now that it’s clear they’ve been in control the entire time… More importantly, though, a dangerous precedent has been set by pressing pause on such a heavily-used network. If we ever reach mass-adoption of crypto for day-to-day transactions, how could these acts be justified when chain halts could, ultimately, mean the difference between life and death? But, as this video from 2019 shows, CZ doesn’t regard the immutability of blockchains as sacrosanct. Although the plan never went ahead, he contemplates the rolling back of the Bitcoin network despite the “far reaching consequences” and risk of “destroying credibility”. Will BNB’s involvement in “DeFi” retain any credibility after today? For now, though, it’s just another bridge exploit, and one more entry on the leaderboard .

SBF - MASK OFF,477000000,11/12/22,N/A,https://rekt.news/sbf-mask-off/,"SBF - MASK OFF Friday, November 18, 2022 SBF -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh 1) What The ? SBF’s meltdown has gone from bad, to worse, to weird. As Twitter crumbles, the disgraced former head of FTX is still spinning his story, repeating the same “shiboleths” [sic] while shirking responsibility for stealing customer funds. But the EA facade has fallen, and all his “beliefs” have turned out to be bullshit. Constant claims of affiliation with the effective altruism movement (which now rejects him ) made it possible to rationalise why someone might take risks in order to “do good”. But it’s not altruistic if it’s not your money. Yikes. DMs between SBF and a supposedly friendly journalist at Vox show SBF agree ing that his focus on ethics was “ mostly a front ”. Despite the fact that the Bankman-Fried family foundation had previously financed Vox’s “Future Perfect” column via a now paused grant, the article published (apparently without permission) SBF’s unguarded thoughts on a range of topics. The article exposes a range of SBF’s lies and hypocrisy, in stark contrast to the NYT puff piece, who continued to portray him as a young genius who took on too much while fighting the good fight, an American underdog attacked by a foreign competitor’s market manipulation. It turns out his take on regulation, and the fierce defence of our “ dumb fuckin take ” was “just PR”, and that regulators “don’t protect customers at all” (as FTX has so effectively demonstrated). Regarding his running of the business, SBF downplays the events, with future classics such as “sometimes life just creeps up on you” and describing the misuse of customer deposits as simply “messy accounting”. And after all that’s happened, he still thinks he could’ve got out of trouble if he hadn’t filed for bankruptcy. As the first stages of bankruptcy proceedings get underway , FTX’s newly-appointed CEO John J. Ray III had some strong words about SBF’s management abilities: Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented. …and coming from the man who oversaw the aftermath of Enron, that’s saying a lot. The documents also provide a look into the dire state of SBF’s empire with highlights including: The value of “Crypto Assets Held at Fair Value” by FTX.com is estimated at just $659k, rather than SBF’s previous claim of ~$5B (of “semi-liquid” shitcoins). Loans totalling $3.3B from Alameda to SBF and his Paper Bird Inc. The statement that “corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees”. FTX and Alameda “do not have an accounting department” Plus the following description of their operational practices: Unacceptable management practices included the use of an unsecured group email account as the root user to access confidential private keys and critically sensitive data for the FTX Group companies around the world, the absence of daily reconciliation of positions on the blockchain, the use of software to conceal the misuse of customer funds, the secret exemption of Alameda from certain aspects of FTX.com’s auto-liquidation protocol, and the absence of independent governance as between Alameda [and FTX.com]. Despite SBFs interviews, “leaked” DMs,, and his continued presence on Twitter, many questions remain unanswered. The reason behind the removal of $633M from FTX on the 12th of November is perhaps the most pressing. $477M of this amount was apparently due to “ unauthorized access ”, with FTX staff sending the remainder to a secure multisig pending bankruptcy proceedings. While SBF’s leaked DMs chalk it up to a hack by an “ex-employee, or malware on an ex-employee’s computer”, Bahamian authorities claim to have instructed the draining of FTX wallets. It’s unclear whether this refers to the $477M figure or the “rescued” funds. 1) What?! The FTX Accounts Drainer address has since swapped assets to ETH making it the 30th largest ETH holder. Much of the swaps incurred significant slippage and appeared to be a scramble towards uncensorable assets (though $100M were frozen ), behaviour which is far from expected by government agency. We’ll put the $477M on the leaderboard , although no detailed official explanation or post mortem has yet been released. This article will be updated as the situation becomes clearer. The true damage from the collapse of FTX and Alameda is an order of magnitude greater than the funds lost in the hack, and the wider fallout will be far greater still. Despite his U-turn on the effectiveness of regulators, SBF’s actions and the fallout they continue to create will pave the way for a harsh crackdown which will affect all corners of the industry. But the crypto movement is bigger than the failures of the past week. Or at least, it will be...

Due to a discrepancy between ‘solana_program::sysvar::instructions’ (a precompile of sorts) and the ‘solana_program’ Wormhole was using, the contract didn’t correctly verify the address being provided, and the attacker was able to provide an address containing just 0.1 Eth. 3: Using an account created hours earlier with a single serialised instruction corresponding to the Sep256k1 contract, the attacker was able to fake the ‘SignatureSet’ , call ‘complete_wrapped’ and fraudulently mint 120k whETH on Solana using VAA verification that had been created in a previous transaction. 4: 93,750 ETH was bridged back to Ethereum over the course of 3 transactions, ( one , two , three ) where it still remains in the hacker’s wallet . The remaining ~36k whETH were liquidated on Solana into USDC and SOL. An on-chain message was sent to the hacker from Certus One, the team behind the Wormhole bridge: This is the Wormhole Deployer: We noticed you were able to exploit the Solana VAA verification and mint tokens. We’d like to offer you a whitehat agreement, and present you a bug bounty of $10 million for exploit details, and returning the wETH you’ve minted. You can reach out to us at contact@certus.one . A $10M bug bounty is the biggest we’ve seen. Keep your innocence, plus $10M, or go on the run with $326M. Which would you choose? As Wormhole have yet to receive any response to their offer, it seems the attacker has chosen the criminal route… We spoke to the founders of Wormhole, and asked how they managed to replace so much ETH so quickly. After waiting for some time, they would only tell us that they are currently writing a more detailed incident report. It’s not been a good start to the year for Solana. The last few months has seen the network experience a number of outages and disruptions. However, in the recent January crash, users were unable to top up their collateral and avoid liquidation, with oracle issues leading to further erroneous liquidations. That being said, Solana is not yet the battle-hardened network that Ethereum has grown to be. Every exploit, for all the damage it does, offers a lesson for how to secure an evolving ecosystem. Newer L1s are thrown into the deep end, into a world of veteran exploiters where they will either sink or learn to swim. Given the seriousness of this incident, along with the Qubit exploit last week and last summer’s mammoth attack on Poly Network , Vitalik Buterin seems to have been proven right about his recent security concerns around cross-chain protocols. In the race across the cryptoverse to reach experimental and more lucrative opportunities, many are willing to trust in newer tech. But when one of these gateways fails, the damage done can be immense. It remains to be seen whether the future of DeFi will be cross-chain or ‘multi-chain’, but either way, the journey there will be long and dangerous.

DMM Bitcoin - Rekt,304000000,05/30/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/dmm-rekt/,"DMM Bitcoin - Rekt Friday, May 31, 2024 DMM Bitcoin -  read this article also in : en - es - zh Centralized Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin exploited for more than $304 million in Bitcoin, the biggest hack since Dec 2022 and one of the largest crypto hacks ever. Initially reported by Whale Alert as 4,502 BTC being transferred from an unknown wallet to an unknown new wallet. DMM confirmed shortly after that the BTC was illegally leaked from their wallet. DMM has refrained from providing additional details on the apparent hack's execution, stating that they are actively investigating the incident and implementing safeguards to prevent future occurrences. While assuring all BTC deposits remain guaranteed, the exchange has temporarily halted spot trading buy orders, leveraged position openings, and new account screenings. The DMM Bitcoin hack appears to be the third-largest cryptocurrency theft in Japan's history, after the 2018 Coincheck hack where over $530 million worth of XEM was stolen. Japan was also home to the infamous Mt. Gox exchange collapse in 2014. Over 809,000 BTC were stolen across six hacks during Mt. Gox’s lifetime. Regardless of whether the $304 million stolen from DMM Bitcoin is recovered, this massive hack is guaranteed to secure a spot on Rekt's infamous leaderboard . Credit: Whale Alert , DMM Bitcoin , CoinDesk , Blockonomi , Beosin , Arkham Intel The attack began around 1:30pm JST, when DMM noticed 4,502.9 BTC being leaked from their hot wallet. They made an announcement on their official site, but maintained radio silence on Twitter so far. According to Beosin , there are two possible methods of attack: A traditional exchange attack. The signature service of DMM Bitcoin is attacked or the multi-sig private key is compromised. Then the attacker used a similar historical transfer address to receive funds to avoid detection and alert. The exchange wallet controller suffered from an address spoofing scam, that is, only the first 5 digits and the last 2 digits of the receiving address were checked during the transfer, resulting in the transfer to the hacker address.

The bounty guidelines are identifying a KYC centralized exchange deposit, revealing the identity of the exploiter and successful effort to return funds. With the hacker's transactions being closely tracked, will blockchain forensics and the bounty program lead to their unmasking and recovery of the $304 million? What could go down as one of the biggest heists in our industry, became another prime example of not your keys, not your crypto. DMM has vowed to make customers whole, but restocking that mountain of bitcoin won't be easy or cheap. The creation of the bounty program on Arkham Intel could potentially aid in recovering the stolen funds or identifying the perpetrators. While on-chain sleuths have cracked some historic hacks, this trail of tainted coins spread across multiple addresses could prove a byzantine blockchain maze. All eyes are glued to see if the bounty hunters can work their magic and resolve this rektoning before it solidifies DMM's legacy as crypto's biggest Rekt of 2024. The root cause of the attack has yet to be revealed, whether it is an address spoofing incident, private key compromise or even an inside job, remains to be seen. Keeping that large amount of funds in a hot wallet as opposed to a cold wallet is just reckless.

WazirX - Rekt,235000000,07/18/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/wazirx-rekt/,"WazirX - Rekt Thursday, July 18, 2024 WazirX Protocol -  read this article also in : en - es WazirX, India's leading crypto exchange, took a massive $235 million hit when it's Safe multisig wallet crumbled under a devastating breach. Cyvers sounded the alarm shortly after the attack, detecting multiple suspicious transactions being funded by Tornado Cash making moves on the platform. They attempted to contact WazirX during the explicit, but it was too late, as the attacker was already swapping the stolen tokens to ETH and making their exit. Roughly half an hour later, WazirX confirmed the security breach and that they were pausing withdrawals. WazirX is sliding into number 7 on the infamous Rekt Leaderboard , right behind this year’s biggest hack, so far, DMM Bitcoin , which lost $304 million at the end of May. DMM Bitcoin was another centralized exchange that fell victim to a multisig compromise. How many times do we need to be reminded of not your keys, not your crypto? Credit: Cyvers , WazirX , Mudit Gupta , ZachXBT , Arkham Intel The WazirX hack was a masterclass in patience and deception. According to a technical breakdown provided by Mudit Gupta , the attackers began laying the groundwork at least 8 days before the main event, conducting small test transactions to set the stage. Their target? WazirX's multisig wallet, which had six signatories, five from WazirX and one from Liminal, their custody provider. This was confirmed by WazirX in their preliminary report of the exploit. Instead of a straightforward drain, the hackers opted for a more insidious approach. They set out to upgrade the multisig wallet to a malicious version under their control. To achieve this, they needed to overcome WazirX's security measures, which included Ledger Hardware Wallets for signatories and a whitelist policy for destination addresses. The attackers likely compromised two of the four required private keys directly. For the remaining two, they employed signature phishing, tricking signers into approving what appeared to be a normal USDT transfer . This deception extended to Liminal's interface, where WazirX suspects a discrepancy between the displayed data and the actual transaction contents allowed the payload to be replaced. Minutes before the hack, a legitimate USDT transfer failed, a red flag that went unnoticed. Two of the four signatures were actually for upgrading the safe to the malicious contract, not for the USDT transfer. With all pieces in place, the hackers executed their exploit. Using the two compromised keys and the two phished signatures, they successfully upgraded the multisig to their malicious contract. Critically, one of the phished signatures came from Liminal Custody, the co-signer responsible for final checks. This suggests a significant failure in Liminal's verification process, a vulnerability the attackers exploited to devastating effect. With the upgrade complete, the attackers gained full control of the wallet, allowing them to drain funds at will. ZachXBT's investigation revealed a complex trail of transactions , broken down into a timeline as follows...

This intricate web of transactions reveals the meticulous planning and execution behind the WazirX hack. The attackers' use of privacy tools, test transactions, and multiple addresses demonstrates a level of sophistication not seen in most crypto heists. Mudit Gupta made a good point in his analysis, “It's a very methodical and organized attack, pointing towards DPRK as the hacker.” This has yet to be confirmed, but you never know… Could this be another case of state-sponsored crypto theft? This $235 million heist not only shakes user confidence but also raises questions about the efficacy of current custody solutions and multisig implementations. In a world where even the most robust security measures can be bypassed, is entrusting large sums to any single entity, no matter how reputable, a risk worth taking? The rise of sophisticated, possibly state-sponsored attacks adds a chilling new dimension to an already treacherous landscape. With data breaches becoming the norm, the rise of phishing attacks and compromised private keys and multisig a rising concern lately. We have to ask, where is it safe to store our funds? The short answer is obviously not centralized exchanges. Is the only path forward a world where every user becomes their own bank, guardian and last line of defense?

Gala Games - Rekt,216000000,05/20/2024,"Anchain, Certik",https://rekt.news/gala-games-rekt/,"Gala Games - Rekt Tuesday, May 21, 2024 Gala Games -  read this article also in : en - es - zh Possible hacker seized control of an admin address to mint a whopping 5 billion GALA tokens worth $216 million, rapidly offloading 592 million tokens for $21.8 million in ETH before Gala Games could blacklist the rogue address. Devops199fan noticed that someone minted 5 billion GALA tokens and had been dumping them in batches of 100 ETH on 0xProject . Gala Games reported the exploit as an isolated incident a few hours later, stating that they are working closely with law enforcement to investigate the individuals behind the breach. After catching the exploit, the Gala team used a blocklist function to block the hacker to further mitigate the damage. A year earlier, Gala Games had given itself the ability in the V2 contract to blocklist wallets, looks like it came in handy. Benefactor from Gala noted that the ETH contract for GALA is secure and under the protection of a multi-sig wallet and was never compromised. Going on to state “we believe we have identified the culprit and we are currently working with the FBI, DOJ and a network of international authorities.” Off all the days to fall into a FUD trap. Just before the incident, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eirc Balchunas raised his odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighting the products to 75% from 25% and the market went on a moon mission . Bucking the uptrend seen in other tokens following news of a possible Ethereum ETF approval, GALA's initial plunge of around 20% stood in stark contrast to the broader market rally. As investors grappled with the implications of the exploit, fears surrounding the security breach led to a sell-off that saw GALA's price fall Although the token managed to recover some ground in the ensuing hours, the damage had already been done, with GALA ultimately failing to capitalize on the positive momentum sweeping the rest of the crypto market. The day after the exploit, the funds were sent back by the exploiter. Yet the multi-million dollar question remained, who was behind this brazen attack on Gala? Credit: The Vulture Trade , Gala Games , Hacken , Benefactor , The Block , Crypto Times , Tay At the core of what could have been a $216 million crypto heist was a critical access control failure. The hacker's path to pillaging Gala Games was paved by allegedly obtaining unauthorized access to an all-powerful admin account on the GALA token contract. According to the attack breakdown by Hacken , the exploit involved an “Access Control” attack vector, where a malicious actor gained control over a dormant MINTER account on the GALA token contract that had not been used for 180 days. The attacker minted 5 billion $GALA tokens to a new address dubbed “Gala Game Exploiter” Attack transaction: 0xa6d90abe17d17743a9cecab84bcefb0fd0bbfa0c61bba60fd2f680b0a2f077fe Followed by the minting, the compromised account sent 2 ETH to Gala Exploiter to possibly cover gas fees for further transactions. The exploiter started exchanging the freshly minted GALA for ETH, executing transactions up to 100 ETH. GALA for ETH swaps: 0xe2ca471124b124831e231fb835778840ad100f97 2 hours and 16 minutes later, Gala admins intervened by blocking the exploiter’s account, halting further transactions. Blocked Account: 0x15129c219a94e24d40541e622757973c0664338f117ff6c4b68d845854b167b9 The exploiter transferred all the stolen ETH back to the Minter account. Minter Account: 0x273c6b54fea8b0d616fb3270698dd4387ec3fefc7b0e290330b4019c35a984b1 After that, all the ETH was transferred from the MINTER account to a new externally owned account, possibly by the Gala team to secure the funds. Externally Controlled Account: 0x16a96053f8e6382a32caa1a4461bf8c500d788019685b803ad3a3194fa5dd290 3 days before the exploit, Jason Brink aka Bitbender, announced he was shifting his role at Gala from being President of Blockchain to being an unpaid advisor. He also mentioned that a number of people will also be resigning from their positions at Gala to form an external organization, LFG (Let’s Fight Giants). The timing is suspicious, especially given some of the shady past of Gala Games. In early 2021, Gala Games lost $130 million after around 8.65 billion GALA tokens were stolen. Eric Schiermeyer, one of the firm's co-founders, sued Wright Thurston, the other co-founder, for allegedly participating in the hack . Thurston then issued his own lawsuit against Schiermeyer claiming that he used company funds for personal use, The Block previously reported . The United States Securities and Exchange Commission also sued Thurston and another of these companies in March 2023 for allegedly selling $18 million worth of unregistered securities in the form of GREEN, a cryptocurrency related to a public global decentralized power grid. In November of 2022 Gala Games urged its community for calm after misplaced fears of a multibillion-dollar rug pull or hack caused the GALA token to temporarily crash 25.6%. The initial panic, which Gala Games tried to debunk hacking rumors , after a single wallet address appeared to mint over $2 billion in GALA tokens out of thin air. Something sounds oddly familiar with the previous minting incident. With a track record of unexplained billion-dollar mints and $130 million insider heists, this latest $216 million incident reeks of potential internal sabotage. Is Gala the one playing games here? The shadow cast by the previous incidents at Gala Games, including insider heists and legal troubles, contributes to the aura of suspicion that now surrounds the company. The departure of key figures just days before the latest exploit and the history of unexplained token mints do little to allay fears. In a space where trust is paramount, Gala Games finds itself at a critical juncture, where the next steps it takes could either restore confidence or further erode its standing within the community. DWF Labs announced the day after the incident , that they have purchased 28 million $GALA tokens ($1.2M) to stabilize the token's value and express support for Gala. So maybe business will carry on as usual and any suspicions just may get swept under the rug, again. Time in the crypto space feels as if it moves faster than the speed of light at times, attention spans are short and memories even shorter. The market's resilience, often bouncing back from scandals and breaches, is a testament to the robust enthusiasm for the blockchain space. Will Gala emerge stronger and more secure, or will it become a cautionary tale? Only time will tell if these red flags are truly just coincidences or harbingers of deeper issues within.

Mixin Network - REKT,200000000,09/23/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/mixin-rekt/,"Mixin Network -  Monday, September 25, 2023 Mixin Network -  read this article also in : en What a way to start the week. This morning, Mixin Network announced a loss of $200M... to an attack which had occurred on Saturday. A few hours later, the Hong Kong-based project informed users via livestream that just 50% of their assets were guaranteed, according to The Block. An english summary of the livestream (promised in the initial announcement) is yet to be published. News of a relatively unheard-of platform losing nine figures brings back memories of Poly Network’s leaderboard -topping incident in August 2021. And just goes to demonstrate the vast disconnect between crypto communities across the globe. Mixin Network claims to be “decentralised”, but has blamed the losses on a hacked third-party database. Something doesn’t add up... The details of precisely how funds were drained have not yet been disclosed. But Mixin wasted no time in shifting the blame: the database of Mixin Network's cloud service provider was attacked by hackers, resulting in the loss of some assets on the mainnet The transactions appear to be simple transfers, which would suggest a leak of Mixin users’ private keys held on the cloud service. BlockSec also believe that some of the addresses drained may have been Mixin’s hot wallets. The stolen funds accounted for so far are comprised of ETH, USDT (swapped to unfreeable DAI) and BTC, with not an illiquid shitcoin in sight. The announcement states that Mixin is in contact with Google (presumably the ‘service provider’ in question) and SlowMist to aid in the investigation. Attacker addresses (identified so far, with approx $50M still to be accounted for): 0x52E86988bd07447C596e9B0C7765F8500113104c - Received 60k ETH ($94M) 0x3B5fb9d9da3546e9CE6E5AA3CCEca14C8D20041e - Received USDT, swapped to DAI ($23.5M) 0xB5d631A74AD9c9efcF96d6e9e2fAbcB75C67Eafa - Used to disperse ETH to victim addresses for gas to transfer USDT bc1qq7uefmz6nng5c4dzs9mwrxxyh9sxg5cjg85hes - Received 891 BTC ($23M) If the $200M figure stated by Mixin is accurate, it would make this incident the biggest hack of 2023 so far, knocking March’s $197M exploit of Euler Finance (funds later returned) off the top spot. As assets currently remain in the drainer wallets, there may be some hope for Mixin’s request for funds to be returned ( with a $20M bounty ), though the swapping of UDST to DAI is not a good sign. This case has many of the hallmarks of a Lazarus heist, who have been plenty busy lately . If it does turn out to be Lazarus, the funds will soon be getting a good Mixin’ … By blaming a third-party, as Nansen also did on Friday , Mixin is attempting to hide from one of crypto’s most important tenets: accountability. Using a web2 service provider for sensitive on-chain data goes against everything about the origins of this industry. And given LayerZero’s latest partnership , they may have some reassuring to do… With a constant stream of hacks, leaks and scams, flooding the timeline, it begins to feel like working in an online minefield . But that's the point. This was a hack, not an exploit . Yet another case of legacy infrastructure failing, yet another reason to be working towards a more secure future… As the darkest days of bear market apathy grind on, it becomes ever-harder to stay motivated.

Euler Finance - REKT,197000000,03/13/2023,Sherlock,https://rekt.news/euler-rekt/,"Euler Finance -  Tuesday, March 14, 2023 Euler Finance -  read this article also in : en - es - tr - zh Just as things were looking up… Against the backdrop of a banking meltdown and stablecoin crisis, one of DeFi’s most well-established lending protocols, Euler Finance, was struck a ~$200M blow. As USDC was creeping back towards its peg, Peckshield raised the alarm . Euler Labs quickly acknowledged the exploit, stating they were “ working with security professionals and law enforcement ”. As the situation developed , the losses began to mount. A total of $197M in ETH, WBTC, USDC and DAI were taken, placing Euler at number 6 on the leaderboard . Euler’s TVL dropped from $264M to just $10M. Any hopes of a whitehat were quickly put to bed ; an associated address had previously been used to exploit BSC-based EPMAX before depositing the proceeds to Tornado Cash. How did it go so wrong? Credit: _ FrankResearcher , Omniscia , Lending on Euler is managed via eTokens (collateral) and dTokens (debt), with liquidations triggered when a user has more dTokens than eTokens. The exploited vulnerability involved the little-used donateToReserves function which was incorporated into Euler via EIP14 last year. donateToReserves allows users to send eTokens to directly to Euler reserves, however does not contain a check on the health of the user’s position. The hacker took advantage of this by using two contracts, one of which would incur bad debt via donateToReserves, and the other would act as liquidator. Using flash-loaned funds and Euler’s leverage system to create a large, underwater position on one contract, the liquidator contract could obtain the inflated eToken collateral at a discount, and withdraw into the underlying assets. Omniscia, one of Euler’s six auditors , published a detailed post-mortem , summing up the issue as follows: The attack ultimately arose from an incorrect donation mechanism and did not account for the donator’s debt health, permitting them to create an unbacked DToken debt that will never be liquidated. Attacker’s address (where funds remain): 0xb66cd966670d962c227b3eaba30a872dbfb995db Example tx (DAI): 0xc310a0af… SlowMist provided a summary of the addresses and transactions involved: total losses comprised 86k in ETH derivatives ($134.6M), 849 WBTC ($18.6M), 34M USDC, 8.9M DAI. Auditors and smart contract insurance protocol Sherlock has taken responsibility for missing the vulnerability in their review of EIP-14 last year, and will pay a claim of $4.5M to Euler. Euler reached out to the attacker’s address via tx input data: We understand that you are responsible for this morning's attack on the Euler platform. We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps. But with some funds having been sent to Tornado via a pass-through address in what seems like a test, the prospects of returned funds aren’t looking good… Given Euler’s high-profile and stable reputation, many other DeFi organisations had funds tied up in the protocol. The fact that so many other projects chose to integrate with Euler is a testament to just how shocking this exploit has been for the community. And many have reached out in support of the Euler team. In addition to Euler itself (whose token, EUL , fell over 50%), the fallout affected the following projects: Angle Protocol (over $17M of agEUR collateral, ANGLE down over 50%) Balancer ($11.9M of bbeUSD) Temple DAO ($5M, TEMPLE down 30%) Idle DAO (~$5M) Swissborg ($2.6M in ETH and $1.7M of USDT) Yield Protocol ($1.5M) Yearn ($1.38M of indirect exposure, losses to be covered by Treasury) Inverse Finance ($800k) And others DeFi’s composability allows us to build interesting, automated and lucrative money legos in a way that traditional finance could never pull off. When things go wrong, however, there’s no stopping the on-chain reaction. The last few days have shown the necessity of a resilient alternative in an increasingly delicate global economy. Spurred on by disasters such as this, we continue to build out robust architecture, laying ever-stronger foundations for DeFi's future. But in the meantime… is anywhere truly safe?

BitMart - REKT,196000000,12/04/2021,N/A,https://rekt.news/bitmart-rekt/,"BitMart -  Sunday, December 5, 2021 CeFi - BitMart -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh Is CeFi any safer than DeFi? BitMart , the self-proclaimed “ Most Trusted Crypto Trading Platform ”, has lost ~$196M from two of its hot wallets on Ethereum and BSC. The stolen assets (mostly memecoins) total ~$100M on Ethereum and ~$96M on BSC. As news began to circulate , BitMart Telegram admins dismissed rumours as “ fake news ”, while stating that requests about the possible hack were creating “ unnecessary tension ”. Eventually, BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia announced that the withdrawals had in fact been down to a “ security breach ”, going on to inform users that “ At this moment we are temporarily suspending withdrawals until further notice. ” However, Xia put the total loss at $150M, despite the fact that total losses were already known to be ~$196M , a figure that BitMart continues to use in its official statement . CEXs are supposed to provide their users with trust. Just two days ago, Celsius also lost $50M from a hot wallet in the BadgerDAO front-end attack, also downplaying the loss. With this latest “ security breach ” sending BitMart straight to number 2 on our leaderboard , one obvious question springs to mind. If CeFi isn’t any safer, why use it? The attack began on Ethereum with this transaction at 21:31:09 +UTC for ~$33M of SHIB, commencing on BSC around half an hour later with ~$41M SAFEMOON. On Ethereum, the affected wallet, labelled Bitmart 2 , was drained of the majority of its contents. The only substantial remaining asset balance is ~$40M of BitMart’s own token , presumably because of the difficulty unloading it outside of the exchange. The affected wallet on BSC: 0x8c128dba2cb66399341aa877315be1054be75da8 Breakdown of losses by token on Ethereum (~$100M). Breakdown of losses by token on BSC (~$96M). The hacker transferred BitMart user funds from the hot wallets to the following addresses: Ethereum 1: 0x39fb0dcd13945b835d47410ae0de7181d3edf270 Ethereum 2: 0x4bb7d80282f5e0616705d7f832acfc59f89f7091 BSC: 0x25fb126b6c6b5c8ef732b86822fa0f0024e16c61 From there, the various memecoins were swapped via 1inch to ETH and BNB before being washed via TornadoCash. BitMart is still investigating what caused the security breach, and has yet to comment on any reimbursement for affected users. The Security section of their website states that <0.5% of their assets are kept in hot wallets. This puts BitMart’s total assets at over $39 billion… If that figure is really true, then a full refund for affected users should be no problem. Centralised platforms exist as a trusted go-between for those who may have reservations about interacting directly with crypto. Users give up custody of their assets with the expectation that the people managing them are experts in security and best practise. It remains to be seen how the attacker managed to gain access to the wallets in question. Hopefully it wasn’t another basic OPSEC error such as granting unlimited approvals to an EOA, as in Celsius’ case. These are understandable mistakes when it comes to individuals and smaller balances. But at this level it’s hard to forgive, especially when CeFi represents the corrupt legacy financial system cashing in on the innovation of DeFi. A Cayman-registered corporation has lost close to $200M. Their communications team first denied and then downplayed the losses. All this while freezing withdrawals until out of the news cycle, when the fear of a “bank run” has subsided. Do these middlemen deserve to take a profit? And if they insist on doing so, will BitMart at least commit to refunding their users?

Nomad Bridge - REKT,190000000,08/01/2022,N/A,https://rekt.news/nomad-rekt/,"Nomad Bridge -  Tuesday, August 2, 2022 Nomad Bridge -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh The vultures had a busy night. Nomad Bridge has been torn apart, with $190M of liquidity drained in a savage attack lasting two and a half hours. This is the 100th incident to make it onto the rekt.news leaderboard . Staying true to DeFi principles, this hack was permissionless - anyone could join in . Once the fatal blow had been struck, the news spread , and many began to fight over the scraps. Cross-chain bridges continue to be a weak point for DeFi and a juicy target for exploiters. And when they go, it's often a total collapse . $190M... devoured. The collateral damage from the unbacked assets is also severely affecting the chains that depended on Nomad. Moonbeam , EVMOS and Milkomeda have all taken a significant hit to their TVLs. This incident is distinct in its every-man-for-himself nature, but many who exploited the bug have declared themselves whitehats… Rekt is looking forward to seeing how much is eventually returned… Even so, with four of our leaderboard’s top 5 entries being cross-chain attacks, it gets ever more difficult to agree with Nomad’s slogan “ The future of cross-chain communication is optimistic ”. But what started the feeding frenzy? And how were so many able to continue picking the bones? Credit: samczsun , Zellic.io Following a routine upgrade in June, the bridge’s Replica contract was initialised with a fatal security flaw leading to the incident. The 0x00 address was set as a trusted root, meaning that all messages were read as valid by default. After a failed first attempt (costing $350k in gas), the original attacker’s exploit tx , which was copied by those that followed, was able to call the process() function directly, without having first ‘proved’ its validity. The process() function is responsible for the execution of all cross-chain messages and has an internal requirement ( line 185 ) to check the validity of the merkle root of all messages to be processed. However, the upgrade inadvertently caused transactions with a ‘messages’ value of 0 (invalid, according to legacy logic) to be read by default as 0x00 which was defined in the upgrade as a trusted root, passing the validation requirement as ‘proven’. This meant any process() calls could be executed as valid. In fact, a more sophisticated exploiter could have written a contract to drain the whole bridge for themselves. Copycat attackers simply had to copy/paste the same process() function call via Etherscan, swapping out their address in place of the previous exploiter’s. The incident quickly proved to be a chaotic mixture of word-of-mouth crowdhacking, frantic whitehat activity and MEV-bot carnage. For example, 🍉🍉🍉.eth managed to extract a total of $4M from the bridge, but fortunately claims to be acting as whitehat : However, other names stood out for the wrong reasons. There was a notable repeat offender in the Rari Capital (Arbitrum) exploiter from April’s article , who got away with almost $3M in stablecoins, which went straight into Tornado Cash. Of the multiple exploiters , the top three addresses (with 95M between them) are the following: 0x56D8B635A7C88Fd1104D23d632AF40c1C3Aac4e3 ($47M) 0xBF293D5138a2a1BA407B43672643434C43827179 ($40M) 0xB5C55f76f90Cc528B2609109Ca14d8d84593590E ($8M) A full list of exploiter addresses is available here . The project completed a Quantstamp audit in June, with issue QSP-19 foreshadowing a similar vulnerability: The auditor’s remarks that “ We believe the Nomad team has misunderstood the issue ” speak to a worrying attitude towards security that the project docs’ “ Long-Term Security ” plan appears to confirm: Concerns were also raised around the response time of the team facing a live and public exploit; the team’s official acknowledgement came three hours after the exploit began. The exploit was eventually halted by simply “ removing the Replica contract as owner ”, but after such a delay it was too late to save the funds. Blockchains may be closed systems, but alt L1 are only as strong as their weakest link. The Harmony chain is still in disarray since its bridge lost $100M in late June, in an attack linked to the Lazarus Group . What will the future hold for the ecosystems affected by Nomad’s collapse? So far, Moonbeam’s TVL has dropped from $300M to $135M, EVMOS’s from ~$7M to ~$3M, and Milkomeda’s from $31M to $20M. But crucially, the loss of confidence may prove to do far more damage than the missing $190M. Building in an nascent, experimental industry is tough, and cross-chain infrastructure has many moving parts to secure. The damage done by bridge attacks are often the most painful, as they can contaminate a whole ecosystem, or more. But nomadic liquidity has no permanent home, users will always roam to new lands in search of the “next big thing”, and will continue to get stung whenever vigilance becomes stretched too thin. With each of the 100 entries on the rekt.news leaderboard , the industry learns a harsh lesson, slowly growing stronger. But for now, DeFi still has plenty of easy prey… …and scavengers continue to circle overhead. Will it ever change?

Beanstalk - REKT,181000000,04/17/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/beanstalk-rekt/,"Beanstalk -  Monday, April 18, 2022 Beanstalk -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh $181 million jacked from Beanstalk, but the attacker only kept $76M. rekt.news records the damage, not the profit, so this one takes #5 on the leaderboard. A malicious governance proposal was pushed through by a flash loan, and the attacker then voted to transfer all the assets to themself. Another ~24800 ETH into Tornado Cash, and 250K of stolen money into the Ukraine War Fund. How much longer can this crimewave last? Credit: Igor Igamberdiev , Peckshield , Kelvin Fichter This was a governance attack made possible through the use of flash loans combined with the absence of a delay on proposal execution. The attacker temporarily acquired sufficient voting power to immediately execute a malicious emergency governance proposal, draining the protocol. Though the attack was instant, some preparation was needed: …there's a ~1 day delay for all governance actions in the $BEAN contract. The attacker actually set this whole thing up yesterday when it made two governance proposals. The first proposal (proposal #18) steals all the money in the contract. The next proposal (proposal #19) sends $250k worth of $BEAN to the Ukraine donation address. This Ukraine proposal is named Bip18 (instead of Bip19)... Once the delay had passed, the attack could be executed: The exploiter was funded from the Synapse Protocol bridge [though initially from Tornado]. They used a flash loan to get: 350M DAI, 500M USDC, and 150M USDT from Aave; 32M BEAN from Uniswap v2; 11.6M LUSD from SushiSwap. These tokens were used to add liquidity to Curve pools with BEAN for the governance voting. Further, they deployed and voted for a fake BIP-18 that moved all funds from the protocol contract to the exploiter. The next step was removing liquidity, repaying flash loans, and converting all received funds into 24.8k WETH ($76M), which went to Tornado Cash.

Presumably to avoid suspicion of an inside-job, Publius, the anon behind the protocol, took the decision to reveal their identity as a group of three in a statement published to Discord. Omniscia is keen to point out that this attack fell outside the scope of their audit, however their report does include commentary on the governance contract. Either way, it is surprising that such a vulnerability was not noticed at some point, given that flash loans are not a novel threat to DeFi governance. A delay on execution of on-chain governance proposals is one way to prevent this. This incident might encourage bagholders to monitor governance proposals more carefully. However, the average user may expect such heavily - shilled projects such as Beanstalk to be under vigilance of more experienced eyes. DYOR.

Wintermute - REKT 2,162300000,09/20/2022,N/A,https://rekt.news/wintermute-rekt-2/,"Wintermute -  2 Tuesday, September 20, 2022 Wintermute - Profanity -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh Wintermute have lost over $160M to their second incident this summer. In June, the market maker sent 20M OP tokens to an account that they didn’t control. Now, their hot wallet has been compromised, likely through the use of a vanity address, created with the vulnerable tool Profanity. The loss was announced by Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy approximately three hours after the theft: We’ve been hacked for about $160M in our defi operations. Cefi and OTC operations are not affected We are solvent with twice over that amount in equity left The firm’s CEO states that the use of the vanity address was for “ gas savings ” rather than aesthetics… an expensive choice. Last time Wintermute got rekt, the exploiter returned (most of) the funds. Will they stay lucky this time around? Hacker’s address: 0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705 Attack contract: 0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26 Main attack tx: 0xedd31e2a… Second attack tx: 0xc253450f… The likely cause of the hack was a weakness in the Profanity tool used for creating vanity addresses. Following last week’s revelation of the Profanity vulnerability, $3.3M was drained from various wallets by 0x6AE09A… over the following days. Both Wintermute’s hot wallet and DeFi vault contract appear to have vanity addresses, with multiple leading zeros. The hot wallet’s private key was likely compromised and used to drain the vault. Though the weak security of Profanity-generated addresses only came into the spotlight recently, the issue was raised on the project’s GitHub back in January. As described by Mudit Gupta : The vault only allows admins to do these transfers and Wintermute’s hot wallet is an admin, as expected. Therefore, the contracts worked as expected but the admin address itself was likely compromised. Around the time that the disclosure happened, Wintermute removed all ether from this admin address which suggests that they realized it might have been vulnerable. However, they forgot to remove the address as an admin from their vault. The stolen funds were mostly various stablecoins, totalling $118.4M. The majority of these were deposited into Curve’s 3pool, presumably in an attempt to avoid any blacklisting. The exploiter is now the 3rd largest holder of 3CRV with over 13% of the supply. Tornado 3pool? The remaining loot is comprised of 671 WBTC (~$13M) and 6,928 ETH ($9.4M) and a variety of other tokens. At the time of writing, the attacker’s address is worth approximately $162.3M. While Wintermute’s statement assures that “ there shouldn’t be a major selloff of any sort ”, certain tokens with smaller marketcaps are exposed to a potential dump, with up to 21% of circulating supply taken in the hack: $PRIMATE 21% $CUBE 12% $NYM 2.44% $eXRD 1.93% $YGG 1.17% The majority of assets haven’t yet been swapped. Could the hacker be looking to negotiate a white-hat reward? Shortly after the news broke, the launch of a honeypot token, WinterMuteInu , was spoofed from the exploiter’s address to capitalise on all those watching for signs of movement. The scammer seeded a Uniswap pool with 35 ETH of liquidity , which has so far accumulated ~ 166 ETH (~ $225k). Today’s incident marks the first major hack since the sanctioning of Tornado Cash last month. Assuming Wintermute don’t manage to retrieve the funds, it will be interesting to see how the funds are laundered. Post-Tornado sanctions, the potential use of 3pool as a replacement mixer should be of some concern to all Curve users.

Compound - REKT,147000000,09/29/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/compound-rekt/,"Compound -  Monday, October 4, 2021 Compound -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh It’s worse than we thought. Last week, a vulnerability was found in the updated Compound Comptroller vault, and ~$80M in excess COMP was wrongly distributed. The Compound team tried to minimise the perceived damage, but they knew it could only get worse. Now another ~$68.8M has been sent to the vulnerable vault, and even more COMP is being given away. How did it go so wrong for Compound? As if the inital loss wasn't bad enough, Compound could not stop a continued attack. Any user could call drip() on Compound’s Reservoir vault, which would refill the Comptroller and allow for even more incorrect COMP distribution. The Reservoir accumulates 0.5 COMP per block. At the time of the first incident, it hadn’t been drained in approximately 2 months. With over 200k COMP (~$68M) inside the Reservoir, the Compound team could only wait and hope that nobody would discover that the damage was far from done. As they waited for Proposal 64 to pass, which contained a fix for the original bug, Robert Leshner and the team had a tense week ahead. However, just three and a half days after the initial event, the secret was out , the Comptroller had been refilled , and another $68.8M was sent to the vulnerable vault. As Banteg wrote; If you tally the initial $80m, $22m already claimed after the drip and the $45m currently at risk, the bug tallies to $147m. Although this was more of a “bank error” than an exploit, it’s only fair that Compound takes a place on our leaderboard , where we can see that this case is not without precedent. In the case of the failed Alchemix experiment, we saw the protocol suffer a ~$6.5M loss due to their own mistake. Like Leshner, Alchemix appealed for their users to return the funds, however, they were more successful in doing so. 55% of the Alchemix funds were returned, an amount which currently seems unachievable for Compound. It’s no surprise that users are more likely to do the “right thing” when “asked nicely” , rather than threatened with the authorities. In Curve Wars , we remembered when Robert Leshner said; Crying to meatspace courts deeply undermines the “code is law” principles that DeFi was founded on. If you want courts and politicians to protect and control you, there is “finance”. If you want a system that is resilient, self-sufficient, open, and upgradable, there is DeFi. Now we compare those words to his aggressive appeal ; If you received a large, incorrect amount of COMP from the Compound protocol error: Please return it to the Compound Timelock (0x6d903f6003cca6255D85CcA4D3B5E5146dC33925). Keep 10% as a white-hat. Otherwise, it's being reported as income to the IRS, and most of you are doxxed. Was this a threat or an offer? Return the 'stolen' money and keep a clean 10%, or pay 40% to the IRS and keep a clean 60%... These nonsensical threats might have done more damage to Compound’s reputation than the multi-million dollar loss. Leshner has since apologised for his words, but can his reputation be repaired? It’s still not clear how (or if) the existing legal and financial systems will cope with the new concept that is decentralised finance, but for now... If you truly want DeFi, then you have to accept the responsibility that comes with it.

Vulcan Forged - REKT,140000000,12/13/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/vulcan-forged-rekt/,"Vulcan Forged -  Monday, December 13, 2021 Vulcan Forged - CEX -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh Four cases in ten days. ~$415 million gone. “Compromised keys” are so hot right now. BitMart ($196M), 8ight Finance ($1.75M), AscendEX ($77.7M) and now Vulcan Forged ($140M). But it’s nothing to do with the markets, right? Vulcan Forged is a “ blockchain game studio ” and “ NFT marketplace ” building fantasy play-to-earn games inside what they call the VulcanVerse . The majority of the funds taken from users’ wallets was in the platform’s own token, $PYR , which is used for in-game transactions and on their native marketplace. In order to facilitate these use cases, user accounts are linked to an integrated wallet - a service provided by Venly . The private keys of 96 addresses were compromised, allowing the attacker to drain their contents. As well as $PYR, users also lost substantial amounts of other tokens including ETH and MATIC. Hacker’s address on: Ethereum Polygon Funds have since been sent on to further wallets, for example this one containing ~$40M in $PYR and ~$600k in ETH. The team claims to have identified an address that may be linked to a KYC’d exchange. A total of over 4.5M PYR was extracted, with a value of ~$140M at the time of the attack. Subsequent sales of the stolen PYR had a large impact on the token price, which dropped ~30% initially, from around $31 to a low of $21.47. In contrast to the other cases, the Vulcan team has been quick to respond to the incident, posting regular updates on their Twitter feed and promising to both replace the stolen $PYR and remove the custodial wallets. According to the latest update , the majority of affected wallets have already been  reimbursed from the treasury, and the team aims to pursue a 100% decentralised system going forward. The response from the team has been better than most, but that doesn’t mean we should be less suspicious. “Compromised keys” can’t be analysed by outsiders; a fact which benefits only the insiders. Who is to blame for this incident? Is it Vulcan Forged, for a lack of due diligence, or their wallet provider; Venly? Without further details; we will never know.

Cream Finance - REKT 2,130000000,10/27/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/cream-rekt-2/,"Cream Finance -  2 Thursday, October 28, 2021 Cream - Yearn -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh Another failed experiment from the Yearn Finance ecosystem. Cream Finance has been hacked ( again ) for ~$130 million. The Yearn Finance decentralised monopoly has grown too large, and its operators; too careless. Why accumulate so many protocols if you don’t care for their users? We assumed that following the string of aggressive acquisitions by Yearn in 2020, we would see improved security on these platforms. However, that was clearly not the goal. The CoinGecko Yearn Ecosystem page shows the price impact of this hack. That’s position number three on our leaderboard, the second entry for the Cream Finance protocol, and ten positions in total for the Yearn Ecosystem. Whilst Yearn developers continue to make fast forks of other platforms, and incentivise users to use chains that work in their favour, they abuse the developers who worked on the original code, and put other users' funds at risk. This is not to say that Yearn seeks to trick their users - all DeFi degenerates are aware of the risks, but we can’t ignore this track record. Business is business, whether on or off-chain. Some of these protocols were picked up post-hack, but who had the most motive for those Yearn competitors to fail? There was a clear advantage for Yearn in being able to link and leverage such a range of protocols, but with great power comes great responsibility… Who takes the blame for losing $130M? credit: @Mudit__Gupta and @cryptofishx Exploiter wallets: Address A , Address B The hacker was able to take advantage of a pricing vulnerability by repeatedly lending and borrowing flash-loaned funds across two addresses. Next, after accumulating yUSDVault-collateralised crYUSD, the price of the underlying yUSDVault token was manipulated in order to effectively double the value of the collateral owned by the attacker. Finally, using the now overvalued collateral, the attacker drained CREAM’s lending vaults of as many assets as possible. A full table of the stolen funds, which include over 2760 ETH, a total of 76 BTC in renBTC, WBTC and HBTC, as well as tens of millions in stablecoins and other tokens, can be found here . Using address A, the attacker took a flash loan of 500M DAI from MakerDAO, depositing into Curve’s yPool for yDAI which was then used to mint yUSD. The yUSD was then deposited into Yearn’s yUSD strategy. By using the yUSDVault tokens from Yearn as collateral on CREAM, the attacker then could mint ~$500M of crYUSD. With address B, the hacker then took a flash loan from AAVE worth $2B in ETH, to use as collateral on CREAM. This allowed for borrowing a further ~$500M of yUSD, which was deposited again in order to mint crYUSD. The two accounts then performed a loop of depositing and borrowing, with B transferring ~$500M in yUSDVault tokens to A each time, until account A was in possession of ~$1.5B in crYUSD and ~$500M yUSDVault. The attacker then exploited a vulnerability in CREAM’s internal PriceOracleProxy of yUSDVault tokens. The price of yUSDVault depends on its pricePerShare, which is defined by the vault’s yUSD balance / totalSupply yUSDVault. By redeeming ~$500M yUSDVault for the underlying yUSD, the attacker was able to decrease the vault’s totalSupply to just $8M. Combining this depletion with a deposit of ~$8M in yUSD into the vault led CREAM to increase the value of yUSDVault shares by approximately a factor of two. Due to the price manipulation, CREAM now sees address A as having $3B crYUSD in collateral. $2B of this was withdrawn in ETH in order to repay B’s flash loan while the ~$500m of yUSD redeeming from the yUSDVault pays off A’s DAI loan. The $1B left over was more than enough to drain (borrow and default) CREAM’s $130M assets available for lending. Following the attack, funds were pulled from the exploit contract back to this wallet which had been funded by Tornado Cash around 30 mins before the attack in two transactions: one , two . Since the attack, the hacker has been using the renBridge to send funds to BTC as well as adding over $40M CRETH2 in single-sided liquidity to Uniswap’s ETH-CRETH2 pool , presumably in an attempt to offload as much as possible as CRETH2 may be salvageable . The Cream.Finance: Deployer is amongst the many accounts who have tried to communicate with the hacker. Their message ; you win. we're rekt. please return funds and we will honor a 10% bounty. When experienced attackers make moves like this, the motives are not just financial. This is manipulation of the industry as well as the markets, and we must consider who stands to benefit. Other protocols were named in a mysterious message in the main exploit transaction’s input data; gÃTµ Baave lucky, iron bank lucky, cream not. ydev : incest bad, dont do In Mudit Gupta’ s Observations and Theories about the attack, he points out several reasons why he believes the hacker, (or hackers) to be experienced DeFi developers, and how it is not the average black hat attack. This hack revealed not only vulnerabilities in project code, but deeper rivalries that may not have been apparent for the average DeFi user. A once hidden war is now being fought in public. A $130M hack gets headlines, but for many, this attack will be remembered not for the loss, but for how it was used as a campaign tool by opposing teams, neither of which have come out on top.

Multichain - REKT 2,126300000,07/06/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/multichain-rekt2/,"Multichain -  2 Friday, July 7, 2023 Multichain - Bridge -  read this article also in : en - es Multi-rekt. Multichain addresses were drained yesterday for a total of $126M, representing around 50% of the FTM bridge and 80% of the Moonriver bridge holdings. The project has quite the record… Before re-branding to Multichain, Anyswap was hacked for $8M almost two years ago. Then, in early 2022, six multi-token contracts were found to be vulnerable to an approvals draining attack , estimated to have led to $3M in user losses. Finally, in May of this year, Multichain caused panic when responding to bridging delays, potential insider dumping and team arrest rumours, explaining things away with a vague, but foreboding, “ force majeure ”. This time, comms were equally worrying: The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain. Fantom, which is heavily reliant on Multichain versions of many non-native assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, wETH and wBTC), also didn’t have any answers . With such a long and chequered history, and still no definitive root cause identified by the team… Is this just another of Cronje’s test-in-prod experiments gone wrong? The largest rug we’ve ever seen? Or even a very shy whitehat? Credit: Beosin As the large withdrawals picked up attention on Twitter, an initial theory that the withdrawals were related to Stargate/LayerZero’s launch of new offerings on FTM were quickly put to bed by the LZ team. While the exact attack vector is still to be determined, the behaviour of transactions appear to suggest that an attacker was able to control the addresses directly. Plausible methods of gaining access include a back-end breach, obtaining private keys via spearphishing or the actions of a malicious insider. The last time Multichain (then Anyswap) was hacked, the attacker was able to back-calculate private keys from repeated transaction data the (then recently-launched) v3. Exploiter addresses and current holdings at time of writing (total $126.3M): 0x9d5765ae1c95c21d4cc3b1d5bba71bad3b012b68 ($16.7M including DAI, LINK, USDT and CRV) 0xefeef8e968a0db92781ac7b3b7c821909ef10c88 ($30.1M in USDC) 0x418ed2554c010a0c63024d1da3a93b4dc26e5bb7 ($13.4M in wETH) 0x622e5f32e9ed5318d3a05ee2932fd3e118347ba0 ($30.9M in wBTC) 0x48bead89e696ee93b04913cb0006f35adb844537 ($7.5M in USDC, USDT, DAI and wBTC from Moonriver) 0x027f1571aca57354223276722dc7b572a5b05cd8 ($27.7M in USDC) The full list of assets can be found here . While the losses are enormous, funds have not been swapped or moved since being drained, potentially pointing to actions of a whitehat. Additionally, over half the amount ($65M) could be frozen by Tether and Circle. Two bridges have earned their 2nd leaderboard entry in a week, after Poly Network’s multisig was compromised last Saturday. The latest in an ongoing series of bridge hacks, this is another reminder of Vitalik’s warning that, despite the name of today's entry, a multi- not cross-chain future may be the safest way to go for crypto.

Justin Sun’s exchange Poloniex had its hot wallets drained of $126M today. The alarm was raised . Then, approximately half an hour after funds began to be drained, Poloniex notified users its wallet had been “ disabled for maintenance ”. Nothing to see here, folks.

Poloniex maintains a healthy financial position and will fully reimburse the affected funds. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities for collaboration with other exchanges to facilitate the recovery of these funds. As the amounts stacked up, Poloniex followed up with a whitehat bounty offer of 5%. Arkham’s on-chain intel market (or doxx-to-earn platform) also offered a $4000 bounty for an ID on the hacker. Will it be enough to either tempt, or force, a return of the loot this time? Credit: Arkham , SlowMist As ever, exchange hacks are often down to off-chain attack vectors, with the aim of gaining access to a device or an employee in order to extract private keys. Organised threat actors, such as North Korea’s Lazarus Group, are well-versed in a variety of methods to carry out extensive phishing campaigns . So far this year, over $250M has been lost in incidents linked to the group, including attacks on Atomic Wallet , AlphaPo , Stake and CoinEx . Could this be another big payday for the DPRK? Regardless of who was responsible, for Poloniex the attack began at 10:30 AM UTC, with a transaction draining 4900 ETH ($10M) from the address labelled Poloniex 4 on Etherscan. The attack continued on Ethereum, TRON and BTC, with a total of $126M lost, according to Arkham’s attacker profile (which displays totals of $59.2M, $48.6M, $18.6M held on the three chains, respectively).

At least it makes up for some of the losses he’s promised to cover… And in the rush to liquidate stolen assets, the attacker lost almost $2.6M worth of Golem Network’s GLM by transferring it directly to the token’s contract. Whoops. In late-September HTX (formerly Huobi) was hit for $7.9M , with Sun making it clear that reimbursing users would be small change for someone with pockets as deep as His Excellency’s. Luckily for Justin, he ultimately managed to escape shelling out for a costly compensation scheme when the funds were returned less than two weeks later. Now, he has promised to cover losses over 10x larger… …while offering a (lower-than-the-going-rate) 5% bounty and a 7-day grace period to think it over. Is he confident the hacker will take him up on it? Or feeling over-confident after getting lucky last time? How deep do Sun’s pockets go?

BonqDAO - REKT,120000000,02/01/2023,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/bonq-rekt/,"BonqDAO -  Friday, February 3, 2023 BonqDAO - AllianceBlock -  read this article also in : en - es - tr - zh BonqDAO got bonked for $120M. But the anonymous attacker got away with less than $2M. The Polygon-based lending and stablecoin protocol was hit by a two-stage attack on Wednesday in another example oracle manipulation. The alarm was raised on Twitter by @spreekaway , who live-tweeted the dumping of stolen funds. The affected protocols, BonqDAO and AllianceBlock (whose ALBT token was used in the exploit), both confirmed the hack in the following hours. Despite all the action being visible on-chain, BonqDAO telegram admins attempted to downplay the incident whilst the team presumably worked out what had happened. FUD and spam will not be tolerated rekt.news reckons: “using instant price feeds for collateral valuation will not be tolerated.” Credit: Peckshield , Beosin Attacker’s address: 0xcacf2d28b2a5309e099f0c6e8c60ec3ddf656642 Example attack tx: 0x31957ecc… Attacked smart contract: 0x8f55d884cad66b79e1a131f6bcb0e66f4fd84d5b Samczsun summarised the attack as follows: the attacker said ""btw 1 ALBT = 5 billion MATIC now"" and Bonq said ""ok"" The hacker was able to manually update the Tellor price feed of (wrapped) WALBT collateral by staking 10 TRB tokens (worth just ~$175). The attacker then used the submitValue function to report WALBT price to the oracle and, because BonqDAO uses the instant value, the attaker was able to borrow against their inflated collateral within the same tx. Firstly, the ALBT price was raised, allowing the attacker to mint 100M BEUR, Bonq’s Euro-pegged stablecoin against 0.1 WALBT collateral. Then, in a subsequent transaction, the WALBT price was reset to extremely low, allowing the attacker to liquidate user’s WALBT collateral, and netting approximately 113M WALBT. Beosin provided a step-by-step: The attacker calls the depositStake function of the TellorFlex contract, depositing 10 $TRB. Why 10 TRBs? We can see that the takeAmount is exactly 10*10^18 Next, the hacker calls the submitValue function to submit a request to change the $WALBT price. The function determines if the caller's stake amount has reached the pre-set takeAmount, which is why the attacker needs to first stake 10 TRB tokens (10^18 is decimal point). This function will record the price submitted by the caller, in this case 50000000000000000000000000000000. After the price is set, the hacker calls the createTrove function of the Bonq contract to create the trove(0x4248FD) contract, which is a contract of data recording, borrowing and liquidating. Next, the attacker stakes 0.1 $WALBT to the contract to perform a borrowing operation. Normally, the borrowing amount should be < 0.1 WALBT to ensure collateral rate in a safe range. But in this contract, the calculation of the collateral value is via TellorFlex contract. The attacker has already raised $WALBT price, thus being able to borrow 100M $BEUR. The hacker sets $WALBT to a low price in 2nd TX. When the $WALBT price is extremely low, the stake rate of WALBTs staked by other users will be at liquidation, enabling hacker to liquidate $WALBT staked by other users at low cost, eventually obtaining ~114M WALBT. — Losses have been widely reported to be up to $120M, using the tokens’ prices at the time of the hack. But low liquidity meant the attacker has only managed to swap the loot to around $1.7M worth of ETH and DAI, so far. Nevertheless, the damage to BonqDAO was brutal, with TVL drained from ~$13M yesterday to just over $100k at the time of writing. Stolen BEUR was dumped on Polygon for just over $500K. Funds were then sent to the attacker’s Ethereum address , where the ALBT was repeatedly dumped for ETH. The attacker’s ETH address currently holds 711 ETH (~$1.2M) and 535k DAI, as well as 89M ALBT (supposedly worth ~$3M, if the attacker can find somewhere to sell it…). BlockSec provided a detailed flowchart of funds, which can be found here . The attacker’s ETH address was funded via Tornado Cash shortly before the attack, and the stolen funds have since been deposited back into the mixer. Omniscia’s audit of BonqDAO raised concerns over “ multiple vulnerabilities as well as core design flaws ”. According to Omniscia's post-mortem , BonqDAO decided to: not move forward with the implementations audited at the time, opting to integrate Chainlink oracles in the future. The Bonq Protocol has introduced numerous updates since the time the audit was finalized, including all contracts involved in the vulnerability (ConvertedPriceFeed, ChainlinkPriceFeed, and TellorPriceFeed). These contracts were never in scope of any audit conducted by the Omniscia team and thus are considered to be unaudited code. While it may have been BonqDAO had the vulnerability, AllianceBlock has suffered significant collateral damage from this incident. The sell-off of Bonq users' liquidated ALBT caused its price to dump up to ~75% following the attack. AllianceBlock have stated they will reissue the token and airdrop to users based on a Snapshot from before the hack. Bonq’s Euro stablecoin, BEUR , has dropped to approximately 25% below its peg and the price of the DAO’s token, BNQ , has also taken a hit of over 30%. AllianceBlock may not be at fault for the vulnerability, but perhaps they need to work on their due diligence. It may not be the most exciting part of DeFi, but it’s surely amongst the most important. If AllianceBlock wants to achieve their aims of “ seamlessly bring[ing] DeFi and TradFi together ”, maybe they should take a more TradFi approach to due diligence. But it looks like it may already be too late for Bonq.

Badger - REKT,120000000,12/02/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/badger-rekt/,"Badger -  Thursday, December 2, 2021 Badger -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh rekt roadkill. The badger is dead. $120 million taken in various forms of wBTC and ERC20. A front-end attack places Badger DAO at number four on the leaderboard . rekt.news repeats: Infinite approval means unlimited trust - something which we know we shouldn’t do in DeFi. But should regular users be expected to spot an illegitimate contract via wallet approvals if the front-end is compromised? An unknown party inserted additional approvals to send users' tokens to their own address. Starting from 00:00:23 UTC on 2.12.2021, the attacker used this stolen trust to fill their own wallet. As the news of users’ addresses being drained reached Badger, the team announced they had paused the project’s smart contracts, and the malicious transactions began to fail around 2 hours 20 mins after they had begun. BadgerDAO’s aim is to bring Bitcoin to DeFi. The project is made up of various vaults for users to earn yield on wrapped BTC variants on Ethereum. The vast majority of stolen assets were vault deposit tokens which were then cashed out, with the underlying BTC bridged back to the Bitcoin network, and any ERC20 tokens remaining on Ethereum. The current locations of the stolen funds is summarised here . Rumours that the project’s Cloudflare account was compromised have been circulating, as have other security vulnerabilities . The approvals presented themselves when users attempted to make legitimate deposit and reward claim transactions, building a base of unlimited wallet approvals that allowed the attacker to transfer BTC related tokens directly from the user’s address. The first instance of approvals for the hacker’s address was almost two weeks ago, according to Peckshield . Anyone interacting with the platform since then, may have inadvertently approved the attacker to drain funds. Over 500 addresses have approved the Hacker’s address: 0x1fcdb04d0c5364fbd92c73ca8af9baa72c269107 Check your approvals and revoke here: etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker Example transaction : draining ~900 byvWBTC, worth over $50M. The victim had approved the attacker’s address to spend unlimited funds via the increaseAllowance() function around 6 hours earlier. Eventually, thanks to an “ unusual ” feature in Badger’s transferFrom() function, the team was able to pause all activity, halting the further loss of funds. If longstanding projects with such strong reputations as Badger can get rekt like this, and some of the biggest names in the game have their near-misses , DeFi users can’t afford to get too comfortable about the security of their biggest bags. Diversification is key to survival. Despite all the stress that’s usually placed on checking the URL and making sure you’re interacting with proper channels, this wouldn’t have helped users in this case. The front-end was manipulated at least 12 days ago . How did Badger not notice? A user flagged the suspicious increaseAllowance() approval in Discord. Why did Badger devs not look into it? For experienced users, these kinds of bogus approvals might be easy to spot, and checking the validity of any contract is easy enough by copy/pasting the address into Etherscan before signing the transaction. But for DeFi to reach “mass adoption”, these extra precautions must be streamlined. Until then, we can only practise good wallet and approval hygiene .

Mango Markets - REKT,115000000,10/11/2022,Out of Scope,https://rekt.news/mango-markets-rekt/,"Mango Markets -  Wednesday, October 12, 2022 Mango Markets -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh To top off yesterday's rumours , exploits and SEC action , Solana’s flagship margin trading protocol also got rekt, losing 9 figures to a well-funded market manipulator. The attacker managed to spike the price of Mango Markets ’ native token MNGO and drain their lending pools, leaving the protocol with $115M of bad debt. The team's initial announcement encouraged users not to deposit, and requested that the attacker get in touch about a bounty. Strangely, they were less keen to offer a bounty when the issue was raised via the project’s Discord back in March. In true DeFi style, the attacker has used their freshly acquired responsibility tokens to suggest a solution to the mess that they themselves created. Their proposal suggests that Mango pay the hacker a bounty of ~$65M, and that they do not pursue any criminal investigation. No prizes for guessing which way the hacker voted on the proposal… Welcome to the future of finance. Credit: Joshua Lim Attacker’s address: yUJw9a2PyoqKkH47i4yEGf4WXomSHMiK7Lp29Xs2NqM The attacker’s address was funded with over $5M ( 2M and 3.5M USDC) from FTX, which were deposited in Mango Markets and used to take out a large MNGO-PERP position. By countertrading against the position from another account, the attacker succeeded in spiking the spot price of MNGO massively from $0.03 to $0.91. While the MNGO price remained high, the attacker was able to drain the lending pools using the unrealised profit from the long position as collateral. The attacker’s Mango Markets account displays a $115M shortfall. The borrowed assets are listed below: The extreme price manipulation was made possible by the MNGO token’s low liquidity and volume. After some mixed messaging , Mango Markets later clarified that the incident was not an oracle failure, but rather genuine price manipulation. In the process of pumping the price, over 4000 short liquidations were caused and as a result of the collapse of the protocol, the Solana network’s TVL is down over 20% . The attack drained all of Mango Markets’ available borrow liquidity, with $70M remaining in the treasury. This leaves a shortfall of approximately $50M to cover the bad debt left by the incident, which the hacker is proposing to return. The governance vote on the hacker’s proposal is on-going and, of course, the attacker voted yes with all of their stolen 32M votes: The hackers proposal would allow users to be made whole and the protocol to become functional again, essentially starting from scratch. And by the looks of Mango Markets’ stated priorities , it sounds like taking the offer would check all their boxes… But surely this behaviour can’t be rewarded with a “bounty” of ~$65M, the total of remaining USDC, BTC, USDT, and SRM? How “binding” is a DAO vote? With no existing laws in regards to DeFi governance proposals, this story will set a precedent. If the token governance vote system remains in use, then there will surely be more hostile takeovers, if not from hackers, then from competing organisations. These events already happen in traditional finance, but DeFi, or regulators, will have to prepare their own method to defend their governance systems from potential bad actors. If only Mango had paid out a bounty in March, and prevented the attack from happening in the first place… A similar attack on Venus Protocol last year (not to be confused with the more recent incident related to the Luna fallout) led to a user raising concerns within the Mango community over six months ago. With so much advance notice, why wasn’t this attack averted?

Atomic Wallet - REKT,100000000,06/02/2023,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/atomic-wallet-rekt/,"Atomic Wallet -  Friday, June 16, 2023 Atomic Wallet - Lazarus Group -  read this article also in : en - es Now I am become rekt… Atomic Wallet blew up earlier this month. While the news cycle became overrun by the regulatory grudgematch , North Korea’s Lazarus Group have remained busy … …and the losses have continued to mount. Elliptic puts the total at over $100M gone so far, with the worst-hit victim losing $8M USDT. But the true total may be far higher . Last August, when a similar attack ran rampant on Solana, we wrote: Panic, chaos, suspicion. All are inevitable reactions to an indiscriminate attack, where nobody knows who’s safe, and who’s next. With still no clarification from Atomic Wallet, this time is no different. Many have blamed the team’s past attitude to security concerns. In 2021, Atomic Wallet were informed of vulnerabilities in their product, but didn’t engage with the auditors, Least Authority, who were left with no option but to publish a warning to users. Why didn’t Atomic fix this ticking time bomb? Atomic Wallet addresses began to be drained just before 10pm UTC on Friday 2nd June (with the theft of 304 ETH, worth over $500k). The following day, Atomic Wallet acknowledged there was an issue, encouraging users to reach out via email. Since then, aside from downplaying the incident (“ less than 1% of our monthly active users have been affected/reported ”), the team have not stated what caused the hack. Do they even know themselves ? The hack reportedly affected both desktop and mobile users, whose addresses were targeted on 13 chains . The addresses were drained via a three step system . Firstly, a direct transfer into a new address, where tokens were then swapped for the chain’s native asset and consolidated in a third wallet. Tracing the funds (spearheaded by ZachXBT and Tayvano ) looks to have been a painstaking task, relying on individual user reports, and linking the above process to addresses which provided gas to the accounts in question. Some funds ($1M) have apparently been recovered , but the method is being kept quiet for now. And while some spend time helping victims, others look to capitalise on their desperation with a fake ‘refund’ airdrop. The laundering of funds has shown patterns attributed to the Lazarus Group, being sent to the Sinbad BTC mixer (formerly Blender), a DPRK favourite. While the root cause is still to be identified, the hack may be linked to a BGP hijacking of Atomic Wallet traffic. BGP has played a part in a number of crypto incidents in the past. While this technique is not enough on its own to carry out the heist, it may have been combined with the vulnerabilities alluded to (though never specifically disclosed) by Least Authority, who faced legal pressure to take down their blog post. A leak of logged sensitive data, such as was the case with the Slope wallet incident on Solana, is another possiblity. Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin has also listed some potential scenarios . Whatever the cause, the attitude of the Atomic Wallet team was summed up by Tayvano: Your security posture sucks, you refuse to listen to people, you aggressively silence people, and your products and services facilitate theft on a daily basis and have for years. Without knowing a root cause, other wallet providers will be having a hard time checking if they might be susceptible to the same attack vector. With plenty of shady looking options out there, it’s better to be safe than sorry. When it comes to securing your assets, any hint of a red flag should be reason enough look elsewhere. And Atomic Wallet is covered in them. Will they ever admit what went wrong?

Since the leaderboard-topping Ronin incident, in which keys to 5 of 9 validators were compromised, there has been much talk of the sophisticated spearphishing campaigns ascribed to the Lazarus group. With threats like these known to be relentlessly targeting cryptocurrency projects, the fact that another entire network’s official bridge could be drained by compromising just two addresses is far from acceptable. Not only should the other cases have set the alarm bells ringing, but in early April @_apedev specifically called out the Harmony bridge’s precarious security situation. How did the devs overlook, and then ignore, such lax security for securing 9 figures of users’ funds? Harmony always struggled with attracting users.

Yesterday, all eyes (including Justin’s ) were on CZ and Binance’s settlement with US authorities. But His Excellency makes sure to never stay out of the spotlight for long… With increasing regulatory pressure on crypto’s main players , this repetitive-rektage couldn’t have come at a worse time for Sun. Or are these repeated “hacker attacks” just building a rainy-day fund , ready for a life on the lam? Credit: Peckshield , Cyvers Two hours after the first alerts of fund movements on HECO then HTX , Sun acknowledged the attacks, promising to compensate the HTX losses: HTX and Heco Cross-Chain Bridge Undergo Hacker Attack. HTX Will Fully Compensate for HTX's hot wallet Losses. Deposits and Withdrawals Temporarily Suspended. All Funds in HTX Are Secure, and the Community Can Rest Assured. We are investigating the specific reasons for the hacker attack. Once we complete the investigation and identify the cause, we will resume services. The HECO Bridge funds were drained via a compromised operator account, which ( beginning at 09:59 AM UTC) withdrew funds from the bridge to the attacker’s address . The majority of funds were forwarded onto an accumulation wallet . The compromised HTX hot wallet addresses ( ETH , others ) transferred funds ( beginning at 10:41 AM UTC) directly to separate attacker addresses ( ETH , others ). While the precise source of the attacks is unknown, it seems likely that vulnerabilities exploited in previous hacks could have been reused , given the connections between the affected entities. Peckshield puts the HECO bridge losses at $86.6M, in the following assets: 42M $USDT, >10k ETH ($19M), 489 HBTC ($18.8M), 347M SHIB ($2.8M), 173k $UNI ($930k), 619k USDC, 42k $LINK ($600k), 347k TUSD. Cyvers summed $12.5M in losses from HTX, made up of: 1,240 ETH ($2.5M), 7.3M USDT, 1.78M USDC, and 62.2K $LINK ($870k).

This style of attack targeting CEX and bridges has all the hallmarks of DPRK’s Lazarus Group , who’ve cleared over half a billion dollars in the last six months alone. Once they find a foothold, insufficient spring cleaning is sure to result in more losses. Regardless of who carried out the double-pronged hack, costs are mounting up for Justin Sun, who may be next in line for the US authorities’ ongoing crypto cleanse. HECO and HTX are the 3rd and 4th incidents inside three months on Sun-linked projects, totaling 233M in losses (with just $8M returned, so far). Earlier this month, we wondered : How deep do Sun’s pockets go? At this rate, perhaps one day we'll find out?

Mirror Protocol - REKT,92000000,10/08/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/mirror-rekt/,"Mirror Protocol -  Tuesday, May 31, 2022 Mirror - Terra -  2 read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh Mirror mirror on the wall… $90 million stolen, but that’s not all. Two exploits hit Mirror Protocol, and the larger of the two wasn’t even noticed at first. When the Ronin Bridge hack was announced, we were all shocked to hear the funds were missing for a week before the alarm was raised. It took Mirror Protocol seven months, to spot the loss, and when they did finally notice, they didn’t publicly announce anything. And then, 232 days later, they were hit again. The day after the first loss was revealed, another $2M was taken. How embarrassing. Mirror devs need to take a long hard look in the… Credit: FatManTerra , pedroexplore1 The first exploit, executed on the 8th of October 2021, involved repeatedly unlocking collateral deposited against short positions on Mirror Protocol. The lock contract did not contain a duplicate call check for withdrawals, allowing the attacker to drain funds deposited by other users by calling unlock_position_funds for their own position ID multiple times. Attack transaction: 08DD2B70… For a step-by-step analysis see this BlockSec blog post . Despite the vulnerability remaining live, no followup attack was made; the balance of the lock contract never rose high enough to exploit again without alerting the protocol’s userbase. As FatManTerra pointed out on Twitter: ”All of this went completely unnoticed by TFL and the Mirror team & community.” On the 14th of May, the vulnerability was finally, and quietly, patched with no mention of the bug nor the $90M loss it had produced just seven months earlier. Suspicions were raised when users on the forum began to look into the bugfix, provoking a discussion as to why the devs had “smuggled” in the fix without an announcement. Eventually, the details were published by FatMan on 27th May. However, the day after the news of the original incident broke, the latest exploit was spotted. Mirror Hack Two: LUNA Switcheroo Source: Mirroruser , Blockpane , FatManTerra “Mirroruser” first posted the details to the Mirror forum, alerting the community to the loss of funds. Due to the same mispricing of LUNC that led to the Anchor exploit , LUNC was assigned the value of LUNA 2.0 on the new chain, at the time ~5 USTC (approx. ~$0.10). The issue was down to Luna Classic validators running an out-of-date oracle , which hadn’t been updated for the legacy chain. This meant that users could buy cheap LUNC, deposit as collateral, and take advantage of the overvaluation to drain Mirror’s pools. The protocol’s mBTC, mETH, mDOT and mGLXY were drained, totalling ~$2M for the attacker. After news of the exploit over the weekend, the oracle was successfully fixed, but the problems didn't stop there. All mAssets (Mirror-wrapped stocks) were still for the taking, unable to be traded until markets opened following the long-weekend. The worry was that the previously stolen funds would be used to snap up the remaining, vastly-undervalued mAssets. However, with just minutes to spare before markets opened on Tuesday, the stolen funds were disabled for use as collateral, saving what remained of the protocol. The fact that a $90M exploit went unnoticed by users (and probably the devs), is symptomatic of the recklessness associated with the failings around the Terra ecosystem. The simplicity of the vulnerabilities seems out of place when compared with the damage that has been done. Firstly, $90M was lost to a basic logic bug, and then, the rushed fork led to the oversight of a very foreseeable oracle issue. Even in the face of these failures, Luna 2.0 is pumping and, despite having lost billions of dollars of other people's money, Do Kwon remains as arrogant as ever. In his rush to repair his reputation, Kwon is taking advantage of all those who are stuck fighting sunk-costs; the developers who invested their time, and retail, who invested their savings. DeFi today feels like it has lost a sense of purpose. Our reputation is damaged, and even the keenest users have less confidence. We may have advanced our methods of wealth distribution, but our moral compass clearly still needs an update.

Woofi - Rekt,85000000,03/05/2024,Certik,https://rekt.news/woo-rekt/,"Woofi - Rekt Wednesday, March 6, 2024 Woofi -  read this article also in : en - es Nothing to Woo about here. WooFi got taken for a $8.5 Million ride on March 5th, after a flash loan attack on Arbitrum. Spreek who was the first to catch last week’s Seneca Protocol attack, front ran the news on the exploit: Wootrade's WooPPV2 contract exploited for a total attacker haul of 8.5m on arbitrum. It is now paused, so no further action is needed. The team didn’t take long to address the issue and paused the pools that were under attack. WooFi , self described as “One Dex to rule all chains”, they offer single-sided yields, cross-chain swaps, perps trading and revenue sharing. Looks like they’re the ones who got ruled, doesn’t it? 2024 is off to a hot start for Arbitrum attacks, with Radiant Capital , Gamma Strategies and Seneca already getting hit. Now that bull season is back, will 2024 make 2023 look like a giant wrestling a midget? Credit: Spreek , Peckshield , Nick L. Franklin , WooFi One of the WOOFi oracles on Arbitrum was exploited using flash loans, which manipulated the price of WOO in order to repay the flash loans at a cheaper price. The attacker manipulated the Woo price to drain funds from the WooPPV2 pool contract. Then drained the pool using the swap function 3 times, stealing about $8.5 million. The exploit was caught and contracts paused within 13 minutes. The attacker still managed to get away with a big stash of ETH. Attacker’s address: 0x9961190b258897bca7a12b8f37f415e689d281c4 Attack tx: 0x40e1b8c78083fc666cb7598efcecd0ae0af313fc41441386e4db716c2808ce07 Attack contract: 0xD4c633C9A765bC690E1FbA566981c1F4eab52dF0 Attack Flow: The stolen funds were sent to this address . Woofi sent an onchain message to the attacker, assuming a whitehat executed the exploit and offered a 10% bounty. Woofi issued a post-mortem and highlighted the exploit: In WOOFi v2, the sPMM system adjusts oracle prices based on trade value to manage slippage and balance pools. However, an error led to a price adjustment outside the expected range and the fallback check, normally executed against Chainlink and didn't cover the WOO token price. The recent addition of a lending market for WOO on Arbitrum, plus relatively low liquidity support for WOO tokens elsewhere on the network, made the exploit economically feasible. Just because your code is audited isn’t a guarantee. Certik most recently audited WOOFi's swap and oracle contracts in October 2022 . Immunefi also held a bug bounty in 2022-3 that included their Wooracle. Although the results don’t seem to be public. Oracle manipulation and flash loan attacks were not excluded. Woofi went live on Arbitrum in November 2022, looks like somebody found a bug. Woofi said this was their first incident. But going cross-chain has its risks. These risks are becoming more common as we connect more networks across the chains. The attack on Woofi underscores the importance of robust security measures, thorough testing, audits, bug bounties and a keen understanding of the complexities of cross-chain operations. The recent addition of a lending market for WOO on Arbitrum, coupled with relatively low liquidity, created a fertile ground for exploitation. Having a novel oracle design that is not widely used, battle-tested and proven to be a cross-chain solution should serve as a reminder not only for Woofi, but any other protocol that tries to reinvent the wheel. Bragging about your sPMM design a few hours before someone took advantage of it is pretty ironic. Is using Chainlink price feeds as a fail safe a good idea? Given some of these circumstances, is it a surprise they were attacked? It's a wake-up call for the DeFi community, reminding us that no system is immune to exploitation, especially in an environment where the stakes are high and the pace of innovation is relentless. Time in our space moves fast, but protocols should slow down at times, especially when they are already live and the risks are more dangerous than in a testing environment. It is much better to catch the mistakes in the lab instead of having them revealed in real time, where bad actors and vigilantes can make an example out of you. While Woofi leads us to believe that it was a whitehat that was behind the attack. At the end of the day, what matters is the fact that they were attacked. It shouldn’t even matter whether it was the good guys or the bad guys. Does it matter if the person who broke your window was a burglar or a neighbor trying to get in?

The final hours of 2023 saw Orbit Chain’s Ethereum bridge lose $81.5M to what looks to have been a compromised multisig. Not to be confused with Orbiter, which connects ETH L2s, Orbit Chain is a standalone network aiming to work as a hub between other established ecosystems. The attack began just after 9PM UTC, and the alarm was raised just a few minutes later. The official acknowledgement referenced a breach shortly before the transactions began… An unidentified access to Orbit Bridge, a decentralized Cross-chain protocol, was confirmed on Dec-31-2023 08:52:47 PM +UTC. …and was accompanied by warnings about opportunistic phishing attacks. With 2023 ending on a bit of a downer, for Orbit at least, what will 2024 bring? Credit: Tayvano , Peckshield While the hack is initially assumed to be due to compromised keys of signer-addresses on the Orbit’s ETH Vault multisig, the team is yet to disclose the exact nature of the attack vector. Others have suggested there could be a tx replay bug at play, similar to a ‘known issue’ identified during Theori’s audit (see page 7). NOTE: This article will be updated to include the root cause once an official post-mortem has been published. Follow-up note: On the 25th Jan, Ozys (Orbit's development company) published a statement implicating the firm's former CISO: Two days after his voluntary retirement decision (November 20), the information security specialist who led Ozys’ efforts to become an ISMS-certified organization, abruptly made the firewall vulnerable and left the company on December 6, without any verbal or written communication during the handover process. Investigations are ongoing. Withdrawals began with 10M DAI at 21:08 UTC, followed by 231 WBTC ($9.8M), 9500 ETH ($21.5M), 10M USDC and finishing with 30M USDT at 21:25 UTC. The bridge was deactivated at 22:21 UTC. Centralised stables and WBTC were swapped out for ETH, as shown in Peckshield’s attack flow : Tay’s thread contains a full list of attacker addresses, where funds remain. Attacker’s primary address: 0x9263e7873613ddc598a701709875634819176aff The methodical tx pattern suggests this may be another Lazarus job, and the team has links to previous hacked projects Belt and Klayswap . The attacker’s address was funded via Tornado Cash through an intermediary address . Over half of Orbit Bridge’s TVL was drained in the attack, adding over $80M to an already impressive total for the presumed culprits. Lazarus was responsible for at least $250M of losses in 2023 alone, with attacks on Atomic Wallet , AlphaPo , Stake and CoinEx all attributed to the group. As markets pick up and institutional interest in crypto continues to grow, we will have to take security more seriously if we want to be taken seriously ourselves: Looks like 2024 is going to be another year of handing DPRK billions of dollars on a silver platter. 🙄 embarrassing af.

Fei Rari - REKT 2,80000000,05/01/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/fei-rari-rekt/,"Fei Rari -  2 Sunday, May 1, 2022 Fei - Rari -  read this article also in : en - fr - ru - tr - zh Fei Rari - rekt. Between approximately 9:00 and 9:35 AM UTC on April 30th, seven of Rari’s Fuse pools were drained for a total of ~$80M. Despite claiming “ none of the arbitrum pools are vulnerable ”, the attack continued on Arbitrum today, though the losses (~100 ETH) were minimal in comparison. This isn’t the first time that Rari has got rekt - lets hope the hackers don’t go for a hat trick. Credit: Hacxyk , Certik Rari uses forked Compound code, which doesn’t follow the check-effect-interaction pattern, and has led to a number of re-entrancy incidents: CREAM , Hundred , Voltage/Ola . In this case though, the re-entrancy pattern is via CEther which uses call.value to send ETH. In the case of the receiver being a contract, call.value is able to make another call which can be abused. This vulnerability was reported in early March and mitigated by upgrading the CToken and Comptroller contracts. However, the new re-entrancy protections didn’t cover the function exitMarket within the Comptroller contract. exitMarket re-assigns a deposited asset as no longer being collateral, which can then be withdrawn, as long as there is no loan taken against the funds. Given that the checks are made after the transfer (due to Compound code not following check-effect-interaction pattern), the transaction doesn’t record the borrowed amount as debt before the collateral is withdrawn. By using flash loans to borrow ETH, the attacker was able to re-enter via call.value , calling exitMarket in order to withdraw the flash loaned collateral whilst also keeping the borrowed ETH. Step-by-step using example tx 0xab4860… 1. Attacker flashloaned 150,000,000 USDC and 50,000 WETH 2. Deposited 150,000,000 USDC as collateral into the fUSDC-127 contract, which is a vulnerable fork version of the compound protocol. 3. With deposited collateral, the attacker borrowed 1,977 ETH via the “borrow()” function. 4. However, the “borrow()” function does not follow the check-effect-interaction pattern. Specifically, it transfers ETH to the attacker’s contract before updating the attacker’s actual borrow records. 5. Therefore, with the attacker’s borrow record not updated, the attacker made a reentrant call to “exitmarket()” in the fallback function, which allows the attacker to withdraw all his collateral (150M USDC) 6. The attacker repeated steps 1~5 on multiple other tokens. 7. Finally, the attacker repaid the flashloan and transferred the rest to their address as profit, and routed some of the funds onward to Tornado Cash. Affected Fuse pools: 8, 18, 27, 127, 144, 146, 156 Attacker’s address (inc. all exploit txs): 0x616275… Attack contracts: 0xE39f3C… , 0x32075b… Arbitrum attack tx: 0x3212d0… Total funds lost: 6,037.8139071514 eth 20,251,603.11559831 fei 14,278,990.684390573 dai 1,948,952.1788665l lusd 10,055,556.328173 usdc 132,959.9008 usdt 31,615.8714 rai 13,101,364.94 frax 2,765,891 ust Total estimated value: $79,749,026 Following the attack, the hacker began depositing the proceeds into Tornado Cash, however stopped after moving just 5400 ETH (~$15M).

Qubit Finance - REKT,80000000,01/28/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/qubit-rekt/,"Qubit Finance -  Friday, January 28, 2022 Qubit Finance - BSC -  read this article also in : de - en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh In other news… Qubit Finance , a BSC-based lending protocol launched by the team behind repeat offender PancakeBunny, has fallen victim to an $80M exploit. That’s number seven on our leaderboard . But will anyone remember this next week? Qubit allows for cross-chain collateralisation , locking assets on Ethereum to borrow against on BSC via the QBridge deposit function. The attacker took advantage of a logic bug in the code which made xETH available for use on BSC without having deposited ETH on Ethereum. The attacker’s Ethereum address was funded from Tornado Cash shortly before the exploit commenced at approximately 21:30 PM +UTC on January 27th 2022. From the Qubit team’s post-mortem : 1. The attacker called the QBridge deposit function on the ethereum network, which calls the deposit function QBridgeHandler. 2. QBridgeHandler should receive the WETH token, which is the original tokenAddress, and if the person who performed the tx does not have a WETH token, the transfer should not occur. 3. tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom(depositer, address(this), amount); 4. In the code above, tokenAddress is 0, so safeTransferFrom didn’t fail and the deposit function ended normally regardless of the amount value. 5. Additionally, tokenAddress was the WETH address before depositETH was added, but as depositETH is added, it is replaced with the zero address that is the tokenAddress of ETH. 6. In summary, the deposit function was a function that should not be used after depositETH was newly developed, but it remained in the contract. According to Certik’s analysis : One of the root causes of the vulnerability was the fact that tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom() does not revert when the tokenAddress is the zero (null) address (0x0…000). Despite not having locked any ETH in the Ethereum contract, the attacker’s BSC address now had access to 77,162 qXETH ($185 million) to use as collateral against loans on Qubit. They used this collateral to borrow WETH, BTC-B, USD stablecoins, and CAKE, BUNNY, and MDX before swapping everything for a total of 200k BNB (~$80M), which remains in the BSC address . According to the Qubit docs, the cross-chain collateral feature was audited in Dec 2021. the whole X-Collateral feature (including contracts and scripts) has been audited by Theori, a professional auditing firm. The audit result is published here . The project has a max bounty of $250k on Immunefi , but the Qubit team seems prepared to negotiate .

Ascendex - REKT,77700000,12/12/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/ascendex-rekt/,"Ascendex -  Sunday, December 12, 2021 Ascendex -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh Two CEX rekt in one week. First BitMart lost ~$196M, now AscendEX has lost $77.7M, again from a “compromised” hot wallet. Why do we see more “compromised keys” in uncertain markets? Are late profit takers grabbing what they can? AscendEX described themselves as a “ group of Wall Street quantitative trading veterans ”, so it’s little surprise that they were playing fast and loose with other people’s money. Claims of “compromised keys” leave us with little to say, and even AscendEX themselves have yet to explain how they let this happen. One thing’s for certain - the AscendEX Twitter intern has been busy with the delete button. Too late though - we saw it all. This one was posted yesterday. Isn’t it annoying when your private keys fall out of your ears. Funds were drained from the hot wallet across three chains, beginning at just before 8PM +UTC on December 11th. AscendEX is still investigating what led to the wallet being compromised. Peckshield puts the losses at $60M on Ethereum, $9.2M on BSC and $8.5M on Polygon. The stolen funds are currently located in the hacker’s address on: Ethereum BSC Polygon One of the assets stolen on BSC, Bemil Coin , has dumped over 98% in price since the incident, leading to the value of the loot on BSC to drop by some $6.5M. In the team’s initial announcement , a full reimbursement was promised to any affected users. Withdrawals, however, have been suspended. In a later update , AscendEX detailed their next steps; the first being the refund. Let’s see if they prioritise their users or wait until more of the stolen coins fall in value... This has been a brutal loss for Ascendex - as one anon pointed out; “ they lost more than their entire series b raise ”. Let’s end with a few more choice tweets from this rekt CEX. Okay George. And what about this one , posted just hours after they lost $77M. Not if you keep it with Ascendex.

Phemex - Rekt,73540297,01/23/2025,N/A,https://rekt.news/phemex-rekt/,"Phemex - Rekt Friday, January 24, 2025 Phemex - Rekt - CEX read this article also in : en When your hot wallets become dozens of points of failure, $73.54 million makes for an expensive lesson in access control. Phemex exchange just learned this lesson the hard way, watching helplessly as an attacker drained their hot wallets across almost 30 different chains in a masterclass of multi-chain mayhem. From Solana to Ethereum, Base to Avalanche, no chain was safe as the attacker systematically emptied wallets faster than Phemex could say ""access control."" The largest centralized exchange hack of 2025 unfolded like a game of blockchain whack-a-mole - as soon as Phemex spotted suspicious activity on one chain, another wallet was already being drained. Their cold wallets may have stayed safe in cold storage, but their hot wallets just got a $73.54 million lesson in thermodynamics. When dozens of chains share the same security flaws, does multi-chain really mean multi-risk? Credit: Peckshield , Cyvers , Federico Variola , Phemex , Crypto Ady , Hacken , The Block , Tayvano Almost 30 chains, one vulnerability, zero time to react - watching Phemex's hot wallets get drained was like witnessing a synchronized swimming routine choreographed by hackers. PeckShield rang the first alarm bell early on January 23rd, spotting suspicious outflows that would make a bank robber blush. Within minutes, Cyvers' systems were lighting up like a Christmas tree, detecting over $29 million in suspicious transfers across multiple chains, but this was just the preview. The protocol's response followed the familiar centralized exchange playbook - suspend withdrawals first, ask questions later. Early security analysis by Hacken points to an access control breach that handed the attacker complete control over Phemex's hot wallets. Like a digital tsunami, the attack swept through blockchain after blockchain, carving out wallets in its wake. Ethereum bore the heaviest blow at $17.45M, while Solana wasn't far behind, losing $14.54M. XRP rounded out the podium finishes with $11.4M vanishing faster than a trader's leverage. The attacker carved through Bitcoin ($5.07M), BSC ($2.88M), Sui ($2457M), and Base ($2.42M). The rampage continued through Tron ($1.64M), Litecoin ($703k), Avalanche ($810k), and Arbitrum ($835k), while Polkadot ($758K), XLM ($863K), Polygon ($507K), Optimism ($421K), and ZkSync Era ($235K) provided the spare change. When you lose control access across twelve chains, you don't just misplace over $73.54 million - you write yourself into the history books of how not to handle private key management. This is going to be a cute post-mortem. Here's how over $73.54 million evaporated chain by chain...

The clinical precision of the attack revealed more than just stolen funds - it exposed the fatal flaw in Phemex's multi-chain ambitions. As MetaMask's principal security researcher Taylor Monahan told The Block the sophistication of the attack - simultaneous drains across chains, methodical token swapping prioritizing freezable assets, and manual execution instead of scripted chaos. While Phemex rushed to reassure users about their cold wallet security, they forgot the first rule of hot wallet management - if you can't secure one chain, maybe don't try securing over a dozen. The team quickly promised a compensation plan would be ""announced soon,"" as if throwing money at the problem could patch their security holes. They might need a bigger compensation fund if they keep treating multi-chain security like a game of whack-a-mole. When every chain becomes a potential point of failure, is multi-chain support really a feature - or just over a dozen ways to get rekt? Whether through leaked private keys or compromised access controls, exchange security keeps failing with clockwork precision. Multi-chain support sounds fantastic until dozens of different doors swing open simultaneously, inviting thieves to a $73.54 million shopping spree. Phemex's hot wallet massacre joins an increasingly crowded club of exchanges who've learned that wallet security isn't just a suggestion - it's an expensive lesson in the art of losing control. Time will tell if we discover the full story behind this exploit. Though if history is any guide, the root cause of access control and private key breaches has a tendency to remain mysteriously classified. In other words, we don’t always find out the entire story. The details fade but the pattern remains crystal clear Hot wallet permissions keep failing, transparency remains optional, and exchanges keep pretending they're ready for multi-chain custody. Which chain will leak next - or have exchanges finally mastered the art of losing money across all of them?

"Curve, Vyper - REKT",69300000,07/30/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/curve-vyper-rekt/,"Curve, Vyper -  Monday, July 31, 2023 Curve - Vyper -  read this article also in : en Multiple protocols bit by the Vyper. And Curve Finance returns to the leaderboard , 100x-ing their previous entry . The total drained from the affected pools reached $69M ( nice ) and came from a number of protocols who use Curve for liquidity of their ETH-pegged assets: JPEG’D lost $11.5M from the pETH/ETH pool Alchemix lost $20.5M from the alETH/ETH pool but were able to save $11.5M Metronome lost $1.6M from the msETH-ETH pool, with the attack tx frontrun by MEV bot 0xc0ffeebabe And Curve itself lost $24.2M from the CRV/ETH pool, $5.4M of which was also frontrun by 0xc0ffeebabe, who quickly returned the funds. Smaller amounts were lost from dBridge ($25k from dormant LPs who hadn’t migrated affected) and BSC Curve-fork Ellipsis ($69k). Peckshield raised the alarm on JPEG’d. Then when Alchemix was also hit , the DeFi community began to panic. This was not just another iteration of the read-only reentrancy bug which has plagued the sector for the past months, despite what Curve initially, and dismissively, assumed . The tweet was deleted once it became clear that the problem ran deeper… …were more pools at risk? As the nature of the threat became clearer , Curve clarified , stating that the bug affected the alETH/msETH/pETH pools and that: Other pools are safe. Then Curve itself was hit when the CRV/ETH pool was drained for $24.3M. Would this bloody Sunday ever end? Credit: Vyper , Ancilia , Chaofan Shou , Tayvano Initially, the hacks were thought to be due to the read-only reentrancy vulnerability which has damaged countless protocols over the last few months, most recently Conic Finance and EraLend . However, the exploited contracts were not external projects using Curve pools as a price feed, but the Curve pools themselves… The root cause was in fact a 0-day compiler bug in certain older versions of Vyper, the language Curve’s contracts are written in. A misalignment of storage slots between two functions (add_liquidity and remove_liquidity) causes a malfunction in the nonreentrant guard . This allows the attacker/s to re-enter the transaction between these two functions in order to manipulated LP token prices and drain the pool. Any pool containing native ETH and written in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 was vulnerable. The bug has been exploitable since 2021, and was patched (seemingly by accident, given no protective actions were taken) in version 0.3.1.

Despite not being able to find a workable exploit, Curve has advised users to withdraw from the Tricrypto pool on Arbitrum out of caution. Thankfully, although being from an older Vyper version, the stETH/ETH pool (>$400M TVL) is fine . As the chaos was unfolding, whitehats rushed to save funds, but were repeatedly pipped to the post by hackers. Some funds were saved, however, totalling $17M so far, with the Metronome funds likely to be returned (0xc0ffeebabe has already set 1000 ETH aside). But many were frustrated at the perceived irresponsible disclosure of the vulnerability (specifically the at-risk version numbers) while efforts were still on-going. BlockSec, who came under fire for publicly reaching out to Curve via Twitter, seem to have a clear conscience and defended their actions as having come after all exploitable pools were drained. Clout farming should take a back-seat when every second counts. As banteg put it : you 👏 don't 👏 tweet 👏 live 👏 vulns 👏 before 👏 they 👏 are 👏 fully 👏 mitigated The losses have been heavy, but the fallout could be worse… Many of the associated tokens took a beating: JPEG (initially -45%, since settled around -20%), pETH (initially -85%, then settled at around -40%), ALCX (down <10%), alETH (roughly -20%), CRV currently -15% but dropped to $0.60 at lowest point. And CRV is the one to watch… The potential impact of such a large amount of CRV being dumped onto the open market (which the hacker still hasn’t done so far…) caused worries due to the highly-leveraged position of the protocol’s founder Michael Ergorov. In a fittingly degen manner, Ergorov has borrowed a total of $107.2M of stablecoins against $284M of CRV collateral across a variety of DeFi lending protocols. But with such a large quantity of CRV hanging in the balance, a liquidation cascade could cause much larger problems than yesterday’s hacks. Theories of perverse incentives aside, Ergorov does seem to be maneuvering but remains in a dicey position under pressure from rapidly increasing interest. For the sake of the whole sector let’s hope his good luck continues… Some managed to profit from yesterday’s chaos, bots included, but are now being urged to do the right thing (by the alETH hacker no less, maybe hinting at some good news to come for Alchemix). While Curve has made clear that the other protocols were not at fault, it’s hard to know where the blame does ultimately lie. Compiler-level vulnerabilities come as a chilling surprise to all involved. Situations like these, which at times seemed to present an existential threat to a key piece of DeFi infrastructure, present an opportunity to break from business as usual and reprioritise. One of the most valuable innovations of our system is the transparency which allows us to dissect incidents like these in an open conversation, in stark contrast to TradFi. The tools underlying our industry require just as much attention as the protocols they are used to build. With the majority of attention on Solidity, this vulnerability in Vyper snuck under the radar for years before being exploited. But the incentives are skewed… Auditing projects can be good money, but generally takes for granted the stability of the underlying language. And with no token for VCs to dump on retail the base layer can often get forgotten about. With 59 contracts potentially affected, a similar bug in Solidity could see far more widespread damage. This hack took a different approach to most. Not content with ripping off protocols for a million or so going after the same read-only reentrancy, the attacker/s targeted a deeper layer to find a way in. That kind of dedication and attention to detail sounds like a certain state-sponsored hacking group … Or perhaps this time the bug was discovered by accident; it’s hard to imagine such a deeply buried vulnerability being painstakingly researched only to get frontrun on execution. Either way, this still offers an opportunity to change direction. Given some of the larger protocols in the space have money to burn, and even more to lose , hiring in-house specialists to work on maintain and research could be money well spent. But while money remains attracted to our casino solely by the promise of moonshots, investment in the most basic level of infrastructure will likely continue to be lacking. Will we learn this time?

Munchables - REKT,62500000,03/26/2024,Entersof,https://rekt.news/munchables-rekt/,"Munchables -  Wednesday, March 27, 2024 Munchables -  read this article also in : en - es Rogue dev tried to turn Munchables into Lunchables. The Blast L2 Big Bang award-winning project Munchables was exploited for $62.5M by a rogue dev. Funds retrieved from dev within a few hours in a rollercoaster ride of a day. Munchables was quick to report that they were compromised on March 26, tracking movements and attempting to stop the transactions. Rumors swirled in the Web3 security community about the possibility that Munchables accidentally hired a North Korean developer who never transferred ownership of the smart contracts back to the team. ZachXBT went on offense against the rogue dev, in a turn of events that may have saved the day for Munchables and those affected by the exploit. This is the second attack on a Blast protocol in under a week. Super Sushi Samurai was sliced just a few days ago for $4.8M. Blast is still a young chain and clearly going through some growing pains, pretty dangerous considering they quickly generated $1.24B TVL , already surpassing Avalanche. Will Blast continue their upward trend or could we continue to see further exploits that could threaten the trust and stability of the entire ecosystem? Credit: ZachXBT , Munchables , Pop Punk , quit.q00t.eth , Pacman The Munchables exploit, resulting in a staggering $62.5M loss, appears to have been meticulously planned by the rogue dev since the initial deployment of the project's smart contract. Upon closer investigation by quit.q00t.eth, it was revealed that the Munchables contract was a dangerously upgradeable proxy, and it had been upgraded from an unverified implementation address . The Munchables contract was soon upgraded to a new version with appropriate checks to prevent users from withdrawing more than they had deposited. However, prior to this upgrade, the attacker managed to manipulate the contract's storage slots and assign themselves a deposited balance of 1,000,000 Ether. The scammer used manual manipulation of storage slots to assign himself an enormous Ether balance before changing the contract implementation to one that appears legit. Then he simply withdrew that balance once TVL was juicy enough. Attacker Address: 0x6e8836f050a315611208a5cd7e228701563d09c5 Contract upgraded March 21: 0xea1d9c0d8de4280b538b6fe6dbc3636602075184651dfeb837cb03f8a19ffc4f A few hours after the attack, in an interesting turn of events, ZachXBT, outed the rogue dev . Four different devs hired by the Munchables team and linked to the exploiter are likely all the same person. They recommended each other for the job, regularly transferred payments to the same two exchange deposit addresses and funded each other's wallets.

Duo Nine highlighted that ZachXBT scared the rogue dev so much, he gave the keys back. Roughly $60.5M funds transferred back to Munchables: Transaction 1: 0x69f271f90204ae993200f54676c922fe5ee3e5020a16ae34f589f52d923857f1 Transaction 2: 0x381d57aa2d959ff9580ad61cc6549ae3c026eed9ee5b2ea10f9601a186c49a13 Transaction 3: 0x62a148877957cbf1ae89cafa144496d99239ee900a3b90194249e6baaa3ddc2f Pacman broke the news that the funds had been secured in a multisig by Blast core contributors. He went on to shout out ZachXBT and samczsun for their support behind the scenes. There were rumors within the Web3 community suggesting the rogue dev might be linked to Lazarus , a North Korean hacking group. While there's no official confirmation, this speculation raises intriguing questions about the attacker's motives and methods. Another controversial topic that was floated by the community around the exploit, was the possibility of rolling back the Blast chain, which immediately raised decentralization concerns. Since the funds were returned, the chain rollback idea was dead in the water, but the conversation did open up a can of worms. There was an audit completed March 2024 by Entersof. Password for Audit: ESMunc@24! Not that the audit helped much with this matter as rogue dev is usually not in the gameplan. Some of these exploit stories are filled with villains and victims, with the occasional hero in the mix. Did the heroes save the day this time around? What could have been the biggest hack of 2024, ended up being an inside job that did not clearly go as planned thanks to some vigilante justice. The CEO of Pixecraft Studios mentioned giving the dev a trial hire in 2022, which didn’t even last a month, due to the dev being sketchy af. After that incident, they changed their hiring practices and now collaborate exclusively with trusted recruiters who conduct background checks on candidates. They recommend all crypto teams adopt similar measures to avoid bad actors found on public job boards. Whether to dox or not is a hot topic. While the debate over doxxing continues within the crypto community, it's clear that in cases like the Munchables exploit, the practice may serve as a powerful deterrent against malicious actors and protect the integrity of DeFi platforms. As the space evolves, finding a balance between maintaining privacy and ensuring accountability will be crucial in fostering trust among users. With ZachXBT being on the case and already having leads, people chatting about simply modifying chain state or rolling back and the rogue dev having no way to transfer funds without being caught, it is no surprise that the exploiter got checkmated so quickly. But, this situation could have gone in a different direction and things could have gotten uglier than they ended up. What if Blast ended up rolling back the chain, assuming that they even can? This was the 2nd attack on Blast in under a week. It's essential for other protocols on the network to reassess their security measures and remain vigilant against similar threats. Will the chain become known as a Blast from the past?

AlphaPo - REKT,60000000,07/22/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/alphapo-rekt/,"AlphaPo -  Wednesday, July 26, 2023 AlphaPo -  read this article also in : en - es $60M gone and it barely raises an eyebrow… AlphaPo , a crypto payments processor for gambling platforms, lost $60M across ETH, TRON and BTC over the weekend. The initial figure, reported by ZachXBT, sat at $23M before a further $37M were traced and added to the total yesterday. Hypedrop, who rely on AlphaPo, have suspended deposits and have reassured users that withdrawals will eventually be paid out, but declined to mention the hack. Both the attack type and pattern of transactions post-hack point to a certain set of state-sponsored cybercriminals: This hack appears to likely have been done by Lazarus as they create a very distinct fingerprint on-chain. It’s been a while since we’ve seen a centralised platform’s hot wallet drained… Lazarus must have been focusing their efforts elsewhere . Could this be the start of another CEX spearphishing spree? As ever, stories of compromised hot wallets leave little to be said. The phishing techniques used by sophisticated groups like Lazarus are varied and ever-evolving . But they alway have a common goal… On Ethereum, the attack begun when AlphaPo’s hot wallet ( alphapo.eth ) began to be drained in the early hours (UTC) of Saturday. 2464 ETH ($4.6M) and a variety of other coins (including over 6M USDT) were transferred to the hacker’s address , swapped to ETH, were then consolidated into a secondary account before being dispersed . Some of the stolen funds on Tron were sent to CEXs . Attacker’s main addresses: ETH 0x040a96659fd7118259ebcd547771f6ecb9580d17 0x6d2e8a20b8afa88d92406d315b67822c01e53c38 0xde374094C837D192B61972172740BDAfc4eE16E0 TRON TKSitnfTLVMRbJsF1i2UH5hNUeHLDrXDiY TDoNAZHa7WxarUAFbQUhiijTGtd7EpbzRh TJF7mdFxDuHB4tb9hoyR4SCpKxk7gr23ym According to ZachXBT the movement of funds on-chain (tracked in this dashboard ) have a strong correlation with patterns associated with the Lazarus group. MistTrack’s analysis of the wallets involved have shown links to addresses involved in the draining of Atomic Wallet accounts (also attributed to Lazarus) and a potential, but as yet acknowledged, attack on Coinspaid. A $60M hack would have topped the rekt.news leaderboard up until the mammoth Poly Network exploit in August of 2021. But nowadays, such blips are in and out of the news cycle in the blink of an eye. Are we simply becoming desensitised to such large losses? Or are we just getting increasingly apathetic as the bear market drags on? Or, perhaps, the only ones still here too busy either building or hamster racing to notice. One thing’s for sure, Lazarus isn’t getting bored.

EasyFi - REKT,59000000,04/19/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/easyfi-rekt/,"EasyFi -  Tuesday, April 20, 2021  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh The first hack on Layer 2 was EASY. The Polygon (formerly MATIC) network saw $6 million in stablecoins and ~$53 million in EASY tokens taken without any complications, when the mnemonic keys for EasyFi fell into the wrong hands. The founder has compared the attack techniques to those used on Hugh Karp of Nexus Mutual - a compromised machine leading to total loss of liquidity. How should we react when users' funds are lost in this way? There’s no debate between “hack or exploit” in cases like this, however more sceptical readers may consider the term “fraud”. The hacker didn’t attack through any holes in the code, and the founder seems to have used reasonable security measures, yet still they end up at number one on the rekt.news leaderboard . Is nobody safe? Despite the public announcement of the attack and the fact that the hacker is now holding 2.98 million EASY tokens, the price of the token has not dumped as much as one might expect. The price of the token fell only ~20% in the past 24 hours since the hack. This is likely due to the fact that the hacker has not yet started to sell their stolen tokens. EASY is a relatively illiquid asset, with an average 24hr trading volume of roughly $10m ($43m in the past 24hr). The hacker is now in control of 30% of the total supply, and with little liquidity, there is not much they can do. The founders are also in a tough situation; the EasyFi network has become centralised and controlled by a criminal mind. So the hacker takes the number one place on our leaderboard on paper , and also - have they deserved it? The founder of EasyFi writes that; the compromised machine was not used for daily operations and is used solely for the purpose of official transfers. If these funds were used for “official transfers”, then they must have been part of some kind of treasury. If so, why would a single user or device have access?
Why wouldn't these tokens be on a Multisig Wallet and / or be secured by a hardware wallet? If this admin key was secured by nothing more than a MetaMask hot wallet, then there’s little reason for sympathy. Those who are in charge of other peoples funds have no reason to not use maximum security. We await a more detailed post mortem from @AnkittGaur , who will hopefully have more detailed explanations as to how this attack took place. It seems EasyFi is hoping for mercy from their attacker, as they published the following open letter in their “ pre-post-mortem ” OPEN LETTER TO THE HACKER You’ve used very sophisticated techniques to steal a lot of funds from the EasyFi community. EasyFi is a very new project which has received a lot of love & support from its users being the one of early movers on the layer 2 Polygon network. We are still at a very early stage and not in a position to make good all the losses in a personal capacity. We care for our community and shall do everything possible at our end to make good all the losses that happened to our users from this theft. We are in great shock and, believe, so as our users who relied on & supported us since inception. As the founder of the project, I would urge you to be thoughtful of the hard work gone into building EasyFi so far. I request you to consider returning all funds and discuss the possibility of an appropriate bounty to avoid all the legal trouble in the future. We can consider a clean payout to a white hacker worth 1M USD and not attempt any legal proceedings regarding this incident. This protocol had thousands of users, yet the founders used a level of OPSEC that would be considered poor even just for an individual. Although the eventual incident was supposedly caused by an external attacker, EASY token holders were in a precarious situation all along. The (single) admin key was capable of draining all the liquidity with no timelock using the “transfer” function shown below. Poor OPSEC and a total lack of effort led to this huge loss of funds. Who knows how EasyFi will explain the situation, but there is very little they could say that would shift the responsibility. Why would they not use a multisig, or even a hardware wallet?

Uranium Finance - REKT,57200000,04/28/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/uranium-rekt/,"Uranium Finance -  Wednesday, April 28, 2021 Uranium -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh Uranium Finance has exploded, and not for the first time. The BSC Uniswap clone played around too much with their copied code and left a loophole open for someone to take the funds. At least $57,000,000 was taken due to a simple math bug introduced to the UraniumPair contracts which had been forked from the Uniswap v2 code. Uranium Finance had already suffered a prior exploit of their rewards contract earlier this month, when they introduced vulnerabilities into the MasterChef contract. At least 2,200 ETH from the latest incident have already been mixed through Tornado.cash, from a total amount worth approximately $57.2 million at the time of writing. Co-founder of bzX Kyle Kistner pointed out the small change in the UraniumPair contract that had such dramatic effects: VS Did you spot the difference? 1,000 was changed to 10,000 in two places but not at the end. This resulted in being able to swap 1 wei of the input token for 98% of the total balance of the output token. This ultimately breaks the check for the Uniswap v2 x * y = k “constant product” formula before updating fee-adjusted reserve balances. Credit: 0xdeadf4ce The following funds were removed: 34k WBNB ($18M) 17.9M BUSD ($17.9M) 1.8k ETH ($4.7M) 80 BTC ($4.3M) 26.5k DOT ($0.8M) 638k ADA ($0.8M) 5.7M USDT ($5.7M) 112k U92 Before interacting with Uranium, the attacker sent the minimum amount of each token to pair contracts. After that, they used a low-level function swap() whose execution should drain both reserves. The Uranium team migrated the contract to v2 about ten days ago, and the old version did not have this bug. The team then decided to update the protocol to v2.1, in which the only significant change is the fix of the above-mentioned bug. The liquidity migration from v2 to v2.1 was supposed to start today. So they added a bug in v2, left it for ten days, and on the day they were due to fix it, it was exploited. To make things even more suspicious, we note that the Uranium contracts repository has been removed from Github. Credit : igor igamberdiev Did the Uranium team add in the bug and use the liquidity migration to try and hide it? Or did “somebody” “find out” about the bug and exploit it just before the developers managed to fix it? Cross chain hacks are becoming more common. The BSC system is not as closed as it once was. There are multiple bridges out of BSC now, and they’re not all controlled by Binance, meaning CZ can’t blacklist all the addresses and keep the stolen funds on BSC. Attackers will steal on one chain and escape to another where they can’t be tracked so easily. Tornado is currently the only DAPP allowing for this kind of exit, but we’ll soon see clones on other chains. The beneficiary of this incident is now sat on $57.2 million of liquid assets, a much more preferable prize than the EASY tokens of our previous article, and one which places them in second place on our leaderboard . Exploits and rug pulls will slow down, but they’re unlikely to stop completely. Even now, when we have battle tested code such as Curve and Uniswap, users still look to chase higher returns in untested projects, so for now, rug pulls look set to stay. One day hackers will operate on fully private chains where they have no need to escape with their funds, but until then... rekt will be watching.

Whale Hunter's Payday,55470000,08/20/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/whale-hunters-payday/,"Whale Hunter's Payday Wednesday, August 21, 2024  - Phishing read this article also in : en - es - zh When phishing for whales, sometimes you land a big one. A crypto whale found themselves $55.47 million lighter after falling victim to a sophisticated phishing attack targeting their Maker vault. On August 20, ZachXBT noticed something phishy , when a whopping 55.47 million DAI had vanished from a single wallet. The whale, perhaps sensing something was amiss, attempted to withdraw their funds to safer waters. But it was too late, the ownership had already changed and the transaction failed. A digital fortune had evaporated in the blink of an eye, serving as a very expensive lesson in the dangers lurking in crypto's deep waters. How did this whale fall for such an elaborate trap and end up on the phisher's menu? Credit: ZachXBT , CertiK , The Block , Lookonchain The attack played out like a masterclass in digital sleight of hand. Our unfortunate whale inadvertently signed an unknown transaction, unknowingly handing over the keys to 55.47 million DAI. The attacker, armed with control of the victim's externally owned account (EOA), set their sights on the real prize: a Maker Vault. With the finesse of a seasoned angler, the attacker transferred ownership of the victim's DSProxy, a smart contract allowing multiple calls in a single transaction, to their own address. This clever maneuver allowed them to change the vault's owner address and withdraw 55,473,618 DAI stablecoins directly into their wallet. Hook, line and sinker. Victim's address: 0xf2B889437F243396b29E829908b5d8ebE2e13048 Phishing address: 0x0000db5c8B030ae20308ac975898E09741e70000 Attacker's withdrawal address: 0x5D4b2A02c59197eB2cAe95A6Df9fE27af60459d4 The main heist transaction: 0xf70042bf3ae7c22f0680f8afa078c38989ed475dfbe5c8d8f30a50d4d2f45dc4 Lookonchain reported that the attacker had already begun laundering their ill-gotten gains. By the time of reporting, 27.5 million DAI had been swapped for 10,625 ETH. In these murky waters, even skilled crypto divers struggle to retrieve what's been lost to the depths. Will the remaining funds be recovered or are they destined to sleep with the fishes? This incident serves as another stark reminder of the dangers lurking in the crypto depths. Phishing attacks continue to be a preferred method for malicious actors, with CertiK reporting nearly $498 million lost to such attacks in the first half of 2024 alone. Jingyi Guo, an analyst at Blocksec, highlighted the likelihood that the victim had signed a phishing transaction, given their failed attempts to invoke the DSProxy after the ownership change. One errant click is all it takes and it can cost you dearly. As the crypto seas become increasingly treacherous, users are urged to implement stronger security measures. Multi-factor authentication, hardware wallets and a healthy dose of paranoia are becoming as essential as a life jacket on a sinking ship. For now, this whale's tale serves as a cautionary story for all who swim in these waters. The next time you're about to sign a transaction, remember that there's always a bigger phish out there and it might just be waiting for you to take the bait. In the grand ocean of crypto, even the mightiest whales aren't safe from a well-crafted lure. As phishing attacks evolve and predators grow bolder, is there any safe harbor left in the turbulent seas of crypto?

bZx - REKT,55000000,11/05/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/bzx-rekt/,"bZx -  Saturday, November 6, 2021 bZx -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh Attacks can come from all angles. It may be their first time on our leaderboard, but this protocol has priors. The debut entry for bzx.network goes straight into the top 10. A bZx developer was sent a phishing email to his personal computer with a malicious macro in a Word document that was disguised as a legitimate email attachment, which then ran a script on his Personal Computer. This led to his personal mnemonic wallet phrase being compromised. Before yesterday's events, the last incident to hit the project was in September 2020, when $8M was taken (and later returned). Previously, in February 2020, bZx fell victim to two attacks, in which $298,000 and $645,000 were lost to the first flash loan based exploits. Looks like 4th time’s the charm for bZx. Given their chequered past, when the announcement came yesterday that the “ private key controlling the Polygon and BSC deployments was compromised ”, the replies were more of exasperation than of shock... ""What is this like 4th time?"" ""It’s probably time for you guys to just give up on this whole crypto thing. Y’all ngmi."" ~10 hours after the initial announcement, bZx published an update stating that one of their devs had fallen victim to a phishing attack, stressing that the code itself hadn’t been compromised... Which was of little comfort for the users who lost their money. Slowmist have been keeping a running total of funds lost, which at the time of writing is up to ~$55M. It’s hard to blame the team when the attack is so sneaky. Can bZx recover, or is this their fourth and final fatality? bZx have issued a preliminary post mortem , detailing the events and containing a list of addresses used by the hacker across Polygon , BSC ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) and multiple Ethereum addresses ( primary wallet ). In place of the more technically advanced exploits that the protocol has faced in the past, this time the root of the issue was a simple phishing attack. Sometime before the exploit, a bZx dev was sent a phishing email with an attached Word document containing a malicious macro. Opening this document resulted in the dev having the keys to their personal wallet compromised. But this was not a personal attack. This EOA had control over bZx’s Polygon and BSC deployments. The hacker was therefore able to gain control of the contracts and drain them of BZRX . The code was then updated to enable the extraction of tokens from any wallet which had granted token approvals to the affected contracts. Check your token approvals here: Polygon , BSC List of bZx contracts Despite bZx’s attempts to convince the community that the damage was contained to just Polygon and BSC, the hacker then sent stolen BZRX to Ethereum to use as collateral and borrow a variety of other assets. Though the attacker nets less profit this way, they also find a way around the liquidity problem of attempting to dump such a large quantity of BZRX. bZx state that they have reached out to centralised services, requesting that Circle freeze the stolen USDC, while the funds on Binance as well as USDT were quickly frozen. They have also reached out to the hacker offering to “ chat and reach an agreement ” The fact that such a large loss of funds can be attributed to such a simple attack vector is hard to believe, especially for a protocol that has experienced more than their fair share of security issues in the past. Anyone in crypto should be expected to be wary, and devs working on high TVL projects especially so. But human error in this case should never have been able to lead to such an enormous loss . But does all the blame lie with the protocol? Losing control of contracts due to their being vulnerable to a single EOA security breach is unimaginable for any responsible project, and there is no room for “ incompetence or negligence ” when $55M is at stake. That being said, it takes an especially callous and greedy hacker to go on to drain individual users’ wallets after having extracted millions. So long rekt readers. Until next time, bZx...

Is that a new record? CEX CoinEx has become the latest crypto custodian to have its hot wallets emptied, losing an eventual total of $54.3M. They may want to update their homepage : Secure and safeguarded with 0 incident Approximately four hours after the attack began , CoinEx acknowledged the incident ( though the thread has since been deleted and replaced with a more urgent sounding message ). Presumably, letting users know they have a “ special investigative team ” on the case didn’t cut the mustard… CoinEx assures users that the missing coins make up “ just a very small portion of CoinEx’s total asset ”, and that losses will be covered. Deposits and withdrawals are currently suspended. As with last week’s $40M+ Stake hack , the alarm was raised by Cyvers , who flagged the suspicious outflows. The Stake incident was later attributed to DPRK state-sponsored hackers by the FBI. Could this be twice in two weeks for Lazarus ? Looks like it. Credit: ZachXBT , CoinEx The attack began with a transfer of almost 4950 ETH (worth approximately $8M) at 1:20:59 PM UTC. As in previous examples, wallets were then rapidly drained of ETH/TRON/MATIC followed by other assets, which in turn were swapped back to native assets over the following hours and forwarded onto new addresses.

The multi-chain lending protocol suffered a devastating attack that drained over $53 million from user wallets. It appears that compromised private keys left Radiant's defenses in tatters. Markets frozen, users reeling, damage still being tallied and this will be one hell of a post-mortem. This marks the second major incident for Radiant in 2024, following a $4.5 million flash loan exploit earlier this year. Could this be the final nail in Radiant Capital's coffin, or can they somehow rise from these ashes? Credit: Ancilia , Radiant Capital , Hacken The attack on Radiant Capital unfolded with surgical precision, exploiting a critical weakness in the protocol's multi-signature setup. Blockchain security firm Ancilia first spotted suspicious activity on Radiant's BSC contract, warning users to revoke approvals as $16M had already vanished. Radiant Capital remained silent for two hours before finally acknowledging the attack on BSC and Arbitrum. They announced collaborations with security firms and paused markets on Base and Mainnet. Radiant also recommended revoking access to the following contracts: ARB: 0xF4B1486DD74D07706052A33d31d7c0AAFD0659E1 BSC: 0xd50Cf00b6e600Dd036Ba8eF475677d816d6c4281 BASE: 0x30798cFe2CCa822321ceed7e6085e633aAbC492F ETH: 0xA950974f64aA33f27F6C5e017eEE93BF7588ED07 This was no ordinary hack, but a masterclass in exploiting centralized control points within decentralized finance. Radiant's security hinged on an 11-signer multi-sig wallet, a setup that should have provided robust protection. However, the devil was in the details: only 3 signatures were required to execute transactions. This low threshold proved to be Radiant's Achilles' heel. The attacker, demonstrating an alarming level of access, managed to gain control of at least 3 of these signers. With this foothold, they swiftly executed a three-step plan that would make any black hat hacker proud: Transfer ownership of the lending pools to their malicious contract Upgrade the implementation of the lending pools Drain funds from the compromised pools Despite Radiant's use of a MultiSig wallet for security, the attacker managed to gain control and execute a meticulously planned exploit. The attack unfolded across multiple chains, with evidence suggesting weeks of preparation. The attacker's first move was to transfer ownership of the Pool Provider contract, which manages Radiant's various lending pools, to a malicious contract. This attack was executed on both BSC and Arbitrum: Attack Transaction on BSC: 0xd97b93f633aee356d992b49193e60a571b8c466bf46aaf072368f975dc11841c Attack Transaction on ARB: 0x7856552db409fe51e17339ab1e0e1ce9c85d68bf0f4de4c110fc4e372ea02fb1 Attacker Address 1: 0x0629b1048298AE9deff0F4100A31967Fb3f98962 Attacker Address 2: 0x97a05becc2e7891d07f382457cd5d57fd242e4e8 The exploiter used DEXs such as 1inch, ParaSwap, PancakeSwap, and Odos to swap for some ETH and BNB, before moving funds to the following wallets. Stolen funds moved to Address on ARB: 0x8B75E47976C3C500D0148463931717001F620887 Stolen funds moved to Address on BSC: 0xcF47c058CC4818CE90f9315B478EB2f2d588Cc78 The malicious contract, used as the implementation for the proxy upgrade, was deployed 14 days ago on several chains. Malicious Contract on BSC: 0x57ba8957ed2ff2e7AE38F4935451E81Ce1eEFbf5 Malicious Contract on ARB: 0x57ba8957ed2ff2e7AE38F4935451E81Ce1eEFbf5 This two-week gap between deployment and execution suggests a carefully orchestrated plan, with the attacker biding their time for the perfect moment to strike. Interestingly, blockchain data revealed by Hacken point to an attempted exploit on Arbitrum six days prior to the successful attack. Failed Attack on ARB: 0xab34055320676b35d4c6c5936dabc4101b45eda0d66b94ee02f10a96e8a1dd45 This failed attempt provides insight into the attacker's persistence and willingness to refine their approach. Moreover, the same malicious contract was deployed on Ethereum and Base, though these weren't utilized in the attack. Malicious Contract on ETH: 0x3C2Bc83Dcd293Cc8a23526A37aaeEdD83eBd62de Malicious Contract on BASE: 0x57ba8957ed2ff2e7AE38F4935451E81Ce1eEFbf5 The attacker's ambition wasn't limited to a two-chain heist. Malicious contracts lay dormant on Ethereum and Base, like digital time bombs waiting for their moment. It seems our enterprising hacker had dreams of a cross-chain apocalypse, thwarted only by Radiant's belated realization that they were being gutted like a fish. This wasn't just an attack, it was a master class in DeFi demolition. Our ""friend"" came prepared with a Swiss Army knife of exploits, ready to carve up Radiant's entire multi-chain buffet. In this multi-chain feast of vulnerabilities, who's next on the menu? Radiant Capital's multi-chain dreams have turned into a cross-chain nightmare. With over $53 million evaporating faster than you can say ""not your keys"" the protocol's future looks about as bright as a black hole. This isn't just a flesh wound – it's a full-body amputation. Radiant's ""robust"" 3-of-11 multisig turned out to be as secure as a paper lock on a bank vault. The attacker didn't just find a chink in the armor; they waltzed through the front door with VIP access. The hacker's two-week preparation period suggests they had more patience than Radiant had security. While the protocol was busy expanding across chains, the attacker was meticulously laying out the welcome mat for their own personal heist party. Radiant's second major incident this year begs the question: is this a case of lightning striking twice, or just shoddy electrical wiring? With their reputation now resembling Swiss cheese, Radiant faces an uphill battle to regain user trust – if there's anyone left to trust them. As users flee the smoldering ruins of yet another DeFi disaster, will they ever feel safe venturing into multi-chain protocols that forgot to install the guard rails?

KyberSwap - REKT,48000000,11/22/2023,"ChainSecurity, Sherlock",https://rekt.news/kyberswap-rekt/,"KyberSwap -  Thursday, November 23, 2023 KyberSwap -  read this article also in : en It’s already been a November to remember… and there’s still a week to go. OG decentralised exchange KyberSwap is the latest project to fall victim, getting rekt across six chains for a total loss of over $48M. The project’s concentrated liquidity protocol, KyberSwap Elastic, saw its TVL fall from $71M to under $3M. The losses were spread out as follows: >$20M on Arbitrum, $15M on Optimism, $7.5M on Ethereum, $3M on Polygon, $2M on Base and $23k on Avalanche. This incident brings the total stolen this month to over $300M ( so far ), including Poloniex ($126M), dYdX ($8M), Kronos Research ($26M), HECO Bridge and HTX ($99M). Spreek spotted the hack, which was confirmed within the hour by KyberNetwork : As a precautionary measure, we strongly advise all users to promptly withdraw their funds. Our team is diligently investigating the situation, and we commit to keeping you informed with regular updates. Honestly, given that the hacker basically left on-chain instructions , it’s probably best to withdraw from any KyberSwap forks, in case of black hat copycats. As well as playing the Bob Ross of smart contract exploiting, the hacker has some shady connections, but nonetheless claims to be keen to negotiate ( after a nap, of course ). Is this an exhausted grey hat, inspired by a near-miss of a similar (albeit simpler ) vulnerability , and finally looking to secure a bounty after over six months of work? Or just a bluffing troll? Credit: 0xdoug , BlockSec The attack, which began shortly before 11 PM UTC last night, targeted KyberSwap Elastic (concentrated liquidity) pools. The exploit involved using flash loans to push asset prices into a region of each pool’s liquidity curve where there was no existing liquidity. Then, by executing extremely precise swaps within this region, the exploiter was able to trick Kyber’s code via a precision error. That shows just how carefully engineered this exploit was. The check failed by <0.00000000001% See 0xdoug’s detailed breakdown here . BlockSec defined the route cause as “ tick manipulation and double liquidity counting ”: In summary, the attackers borrowed a flash loan and drained the pools with low liquidity. By executing swaps and altering positions, they manipulated the current prices and ticks of the victimized pools. Ultimately, the attacker triggered multiple swap steps and cross tick operations, resulting in double liquidity counting and consequently draining the pools. Exploiter address 1 ( ARB , OP , ETH , MATIC , BASE , AVAX ): 0x50275e0b7261559ce1644014d4b78d4aa63be836 Exploiter address 2 ( ARB , OP , ETH , MATIC , BASE , AVAX ): 0xc9b826bad20872eb29f9b1d8af4befe8460b50c6 Example attack tx (ETH): 0x485e08dc… The attacker used the 0x50275 address for execution and 0xc9b82 address for holding stolen funds across all affected chains. BlockSec’s MetaSleuth provided a map of all the attacks. EigenPhi published a list of all transactions. Although the hacker also funded their address on Scroll, the attack never went ahead. Initial funding came from Tornado Cash on Ethereum (via an intermediary address ), which in turn funded the ARB, OP, BASE and (unused) Scroll addresses. MATIC and AVAX funding came from FixedFloat. According to KyberSwap’s docs , the current version of Elastic had been audited by ChainSecurity and via a Sherlock contest . The exploiter clearly has on-chain flair, showing their working via tx event logs throughout the attack, leaving charming comments such as “ Step 2, finding liquidity required ”, “ Is it enough? ” and “ Raping Now ”. They also sent 1000 ETH on Arbitrum to an address associated with the $16M hack of Indexed Finance in October 2021. While this may be simple misdirection, the move does sound plausibly like the actions of the Indexed hacker, limelight-loving Andean Medjedovic, who has previous in being performatively offensive. The timing is also strange, given the recent (thwarted) governance attack on Indexed Finance’s abandoned treasury. While the fallout is ongoing , the initial attempt appears linked to Lazarus . However, while many recent hacks have Lazarus written all over them, this incident looks different. Candid on-chain easter-eggs and attempts at misdirection aren’t Lazarus’ style; they don’t waste time planting red-herrings. Instead, they opt to work openly, relying on complex webs of transactions to bore and confuse investigators, or throw them off the scent. And if it were Lazarus, they certainly wouldn’t be looking to negotiate… Whoever the hacker may turn out to be, it appears that all hope is not lost. The the following on-chain message was sent from the exploiter’s address upon completion of the attack: Dear Kyberswap Developers, Employees, DAO members and LPs, Negotiations will start in a few hours when I am fully rested.

Cashio - REKT,48000000,03/23/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/cashio-rekt/,"Cashio -  Wednesday, March 23, 2022 Cashio -  - Solana read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh ~$48M CASHed out. The latest leaderboard entry (#13) comes from the Solana network, where an anonymous attacker used an infinite mint to make Cashio print faster than the Fed. The exploit began at 08:15 UTC. At 09:59 UTC, Cashio made their announcement: Please do not mint any CASH. There is an infinite mint glitch. We are investigating the issue and we believe we have found the root cause. Please withdraw your funds from pools. We will publish a postmortem ASAP. Hyperinflation on a crypto timeframe. At least their tagline was accurate. Credit: samczsun, @madergaser, and @siintemal. The root of the infinite mint vulnerability was Cashio’s incomplete collateral validation system. Before accepting tokens as collateral to mint CASH, the contract checks that the tokens to be deposited are correct (the same type of token that the contract holds). However, the validation of the LP tokens to be deposited via saber_swap.arrow is incomplete, as the .mint field is never validated. This results in the hacker being able to create a fake root contract , which is never validated, and then a chain of fake accounts which each pass validation checks as they are compared only to one another. UPDATE (25/03/2022): The hacker also bypassed depositor_source via a similar mechanism, creating a false bank in order to pass the common.collateral verification. Full details here. The hacker was therefore able to use their token as collateral to mint 2B $CASH. Part of the funds were then burned for SaberSwap LP tokens which were cashed out for 10.8M UST and 16.4M USDC, and the remaining 1.97B CASH were swapped for 8.6M UST and 17M USDC on SaberSwap. The majority of funds were bridged back to Ethereum, and swapped for >16k ETH (~$48M) which remains in this wallet. Following the attack, the exploiter’s SOL address emitted hundreds of transactions of relatively small amounts of USDC to different addresses. And 3 hours after the exploit began, the hacker left the following message via transaction input data : “Account with less 100k have been returned. all other money will be donated to charity.” As the attacker has handled part of the refund process themselves, perhaps Cashio will decide to continue. We’ll find out for sure in their planned post-mortem. Should we believe the charitable claims of the anonymous attacker, or is this just an attempt to dissuade anyone from trying to track them down? Shitcoins stolen to fund the war effort? We’ll watch the wallet to find out.

PancakeBunny - REKT,45000000,05/19/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/pancakebunny-rekt/,"PancakeBunny -  Thursday, May 20, 2021 PancakeBunny - BSC -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh “Aren’t Flash loans Earitating” said the hacker . $45 million gone from Pancake Bunny Finance. This was made possible due to a bug in the protocol that uses PancakeSwap to retrieve the prices of PancakeSwap liquidity providers (BNB-BUSDT / BNB-BUNNY) 8 flash loans were used to manipulate the price on various PancakeSwap pools, creating a skewed calculation of BUNNY from the VaultFliptoFlip vault. This led to the minting of 697,000 BUNNY tokens, which were then sold, causing the price to drop from $146 to $6. Credit: Peckshield BSCScan Transaction. Step 1: Take 8 different flashloans: The first seven flashloans are taken from various PancakeSwap pools while the last comes from Fortube Bank. 1.05M WBNB from WBNB+CAKE pool 522.52K WBNB from WBNB+BUSD pool 210.16K WBNB from WBNB+ETH pool 133.50K WBNB from WBNB+BTCB pool 241.02K WBNB from WBNB+SAFEMOON pool 98.519K WBNB from WBNB+BELT pool 66.29K WBNB from WBNB+DOT pool 2.96M USDT from Fortube Bank. Step 2: Deposit 2.96M USDT and 7886 WBNB into WBNB+BUSDT pool as liquidity and mint 144.45K LP tokens. Step 3: Swap 2.32M WBNB for 3.83M BUSDT via the above WBNB+BUSDT pool so that the pool has a sufficiently large WBNB reserve, which is used to influence the valuation of the pool tokens. Step 4: Call getReward() to claim rewards from VaultFlipToFlip. With the higher LP token valuation, the attacker is able to claim a reward of 6.97M BUNNY (valued about $1+ B). Note the dev team gets separate 1.05M BUNNY. Step 5: Return the flashloans in Step 1 back to PancakeSwap pools and Fortube Bank. The attacker’s loot was initially held in this wallet: 0xa0acc61547f6bd066f7c9663c17a312b6ad7e187. At its peak, Pancake Bunny had over $10 billion in TVL. At the time of writing, that TVL is down to just over $1 billion. Even a Haechi audit couldn’t protect the Pancake Bunny from the awesome power of flash loan attack, earning them joint third position on the rekt leaderboard.

Kucoin originally stated that the stolen tokens had a value of at least $150m, however some are estimating the true value to be as high as $280m, as more wallets are linked to the attack. https://twitter.com/lawmaster Over the last 24 hours, the hacker has been attempting to launder the stolen money via Binance and Uniswap, selling all tokens for ETH. The first tokens to be sold were OCEAN and SNX, where the large market sales caused the price to decrease dramatically. OCEAN sales on etherscan Ocean protocol price impact 7 day chart (Sep-27-2020 06:54:55 AM +UTC) SNX sales on etherscan SNX price impact 7 day chart (Sep-27-2020 12:52:25 PM +UTC)
The hacker has gone on to sell COMP, LINK, and DIA, and with the token holdings of the wallet in full view, it has caused some uncertainty amongst holders of the ~160 different tokens that remain in the wallet . Breadcrumbs provides a visualisation of the flow of tokens from Kucoin to the hackers wallet. From this graphic we can see the attackers funds are flowing through Uniswap and consolidating in the following two addresses. 0x00600423c03ec4b46f9b8a28c66d42bdd1b19c36 0xf519e276958c3ef2dffd9b6b2d87d26859526505 One of the first tokens to be moved out of the hackers address was a relatively small sum of 50,000 USDT , after which Tether moved quickly to freeze the remaining tokens in the wallet; a predictable move that left some wondering why the hacker didn’t exchange this currency first. Other tokens have taken steps to reduce the damage caused by this hack by forking, freezing or blacklisting the stolen tokens. Some of the projects that have acted against the hacker with approximate value of tokens stolen. Velo ~$76 million Tether ~22 million Orion ~$10 million KardiaChain ~$10 million Ocean Protocol ~$9 million Ampleforth - $9 million VIDT Datalink ~$7 million NOIA Network ~$5 million Aleph - $1.2 million Covesting ~$600,000 Opacity - $215,000 SilentNotary - $99,000 Although this is positive news for the owners of the stolen funds, it does cast doubt on the true decentralisation of each protocol. Despite the hacker being able to remove $150m in ERC20 tokens from the exchange, the relatively unadvanced techniques used to launder the funds have caused some to wonder if the hacker was in fact a Kucoin employee. As the funds were removed via access to the hot wallet private key rather than a brute force attack,  this looks to be a possibility. Amidst claims that the hacker would have been better off using DeFi instruments such as Curve or Balancer to launder their money, Curve has spoken out to state that decentralised protocols are actually less effective for money laundering than their centralised alternatives. It’s not just Ethereum that has been affected by this hack. 1008 BTC were also stolen. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1309668583908061185?s=20 The hacker took the opportunity to send a message to the community using BTC. “Epic Hack Homie - Not your keys not your coins” The crypto community has been responding to the hacker address.

BingX - Rekt,44700000,09/19/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/bingx-rekt/,"BingX - Rekt Friday, September 20, 2024 BingX -  read this article also in : en - es - zh BingX just crapped out to the tune of $44.7 million. In a plot twist that's becoming all too familiar, another centralized exchange found their hot wallets compromised. On September 19th, BingX learned a costly lesson in the dangers of hot wallet management and the persistence of sophisticated hacking groups. As alerts of the exploit spread, observers watched in fascination as the hackers performed their dark magic, siphoning funds across multiple chains with the finesse of a digital David Copperfield. Meanwhile, BingX's PR team scrambled to downplay the incident, insisting it was just a ""minor"" setback - because nothing says ""everything's fine"" like hemorrhaging eight figures worth of customer funds. In the wake of this Singaporean crypto tsunami, how many more exchanges need to be drained before ""not your keys, not your crypto"" stops sounding like a broken record and starts becoming common sense? Credit: Tayvano , Peckshield , BingX , Vivien Lin , Cyvers , SlowMist , Crypto Slate , ZachXBT As with many crypto calamities, it was the ever-vigilant Crypto Twitter that first sounded the alarm. Tayvano began listing the addresses exploiting BingX, setting off a chain reaction of blockchain sleuthing. Tayvano's keen observation highlighted the multi-chain nature of the attack, foreshadowing the extent of the damage to come. Not to be outdone, blockchain security firm PeckShield chimed in shortly after, alerting BingX to a suspicious $13.6 million outflow from their wallets. It wasn't until roughly an hour later - a lifetime in crypto years - that BingX acknowledged the situation with a vague ""Temporary Wallet Maintenance Notice."" Shortly after, BingX's Chief Product Officer, Vivien Lin, took to social media with a more detailed, if not entirely reassuring, statement. According to Lin, the BingX team detected ""abnormal network access"" at around 4 AM Singapore time, suspecting a hacker attack on their hot wallet. They claimed to have ""immediately started our emergency plan, including the urgent transfer of assets and withdraw suspension."" Lin attempted to downplay the severity of the incident, describing it as a ""minor asset loss"" and assuring users that the majority of funds were safely tucked away in cold wallets. The exchange promised to restore withdrawals within 24 hours and hinted at a forthcoming compensation plan . Meanwhile, as BingX was busy crafting its PR narrative, Cyvers painted a far more alarming picture . The total damage? An eye-watering $44.7 million across multiple chains according to SlowMist , including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and others. Multiple addresses were involved in the exploit, suggesting a coordinated effort or a particularly sophisticated attacker. The digital fingerprints of the heist were scattered across the blockchain, with no less than ten confirmed exploiter addresses and three additional suspected addresses involved in the attack. Exploiter Address 1: 0xf7e8033366166f92eb477b7b38e0d47d47b43326 Exploiter Address 2: 0xb0146aec3593410c8307b570af69adf4d74678b3 Exploiter Address 3: 0x940362b46faf7df48af1c8989d809f50466b5fca Exploiter Address 4: 0x1Dd7dAf089C16856155FeFd7e2170966bb6b3AEE Exploiter Address 5: 0x719981cf7D1a1dC681a1cf0C6B1eeeE090D0FEd6 Exploiter Address 6: 0xf26e64ef4300ca027d2ffedd7d765d7a3906091c Exploiter Address 7: 0xb77a4a9678315775c4ba89f18f84f87538e748f5 Exploiter Address 8: 0x63dc352ddfc17aa04edac47ce36e186c1e54b02c Exploiter Address 9: 0x49284f0ab5098d7effb3392124903c081d1b9f7e Exploiter Address 10: 0xcfc14fa81226074036622976d95897ff84b58d66 The following 3 addresses were suspected to be involved as well and had interactions with the original exploiter addresses. Suspected Address 1: 0xc1B5a00871B89175bDC8F3b0de9Be3b29ffD3729 Suspected Address 2: 0x4D9D586567c9feA923c362c35385935Ee7781bf6 Suspected Address 3: 0xf36dd342A1D1C63aAddF9a95226349e527917fF3 The exact root cause of the exploit remained elusive, leaving room for speculation. Was this the result of a sophisticated phishing attack? An inside job? Or perhaps a vulnerability in BingX's security infrastructure that had been lying in wait, ready to be exploited? The attack spoke to a level of complexity that would make even the most hardened cybercriminals tip their hats in grudging respect. Piecing together the puzzle, a familiar specter loomed over the investigation. Hakan Unal, Senior Security Operations Lead at Cyvers, raised eyebrows with a provocative observation . “This hacker’s behavior—using multiple wallets to swap altcoins into ETH and BNB before consolidating—is consistent with the tactics we’ve seen in past Lazarus operations.” Could this be another notch in the belt of the infamous cyber-criminals, or just a convenient boogeyman for the industry? While the connection remains speculative, it adds another layer of intrigue to an already complex situation. Amidst the flurry of analysis and speculation, blockchain detective ZachXBT dropped a truth bomb that put BingX's victim narrative into sharp perspective. ""The second part of your statement is ironic considering BingX is known to be unhelpful to all of the victims who have stolen funds go there from pig butchering scams, indian call scams, and irl thefts. Hopefully your security incident will help you reassess your processes as you are among the worst in that regard."" ZachXBT's scathing commentary highlighted a bitter irony: the exchange that had often turned a blind eye to the plight of scam victims now found itself on the receiving end of a massive heist. As BingX scrambles to contain the damage, both financially and reputationally, the community watches with a mix of cynicism and curiosity. Is BingX's misfortune a mere blip on the radar, or the harbinger of a larger storm brewing in the world of centralized exchanges? With sophisticated techniques at play and whispers of state-sponsored involvement, one has to wonder: are we witnessing the opening salvo of a new, more treacherous season of crypto heists? BingX's $44.7 million mishap isn't an isolated incident. Just over a week ago, Indodax, another Asian exchange, found itself $25 million lighter courtesy of a similar attack. These back-to-back breaches paint a worrying picture of escalating threats and potentially outmatched defenses. As exchanges scramble to fortify their digital ramparts, users are left questioning the very foundations of centralized crypto trading. The promise of ""institutional-grade security"" starts to sound hollow when millions vanish in the blink of an eye. Yet, as the cycle of hack, patch, and repeat continues, one can't help but feel a sense of déjà vu. Are we stuck in a never-ending game of whack-a-mole with increasingly sophisticated moles, or is this the push needed for a radical rethinking of exchange security? Are these exchanges bringing knives to a gunfight, or are the attackers simply that many steps ahead?

Hedgey Finance - Rekt,44700000,04/19/2024,Consensys Diligence,https://rekt.news/hedgey-finance-rekt/,"Hedgey Finance - Rekt Friday, April 19, 2024 Hedgey Finance -  read this article also in : en - zh Not a good strategy to hedge your bets. Hedgey Finance rocked by $44.7 million flash loan attack across both the Arbitrum and Ethereum platforms. The exploit was first reported by Cyvers and confirmed by the Hedgey team just a little over a couple of hours later. Hedgey informed the community that they were investigating an attack on the Hedgey Token Claim Contract. Urging users who have created active claims, to please cancel them using the "" End Token Claim "" button to mitigate further losses. Touted by Hedgey as “The #1 token vesting and lockup tools.” The platform provides token infrastructure for onchain teams. It appears the lockup tools were not secure enough, as the thieves drained just over $2.1m worth of assets from the Ethereum contract, consisting of USDC , NOBL , and MASA tokens. On the Arbitrum chain, the attacker was able to steal roughly $42.6m worth of BONUS tokens. NobleBlocks(NOBL) gave a detailed security report to their community. Bonus Block(BONUS) briefly posted “Our vestings are safe"" and MASA seemed more concerned with hosting Twitter Spaces than informing their community about the exploit. As the dust settles, the big question remains, how did Hedgey's vaunted security fail so catastrophically? Credit: Cyvers , Hedgey Finance , NobleBlocks , Blocksec On April 19, Hedgey Finance was exploited across a series of transactions, which resulted in a loss of $2.1 million on the Ethereum Mainnet and $42.6 million worth of assets on the Arbitrum network, totaling approximately $44.7 million. The root cause of the exploit is the lack of input validation on users' parameters, which allowed the attacker to manipulate and gain unauthorized token approvals. The attacker took a flash loan of $1.3 million USDC from Balancer to abuse and manipulate the claimLockup parameter within the createLockedCampaign function of the exploited contract to trick this vulnerable contract into approving USDC token transfer to the attack contract. In the second step, the attacker used the approval to transfer USDC to themselves. Executing in two separate transactions, likely to prevent being front-run by bots. After checking the commit records of the vulnerable contract, the root cause was confirmed to be Unverified User Input; there was less verification of the parameters passed by users, resulting in tokens being approved to the attacker's contract. Exploiter’s address on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0xded2b1a426e1b7d415a40bcad44e98f47181dda2 Attack Contract on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0xc793113f1548b97e37c409f39244ee44241bf2b3 Exploited Contract on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc452fdc8f851d7c5b72e1fe74dfb63bb793d511 Exploiter’s address on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/txs?a=0xc7241e27ee4b8d32b59a10e848b48530047a8c5b Attack Contract on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/txs?a=0xbb52f1723ddf2c84ba2668f4e04712f572cbf780 Exploited Contract on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbc452fdc8f851d7c5b72e1fe74dfb63bb793d511 Funds are currently being held here . Hedgey sent an onchain message to the attacker looking to get in touch and discuss next steps. They’re assuming it is a white hat and even told them “well done” for finding the exploit. Thanks for robbing us, you’re one of the good guys, right? Consensys Diligence audited Hedgey’s Token Lockup and Vesting Plans in June and July of 2023. Whether it was a white hat or a black hat, doesn’t matter, someone still made away with $44.7 million. Isn’t calling theft ""well done"" an insult to every user whose funds were compromised? While Hedgey praises the attacker's skills and holds out hope they are a white hat actor, the nearly $45 million reality check exposes alarming gaps in their security practices. Hedgey Finance faces an uphill battle to rebuild trust, beginning with a comprehensive security overhaul. It may be a good idea to execute a complete security revamp, fortifying input validation, reinforcing access controls, and enduring stringent audits to prevent history from repeating itself. With millions of dollars lost and trust shaken, the path to recovery will be a long and challenging one. By scrutinizing its security practices and learning from these costly mistakes, Hedgey can begin the arduous journey towards rebuilding its reputation and restoring faith within the decentralized finance community. The decentralized finance landscape is a breeding ground for innovation but also presents a constant reminder that the stakes are high, and the consequences of negligence can be dire. For Hedgey, this exploit serves as a cautionary tale and a reminder that security must always be the top priority. The question remains: can Hedgey redeem itself and regain the trust of its users or will this event forever taint its standing in the world of DeFi?

Stake - REKT,41600000,09/04/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/stake-rekt/,"Stake -  Monday, September 4, 2023 Stake - Casino -  read this article also in : en They say the house always wins. Not in crypto. On-chain casino Stake lost over $41M from its hot wallets yesterday. Suspicious transactions were initially flagged by Cyvers, with losses on mainnet of around $16M. Then came another round of transactions, with a further $25.6M lost on BSC and Polygon. The platform took four and a half hours (or just three, according to Stake themselves) to publish an acknowledgment , despite managing to put out a tone-deaf promo tweet in the meantime. However, the announcement fails to mention the transactions on Polygon, or address reports that user withdrawals are currently suspended. After another four hours, the team tweeted again , informing users that deposits and withdrawals had resumed. Surely $41M must be a drop in the ocean for Stake, with co-founder Bijan Tehrani earlier stating that there would be no impact on customer funds. So why the delay, and the omissions, in official comms? Credit: tayvano , PeckShield Given that the transactions, which began at 12:48 UTC, were simple transfers, it appears that the private keys of Stake's hot wallets had been compromised. The funds were drained as native tokens ( 6k ETH , 3M MATIC and 12k BNB , totalling $14M), a total of $22.3M in stablecoins, plus $650k of SHIB and $3.25M of Binance-pegged ETH . Stake’s hot wallet addresses (on Ethereum , Polygon and BSC ) are showing no transfers since approximately 3 hours after the draining, suggesting that users are indeed currently unable to withdraw. Funds were drained into the following hacker addresses: ETH: 0x3130662aece32f05753d00a7b95c0444150bcd3c MATIC: 0xfe3f568d58919b14aff72bd3f14e6f55bec6c4e0 BSC: 0x4464e91002c63a623a8a218bd5dd1f041b61ec04 Any non-native assets were then swapped to native tokens and distributed to other addresses, see the full list here , and mainnet fund-flow diagram here . Backed by Drake, and relentlessly shilled by Bitboy, Stake has grown by appealing to a largely normie audience. And for washing scammers’ loot, of course… just like a real casino. Rollbit may have been making more noise recently thanks to its pumping token, but Stake is clearly doing just fine , making enough to buy a $28M mansion last year. Aussie crypto founders certainly know how to cash out. But with Stake’s main fanboy Bitboy out of the picture so recently, the timing certainly seems coincidental. Then again, anyone trading shitcoins via Metamask is probably not the type to pull off a multimillion dollar hack... Stake may be a casino but, ultimately, this story is the same as a large number of CEX hacks we've covered over the last few years. DeFi might have a reputation for incidents of this size, and looking at the leaderboard it'd be hard to argue that it was undeserved. But centralised platforms should be held to a higher standard. DeFi protocols are open books, where permissions, privileges, and source code are published so users can DYOR. Where are CeFi's disclosures of who has access to private keys within their systems? Some may argue that this would pose a risk of individuals being targeted for phishing campaigns (or worse). So should they overhaul their entire infrastructure? Tens of millions held in hot wallets behind a single set of private keys... How many more ‘coincidences’ can we take?

Alpha Finance - REKT,37500000,02/13/2021,"Quantstamp, Peckshield",https://rekt.news/alpha-finance-rekt/,"Alpha Finance -  Saturday, February 13, 2021 Alpha Finance - Cronje - rekt read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh The dark arts of DeFi remain the most profitable. What follows is one of our most dramatic stories yet. A tale of fake magic, confusion and accusation leading to the biggest DeFi hack to date. ~$37.5 million was stolen in a complex piece of DeFi deception, as a multi transaction attack was used to raid the vaults of Alpha Finance, whilst leaving many believing that it was the Iron Bank that had been affected. This murder took place in a hall of mirrors . The increasingly intertwined nature of DeFi protocols, combined with the complexity of the attack, left the community confused as to who the real victim was, and who was responsible for making reparations. The attackers' contract made the Homora code “believe” that their malicious contract was one of their own in order to manipulate internal debt numbers in their system. This was a private battle between protocol and attacker. The exploited contract was not yet announced, nor was it available to users, meaning they were not directly affected. We have not yet seen such a blatant inside job, and Alpha Finance were quick to point out that they had a “prime suspect” . Why was the contract left on mainnet if it was not yet ready? We asked Alpha Finance, who told us; ""We launched several pools e.g. sUSD on the contract level and not the UI because we were preparing to launch new pools including sUSD that coming week"" Large players quickly moved to preserve their capital amidst the confusion. SBF withdrew $400 million of FTT from Cream Finance, and Three Arrows Capital sent over $3 million of $ALPHA to Binance, where the only purpose could be to sell. All tokens related to the attack decreased in value. The Alpha Homora governance token ALPHA fell from $2.25 to $1.78. The Iron Bank governance token CREAM fell from $288.32 to $193.51. AAVE , the governance from the home of the controversial flash loan which has enabled so many attacks of this nature, fell from $518 to a low of $492 later in the day. However, token pricing is not the most interesting aspect of this story... The Alpha Finance team built an excellent post-mortem , and what they found was startling. The implications of our joint investigation suggest a depth of corruption much worse than expected. Whether Alpha Finance goes public with their accusations remains to be seen, but their initial statement of having a prime suspect suggests that repercussions are coming. From the official post-mortem, we can see that the attacker needed to know the following in order to carry out the attack: HomoraBankv2 has an sUSD pool on a contract level in preparation for the upcoming release, which is neither available on the UI nor publicly announced. There was no liquidity in sUSD lending pool , so the attacker can fully manipulate and inflate the total debt amount and total debt share. There is a rounding miscalculation in the borrow function calculation , which only affects when the attacker is the sole borrower. resolveReserve function can increase totalDebt without increasing totalDebtShare and the function, intended for collecting revenue to the reserve pool, can indeed be called by anyone. HomoraBankv2 accepts any custom spell, as long as the invariant checks out that collateral > borrow (a spell is similar to a strategy in Yearn). With so many users watching on, the robbers left a clear trail of clues, and in a rare move of counter-aggression, the victims have singled out their attacker. The above requirements prove that insider information was required in order to carry out this attack. However, due to the range of protocols and audit firms involved, the insider could have come from several different angles. rekt is no longer in the business of making accusations, but we look forward to seeing how Alpha Finance handle the situation. How it happened according to Alpha Finance: 1. The attacker created an evil spell (equivalent to Yearn’s strategy). https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23 2. Attacker swaps ETH -> UNI, and supplies ETH + UNI to the Uniswap pool (obtaining ETH/UNI LP token). In the same tx, swaps ETH -> sUSD on Uniswap and deposits sUSD to Cream’s Iron Bank (getting cysUSD) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4441eefe434fbef9d9b3acb169e35eb7b3958763b74c5617b39034decd4dd3ad 3. Call execute to HomoraBankV2 using the evil spell (creating position 883), performing:
Borrow 1000e18 sUSD
Deposit UNI-WETH LP to WERC20, and use as collateral (to bypass the collateral > borrow check)
In the process, the attacker has 1000e18 sUSD debt shares (because the attacker is the first borrower) https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcc57ac77dc3953de7832162ea4cd925970e064ead3f6861ee40076aca8e7e571 4. Call execute to HomoraBankV2 using the evil spell again (to position 883), performing:
Repay 1000000098548938710983 sUSD (actual debt with interest accrued is 1000000098548938710984 sUSD), resulting in a repay share of 1 less than the total share.
As a result, the attacker now has 1 minisUSD debt and 1 debt share. https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf31ee9d9e83db3592601b854fe4f8b872cecd0ea2a3247c475eea8062a20dd41 5. Call resolveReserve on sUSD bank, accruing 19709787742196 debt, while totalShare remains 1.
Current state: totalDebt = 19709787742197, while totalShare = 1 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x98f623af655f1e27e1c04ffe0bc8c9bbdb35d39999913bedfe712d4058c67c0e 6. Call execute to HomoraBankV2 using the evil spell again, performing (repeat 16 times, each time doubling the borrowed amount):
Borrow 19709787742196 minisUSD and transfer to the attacker (doubling each time, since totalDebt doubles each time the borrow is successful). Each borrow is 1 less than the totalDebt value, causing the corresponding borrow share = 0, so the protocol treats this as no debt borrowing.
At the end of tx, the attacker deposits 19.54 sUSD to Cream’s Iron Bank. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2e387620bb31c067efc878346742637d650843210596e770d4e2d601de5409e3 7. Continue the process: call execute to HomoraBankV2 using the evil spell again, performing (repeat 10 times, each time doubling the borrowed amount). At the end of tx, the attacker deposits 1321 sUSD to Cream’s Iron Bank. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x64de824a7aa339ff41b1487194ca634a9ce35a32c65f4e78eb3893cc183532a4 8. Flashloan from Aave (borrowing 1,800,000 USDC)
Swap 1,800,000 USDC to 1,770,757.56254472419047906 sUSD, and deposit to Cream to have enough liquidity for the attacker to borrow using the custom spell
Continued doubling the sUSD borrow from 1,322.70 sUSD to 677,223.15 sUSD (total of 10 times).
Swap 1,353,123.59 sUSD to 1,374,960.72 USDC on Curve
Borrow 426,659.27 USDC from Cream (since the attacker deposited sUSD already in step b.) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7eb2436eedd39c8865fcc1e51ae4a245e89765f4c64a13200c623f676b3912f9 9. Repeat step 8, but with ~10M USDC (no USDC borrowing at the end) https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd7a91172c3fd09acb75a9447189e1178ae70517698f249b84062681f43f0e26e 10. Repeat with 10M USDC (no USDC borrowing at the end) https://etherscan.io/tx/0xacec6ddb7db4baa66c0fb6289c25a833d93d2d9eb4fbe9a8d8495e5bfa24ba57 **11.**Borrow 13,244.63 WETH + 3.6M USDC + 5.6M USDT + 4.26M DAI
Supply the stablecoins to Aave (to get aTokens, so USDC & USDT can’t be frozen)
Supply aDAI, aUSDT, aUSDC to Curve a3Crv pool https://etherscan.io/tx/0x745ddedf268f60ea4a038991d46b33b7a1d4e5a9ff2767cdba2d3af69f43eb1b 12. Add a3Crv LP token to Curve’s liquidity gauge https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc60bc6ab561af2a19ebc9e57b44b21774e489bb07f75cb367d69841b372fe896 13. The rest of txs are supplying to Tornado Cash, GitCoin Grants. 1k ETH is sent to each of Cream’s and Alpha’s deployer addresses. This story is unique in it’s casting. We have always expected some ambiguity and role reversal when it comes to white hat / black hat activity, but rarely do we see such clear accusations from the victim. Andre Cronje, who partnered Yearn with Alpha Homora just weeks earlier, today wrote of the attack : Take the time to study the exploit. 9 transactions. 4 different manipulations. One including an exact debt calculation. This took teams of researchers hours to figure out. Alpha took immediate steps to mitigate the exploit. It was addressed within minutes of original discovery. And Banteg’s reply: The setup is absolutely insane. No way this could be found by someone casually looking at the contracts, especially the unannounced stuff. Perhaps this will lead to another Yearn acquisition; Cronje’s name is mentioned 4 times in the post-mortem, and the pattern does seem familiar... How much longer can this era last for the anonymous hackers? As the list of possible suspects is so small, it becomes easier to rule out and track down potential attackers, in this case the list is even smaller than usual. “Don’t trust, verify” is an excellent mantra when working with code, yet it does not prevent the increasing social paranoia that must be growing in the upper circles of decentralised finance.
We’re living through a period of unprecedented growth for cryptocurrency and DeFi, where the cost of not working is incredibly high. The mental load for DeFi developers grows heavier day by day. Empires are being built upon lines of code, and the future of finance is being constructed before our eyes. Developers are locked in a race to the sky while corrupt insiders help hackers to work underground, picking holes in their foundations. When one tower falls, the others look on and learn. Before the dust has even settled, the crowds have moved on, and relentless teams return to the race in a quest to build back stronger. How long can they maintain this intensity before the inevitable mistake causes their cloak of anonymity to fall?

LastPass Users - REKT,37000000,12/14/2022,N/A,https://rekt.news/lastpass-users-rekt/,"LastPass Users -  Tuesday, October 31, 2023 LastPass -  read this article also in : en Your keys, their coins. Since December of last year, a slow-burn wallet draining campaign has affected hundreds of individual addresses. No phishing necessary, this time. Although the attack has been ongoing for nealy a year, last week saw $4.4M stolen in a single day, bringing total losses to at least $37M. Similarly to June’s Atomic Wallet hack , which saw over $100M stolen, these incidents have been meticulously traced by ZachXBT and Tayvano over the last months. The thefts appear to be linked to seed phrases stored in LastPass, which was hacked last year. Who do you trust with your seed phrase, anon? Credit: ZachtXBT , Tayvano The loss of funds is believed to be down to security breaches at LastPass last year. An initial, direct hack in August led to a breach of a third-party cloud storage provider, in November. While the original August statement reassured users: we have seen no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data or encrypted password vaults The December update revealed that: The threat actor was also able to copy a backup of customer vault data And contained an onminous warning: The threat actor may attempt to use brute force to guess your master password and decrypt the copies of vault data they took. However, victims apparently had very secure LastPass master passwords which, according to Tayvano , either means that: someone has compromised hundreds of users' vaults one-by-one via a still undetected method or… LastPass has still not shared some critical details about their security posture and the stuff that was compromised by the attackers. Although the known thefts date back as far as mid-December 2022, with the tracing operation well underway by April, the LastPass connnection was only made public in August. The attackers appear not to be interested in small fry, with the smallest loss being “ well over $10k ”. Victims , one of whom even lost funds which had been untouched for almost a decade , apparently include many experienced crypto users: employees of reputable crypto orgs, VCs, people who build defi protocols, deploy contracts, run full nodes, and have ENS names Aside from targeting LastPass users, the attacks appear to share certain characteristics , which include: Primary theft txns are almost always between 10am–4pm UTC. Except when stealing v large amounts, the attacker will swap your tokens for ETH inside your wallet before sending the ETH out. The attacker will often miss staked positions, NFTs, or lesser known tokens. Successful rescue missions are COMMON. Funds are eventually sent to a CEX such as “ FixedFloat, SimpleSwap, SideShift, ChangeNOW, LetsExchange ”. The hackers also seem to favour the weekends. Over $37M stolen and still working a day job? While initial comms from LastPass in August 2022 made it seem that there was no reason to worry, any user who then let their guard down may later have become a victim. Though there may be good reason to be guarded with info sharing, the safest option for users is always to rotate assets to a fresh seed phrase if in any doubt. Improved UX is not worth trusting sensitive info to 3rd parties. When did you last change your seed?

Vee Finance - REKT,34000000,09/21/2021,Slowmist,https://rekt.news/veefinance-rekt/,"Vee Finance -  Tuesday, September 21, 2021 Vee Finance -  read this article also in : en - fr - ko - ru - zh Top ten thievery. $34 million taken from Vee Finance earns them the number 7 spot on our leaderboard. As AVAX rises in popularity, its crime rates increase accordingly. This is the second substantial loss on the Avalanche network this month. On the 12th of September Zabu Finance lost ~$3.2M; a small sum compared to today’s loss , yet still a huge haul for those who are not used to the drama of DeFi. What’s normal for us is not normal elsewhere. 34 million dollars stolen, but this story is just one of many. The following is taken from the (first) official post-mortem. Exploiter ETH Address: 0xeeee458c3a5eaafcfd68681d405fb55ef80595ba Exploiter AVAX Address: 0xeeeE458C3a5eaAfcFd68681D405FB55Ef80595BA The exploiter’s Ethereum address was funded via TornadoCash in three lots of 10 ETH: ONE , TWO , THREE . The funds were then bridged to Avalanche, where the attacker swapped 26.999006274904347875 WETH.e for 1,369.708 AVAX via Pangolin. The attacker then deployed exploit contract 1 and used it to firstly swap AVAX for the targeted tokens, then create the following trading pairs: QI/WETH.e XAVA//WETH.e LINK.e/WETH.e QI/LINK.e XAVA/LINK.e XAVA/WBTC.e LINK.e/WBTC.e Once the attack contract had been funded with 20 AVAX in 5 addresses, the preparation was complete and the exploit execution could begin. After initially failing due to low gas, the attacker was able to use a dynamic contract to conduct leveraged trading on the QI/WETH.e pair, before failing again. After deploying a new attack contract , the same steps were used, this time successfully. Repeated trades of USDT.e to ETH.e were made via AugustusSwapper. And a third attack was deployed. During leveraged trading, Vee Finance uses a single source price oracle: the prices of assets in the Pangolin pools. Via trading between these newly created pairs, the attacker was able to manipulate the prices that Vee Finance referenced. This manipulation, together with the fact that price acquisition wasn’t processed for decimals, allowed for the approval of transactions that would usually not pass the protocol’s slippage check. For an in-depth analysis of the exploit, see Vee Finance’s second post-mortem of the day. The stolen funds were bridged back to Ethereum during and after the attack, over a series of over 100 transactions, for example this transaction. The exploiter’s Ethereum wallet currently holds a total of 214 WBTC ($9.3 M) and 8,804 WETH ($26.9M) According to Vee Finance’s incident report “The VEE team is actively working to further clarify the incident and will continue to try to contact the attacker to recover the assets” and are appealing to the hacker to take a bug bounty. The team sent a transaction to the exploiter’s addresses on both Ethereum and Avalanche , with the following message, also sharing on Twitter : Hello, this is vee.finance team. We are willing to launch a bug bounty program for the bug you identified, please contact us via contact@vee.finance . Other incoming transactions contained messages, too, ranging from warnings: Your address has been caught by the team To self-promo : Hello this is @yannickcrypto, please follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/yannickcrypto _ To outright begging on-chain: Big man, send me some for a poor man who can't afford to eat At press time, there was still no response from Big man. Vee Finance ignored the recommendations given in their Slowmist audit , and their Certik audit wasn’t much help either. Any project which appears in “pump groups” such as this one is not doing well at all. Will we see a vee-shaped recovery, or has all the value veritably vanished?

Crypto.com - REKT,33700000,01/18/2022,Deloitte,https://rekt.news/cryptocom-rekt/,"Crypto.com -  Wednesday, January 19, 2022 CEX -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ja - ko - ru - tr - zh It’s worse than we thought. After our initial investigation, ErgoBTC uncovered even more lost funds from Crypto.com. Another 444 BTC: ~$18.7M. That brings the total value lost up to $33.7M, and moves Crypto.com up to position 15 on the leaderboard. And still no acknowledgement of any loss from Crypto.com. “All funds safe” ??? They’re lying to you. ErgoBTC investigates… We noted this abnormally large withdrawal from @cryptocom's payout wallet bc1q7cyrfmck2ffu2ud3rn5l5a8yv6f0chkp0zpemf via 06f7b6adac715ea7f30e2f23f52b3dfeed53... Shortly after, several hundred withdrawals are consolidated into 4 outputs for 67.75 BTC. The 271 BTC then make a series 24 or 25 BTC deposits to a well known BTC tumbler. 173 BTC at address bc1qk8wlwypvvr6v5lmsngg5a248k2a9cgrsrw5jsq is likely associated with the hack, has not yet been sent to the tumbler. This tumbler has been commonly used in hacks attributed to the DPRK Lazarus Group and more recently in the attempted laundering of BTC from to this summer's Darkside ransomware activity. These findings double the damage from our initial investigation, and increase the pressure on Crypto.com to come clean about what happened. At least the CEO is happy… Crypto.com should stop shitposting and tell their users where their money has gone. Our original article continues below. Another CEX rekt, but they have yet to admit it. The first message from crypto.com about the attack was at Jan-17-2022 04:44 AM UTC, stating that: ”We have a small number of users reporting suspicious activity on their accounts.
We will be pausing withdrawals shortly, as our team is investigating. All funds are safe. ” ~8 hours later, at 12:17,  Crypto.com doubled down on their statements, with a tweet that said: ”Earlier today a small number of users experienced unauthorized activity in their accounts. All funds are safe. ” Later that day, at 18:44 +UTC, hundreds of users crypto.com wallets were drained. Funds were not safe. How did the attacker bypass users 2FA, and their email withdrawal approvals? If, as CEO @Kris_HK also claimed “all funds are safe” Why are so many users claiming to have lost their ETH? Peckshield suggests that the total loss is about $15M, with at least 4.6K ETH taken directly from hundreds of different users wallets. Certik wrote that: The total loss is around 4,836 ETH and 282 users' wallets have been affected by the hack. The stolen ETH was sent to Tornado Cash and the address has been inactive since Jan-18-2022 01:21:13 AM +UTC. The hacker bypassed existing 2FA, they bypassed the withdrawal whitelist, could this attack really have come from outside? Even a ""SOC2"" audit from Deloitte couldn't stop this attack, which gives Crypto.com position 29 on the leaderboard . When one of the most recognisable crypto brands falls victim to an exploit, it damages the reputation of the entire industry. Centralised exchanges rely on retail investors, who will be easily put off by events such as this. Will crypto.com ever admit that funds were not safe? Surely a $15M recompensation plan is better than trying to pretend that nothing happened. Or maybe they will quietly refund the affected users, rather than announce anything official. We await the official post-mortem from crypto.com.

ZKasino - Rekt,33000000,04/20/2024,Certik,https://rekt.news/zkasino-rekt/,"ZKasino - Rekt Monday, April 22, 2024 ZKasino -  - Rugpull read this article also in : en - zh The house always wins and ZKasino hit the jackpot, making off with a $33 million rug over the weekend. Despite red flags like abruptly canceled token listings, shady team responses, pumped tech claims, and unpaid employees/contractors, ZKasino still managed to raise a massive war chest. In a brazen rug move, the platform converted over 10,500 ETH worth $33 million into $ZKAS tokens at an inflated price without user consent. As evidence of the scheme mounted, ZKasino went dark, shutting down communication channels and banning users who dared to call out the rug pull. The signs were there, were people too degen to read them? Credit: ZigZagExchange , ZachXBT , cygaar , defizard , ardxt The mechanics behind ZKasino's brazen theft were straightforward, yet the red flags leading up to it were plentiful. The crypto betting platform claims to have raised $26 million in a Series A funding round for a lofty $350 million valuation from major investors, including MEXC , Big Brain Holdings , Trading Axe , Pentoshi and Sisyphus . Big Brain Holdings claimed it received a token distribution offer from ZKasino that it will not opt to receive and look to be distancing themselves from the fraudulent project. Suspicions were there from the start with CEO and founder Ildar Elham aka Derivatives Ape, who had a shadowy past involving the failed ZigZagExchange and Syncus projects. According to tweets from the official ZigZagExchange account, Elham was one of the founders who conducted the $15 million fundraise for ZigZag. However, it's alleged that as one of the 3/5 multisig signers, Elham and the other ZKasino founders misused those funds to secretly build out ZKasino instead. Built on a foundation of lies it appears. Some have pointed out that the project has nothing to do with the various buzzwords that it uses to market itself, such as ‘zk’ (zero-knowledge) technology and ‘EigenDA’ (for data availability). The underlying ‘ZKasino chain’ is instead an ‘an Arbitrum Nitro chain that took two minutes to deploy.’ False advertising was merely a symptom of ZKasino's dubious operations. As early as December, ZachXBT had been sounding alarms about the project's founder and team, calling them out as bad actors who avoided paying what they owed in several instances: Failing to pay money owed to Pancakesbrah . Not announcing winners for their $200K giveaway after 2 months. Avoiding paying CL207 for a bet. Using a gore video from a recent murder to market their casino. Not reimbursing people after their team member was phished. The allegations painted a picture of a team with little regard for integrity or accountability long before the rug pull. The Series A investors had terms of 15% TGE, 3 month cliff, and 15 month linear vesting, the same vesting schedule that was ultimately imposed on user funds without disclosure. ZKasino had also initially planned IDOs on ApeTerninal and AIT Protocol that were abruptly canceled without explanation, another red flag. In their Telegram investor chat, team member XBT_Prometheus repeatedly downplayed concerns , stating ""We're still building"", ""People always FUD, it's normal"", and ""We didn't scam anything"" as questions mounted. ZKasino CEO promised users a clean payout if they locked their ETH to farm the $ZKAS token, vowing to let them withdraw initially deposited ETH at a 1:1 ratio later on. But in a brazen rug move, the platform instead converted over 10,500 ETH worth $33 million into $ZKAS at an inflated price without consent. To compound the scheme, that staggering ETH pile was then staked on Lido to lock up the funds with a 15 month vesting schedule that was never mentioned. The site’s bridge webpage (now offline) previously stated that once the chain was live, funds would be ‘returned and can be bridged back.’ Deleted tweets and audio clips confirm the same. In the end, ZKasino's trail of red flags, deception, and unethical practices was glaringly obvious to anyone who cared to look. This rug eventually unraveled into one of the biggest and most obvious crypto exit scams of the year. For Satoshi’s Sake, if ZachXBT is calling something a scam months in advance, run and do not walk to the exits! Who likes to gamble at a casino where only the house wins? The shady history of the founder should have raised concerns about his ability to lead a legitimate project like ZKasino successfully. However, investors and users seemingly overlooked or ignored these warning signs about the founder's past. Furthermore, there were allegations of unpaid employees and contractors, as well as claims of mismanagement from sources like ZachXBT. These reports hinted at potential issues within the ZKasino team and operations, which should have prompted further scrutiny and due diligence from those considering investing or participating in the platform. ZKasino made inflated claims about using advanced technologies like zkSync, when in reality, the platform was simply running on the more basic Arbitrum network. This brazen discrepancy between their marketing and reality should have erased any last shreds of credibility. The Captain Obvious of red flags was the abrupt cancellation of ZKasino's token listings without clear explanations provided. Such last-minute changes, especially without transparency, should have been seen as potential signs of trouble brewing behind the scenes. But sometimes when people step into the casino, they may already know in the back of their mind that they could lose it all. ZKasino sure was a losing bet, wasn’t it?

Meerkat Finance - BSC - REKT,32000000,03/04/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/meerkat-finance-bsc-rekt/,"Meerkat Finance - BSC -  Thursday, March 4, 2021 BSC - Meerkat -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh In retrospect, it was inevitable. An impressive debut for the first major exploit on BSC, as Meerkat Finance head straight to number three on our leaderboard. After just one day of operation, Meerkat Finance was rug pulled for 13 million BUSD and about 73,000 BNB, currently totalling around $31m. We’ve been watching Binance Smart Chain as they do their speed run through Ethereum’s DeFi summer. Now their copied codes have built up enough capital, and they have entered the rug pull phase. The aftermath presents an interesting situation. Will CZ and team roll back their corporate chain, or allow their users to suffer the loss? This suricate scam leaves the thieves with nowhere to hide. Where can they run to on such a small chain? Binance has closed the bridges , and even bscscan.com went down for a short while. Was this too much traffic, or some type of smokescreen? Meerkat Finance first claimed it was a hack but then deleted their accounts, leaving BSC users with only themselves, or maybe Binance to blame. With thanks to 0xdeadf4ce. Meerkat Finance Deployer upgraded 2 vaults of the project. Attacker address called permissionless initialization function through the Vault proxies, effectively allowing anyone to become the Vault owner [2] Attacker subsequently drains Vaults by calling a function with signature 0x70fcb0a7 which accepts a token address as an input. Decompilation of the upgraded-to Smart Contract shows the only use of the invoked function to be removal of funds with the owner as beneficiary. Usually, if the contract has a function which allows the owner to retrieve the assets which are used in the strategy/vault actively, then you are placing your trust in the project team. They can pull the plug any time. That’s why projects like yearn add checks like in the image below, so that the team can only rescue the funds which are not in active use by the strategy/vault. Both affected Vaults used OpenZeppelin’s Transparent Proxy Upgrade pattern, allowing to upgrade the Vault logic to a new logic implementation by calling the function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) on the Vault proxy level. The BUSD Vault’s previous implementation is located at 0x49509a31898452529a69a64156ab66167e755dfb , the WBNB Vault’s previous implementation is located at 0x3586a7d9904e9f350bb7828dff05bf46a18bb271 , both being rather inconspicuous and verified contracts. Meerkat Finance Deployer calls upgradeTo() two times: at block 5381239, setting WBNB Vault implementation to 0x9d3a4c3acee56dce2392fb75dd274a249aee7d57 at block 5381246, setting BUSD Vault implementation to 0xb2603fc47331e3500eaf053bd7a971b57e613d36 This changed the Vault logic to introduce two noteworthy functions that have not been part of the initial implementations. init(address owner) According to decompiled bytecode this function sets the address on storage slot 0 to the address provided to the function. There’s no permission check, making this newly added function the ultimate backdoor into the Vaults. Using a specific Initializer pattern in transparent proxies is best-practice and was also applied in the first Vault implementations, so it is highly questionable what was the intend to add the init() method other than a planned theft of Vault funds. 0x70fcb0a7(address _param1) Source code is not available, decompiled source is limited to checking that the caller is equal to storage slot 0 set in init() method and transferring out the balanceOf() on the token contract supplied with param1, using the Vault address as the query target.
Both functions are not part of the previous Vault implementations. Comparing the bytecode size of old and new implementations it can be stated that the new implementation is only 1/4th the size of the previous logic. Since the upgrades were done by the Meerkat Finance Deployer the most likely scenario given all aspects of the on-chain data is an intentional “rug pull” while granted there is a small chance of private key compromisation. As of the time of writing funds have partially been split among various addresses and sent to what seemingly belongs to the Binance Bridge hosted by Binance exchange. The Binance.org Bridge is currently suspended, probably to avoid the funds from being easily moved to other chains. Timeline (04.03.2021) Mar-04-2021 08:53:10 AM +UTC Meerkat Finance Deployer upgrades WBNB Vault to contract 0x9d3a4c3acee56dce2392fb75dd274a249aee7d57 Mar-04-2021 08:53:31 AM +UTC Meerkat Finance Deployer upgrades BUSD Vault to contract 0xb2603fc47331e3500eaf053bd7a971b57e613d36 Mar-04-2021 08:54:31 AM +UTC Attacker calls method 0x70fcb0a7 on BUSD Vault to transfer out 13,968,039 BUSD Mar-04-2021 08:54:55 AM +UTC Attacker calls method 0x70fcb0a7 on WBNB Vault to transfer out 73,635 WBNB The same games are played on different chains, but the balance of power is different. With CZ watching and the bridges burning, the robbers have nowhere to hide. Even in the Meerkat_Rugpull Telegram group, chat members were not in total agreement of how they wanted Binance to handle the situation. Could Binance roll back the chain and refund their users? The answer is not so clear - the 21 mystery validators could in theory arrange a refund, but it is unlikely. It would only fuel the CeDeFi issues and create more work for the (likely already stressed) BSC lawyers. Binance will have planned in advance how they would handle such a scenario. How they handle this case will set a precedent. Although this is not the first multimillion rugpull on BSC, it is the first since the rise of PancakeSwap and the increased user numbers that came along with it. Ignoring the unlikely event of someone from Binance stepping up to arrange a merkle distributor and returning the funds, the money is gone. So we find that protocols on BSC are no more secure than Ethereum. CZ won’t save you. Their transactions are cheaper, but there’s no original development. What will become of this corporate chain once Eth L2 arrives?

MonoX - REKT,31400000,11/30/2021,"Halborn, Peckshield",https://rekt.news/monox-rekt/,"MonoX -  Tuesday, November 30, 2021 MonoX -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh rekt by their own token. Over $31 million stolen, across two chains, via a price manipulation of the project’s native token, MONO . MonoX , which launched last month on Polygon and Ethereum, is a DEX based on Single Token Liquidity pools. Rather than the standard pool model of paired assets deposited by LPs, MonoX pools function by grouping a deposited token “ into a virtual pair with our virtual cash stablecoin (vCASH) ”. One of the benefits that MonoX claimed their virtual pool model brought was streamlined swap routing. How convenient for today’s hacker who, manipulating a pricing bug, was able to inflate the price of the platform's native token and make a streamlined cash-out into the other deposited tokens. Two attacks hit the protocol in swift succession. First, ~$19.4M was stolen on Polygon and just 17 minutes later, the same attack vector was used on Ethereum, taking a further ~$12M. The team provided a statement via the MonoX Announcements channel on Telegram, and later via Twitter . ...A method in the swap contract was exploited and boosted MONO token price to sky high. The attacker then used $MONO to purchase all the other assets in the pool... ...We also really wish to have a chance in talking with the ""attacker"". We value very much for what we've built for the current and future MonoX, and most importantly our users and their funds; PLEASE reach out to us! Credit: @BlockSecTeam The protocol’s recently -launched MONO token was used in the exploit. The hacker was able to massively inflate its value owing to a bug in the swapTokenForExactToken code in the Monoswap contract ( Polygon , Ethereum ). The function _ updateTokenInfo was used to update token prices following swaps through MonoX pools. However, there was nothing to restrict the use of the same asset for both tokenIn and tokenOut . By doing just this with the platform’s native token, the hacker created a loop in which the price of tokenOut would overwrite the price of tokenIn , pumping the price of MONO over the course of many “swaps”. Once the price had been manipulated, the attacker cashed out the overvalued MONO for almost all the other tokens deposited in the platform’s Single Token Liquidity pools. Both Halborn and Peckshield conducted audits of the Monoswap contract. How did they both miss this simple bug? Was it deliberate, or just careless? Total assets stolen: 5.7M MATIC ($10.5M) 3.9k WETH ($18.2M) 36.1 WBTC ($2M) 1.2k LINK ($31k) 3.1k GHST ($9.1k) 5.1M DUCK ($257k) 4.1k MIM ($4.1k) 274 IMX ($2k) Exploit transactions: Polygon , Ethereum . Exploit contracts: Polygon , Ethereum Stolen funds: ($31.4M total) Polygon ($19.4M), Ethereum ($12M). Over $30M lost on a protocol barely one month old. In fact, the project had passed $30M TVL just 3 days prior to the exploit. While the rate at which projects are now able to attract value is impressive, the insecurity that comes with investing in DeFi is a stark reminder of the immaturity of the space. With time, casualties like these build a base of knowledge on which best practises can be established. But for now, experiments will continue to be launched. And some of them will fail.

Spartan Protocol - REKT,30500000,05/02/2021,N/A,https://rekt.news/spartan-rekt/,"Spartan Protocol -  Sunday, May 2, 2021 Spartan Protocol -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh Sparta has fallen. A flaw in the code allowed an attacker to drain the SPARTA/WBNB liquidity pool, earning themselves $30.5 million and the 6th position on the rekt leaderboard as a result. The attacker took advantage of a flawed logic used to calculate liquidity shares when users burned their LP tokens in order to withdraw funds. A flash loan was used to inflate the balance of the pool before burning the same amount of pool tokens, allowing them to claim a much larger amount of underlying assets. The following details are taken from the Peckshield root cause analysis. A flash loan was taken for 10K WBNB, to be returned at the last step with 260 WBNB as the flash loan fee; Swap WBNB to SPARTA five times through the exploited Spartan pool, with each time swapping in 1,913.172376149853767216 WBNB to get 621,865.037751148871481851 SPARTA, 555,430.671213257613862228 SPARTA, 499,085.759047974016386321 SPARTA, 450,888.746328171070956525 SPARTA, and 409,342.991760515634291439 SPARTA respectively. The resulting total 2,536,613.206101067206978364 SPARTA, plus 11,853.332738790033677468 WBNB, are then added into the pool, minting 933,350.959891510782264802 pool token (SPT1-WBNB); Swap WBNB to SPARTA ten times through the same pool , with each time swapping in 1,674.025829131122046314 WBNB to get 336,553.226646584413691711 SPARTA, 316,580.407937459884368081 SPARTA, 298,333.47575083824346321 SPARTA, 281,619.23694472865873995 SPARTA, 266,270.782888292437349121 SPARTA, 252,143.313661963544185874 SPARTA, 239,110.715943602161587616 SPARTA, 227,062.743086833745362627 SPARTA, 215,902.679301559370989883 SPARTA, and 205,545.395265586231012643 SPARTA respectively, resulting in a total of 2,639,121.977427448690750716 SPARTA. Inflate the asset balance in the pool by transferring into the pool 21,632.147355962694186481 WBNB and all SPARTA from the above step 3, i.e., 2,639,121.977427448690750716 SPARTA. Burn the 933,350.959891510782264802 pool tokens obtained from step 2 to withdraw the liquidity. Since the pool’s asset balance is inflated, the burn operation leads to 2,538,199.153113548855179986 SPARTA and 20,694.059368262615067224 WBNB. Note that step 2 only deposits 11,853.332738790033677468 WBNB, leading to the profit of about 9K WBNB. Add the liquidity into the pool with the added assets in step 4 with 1,414,010.159908048805295494 pool token, which is immediately burned to obtain 2,643,882.074112804607308497 SPARTA and 21,555.69728926154636986 WBNB. Repeat the above steps to continue draining funds from the pool. Return the flash loan with 100,260 WBNB. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the liquidity share calculation calcLiquidityShare() is querying the current balance which can then be inflated for manipulation. A correct calculation needs to make use of cached balance in baseAmountPooled/tokenAmountPooled. Most of the attacker’s funds from the above exploitations are currently held in this wallet: 0x3b6e . 30.7k WBNB ($18.9M) 4.6M SPARTA ($7.8M at the time of hack) 1.3M BUSD-T ($1.3) 23.2 BTCB ($1.3M) 924k BUSD ($0.9M) The attacker used 1inch (to swap all tokens to BTCB or BETH), Spartan (to dump SPARTA), Nerve (to swap BTCB and BETH to Anyswap versions). In this way they were eventually able to withdraw part of the profit through Anyswap. Due to slippage, the profit decreased by a third: 219.5 BTC ($12.4M) 3311 ETH ($9.7M) Credit igor igamberdiev A relatively straightforward story of another copied protocol who were too ambitious with their imitation. The era of BSC flash loans is upon us, and this won’t be the last time we see such attacks. $30 million reward for only $66 in fees is an excellent ROI, and with so many developers rushing to copy the ETH blue chips onto BSC, there’s sure to be more opportunities for keen eyed hackers. With no word yet from CZ or Binance, one wonders, how much of this will they tolerate? How rekt do you have to get for CZ to step in and save you?

Grim Finance is rekt. The latest entry onto our leaderboard (#18), was a fork of “Beefy Finance” , offering auto-compounding LP vaults on Fantom. After the attack, the project’s initial announcement referred to it as “ advanced ”, however reentrancy vulnerabilities are nothing new. The price of $GRIM fell 80% after the attack. Charge DeFi lost 1849 $CHARGE to the same attack vector just hours before… Was this a serial attacker? Credit: RugDoc The attack exploited a depositFor() function that hadn’t been protected against reentrancy. This allowed the hacker to loop additional false deposits within the initial call, vastly increasing their share of the vault. As shown below, the user is able to choose the deposit token, which is where the attacker inserted their own contract containing the reentrancy deposit loops.

Further details can be found in the rekt.news Telegram group. Charge DeFi claims they reached out to projects who were using the same code in order to warn of the vulnerability. However, perhaps those messages didn’t have the desired effect. One Discord user tried to claim responsibility for the attack.

The official announcement stated that the loss will be covered by company reserves and that they keep “ 99% of our user funds in cold storage to limit the impact of these type of events ”. Withdrawals were temporarily suspended, with a later update informing users that on-chain deposit addresses for BTC, ETH and USDC will have to be regenerated, and previous deposit addresses will no longer be valid. As with all cases of “compromised keys”, only insiders can say for certain what caused the breach, but if it was due to a phishing attack, then of course we have our usual suspects … Deribit lost roughly equal amounts across the two chains. The Ethereum hot wallet lost 6968 ETH and 3.4M USDC and the Bitcoin hot wallet lost 691 BTC.

Perhaps this is a good time to test out SBF’s recently proposed 5:5 bounty standard ($1.4M in this case). Let’s see if the attacker prefers $1.4M or $28M… Just under a year ago, a string of high-profile CEX hacks saw enormous amounts of money lost from compromised hot wallets: Bitmart ($196M), Ascendex ($78M), Crypto.com ($34M). Then, a switch in focus towards bridge hacks saw our leaderboard fill up with names such as Ronin , BNB , Wormhole , Nomad and Harmony , some of which were confirmed to be carried out by North Korea’s state sponsored hackers, the Lazarus Group. If they also carried out this phishing attack, then Deribit will not be getting their funds back. When you consider how North Korea spends their money, then the consequences of these attacks seem much more serious. How much of the $5.2B listed on our leaderboard has gone to state-sponsored attackers? We may never know for certain. Deribit takes #32.

Wintermute - REKT,27600000,06/05/2022,N/A,https://rekt.news/wintermute-rekt/,"Wintermute -  Thursday, June 9, 2022 Wintermute - Optimism -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh The glass is half-empty for Wintermute who have lost 20M OP, worth ~$27.6M at the time of the incident. The funds were supposed to be sent to Wintermute by the Optimism Foundation in an agreement to act as a market maker ahead of the OP token launch. But Wintermute provided the address of their multisig on Ethereum as the destination address on Optimism - an address they did not control. According to the Optimism Foundation’s announcement , Wintermute then confirmed receipt of two test transactions, firstly for 1 OP and then for 1M OP , without checking that they had access to the funds. The remaining 19M OP were sent shortly after the second test transaction on the 27th May. According to Wintermute’s statement , they notified the Optimism Foundation about their error on 30th May. The OP launch went ahead regardless on the 1st of June, despite almost 10% of the soon-to-be circulating supply being up for grabs. An opportunistic anon seized control of the ownerless funds on 5th June. How did the exploiter gain access? Credit: yoav.eth , kelvinfichter , banteg Once the tokens had been sent, they were sitting out in the open, ready to be taken by anyone who spotted them… The hint was the fact that the address corresponded to a Gnosis Safe proxy on mainnet, but had no contract deployed to the Optimism address. Nobody could take control of the address as an EOA, that would require the private key. However, there was a way to access the funds; anyone could take control of the address by deploying a Gnosis Safe proxy to it. This is not an easy task , however. Wintermute state that: After consulting with the Optimism and Safe teams, Wintermute made the assessment that the funds were potentially retrievable, and that nobody other than Wintermute could recover those funds. The assessment was also that it was a high risk retrieval that could only be attempted once and required Safe to support. Retrieval was scheduled for 7th of June. However, the assumption that the funds can only be recoverable by Wintermute proved to be false. As Wintermute’s Gnosis Safe on mainnet had been created back in 2020, it was deployed using an old version of the ProxyFactory contract , which includes the out-of-date create opcode, rather than create2 . With create , the deployed proxy address depends only on the ProxyFactory’s address and nonce. This meant that the exploiter could replay deployments on Optimism (setting themself as owner) until the nonce matched the original mainnet deployment and a matching proxy address was created. This was eventually achieved after running batched deployments of 162 safes at a time, until the matching address was created in this transaction . Exploiter’s address , used to create the adapted ProxyFactory contract , which was funded by Tornado Cash on the 1st June. Wintermute’s multisig on Ethereum: 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 Hijacked address on Optimism: 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 So far, 1M OP has been sent to the exploiter’s EOA and sold for 720 ETH, and a further 1M OP was sent to Vitalik’s address. The exploiter’s timing is interesting, as pointed out by yoav.eth : Funded via Tornado 7 days ago Then deployed the contract, waited 4 days, and hijacked wintermute's proxy. Why wait 4 days? If they were looking to secure their loot, why give Wintermute the extra time to mount a rescue attempt? The remaining 18M OP have not yet been dumped, is this down to a lack of liquidity or does the exploiter intend to return the funds? Wintermute aren’t banking on it: There is hope that it is a whitehat exploit, in which case the remaining funds are potentially recoverable. However we are currently operating under the premise that it is not the case In the meantime, the Optimism Foundation has provided an additional 20M OP to Wintermute to perform their original market making duties. Wintermute’s balance sheet aside, there are more wide-reaching concerns raised by this incident. Having almost 10% of the OP circulating supply in the hands of a bad actor is potentially dangerous for Optimism’s governance processes, something the Foundation is well aware of . Should this change, the option of “ a network upgrade … to halt the movement of those OP tokens ” would set a worrying precedent. Although the mistake was flagged on OP’s launch day, the alert was seemingly ignored by the community. The tweet came hours after the exploiter had funded their address, however, so is unlikely to have been the information to tip-off the incident. While replacing the 20M OP won’t be a problem for a giant MM such as Wintermute, the carelessness of this incident is alarming. The funds were sat in an unowned address for 9 days. In an already struggling market, actions such as these make it hard to remain Optimistic. If you enjoy our work, please consider donating to our Gitcoin Grant .

Penpie - Rekt,27000000,09/03/2024,"Watch Pug, Zokyo",https://rekt.news/penpie-rekt/,"Penpie - Rekt Wednesday, September 4, 2024 Penpie -  read this article also in : en - es - zh The crypto world never sleeps and neither do its hackers. In the latest episode of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: DeFi Edition,"" Penpie has found itself on the wrong end of a $27 million exploit. On September 3rd, a yield farming protocol, built atop the Pendle Finance ecosystem, learned a costly lesson in the dangers of complex financial integrations. As news of the exploit spread, the PNP token went into a free fall, tanking a brutal 40%, while the PENDLE token didn't escape unscathed, taking a 9% hit in the chaos. Another gentle reminder that in the high-stakes game of yield farming, sometimes the only thing you harvest is regret. When the music stops in this high-risk DeFi dance, which investors will be left holding empty bags? Credit: Chaofan Shou , Cyvers , Pendle , Penpie , PeckShield , Ancilia The first signs of trouble came when Chaofan Shou raised the alarm on Twitter: ""Seems like Penpie got hacked. $17M loss."" It didn't take long for the blockchain sleuths to mobilize, within 20 minutes, Cyvers confirmed the worst as the damage had ballooned to a staggering $27 million. Pendle Finance, the platform underlying Penpie, was quick to reassure users that their own funds were secure. Nevertheless, they hit the pause button on all contracts to further mitigate the damage. Penpie followed suit , admitting to a ""security compromise"" and freezing all deposits and withdrawals. In a space where code is supposed to be law, it seems some crafty lawyers found a loophole. But in this digital courtroom, who's really calling the shots? According to the blockchain gumshoes at PeckShield, the root cause was ""the introduction of an evil market that was used to inflate the staking balance to claim unwarranted rewards."" Translation for the non-tech savvy: the attacker created a fake Pendle market, essentially tricking Penpie's contracts into thinking they were dealing with the real McCoy. Ancilia provided more information , highlighting that the exploit stemmed from a sneaky loophole in Penpie's batchHarvestMarketRewards() function. In a flash, the attacker launched a reentrancy attack, creating a fake Pendle market to dupe Penpie's contracts. When the _harvestBatchMarketRewards() function called redeemRewards(), the hacker's contract slipped in, executing a deceptive maneuver that would make seasoned con artists envious. The end result? A textbook double-dip, inflating the attacker's staking balance and siphoning off undeserved rewards. Exploit transaction: 0x56e09abb35ff12271fdb38ff8a23e4d4a7396844426a94c4d3af2e8b7a0a2813 Exploiter Addresses: 0x7a2f4d625fb21f5e51562ce8dc2e722e12a61d1b 0xc0Eb7e6E2b94aA43BDD0c60E645fe915d5c6eb84 Fake Pendle Market: 0x0ab305033592E16dB7D8e77d613F8d172a76ddc9 Attack contracts: Arbitrum: 0x4BC9815b859c8172CEe1ab2CD372fD0Eb00eb487 Ethereum: 0x4aF4C234B8CB6e060797e87AFB724cfb1d320Bb7 Despite audits by WatchPug and Zokyo , this glaring oversight slipped through the cracks. Penpie has posted a message to the hacker on Twitter, hoping to retrieve the stolen loot. Pendle posted a Post Mortem on behalf of Penpie on Twitter, where they mentioned the $105 million that wasn’t stolen, but failed to mention what was stolen and the specifics behind the exploit. Yet another reminder that even in the world of trustless systems, we're still putting an awful lot of faith in protocols to do their security due diligence. The exploiter, armed with nothing more than some clever code and a dash of audacity, managed to outsmart multiple layers of supposed security. In this game of digital cat and mouse, are we building fortresses or just more elaborate mazes? Penpie's misfortune serves as a stark reminder that in the wild west of DeFi, even the sharpest tools can get dulled. It's a tale as old as time (or at least as old as smart contracts), in the rush to innovate, security sometimes takes a back seat. As the DeFi space continues to evolve at breakneck speed, it's clear that even more rigorous security measures and audit processes are needed. But in a world where ""move fast and break things"" is the modus operandi, can we really expect protocols to pump the brakes? Is it too much to ask protocols that hold millions in users funds to audit every upgrade? In this case, it appears so. For now, Penpie joins the ever-growing list of protocols that have fallen victim to exploits in the digital Wild West. Is it time for DeFi protocols to prioritize security over speed, thoroughly auditing upgrades and fortifying defenses, or will they continue to gamble with user funds and leave themselves vulnerable to relentless blackhat gunslingers?

StableMagnet - REKT,27000000,06/23/2021,Techrate,https://rekt.news/stablemagnet-rekt/,"StableMagnet -  Thursday, June 24, 2021 StableMagnet - BSC -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh They told us it was going to happen, then it did. A few hours before the attack, we received a direct message from an anonymous source suggesting that StableMagnet would rugpull. We couldn’t verify the claims, and therefore our hands were tied. If we had made a public warning and the accusations had been false, we would have caused FUD and potentially damaged an innocent project. There was no scope to whitehack the funds, so all we could do was wait. Now there’s $27 million gone, and more due to be stolen from the wallets of those who have not yet revoked permissions to StableMagnet. Users can use the BSC Token Approval Checker to revoke these permissions. We were unable to stop this attack, and that knowledge is not easy to accept. However, the information we received correlates with some of our previously held suspicions. Techrate audits are not to be trusted. The rug pull started with this transaction: An initial $22.2 million in stablecoins were taken from the StableMagnet 3Pool via an unverified source code. This figure is now $27M and rising. As stated by Rugdoc: Etherscan and BSCScan explorers do not verify linked library source code. This allows the exploiter to deploy a completely different library than the one in the source code. The unverified SwapUtil library did not only contain code to drain all pairs, it also contained code to transfer more tokens to everyone who had approved StableMagnet. SwapUtils library containing the exploit: 0xE25d05777BB4bD0FD0Ca1297C434e612803eaA9a Other protocols which are still in operation, such as Dopple and StableGaj are based upon the same code, and their SwapUtils libraries are also unverfied. The stolen funds were split between multiple addresses and deposited to Binance in order to switch to the Ethereum blockchain, then quickly withdrawn and the centralised USDT exchanged for decentralised DAI. These attackers had planned their escape route. Is the Binance KYC process faulty, or do Binance care less about enforcing the law than they would have us believe? BUSD sent to Binance hot wallet: 0x2bac04457e5de654cf1600b803e714c2c3fb96d7 Tether received on ETH chain: 0xDF5B180c0734fC448BE30B7FF2c5bFc262bDEF26 Tether changed to DAI: 0xe5daac909a3205f99d370bc2b32b1810a4912a07 This pattern has been replicated across multiple addresses. Could this be the rug that keeps on rugging? At one point, there were over 1000 users with non-zero allowances on the rugpulled StableMagnet. With an initial entry at number 8, this case is set to keep on climbing the rekt leaderboard as we uncover more of the story and the wallets of unsuspecting users continue to be drained. This is not the first time that this group has rugpulled, but this time they’ve left us some clues. The other information that was given to us by our anonymous source is given more authenticity following the events at StableMagnet. They told us that the same group is responsible for multiple recent rugpulls, suggesting that Moon Here token , and Wen Moon token were also carried out by the same bad actors. They also told us that “ Techrate audited the Github , but not the deployed contract” We know that Techrate was alerted to this rugpull, and that they took no action.  A quick glance through the list of projects that they are involved with will give you a good idea of the kind of quality you can expect with a Techrate audited project. Why should we expect them to point out the problem, rather than let it slide and come back to it later when they are wearing their black hat? In a space and time where trust is already at a minimum, you would hope you could look to audit companies for some security. However, this is not the first incident in which the auditor becomes the number one suspect. We know of at least two major hacks in which the protocol is working to prove that they were attacked by their auditor. Investigations are ongoing. This has been one of the more sinister rug pulls that we have documented. A known group of attackers stealing not only from their scam protocol, but also directly from users wallets, then fleeing to the decentralised protection of DAI. Don’t trust an auditor to DYOR.

Total WETH swapped: 2079.603371141493 = $3,104,887.33 Total PAID left in account: 594,717,455.71 = $24,313,147 Total Rugged Amount: $ 27,418,034.33 Banteg tweeted: I don't know what PAID is, but it looks to me that one founder rugged another. Burn Mint @n2ckchong’s finding seems to correlate with this suggestion, as he pointed out that “Paid Network's deployer, an EOA, transferred ownership of a contract to the attacker 30 mins before the mint.” As with most of our cases, it will be almost impossible for the founders to prove that it wasn’t them, leaving the PAID team in a particularly uncomfortable situation. Perhaps their private keys were compromised… Kyle Chasse is the CEO of Paid Network, a Youtuber and self-proclaimed “master disruptor crypto OG”. However, even these lofty achievements are not enough to prevent people from suspecting foul play. Someone out there believes that this was not an exploit, but an inside job. We usually love it when people slide into the TXID’s, but this note was of a more personal nature than usual. It seems the suspicious sender is not alone in their belief, as we can see that the Twitter account WARONRUGS warned users of this mint capability over a month ago. Another message was sent to the minters address to congratulate the “Russian Hackers” for putin in the work. PSA - If a protocol advertises themselves as a “100x altcoin gem” - it’s probably best to stay clear. The mint happened just after 18:00 UTC, with the dumping during the next 30 minutes, which took the price of PAID from ~$2.86 to ~$0.32. PAID Network have tweeted that; We are investigating the issue. We pulled liquidity, are creating a new smart contract, & will be restoring everyone's original balances to before the hack. Those with staked, Lpool & UniFarm $PAID will have their tokens be sent to them manually. We will share more updates soon. DeFi runs 24/7, a hall of mirrors and back doors where the ruthless walk free. Working 9-5 is no way to make a living, but is stealing from others any more respectable? An infinite mint is a magical thing - a golden ticket to make profit illicit, but who’s to blame when the warnings are clear, loot isn’t shared but the responsibility is. Was this an exploit, a hack or an insider job? We await the official post-mortem from PAID. Thanks to all the greedy hackers and scammers for keeping us in work.

Market maker Kronos Research lost $26M over the weekend, leading to liquidity issues on closely- associated CEX, Woo X . The Taiwan-based trading firm admitted to having suffered an attack via “ unauthorized access of some of our API keys ”. A later update confirmed the amount lost, adding “ despite it being a sizable amount, Kronos remains in good standing. All losses will be covered internally, no partners will be affected ”. According to Woo X, Kronos was the exchange’s largest LP, so when their trading was halted following the hack, Woo X decided to pause markets in order to “ protect users positions from a lack of liquidity ”. Users were not happy. A market maker taking heavy losses and disrupting their partner exchange… …where have we heard that before? Credit: X-explore Kronos Research accounts on four exchanges (across ETH and BSC) began to be drained at approximately 5PM UTC on Saturday. As well as being transferred directly to the hacker’s address (from OKX and BTSE), funds flowed from CEX wallets, via Kronos’ address and then to the hacker (from Binance and Deeocoin). This was likely due to whitelist restrictions on the addresses to which CEX withdrawals could be made. Attacker address: 0x2b0502FDab4e221dcD492c058255D2073d50A3ae A full breakdown of the assets, exchanges and chains can be seen in the flowchart below: This is not the first time Kronos has had issues, as reported in August: Two engineers who were dissatisfied with the unpaid bonus tampered with the code of the crypto quantitative trading team Kronos Research before leaving, causing the company to lose $1.4m Nor is it the first time API leaks have led to losses from CEX accounts. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this story is the eerily familiar relationship between Kronos and Woo X. Have users learned nothing from last November? Previously boasting of an Alameda/FTX/FTT type setup while half-heartedly claiming to be credibly separate entities… With so much in common with the drama that marked the lowest point of the bear market, perhaps we’re coming full circle.

Indodax - Rekt,25220000,09/10/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/indodax-rekt/,"Indodax - Rekt Wednesday, September 11, 2024 Indodax -  read this article also in : en - es In the high-stakes game of crypto exchanges, Indodax just crapped out. Over $25 million vanished faster than you can say rupiah in the latest episode of ""Centralized Exchange Calamities: Southeast Asian Edition."" On September 10th, Indodax, Indonesia's largest crypto exchange, learned a costly lesson in the dangers of wallet management and the persistence of sophisticated hacking groups. As alerts of the exploit spread, observers watched in fascination as the hackers performed their dark magic, siphoning funds across multiple chains with the finesse of a digital David Copperfield. In the world of centralized exchanges, ""not your keys, not your crypto"" isn't just a catchy slogan, it's a warning that keeps ringing true. In the wake of this Indonesian crypto tsunami, will Indodax's reputation be as leaky as its security protocols? Credit: Cyvers , Lookonchain , SlowMist , William Sutanto , Arkham Intel , Bein Crypto The first signs of trouble came when Cyvers raised the alarm on Twitter: ""Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions involving your wallets on different networks."" It didn't take long for the blockchain sleuths to mobilize. Within hours, a clearer picture emerged of the devastation: 6.14M USDT 1,047 ETH ($2.48M) 25 BTC ($1.41M) 2.2M MATIC ($849K) 1.4M ARB ($749.6K) 2M ENA ($465K) ...and the list goes on totaling roughly $25.22 million. As the crypto sleuths pieced together the digital breadcrumbs, a familiar pattern began to emerge. Yosi Hammer, Head of AI at Cyvers, provided some intriguing insights: ""While it is premature to confirm the involvement of any specific group, the attack's speed and complexity, the pattern and the characteristics of the attack highly resembles those of North Korea's Lazarus Group."" Hammer, however, emphasized that it’s too early to confirm the attackers’ identity. SlowMist's analysis ruled out a simple hot wallet compromise, suggesting a more insidious breach of the withdrawal system itself. In a move that would make Ocean's Eleven blush, the hackers managed to initiate withdrawals that looked legitimate, complete with change addresses depositing back into Indodax. Compromised Indodax hot wallets: Eth/Polygon: 0x3C02290922a3618A4646E3BbCa65853eA45FE7C6 Tron: TWe5pEnPDetzxgJS4uN26VFg15wWtdcTXc BTC: 1JUToCyRL5UwgeucjnFAagKs4v1YqhjT1d As onlookers held their collective breath, Indodax finally broke their silence, announcing a ""complete maintenance"" to ensure system integrity. In a move that surely instilled confidence, Indodax co-founder William Sutanto assured users that their funds were ""100% safe both in crypto and rupiah."" Because nothing says ""everything's fine"" like completely shutting down your platform. The hackers, meanwhile, weren't content with their initial haul. Like kids in a crypto candy store, they proceeded to swap their ill-gotten gain and moved their stolen loot here: Ethereum ($12.37m): 0x59101E532bc728599a2d373fCdC7aFf58cB48Df8 Misc erc-20 tokens on Ethereum ($1.2m): 0xB0A2e43D3E0dc4C71346A71484aC6a2627bbCbeD Optimism ($900k): 0x3B8F1131a20e131c195bdA6FDd6e9bE38935eB6d Polygon ($6.8m): 0x90fffbc09e9a5f6d035e92d25d67e244ef5e904f Tron ($2.55m): TBooefeY6FvGuyKfvp5yE1HmzhzvXnvA1P BTC ($1.4m): bc1q5uqpn0ha5llrvhcvkq3nfalp8fj7qe3rydcvmf In this game of cat and mouse, it seems the attackers have once again proven they're the Garfield of the crypto world- fat, sassy, and always getting the lasagna. With Cyvers reporting over 150 transactions in this digital heist, untangling this crypto yarn promises to be more complex than decoding a teenager's TikTok feed. One thing's for sure: when the post-mortem drops, it'll be a page-turner that'd make even the most hardened crypto-detective's head spin. Grab your popcorn, folks, this blockchain whodunit is far from over. The stolen stash was a relatively small amount as the exchange’s wallets continue to hold over $400 million worth of various tokens, as Arkham data shows . Back in June 2023 , Indonesian cops nabbed a duo of digital doppelgangers who were masquerading as Indodax on social media. These crafty con artists were peddling fool's gold to unsuspecting marks, managing to pilfer a cool 625 million Indonesian Rupiah (about $40,500) before the law caught up with them. Indodax's misfortune serves as a stark reminder that in the wild east of crypto exchanges, even the biggest fish can get caught in a net. When exchanges are playing whack-a-mole with threats ranging from two-bit hustlers to sophisticated hackers wielding nation-state level techniques, is ""not your keys, not your crypto"" less of a mantra and more of a survival guide? It's a tale as old as Bitcoin, in the rush to provide liquidity, security sometimes takes a back seat. As the crypto space continues to grapple with the reality of highly sophisticated hacking groups, it's clear that even more rigorous security measures are needed. But in a world where exchanges are locked in an arms race with some of the most skilled hackers on the planet, can we really expect them to keep up? Is it too much to ask exchanges that hold millions in user funds to better secure their hot wallets, implement stricter withdrawal controls, and maybe hire a security guard named Brutus? In this case, it appears so. For now, Indodax joins the ever-growing list of exchanges that have fallen victim to high-profile digital heists. As hackers continue to target crypto exchanges with increasing sophistication, one has to wonder: Is your favorite exchange next on their hit list or have they already paid their ""security debt""?

Harvest Finance - REKT,25000000,10/26/2020,"Haechi, Peckshield",https://rekt.news/harvest-finance-rekt/,"Harvest Finance -  Monday, October 26, 2020 harvest finance - flash loan - hack read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh The reaper does not listen to the harvest. A skilled farmer used flash loans to reap $33.8 million from the FARM_USDT and FARM_USDC pools. In troubled times, some turn to sacred texts for guidance. Of the ten plagues that ruined the harvests of ancient Egypt, the first brought blood, and the second; frogs. It was Baron Rothschild who advised to buy when there’s blood in the streets. Now that the heady days of DeFi summer are over, the DFI-PERP has taken on a sanguine liquidity, and the behaviour of the more Enlightened Farmers has become decidedly unchristlike. In Exodus 7:25 8-15, we read “I will plague your whole country with frogs. The frogs will go up on you and your people and all your officials.” In our cryptographic metaverse, the developer is the official, and as was prophesied in the ancient scrolls, the Harvest Finance developers have certainly got frogs all up on them. Arbitrage Analysis fUSDT fell 13.7% and $FARM fell 67% over two hours as the hacker took out a $50m USDT flash loan, then used the Curve Finance Y pool to swap funds and stretch stable coin prices out of proportion. Detailed transaction analysis here. The following actions took place in a 7 minute time period. Credit @valentinmihov Swap 11.4m USDC to USDT -> USDT price up Deposit 60.6m USDT into Vault Exchange 11.4m USDT to USDC -> USDT price down Withdraw 61.1m USDT from Vault -> 0.5m profit Rinse and repeat 32 times. (without any prior testing) Convert to renBTC and exit to BTC / ETH via Tornado Cash The attacker was able to withdraw more USDT at step 4 because of the changed USDT price. As the price of USDT was lower during the time of the withdrawal, their shares represent more USDT from the Vault pool. Approximately 4 cycles can fit into a 10m gas limit, and although the profit on each cycle is less than 1%, ~$500k per repetition adds up quickly. The price calculation mechanism for LP deposits and withdrawals was the source of the exploit, meaning this attack could have carried over to the renBTC pool, the FARM_TUSD pool, and the FARM_DAI pool. However the hacker chose to stop after draining $25m or 17% of what was available in the FARM_USDT and FARM_USDC pools, although they could have easily continued to drain the entire pool for a total of $400m if they had so desired. The FARM_USDT strategy has the following code Which indicates some price index was calculated. However, since they specify ""tokenIndex"", we can assume they aren't just using get_virtual_price() but instead, do some underlying calculation.
Credit Andre Cronje The arbitrage check function tolerance value was not high enough, but the default slippage tolerance value of 3% was too high. Credit PancakeBunnyFin It wasn’t just the hacker who profited from their actions. LPs and Harvest developers also received a reasonably sized sum of money, as the hacker chose to throw back some scraps ($2,478,549.94) to the Harvest Deployer in the form of USDT and USDC. Harvest have since stated that this will be returned to the affected users pro-rata using a snapshot.

With exposure to all Curve pools, veCRV holders have profited from the extra volume going through Curve, as the hacker generated ~$500k in trading fees which will be shared among all those who are staking their CRV.
Curve trading fees increased over 8,000% from the previous day as the hacker swapped over $100M in USDT and USDC. Uniswap LPs also had a field day thanks to the actions of this anonymous superfarmer. Total Uniswap trade volume spiked from $148 million to $1 billion in 24 hours. 92% of this volume came from the USDT/ETH and USDC/ETH pairs, generating $5.76 million in fees for liquidity providers. Credit Larry Cermak Confidential Contributor Whistleblowing and protecting our contributors is a huge part of what we do at Rekt. While your author was writing this story, someone contacted us with information regarding the actions of Harvest Finance some days prior to last nights events. The following information is presented without comment. I was contacted by the Harvest Finance team seeking collaboration on incentivising liquidity pools for two asset classes. The first was trustless BTC, the second was FARM/ETH. I didn’t follow up with them as something was off-putting. I’m not claiming that it is the Harvest team, but seeing the 3% slippage in the smart contract, and the fact that the exploit was in trustless BTC, which is a “novelty”... I think that if this isn’t Julien, then it has to be Harvest Finance themselves, or the EMN hacker, or someone with deep flashloan knowledge. Refund Requests As usual, a debate has arisen regarding the ability for protocols to block or amend this type of activity in the future. In the Curve Telegram group, some were of the opinion that Curve should be able to block this type of activity, however the existing smart contracts cannot be stopped or modified. There have also been calls for renBTC to refund the fees they earned from the hackers activity. This is a controversial topic which forces users to consider the pros and cons of using decentralised protocols. Sloppy Security Only three weeks ago on October 6th, Harvest Finance published a security update stating that they were ensuring the safety of their lands via “rigorous security audits” from Peckshield , Haechi Labs , and CertiK . It should be noted that Peck Shield and CertiK also audited Bzx before their three hacks earlier this year. We await their comments on this situation. Developers and seemingly even specialised security firms are not used to having to consider the impact of flash loans on their code. Mastering flash loans is like turning up to a 12th century jousting tournament on a Harley Davidson dual-wielding AK47’s; nobody expects it, plebs get rekt, and it’s years until the uneducated masses are able to protect themselves from such savage master tradesmen. Harvest Finance has responded to the events with an enjoyably passive-aggressive tone. twitter.com/harvest_finance/status/1320624369543057409 Truthful Terminology Arbitrage / Exploit / Hack. The differences in the terminology become increasingly blurred, while the fact that “code is law” becomes crystal clear. The term used by Harvest Finance was arbitrage economic attack. Some consider this activity a crime, while others simply see the actions of a more capable user, yield farming with modern machinery. Is this a meritocracy, or anarcho-capitalism? It’s certainly entertaining either way. caveat emptor. It is only the farmer who faithfully plants seeds in the spring, who reaps a Harvest in the autumn. B.C.

Ankr & Helio - REKT,24000000,12/02/2022,N/A,https://rekt.news/ankr-helio-rekt/,"Ankr & Helio -  Friday, December 2, 2022 Ankr - Helio -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh 18 quadrillion dollars. That’s the theoretical value of the 60 trillion aBNBc that was illegitimately minted from Ankr earlier today. Unfortunately, that’s more than the GDP of the entire world, and the aBNBc liquidity couldn’t stretch that far, so the hacker only got away with $5M. Ankr’s official announcement pointed out that underlying staked assets are safe, and the thread goes on to promise users “a reissuance of aBNBc” via a snapshot. But the damage didn’t stop there… Credit: BlockSec , Peckshield aBNBc is a reward-bearing receipt token for BNB staked via the Ankr platform on BSC. The exploit was due to a private key compromise of the Ankr deployer address on BSC, potentially the result of a phishing campaign . The compromised deployer account published a malicious version of the aBNBc token contract, which was then upgraded to replace the existing implementation. The upgraded version included a new function (0x3b3a5522) which allowed the attacker to bypass caller verification and mint tokens freely, directly to their own address. Exploiters address: 0xf3a465c9fa6663ff50794c698f600faa4b05c777 (Compromised) Ankr deployer address: 0x2ffc59d32a524611bb891cab759112a51f9e33c0 Example attack tx (minting aBNBc to exploiter’s wallet): 0xe367d05e… Funding exploiter wallet from compromised deployer: 0xeb617798… Despite the large amount of tokens minted, a lack of on-chain liquidity limited the exploiter’s profits to just $5M after draining PancakeSwap’s aBNB pools. Most of the proceeds were bridged to Ethereum , where the exploiter is in the process of laundering them through Tornado Cash. As the word got out about the publicly callable infinite mint, copycats joined in, many of whom can be seen amongst the top holders of the now worthless aBNBc. Some did find a way to profit, however, with one account making 3x more than the initial exploiter, however the quick timing and recent funding of the address suggest that it could be the same actor. By buying large amounts of depegged aBNB from PancakeSwap, this address took the token to stablecoin project Helio Money . Before the oracle had updated to reflect the crashed price, the user borrowed 16M HAY against aBNBc collateral for a profit of $15.5M. Another user profited through the same method, earning approximately $3.5M. The attacks have caused HAY to depeg ($0.62 at the time of writing), but the project has assured its users that they will be compensated. Audits by both Peckshield and Beosin called out the danger that the privileged accounts posed to Ankr’s smart contracts, and were marked as “Confirmed” and “Acknowledged”, respectively. However, Ankr did not take steps to fix these issues. Now they have paid the price, and Helios has caught even more collateral damage. CZ tweeted the following summary: ”Possible hacks on Ankr and Hay. Initial analysis is developer private key was hacked, and the hacker updated the smart contract to a more malicious one. Binance paused withdrawals a few hrs ago. Also froze about $3m that hackers move to our CEX.” Is CZ trying to become crypto’s new main character?

This was no cheap ticket - XToken is a quality protocol with strong partnerships. Hacks like these remind us that even the “blue chips” aren’t entirely safe. What went wrong? Credit: 0xdeadfce & Frankresearcher Exploit Transaction xToken.Market, a decentralized passive investing protocol, was exploited with the use of flash loans. Over $24 million was taken from the yield-bearing liquidity pools for SNX (xSNXa) and BNT (xBNTa). At 15:14 UTC X-Token released the following warning . Minting on all contracts has been paused as we investigate reports. The community alerted us to X-Tokens tweet within minutes. A second tweet explained that: xSNXa and xBNTa contracts have been exploited. Minting paused on all contracts as we investigate further. Liquidity pools have been drained, however most SNX and BNT remain in xToken contracts. The attacker used a Flashloan from DyDx for 61,833 ETH (~$267M) and a Private Transaction using Flashbots MEV to facilitate the attack. Funds lost 2.4k ETH ($10.3M) 781k BNT ($6.2M) 407k SNX ($8M) 1.9B xBNTa All tokens except xBNTa have already been sold to ~5.6k ETH through 1inch. 1: Hacker borrowed 61.8k ETH flash loan on dYdX 2: Deposited 10k ETH to borrow 564k SNX on Aave and swap 5.5k ETH to 700k SNX on SushiSwap 3: Sold 1.2M SNX for 818 ETH on Uniswap v2, significantly reducing the SNX price. 4: Used only 0.12 ETH to mint 1.2B xSNXa, because the protocol buys SNX through Kyber, who in turn led to use Uniswap v2 for this swap. 5: However, within the protocol, xSNXa price turned out to be normal, which made it possible to swap 105M xSNX into 414 ETH. 6: After that, the attacker began to do reverse swaps in SushiSwap and Uniswap and repaid loans in Aave. 7: Then they also began to sell the existing xSNXa to the Balancer SNX/ETH/xSNXa (25/25/50) pool. 8: Repaid flash loan to dYdX. 9: Issued xBNTa four times for 0.03 ETH, which ultimately gave them 3.9B xBNTa. 10: Swap half of xBNTa to 781k BNT. Another $24 million gone, yet the only unusual thing is the names involved. We’re not used to seeing our blue chip babies involved in such violence. Perhaps that label gives a false sense of security, even the most time-tested protocols are still incredibly new when you look long term. A new entry onto our leaderboard for XToken as they take the number 9 spot, but it’s the fourth time for their security auditor Peckshield, making them the most rekt auditor on the rekt.news leaderboard. But then again, perhaps a $24 million bounty is worth another spot on the leaderboard… Did this attack come from within? We may never know, but we will always wonder.

BALD on Base - REKT,23000000,07/31/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/bald-rekt/,"BALD on Base -  Wednesday, August 2, 2023 BALD - Base - Rugpull -  read this article also in : en Coinbase’s compliant and grown-up L2 is already a shitshow. …and it’s still supposedly just a testnet. Over barely 24 hours, users aped into Base’s latest memecoin, BALD , before the rug was pulled for $23M. Every shitcoin needs a catchy name, and what better imagery for popping Base’s cherry than evoking Brian Armstrong’s powerful shining orb. A beacon of resistance in the battle against Gensler . The deployer has dubious origins, to say the least, but degens don’t take time to DYOR, opting instead to yeet their cash across the cryptoverse, before paying the inevitable ape tax . With no established bridging UI yet established, users deposited ETH directly into a contract address without a care in the world. While options (either slow or unofficial ) did exist to bridge back, many users simply piled into the pvp , leading to a pump of epic proportions. And with many options having rugged already, BALD was the only game in town. YOLO-mania is in full force while DeFi burns … Credit: PeckShield , thiccy With a well-funded deployer who kept adding liquidity ($12M in first 24 hrs), BALD skyrocketed. Many might have suspected the deployer to have been Armstrong himself, willing to front so much cash in order to draw attention to the new chain. After the initial mania, the price stagnated. The deployer then began buying BASE, prompting a pump of almost 100% to ~$0.10. The fresh capital deployment was accompanied by the obligatory: steady lads Then came the rug. Shortly after midday UTC on Monday, a total of ~$23M of liquidity was pulled ( example tx ), netting a profit of 3,163 ETH ($5.9M). The aftermath: After rugging the pool, the deployer defended themselves on Twitter: I didn't sell a single token at any point since deployment. Just added/removed 2 sided liquidity and bought But when called out , they didn’t seem interested in keeping up the pretence of innocence. BALD deployer address: 0xccfa0530b9d52f970d1a2daea670ce58e4176389 Example rug tx: 0xd4fce790… As the dust settled, users started looking for someone to blame. And it soon became clear that the deployer address had some very interesting connections… Sizeable transfers from Alameda, involvement in early Sushi and dydx governance, even pushing the cbETH lending market to the limit . All evidence pointed towards a close association with FTX/Alameda, with some of the more out there conspiracy theorists even suspecting SBF himself. While he may have previous, rugging FTX for a cool 10 billy, the master hypocrite has been under house arrest, now apparently with very restricted access to the outside world. A deeper dive from veteran researcher Igor Igamberdiev points to another Sam… Whoever it was, they continue to fiddle with the liquidity pool, making even more profits in the process. After Saturday’s latest zksync rug we wondered: Will BASE be next ? It looks like the answer is yes. Shortly after the rug, Base’s main DEX got rekt for $630k by a price manipulation attack, due to a public transferFeesSupportingTaxTokens() function. The last few days haven’t been a great look for the potential FedChain, especially while Coinbase is trying to prove itself an upstanding entity ahead of a length legal battle with the SEC. The current state of L2s perfectly encapsulates the hypocrisy of our sector: attempting to redefine financial engineering while constantly plagued by rampant degeneracy. Is this… RetardFi summer?

Elephant Money - REKT,22200000,04/12/2021,Solidity Finance,https://rekt.news/elephant-money-rekt/,"Elephant Money -  Wednesday, April 13, 2022 Elephant Money -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh An audit couldn’t protect Elephant Money from the on-chain poachers. Solidity Finance failed to notify Elephant about a price manipulation vulnerability, which was then exploited in a flash loan attack that this Elephant will want to forget. The official post-mortem stated a loss of $11.2M, yet Peckshield later pointed out that Elephant had chosen not to include the loss of ~30 billion ELEPHANT tokens, bringing the total amount lost to $22.2M. “DO NOT SELL” say Elephant Money . Is this… financial advice? Credit: BlockSecTeam The attacker used flash loans to manipulate the price of the ELEPHANT token during the minting process of the project’s stablecoin TRUNK. Example tx: 0xec317deb2f3efdc1dbf7ed5d3902cdf2c33ae512151646383a8cf8cbcd3d4577 Firstly, the attacker took flash loans of 131k WBNB and 91M BUSD, the 131,162.00 WBNB was swapped to 34.244e21 ELEPHANT. TRUNK can be minted by depositing BUSD. During this process, the vulnerable contract first swaps BUSD to WBNB and then uses the WBNB to buy ELEPHANT, raising the price of ELEPHANT. By minting, the attacker both receives TRUNK and increases the value of the ELEPHANT from the previous step. The attacker then swapped the ELEPHANT, originally acquired for 131k WBNB, to 164k WBNB. Additionally, the attacker redeemed the TRUNK for 37k WBNB and 67M BUSD, making for a total of ~200k WBNB and ~67M BUSD. After returning the flash loans (of 131k WBNB and 91M BUSD), this resulted in a profit of ~$4M The same process was repeated on a cycle, leading to total gains of over 27k WBNB ($11.2M) for the hacker. Since the incident, the funds have been sent on to various accounts and then either bridged to Ethereum or sent to Tornado Cash, as can be seen in the visualisation below . Position #28 on the leaderboard for Elephant Money , despite their attempt to downplay the loss. The price of $ELEPHANT is now down by 75%, and their “stable”coin TRUNK fell by 40%, before partially recovering to $0.78. It’s a standard story of flash loans and price manipulation. The most entertaining part is this headline / financial advice from the Elephant Money marketing department. So we buy the tops… then we sell the… ?

"Blizz Finance, Venus Protocol - REKT",21800000,05/13/2022,n/a,https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/,"Blizz Finance, Venus Protocol -  Friday, May 13, 2022 Blizz Finance - Venus Protocol read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh The Luna fall-out continues. Two lending platforms, Venus Protocol on BSC and Blizz Finance on Avalanche, have been drained of $13.5 and $8.3M, respectively. As the LUNA price continued to plummet, the Chainlink price feed used by the protocols became inaccurate, allowing funds to be borrowed against vastly overpriced LUNA collateral. Neither project had existing failsafe mechanisms in place, and even though it appears the alarm was raised in advance, preventative measures weren’t established in time to prevent losses. With shaky markets, and the first projects falling victim to the failure of LUNA and UST, how far will the damage spread? The total collapse of the Terra ecosystem is no longer in doubt. For a short while the whole chain was halted , and several exchanges (Binance, Bybit, eToro, dydx) suspended trading on LUNA and UST. Block production on Terra has now resumed , and the chain is active, but it's far from healthy. On-chain swaps are disabled, and IBC channels are closed. The failed UST recovery plan crashed the price of LUNA to fractions of a cent, down from an ATH of almost $120, just over a month ago. However, the Chainlink oracle, used as a price feed by both protocols to value collateral, contained a minimum price ( minAnswer ) for LUNA hardcoded at $0.10. As the price dropped below this, anyone was able to buy up large quantities of LUNA at market price and use it as collateral (valued at $0.10) to borrow funds from the platforms. Venus, with a TVL of ~$1B, was (luckily) able to suspend activity before being totally cleaned out. There is currently an active proposal to resume functionality, but with LUNA and UST positions suspended. According to the official statement: Venus Protocol also has a Risk Fund that will be utilised to remedy the shortfall that resulted from this event. Blizz Finance, however, was unable to react in time, due to their timelock, leaving the protocol wiped out. A glance at the project’s site shows all assets lent out, supposedly on worthless collateral. $8.3M of TVL gone in a flash. With both protocols claiming that the blame lies with Chainlink for the “pausing” of their price feeds, Chainlink put out a statement explaining the functionality of the automatic circuit breaker and describing best practices followed by other protocols. No protocol is too big to fail. LUNA dropping below $0.10 may have been unthinkable when the Chainlink feed was set up, but as it became clear that LUNA was not going to recover, Chainlink should have updated their oracle’s parameters to reflect reality. This incident shows that even using a reputable oracle such as Chainlink is not a silver bullet. The responsibility lies with each project to understand every element of their protocol and integrate everything in a safe and secure way, no matter what the market does. Protocols should have measures in place for these unforeseen events, such as their own automated circuit-breakers to pause contracts under such conditions, as suggested in Chainlink’s docs . Unfortunately, these two casualties are unlikely to be the last incidents linked to the implosion of Terra. After maintaining radio silence since announcing the plan to nuke LUNA, Do Kwon has just published his thoughts on how the chain should be resurrected. The consequences continue, and we still don't know what happened to the $3B of BTC that belonged to the Luna Foundation… SUBSCRIBE NOW email address *   serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on . donate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C disclaimer :  is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by .

Transit Swap - REKT,21200000,10/02/2022,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/transit-swap-rekt/,"Transit Swap -  Sunday, October 2, 2022 Transit Swap -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh Working on the weekend like usual… Sunday morning notifications of a cross-chain protocol losing millions. Just like the good old days. Transit Swap has lost $21M to a vulnerability which allowed an unknown attacker to drain the wallets of users who had approved the protocol's swap contracts. But unfortunately for the hacker, over $1M was lost in transit … not all MEV bots are down 0xbad this week. The team paused the affected contracts before announcing the incident on Twitter. Then came an update that via “ the joint efforts of the @SlowMist_Team , the @Bitrace_Team , the @peckshield security team, ” key info about the hacker, including their “ IP, email address, and associated on-chain addresses ” had been uncovered. As the attacker’s anonymity began to slip away, it seems they had second thoughts. So far, over 70% of the funds have been returned. Finding a vulnerability in an unverified contract; diligent decompiler, or someone acting on insider info? Though the vulnerability was in the project’s code, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users’ wallets to the unknown exploiter’s address. The first attack tx occurred just after 18:30 UTC, with the attack lasting approximately half an hour before swapping stolen tokens to ETH and BNB. Exploiter’s address on ETH and BSC : 0x75f2aba6a44580d7be2c4e42885d4a1917bffd46 Vulnerable contract (revoke approvals on both ETH and BSC): 0xed1afc8c4604958c2f38a3408fa63b32e737c428 Credit: Supremacy Inc. , SlowMist The project’s smart contracts are unverified. However, they can be decompiled from the published bytecode: After understanding the hacker's attack path, we tried to find out the cause of the vulnerability, but the smart contracts of the project are closed-source contracts. So we decompiled it and finally found the root cause of this attack: a controllable transferFrom external call Because it is decompiled code, it is a little obscure for readers to understand. We can understand that varg0 is the token address, varg1, varg2 and varg3 are the from, to and amount parameters of the transferFrom function. 0x23b872dd in the figure is transferFrom() function signature of the function. Therefore, the claimTokens function calls the transferFrom function of an address, and the address and function parameters are controllable. For a more detailed explanation, see SlowMist’s analysis . Peckshield also provided a visual summary of the attacker’s activities. The returned funds have been consolidated into the same address (0xD989f7B4320c6e69ceA3d914444c19AB67D3a35E) on ETH and BSC , which holds a total of ~$16.5M across the two chains. Stolen funds: 3180 ETH ($4.2M), returned . 1500 Binance-pegged ETH ($2M), returned . 50k BNB ($14M), $10.4M returned . At the time of writing, the exploiter’s BSC address still holds over $3.5M in stolen BNB and previously sent 2500 BNB ($715k) to Tornado Cash. The fast response and cooperation between multiple security teams meant this incident had a happier ending than most. But a protocol using live, unverified contracts is never a good look in DeFi, where open-source is the name of the game. Hiding contract code makes DYOR all but impossible, and impedes the work of whitehats to spot vulnerabilities before they’re exploited. Closed-source code also breeds suspicion in the blockchain world, where exploits, rug-pulls and “compromised keys” are often forgotten within weeks. Could this be a case of an insider using privileged info against their users, before returning most of the funds and hoping it will all blow over? Business as usual.

Cyvers sounded the alarm during the March 8th attack. Unizen acknowledged the hack 7 hours later. The attacks happened over a period of a few hours, leaving some users in the dark, believing the DEX was down due to the upgrade, not finding out until after the fact. RevokeCash urged users to check whether their address was affected and revoke approvals via their dedicated tool . Upgradeable contracts are a common red flag for attacks. Highlighted recently by attacks on Socket , last year’s Safemoon and Level Finance to name a few. Did another protocol rush to upgrade a contract without due diligence, setting themselves up for an exploit? Credit: Cyvers , SunWeb3Sec , Martin Granstrom , Blocksec , Chain Aegis , Blockfence Multiple attackers took advantage of an unverified external call vulnerability shortly after a DEX Aggregation contract upgrade upgrade on Unizen. The upgrade was meant to reduce the cost of ETH gas fees, except something else was reduced. Users that had interacted with and approved a higher spending limit for certain tokens, were taken advantage of by a malicious actor that stole user funds. Resulting in a robbery worth more than $2.1M.

The flow of funds can be found here . Stolen funds were sent to this address . Not helping matters, the X feed filled with phishing spam posts tagging Unizen, burying the news of the hack. Unizen caught the spam situation shortly after. Unizen addressed the community 7 hours after the attack, offering to address concerns and start the healing process for their community. The protocol’s CTO went into further detail , highlighting the gas optimization upgrade was a minor bug with great consequences. 2 days after the hack, Unizen sent several onchain messages addressing a “Security Professional”, offering a 20% bounty to return the funds. On-chain Messages: 0x13f8220624f61cfb002489821eeba9df392150285147c1aaf816f283ae7cc43e 0x351906b2406282042c7396ea960b7a52d305658097e3f25bae79be4cdbb7c311 0x015b7fd22c027abb9c237a4ecb3862b7c3f2acb857fe93175e4a6c8265d38857 0x0dc8ce3e98d006cd1ba446544b289d960477347e8826efa788d6b879a59cd09d 0xcbdba5e11d3becfe80f8fd710d04fd068ad722289869459a7ce4f1e7123e5946 0xdcfed8e883eec7f913c452b2ed0da29f3504722479400053482cddd7797f883f 0xd5d684f3f61de25bd04b8434bb9af23658377350dee16ed2575d377426cebd89 A few hours later, Unizen announced they will reimburse losses below $750,000 with USDC or USDT. CEO and Founder, Sean Noga loaned the protocol with his personal funds. They even posted a video in the same announcement on how to revoke spend limit approvals on the Unizen platform. Where was this the day of the attack? Later in the day, the CTO announced that they have enough evidence to proceed with the post-mortem. Adding that an upgrade was patched to the gas optimization contract. Claiming they will invest a lot more in ensuring the security with every upgrade introduced, no matter the risk assessments and internal reviews. But one of the crooks may not be finished. Caught by Blockfence on March 11th, one of the attackers may have moved on to their next onchain sleight of hand. They deposited 128 ETH of stolen loot in an LP on Uniswap , with the Yoink token. They even left a message stating all profits from highly profitable trading strategies will be reinvested into Yoink. Did you mean to say hacking strategies? Halborn and Verichain audited Unizen's DEX Aggregator in 2022, no documentation can be found for an audit on the recent upgrade. Do you think this attack could have been prevented with an audit to their recent upgrade? Another external call vulnerability and another attack on an upgradeable contract, when will this madness end? A costly mistake that could have been prevented with thorough testing and auditing. Blackhats have to be foaming at the mouth with a checklist of upcoming contract upgrades just waiting to pounce and run away with the loot. The team's response may have been slow to keep their community updated, but it was refreshing how they handled the situation a few days later. Users have already started to pour in to Unizen's Telegram and on X, thanking them for  starting the reimbursement process, it appears they are following through so far.

Sonne Finance - Rekt,20000000,05/15/2024,yAudit,https://rekt.news/sonne-finance-rekt/,"Sonne Finance - Rekt Thursday, May 16, 2024 Sonne Finance -  read this article also in : en - es - zh The alarm has been rung on Sonne Finance, as a $20 million flash loan attack reverberates across the crypto sphere, chiming a somber melody that warns of the perils lurking in the DeFi shadows. Nerv Alert sounded the alarm on late Tuesday, initially detecting a $3 million loss. Sonne made an announcement on Discord soon after the attack. But did not announce it on X until a couple of hours after. Soon after the loss tallied up to $20 million in WETH, VELO, soVELO and Wrapped USDC. The Optimism chain of Sonne Finance was exploited through a known donation attack on Compound v2 forks. Another fork of Compound v2, Hundred Finance was rocked by a similar exploit roughly a year ago. Hundred Finance sent out a warning to other Compound forks after their attack. It appears that Sonne seemingly turned a deaf ear, because this was an attack that could have been prevented. Will these protocols ever learn? Credit: Nerv Alert , Luke Youngblood , Daniel Von Fange , Tony KΞ Rinse, repeat, rekt - another DeFi protocol gets taken to the cleaners by a known exploit. A fork of Compound V2, Sonne held just over $60 million in TVL prior to the exploit. In an infuriating display of ignoring history, Sonne became the latest Compound fork to succumb to an exploit that had already taken down protocols like Hundred Finance a year prior. Luke Youngblood provided an attack breakdown : The Sonne Finance team deployed a new market contract for $VELO and a governance proposal was created to activate the market, which had a 4 day total governance period before going live. When the governance proposal succeeded 3 days later, and the 24 hour timelock expired, it was now executable by anyone on the Optimism network. The attacker made sure they were the one to execute it, probably by running a bot and hoping they were first to strike. The attacker executed the proposal, along with their attack payload, all in a single transaction. The proposal set the collateral factor on the Sonne $VELO market to 35%, which enabled the attack to occur, and the protocol to immediately be drained of at least 7 figures of funds. Attacker: 0xae4a7cde7c99fb98b0d5fa414aa40f0300531f43 Attack Contract: 0x02fa2625825917e9b1f8346a465de1bbc150c5b9 Target Contracts: soVELO: 0xe3b81318b1b6776f0877c3770afddff97b9f5fe5 SoUSDC: 0xec8fea79026ffed168ccf5c627c7f486d77b765f soWETH: 0xf7b5965f5c117eb1b5450187c9dcfccc3c317e8e Attack Transaction: 0x9312ae377d7ebdf3c7c3a86f80514878deb5df51aad38b6191d55db53e42b7f0 Stolen Funds currently held in several addresses: 0x5d0d99e9886581ff8fcb01f35804317f5ed80bbb 0x6277ab36a67cfb5535b02ee95c835a5eec554c07 0xae4a7cde7c99fb98b0d5fa414aa40f0300531f43 0x9f09ec563222fe52712dc413d0b7b66cb5c7c795 0x3b39652151102d19ca41544a635956ef97416598 0x9f44c4ec0b34c2dde2268ed3acbf3aba8eacde51 Daniel Von Fange delved deeper into the critical errors committed by Sonne, and provided recommendations for protocols employing multisig wallets alongside timelock governance. The TL;DR: if a series of actions must happen in a certain order in order to be safe, make sure your governance process doesn't allow picking and choosing what to execute, be atomic. Sonne was quick to issue a Post-mortem on the exploit roughly 5 hours after the attack. They highlighted how they previously avoided the Compound V2 donation attack by slowly increasing collateral factors, but a recent proposal to add VELO markets opened an exploit window. After scheduling VELO integration transactions through their permissionless Optimism multisig, the attacker executed the changes and drained $20M by leveraging the well-known vulnerability. Sonne Finance is working to recover the stolen funds, considering a bug bounty for their return. But it wasn’t all bad news. MEV researcher Tony KΞ from fuzzland posted a play by play of how they prevented more than $6.5M from being hacked during the incident, using just $100. One user noticed something fishy when they posted that Mendi Finance's code is a friendly fork of Sonne Finance . Could they be exploited soon? Sonne was audited by Yearn Finance's yAudit. The attack vector is listed as high finding, stating “Unclear protection against Hundred Finance attack vector.” This latest attack on a Compound v2 fork has speculation floating around that other forked protocols could be exploited This is a known vulnerability that can be easily prevented, hopefully this latest incident will put this on other forked protocol’s radars. Do you think they will do their due diligence or will we see more similar attacks? The $20 million attack on Sonne Finance represents a major breach enabled by failure to properly address a well-known vulnerability. Despite explicit warnings from previous incidents like the Hundred Finance exploit, Sonne's team pushed ahead with integrating new markets without comprehensive safeguards against the donation attack vector. This oversight, coupled with loosely configured governance permissions, allowed the attacker to drain millions with relative ease. The fact that auditors had explicitly flagged this risk as high-severity makes this incident even more inexcusable and concerning. As speculation swirls around other Compound V2 forks potentially being exposed to the same exploit, the incident serves as a wakeup call. Prioritizing swift deployments over comprehensive security reviews is a trade-off no protocol can afford, as Sonne has learned the hard way. For DeFi to reach maturity, teams must move past blindly copying code they don't fully understand. Rigorous pre-launch audits, real-time monitoring for attack vectors, and recovery mechanisms are essential. Otherwise, the ecosystem will remain trapped in a cycle of relearning the same costly lessons with each keystroke. The burning question is whether Sonne's $20 million lesson will be the final straw that forces positive change or will the acceptable loss figures simply keep increasing until major investors and users lose faith altogether?

A complex hack of a simple bug leaves Popsicle Finance in a sticky situation. The RewardDistribution bug has already been exploited in several other protocols. Auditors and Smart contract developers need to stay up to date. This code should not have made it to production. If only there was somewhere they could read about previous hacks and exploits... Credit: @Peckshield & @Mudit__Gupta Attacker address: 0xf9E3D08196F76f5078882d98941b71C0884BEa52 Transaction Hash: 0xcd7dae143… The “Sorbetto Fragola” contract automatically manages Liquidity on Uniswap V3. Fragola adjusts the position so it is always in the correct range. The hack was due to the lack of proper fee accounting when LP tokens are transferred. Specifically, the attacker creates three contracts: A, B, and C and repeats in the sequences of: A.deposit(), A.transfer(B), B.collectFees(), B.transfer(C), C.collectFees() for eight pools. Step 1: Flashloan 30M USDT, 13K WETH, 1.4KBTC, 30M USDC, 3M DAI and 200K UNI from Aave to attack eight PLP pools. Below we take the USDT-WETH pool as an example. Step 2: Alice calls deposit() to add 30M USDT and 5.467K WETH liquidity into the USDT-WETH PLP pool and gets 10.51 PLP tokens. Step 3: A transfers the 10.52 PLP tokens to B Step 4: B calls the collectFees() function to get its tokenRewards updated. Step 5: B transfers the 10.52 PLP tokens to C Step 6: C calls the collectFees() function to get its tokenRewards updated. Step 7: C transfers the 10.52 PLP tokens back to A, so A will be able to remove the liquidity later on. Step 8: A calls withdraw() to remove the liquidity and gets back 30M USDT and 5.46 WETH. Step 9: B calls collectFees() to get 2.15M USDT and 392 WETH as rewards. Step 10: C calls collectFees() to get 2.15M USDT and 402 WETH as rewards. Step 11: The attacker repeats step 2 to 10 for several other PLP pools and repays the flashloan in step 1. A portion of the attack's profits (4,100 ETH, about $10M) is immediately deposited to Tornado Cash. At the time of writing, the remaining 2,560 WETH, 96 WBTC and 159,928 DAI are still in the attacker account: 0xf9E3D08196F76f5078882d98941b71C0884BEa52. Everyone makes mistakes, but not many are responsible for $20M TVL… It’s strange that Peckshield decided to publish a post-mortem of code that they audited, instead of waiting and releasing it as an official release from the Popsicle account. Another client's funds lost, while Peckshield chase clout on Twitter. There is little excuse for the auditors for missing an already known bug. They did write a nice post-mortem though, so at least Popsicle Finance got something for their money.

Pickle Finance - REKT,19700000,11/22/2020,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/pickle-finance-rekt/,"Pickle Finance -  Sunday, November 22, 2020 pickle finance - Rekt read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh The fermentation of finance continues. Even pickles have a shelf life. The Pickle Finance cDAI jar was hacked for 19.7 million DAI via a vulnerability involving fake “Pickle Jars”. Pickle Finance has become the latest victim of the hack epidemic. However, this time, something is different... As Twitter tried to come to terms with yet another financial fatality, Rekt started to investigate. We contacted the Stake Capital team, who looked at the code and warned us that other jars could be at risk. We then quickly contacted the Pickle Finance team and set up a war room between members of Stake Capital (@ bneiluj , @vasa_develop )  Yearn ( @bantg ) Pickle Finance and experienced developers @ samczsun , @emilianobonassi . As we worked, it became clear we were looking at something very different to the recent DeFi lego style hacks of recent weeks. This was not an arb. The attacker had excellent knowledge of Solidity and EVM, and had likely been paying close attention to the Yearn code for some time, as the vulnerability was similar to one which was discovered in the Yearn code a month earlier. Pickle Jars are essentially a fork of Yearn’s yVaults. These Jars are controlled by a contract called the Controller, which has a function that allows users to swap their assets between Jars. Unfortunately, there is no whitelist for which Jars are allowed to use this swapping function. The hacker had created a fake Pickle Jar and swapped the funds from the original jar. This was possible because the swapExactJarForJar didn’t check for ""whitelisted"" jars. The Pickle Finance team knew they needed help, and were more than willing to work with the others to prevent any further damage. Pickle had tried to call “withdrawAll”, but the transaction failed . The withdrawal request had to pass through the Governance DAO which had a 12 hour timelock. Only one member of the Pickle multisig had the ability to bypass the timelock, and they were asleep. This meant admins couldn’t empty the Pickle Jars, but it didn’t protect them from another hack. Pickle Finance and Curve sent out warnings telling users to withdraw their funds from Pickle immediately, however, $50 million remained in the potentially vulnerable pickle jars, while the white hat team investigated the exploit and checked the safety of remaining funds. The rescue team either had to wake the sleeping admin, or drain the jars themselves. The team had to overcome five major challenges. To get the Pickle Finance team together across several time zones to start rescuing the funds by pushing transactions into 12h timelock (via 3 out of 6 multisig) to withdraw funds. To get thousands of investors to withdraw their funds (and discourage them from redepositing once the pool TVL dropped and the APY inflated to 1000+% APY) Performing safety checks on the other jars to see if there is a possibility of more attacks. Duplicating the attack and whitehacking before anyone can hack the jars again. Avoiding getting front-runned when trying to rescue the remaining 50k How long can we continue to rely on pseudo anonymous white hat hackers for help? The incentives are clearly more aligned for attackers than protectors; why would they co-ordinate such a gruelling counter attack? The glory goes to whitehacks, yet the money goes to hackers. That’s not sustainable. How long until the temptation turns these white hats black? Analysis By releasing this technical information we are aware that we could be triggering new hacks. We discussed the potential consequences with Pickle Finance and other developers, and confirmed that we do not know of any operational forks of Pickle that could be affected by copycat attacks. Selective disclosure would introduce an aspect of liability, so we decided to release this information freely. If any protocols are running a fork of Pickle’s code, they should already be aware of the unfolding events and be taking preventative action against copycat hacks. The following chart was created by @vasa_develop . The original file can be found here . For further details see the teams full post-mortem here. It will be interesting to see how the relatively new insurance primitive “ Cover Protocol ” handles this incident; a large amount for their first claim. The snapshot vote for the insurance claim can be found here. Pickling is a slow process. For decades, agile development evangelists have told developers to move fast, fail quickly and release the minimum viable product.
These ideas don’t fit the bill when building in a hostile environment. Failing quickly in DeFi comes at great expense. We don’t simply need another methodology. We need a paradigm shift allowing for rapid iteration while reducing the likelihood of getting rekt at the same time. Let’s eliminate the idea that an audit is a guarantee for safety. It is – most of the time – a snapshot of checklist-style security measures applied to moving targets that have often evolved into something else shortly after a project hits mainnet. The audits from MixBytes (October 3rd) and Haechi (October 20th) were completed before the addition of ControllerV4 (October 23rd), which was one of the key attack vectors. The greatest teams in the future of finance will be those capable of handling the trade-offs between shipping fast and shipping safely , continuously auditing and rigorously testing their composable money robots on a regular basis. Audits should be a regular and continuous process, not a box to be ticked before launch. New DeFi protocols are subject to constant change and adaptation, and safety audits should reflect this. Pickles only stay fresh when they’re inside the jar... photo @ martinkrung EDIT - 18th July 2021. Haechi reached out to us with the following statement: We audited a part of Pickle’s contracts, but the exploit occurred in newly updated smart contracts. The smart contract with the exploit was “swapExactJarForJar” in “controller-v4.sol”, and our scope of the audit was “controller-v3.sol” without “swapExactJarForJar”.You can find the details here. (FYI) I checked that your team mentioned that our audit for pickle finance was completed before the addition of ControllerV4 which was the key attack vector for this hack.

The attack, first identified by Cyvers , utilized a series of three transactions within six minutes to convert stolen $WBTC and $DAI into $ETH after being funded from Tornado Cash. UwuLend acknowledged the exploit roughly an hour later, pausing the protocol while the team investigated the situation. The $19.4 million in drained capital was swiftly moved across two Ethereum addresses in a blitz strike choreographed with criminal precision. For a protocol that had recently passed a robust security audit, this blindsiding exploit represented a nightmarish rug pull from the UwuLend depositors' perspective. In light of the exploit, skeptics can't help but raise an eyebrow at Sifu's involvement. With his history of controversies, the question on everyone's mind is, has the former Frog Nation CFO orchestrated yet another masterful deception in the crypto realm? Credit: Cyvers Alerts , UwuLend , Nick Franklin , CRV Hub Uwulend’s contract is a fork version of AAVE V2, but they changed the oracle fallback logic to borrow assets at one rate and liquidate them at an artificially inflated rate as seen here . According to root cause analysis by Nick Franklin , the exploit took advantage of a price discrepancy in UwuLend's oracles. To manipulate the price, the attacker utilized a flash loan. UwuLend's fallback oracle calculated prices based on the state of several Curve pools. The attacker could manipulate the pool states by making large trades with the borrowed tokens. This manipulated the price feed, allowing the attacker to borrow sUSDe at 0.99 but liquidate positions at the inflated 1.03 rate.

The attacker deposited the tokens into Curve’s Llama Lend and borrowed just over 8 million crvUSD ($8.11M). Thanks to the diligent lenders of crvUSD in LlamaLend's CRV market, the hacker's position was fully hard-liquidated as the lenders repaid the debt, being one of the little silver lining of this event by proving the robustness of the platform. The situation and effects are being unpacked and analyzed in real time in the Curve Social Telegram channel. Sifu extended an on-chain olive branch to the attacker, proposing a 20% white hat bounty if they cooperate by June 12, 17:00 UTC. Post-deadline, the bounty will shift gears, rewarding anyone who can expose and help bring the exploiter to justice. Someone else sent an onchain message to the hacker with instructions on how to move the funds without getting caught. The same address has sent messages in the past to the exploiter of Gala Games , PlayDapp and Exactly Protocol to name a few. UwuLend was audited by Peckshield , who characterized the code as “well designed and engineered,” with “no high-severity or critical issues” detected. How did such a critical oracle vulnerability go uncaught by the auditors? The $19.4 million UwuLend exploit leaves more questions than answers. Despite a recent security audit, a seemingly elementary oracle vulnerability paved the way for one of 2024's most bizarre thefts. With the attacker's identity still shrouded in mystery, suspicion has fallen on Sifu, who appears to be a common thread in multiple crypto crime scenes. Questions linger about UwuLend's choice to rely on DEX prices as a fallback oracle. As conspiracy theories swirl, it remains unclear if the UwuLend attack was an unfortunate lapse in security or something more nefarious. The overlapping breadcrumb trail of Sifu's involvement, the unorthodox oracle design, and the enigmatic on-chain instruction adds further intrigue. Who is the shadowy figure instructing exploiters and are there other cryptic connections that have yet to be uncovered or is it just somebody trying to exploit the attacker?

Cream Finance - REKT,18800000,08/30/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/cream-rekt/,"Cream Finance -  Monday, August 30, 2021 Cream -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh Inspector rekt back once again. $18.8M lost to a ghostface killer, this time from an old school DeFi protocol. Cream Finance was audited by Trail of Bits (one of the few auditors absent from our leaderboard ) on Jan 28th 2021. However, even the strongest audit becomes irrelevant once the protocol is changed. On Feb 10th 2021, the Cream proposal to add the AMP token came into effect, and the loophole opened up. Credit: @peckshield 418,311,571 AMP tokens and 1,308.09 ETH were lost on the Cream Finance AMP token contract. The AMP token contract implements ERC77-based ERC1820, which has the _callPreTransferHooks for reentrancy. The reentrancy vulnerability within the AMP token contract allowed the exploiter to nest a second borrow() function inside the token transfer() before the initial borrow() has been updated: Example exploit transaction (one of 17) Attack contracts: A , B and exploiter wallet .

A similar process was used over 17 transactions, accumulating a total of almost 6k ETH.

Snowdog - REKT,18100000,11/25/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/snowdog-rekt/,"Snowdog -  Friday, November 26, 2021 Snowdog - Avalanche -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh A “ game theory experiment ” or a new breed of rug pull? For many, Snowdog has made this a thanksgiving to forget… Snowdog claims to be “ a decentralized reserve meme coin ”, forked by the anon team at Snowbank from their own project; one of many OHM-forks to have launched recently. The premise was to run an 8-day accumulation phase , during which users could stock up on SDOG via minting, staking or market buying. Then, a buyback was scheduled which offered SDOG holders the chance to cash out for a share of $44M in MIM, bought using the treasury funds grown during the accumulation phase. Following the buyback, the project planned to burn the proceeds, cut staking rewards and renounce contract ownership in order to fix the supply and establish SDOG as the “ meme currency of Avalanche ”. This is the first incident we have investigated on Avalanche. Was it luck or inside information that led the top $DOGs to success? In the lead-up to last night, SDOG had been trading on TraderJoe at close to $1350. However, claiming they wanted to protect against bots and MEV searchers frontrunning the sale, Snowdog decided to set up a new AMM with an SDOG-MIM pool solely for the purposes of the buyback. adding a simple mathematical challenge to the AMM, it became nearly impossible for bots to quickly adapt and understand how the swap works. Only users using the front-end could swap The front-end was kept password-protected until the moment the buyback went live, and once the liquidity migrated from TraderJoe was added to the pool, it became clear that a massive price hike had been created as the pooled ratios determined a new SDOG price of ~$70k. A list of transactions from the first few minutes in the pool can be found here . The first two transactions were the clear winners, picking up around 40% of the spoils between them. Tx1 - 187.8 SDOG for 10.4M MIM (SDOG price of ~$55k) from this address , funded via FTX the day before. Tx2 - 215.1 SDOG for 7.7M MIM (SDOG price of ~$36k) from this address , also funded via FTX the day before. These two transactions sold a total of 403 SDOG for approximately $18M, which would have been worth a mere $500k at pre-buyback rates. However the “ joy ” referred to in Snowdog’s explanation of the incident quickly turned to “ deception ” for the vast majority of users who were left either selling their tokens below the previous market price or holding while watching their value nosedive. 36 seconds after the front-end reveal, $SDOG market price was already lower than the market price before buyback ($1200). The report goes on to defend the use of the custom liquidity pool by drawing attention to the number of failed botted transactions at the time of the launch. However, suspicion began to build over the earliest trades, and the likelihood of them being an inside job: The two first and most profitable trades are from brand-new addresses ( one , two ), funded within hours of each other on the day before the buyback. The accounts were funded via FTX, so are likely KYC’d. The accounts appeared to have prior knowledge that the buyback would happen on a new DEX, not having approved SDOG for trading on TraderJoe in advance but approving the custom pool as soon as it was published. The contract’s challengeKey , introduced in order to disrupt sniping bots, is a further source of suspicion given that team members would know the details of this mechanism and have privileged access to the contract directly before the front-end went live. Snowbank and Snowdog have attempted to capture the two extremes of the current crypto zeitgeist on Avalanche. Combining dogcoin FOMO with the aim to establish a reserve currency backed by protocol owned liquidity is ambitious to say the least. And the anon team’s attempt to join these two popular but opposing narratives has backfired, given how the Snowdog “ experiment ” has affected Snowbank’s token price . That’s one botched buyback, and two projects rekt by the same team. It seems the response to yesterday’s events has tightened Snowbank’s leash with regard to further launches , despite initially using the hype to tease upcoming products . As for any future success of SDOG as Avalanche's answer to DOGE, and Snowbank as its reserve currency, only time will tell. Was this a gamed buyback, representing a slightly more sophisticated form of the everyday rugpull? Or was it simply the bubble popping on what was never meant to be anything more than an experimental memecoin?

bEarn - REKT,18000000,05/17/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/bearn-rekt/,"bEarn -  Monday, May 17, 2021 bEarn -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh Every weekend another one falls. Binance Smart Chain provides the easiest prey for the anonymous apex predator. Hard-hearted hackers are fast to feast on copied code from developers keen to cut corners. Another week finished and another protocol with it. $18 million gone from bEarnFi. The following is taken from the Peckshield and bEarn analysis . Starting at 10:36:20 AM +UTC, May 16, 2021, BearnFi’s BvaultsBank contract was exploited and approximately $18M funds were drained from the pool. The incident was made possible due to a bug in the internal withdraw logic, which inconsistently read the same input amount, but with different asset denominations between the BvaultsBank and the associated strategy BvaultsStrategy. The BvaultsBank's withdraw logic assumes the withdrawn amount is denominated in BUSD while the BvaultsStrategy's withdraw logic assumes the withdrawn amount is denominated in ibBUSD. However, ibBUSD is an interest-bearing token and is more expensive than BUSD . 1: Borrow a flashloan from CREAM with 7,804,239.111784605253208456 BUSD, which is returned at the last step with necessary fee to cover the flash loan cost. 2: Deposit the borrowed funds into BvaultsBank, which are immediately sent to the associated BvaultsStrategy strategy, then to Alpaca Vault for yield. Due to the above deposit, the Alpaca Vault mints 7,598,066.589501626344403426 ibBUSD back to BvaultsStrategy. 3: Farm with the received 7,598,066.589501626344403426 ibBUSD via the Alpaca FairLaunch. 4: Withdraws the 7,804,239.111784605253208533 BUSD from BvaultsBank, which is interpreted as withdrawing 7,804,239.111784605253208533 ibBUSD, the equivalent of 8,016,006.09792806917101481 BUSD. 5: In the next round, the user still deposits 7,804,239.111784605253208533 BUSD into BvaultsBank, cascadingly to BvaultsStrategy. But with the previous leftover from the last round, BvaultsStrategy credits the user with 8,016,006.09792806917101481 BUSD, which is used for yield again via Alpaca. 6: Repeat the above steps to continue accumulating the credit and finally exits by draining the pool. 7: Return the flash loan with 7,806,580.383518140634784418 BUSD. The attacker’s funds from the above exploitations were initially held in this wallet: 47f3 . Another week begins. Has the hacker returned richer to their day job, or do they attack on weekends as they expect less attention? The boom in BSC code copies has created a wealth of new opportunities for any developer who seeks to exploit protocols.

Curio - REKT,16000000,03/23/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/curio-rekt/,"Curio -  Tuesday, March 26, 2024 Curio -  read this article also in : en - es Stormy Spring breach. Curio's MakerDAO-based smart contract on Ethereum was exploited for $16 million, due to a critical vulnerability involving voting power privileges. Curio broke the news first, highlighting that the incident only affected the ecosystem on the Ethereum side and all Polkadot side and Curio Chain contracts remain secure. The exploit wasn't limited to minting and manipulating governance. It extended into sophisticated financial strategies involving token swaps and cross-chain transfers. The exploiter is still holding 996 Billion CGT . The total loss is significant, but difficult to calculate, because of the limited market liquidity of CGT. Could this just be the beginning of storm season? Credit: Curio , Hacken The Curio Ecosystem, known for bridging the gap between tradfi and defi through tokenized real-world assets, got thunderstruck for a $16M loss over the spring weekend. On March 23, 2024, CurioDAO Association announced its voting protocol experienced an exploit involving a smart contract based on MakerDAO’s fork. Hacken posted a thread outlining the cause of the exploit. As Hacken explained: The attack was initiated through the ""cook"" function of an attack contract, which played a crucial role in leveraging the ""IDSChief"" and ""IDSPause"" contracts to execute a governance manipulation and mass token minting scheme. The attacker leveraged this vulnerability by acquiring a small number of CGT tokens, thereby gaining access to elevate their voting power within the project’s contract. By locking these tokens and voting, they gained control, allowing them to execute a delegate call to a malicious contract. The exploit not only involved minting tokens and manipulating governance but also complex financial strategies such as token swaps and cross-chain transfers, likely in an attempt to distribute and disguise the origin of the minted tokens.. The various swaps and transfers indicate a methodical plan to distribute and perhaps obscure the trail of the minted tokens across multiple platforms and blockchains. Attacker Address: 0xdaAa6294C47b5743BDafe0613d1926eE27ae8cf5 Attacker Transaction: 0x4ff4028b03c3df468197358b99f5160e5709e7fce3884cc8ce818856d058e106 Attack Visualization on Metaseluth. Despite the incident within the CurioDAO, the impact was confined to the Ethereum side of Curio’s technology stack. CurioDAO released an exploit recovery strategy on March 25, highlighting a 2 stage compensation plan: -   The Curio team will release a new token CGT 2.0 instead of the current CGT token that is susceptible to exploit attacks. -   A funds compensation program related to the second token in the liquidity pools will be launched. The compensation program will consist of 4 consecutive stages, each lasting for 90 days. They will be developing and deploying a patch to address the identified vulnerability in the voting power privilege access control. Claiming this patch will undergo rigorous testing to ensure its effectiveness in mitigating similar exploits in the future. Along with that, they plan to enhance Curio DAO's smart contract security through upgrades that enforce stricter access controls, audit the code, and add extra layers of security validation to avoid future exploits. No known audits could be found and it appears Curio may be doing their security in house. It was mentioned in the exploit recovery strategy, Curio is relying on internal expertise and leveraging best practices in smart contract development and security auditing. Curio DAO is offering a reward structure to white hat hackers, based on proceeds from the initial recovery phase, 10% of the proceeds recovered during the first week and 5% after that, until May 25th. Do you believe Curio would have been better protected by having external audits, instead of keeping things in house? Spring brought more than just flowers for Curio, not only wiping out $16M, but essentially retiring their original CGT token. On the bright side, CurioDAO's two-stage compensation plan with a new token, CGT 2.0,may patch things up a bit. While Curio claims the exploit was contained to their Ethereum playground, the exploiter is still sitting on 996 Billion CGT tokens. Maybe the attacker just got started and will find a way to swap across chains for a complex financial game. Will Curio's promise to revamp smart contract security calm any brewing distrust? Time will tell. If they’re going to keep security in-house, it may not be the best strategy, as highlighted by this attack. Launching projects into the wild without proper security due diligence is setting yourself up for failure. Are finding risks after the fact becoming too common, or just an indication that the industry needs to invest more in preventive measures and proactive security strategies?

Indexed Finance - REKT,16000000,10/14/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/indexed-finance-rekt/,"Indexed Finance -  Friday, October 15, 2021 Indexed Finance -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh $16 million taken from Indexed Finance. That’s one more protocol added to the rekt register, and $16 million more on our leaderboard. We’ll always bring our stories to Twitter , but if you want to talk directly to the characters involved, then the best place for you is the rekt.news Telegram group. Shortly after the attack, Indexed Finance core contributor and rekt reader Dr Laurence Day showed the rekt group members as he tried to communicate with the hacker on-chain; Indexed Finance here. Time to talk? Indexed Finance offers investors 6 indices, each one a pool of various assets. Each index pool has its own token whose price should be a weighted average of the underlying assets. At 18:37 UTC on October 14th, an attack took place targeting the DEFI5 and CC10 pools. The “Future of Finance Fund” (FFF) was also heavily affected, given that DEFI5 and CC10 tokens make up 37.05% of its underlying assets. More details of the exploit can be found in the official post-mortem as well as in Mudit Gupta’s twitter thread . Dillon Kellar; the sole developer responsible for writing the original code of Indexed Finance, has made his thoughts public in a Tweet thread. The code governing the index pools is forked from the Balancer Pool contract . This allows for the internal rebalancing of assets within the pool on a constant product curve. The function extrapolatePoolValueFromToken is based on the “first token in the pool with a target weight over 0 and which is fully initialized” to calculate the total value of the pool. total_value = token_balance * total_weight / token_weight In order to control slippage, the rate at which the resulting changes in weights are enacted within the pool is limited , creating a temporary discrepancy ripe for manipulation. The attacker’s address was funded via Tornado Cash hours before the attack: 0xba5ed1488be60ba2facc6b66c6d6f0befba22ebe Both the DEFI and CC10 pools were attacked in the same way, see this transaction for the attack on the DEFI5 pool. The attacker was able to take advantage of the above by using flash loans of the other assets in the pool to buy out UNI, decreasing the extrapolated value due to the delay in updating UNI’s weight decrease. This was done gradually, as the “pool does not allow swaps to send more than 1/2 of the pool’s existing balance in a token or purchase more than 1/3 of the pool’s balance in a token”. After calling the updateMinimumBalance function using the gamed pool value, the controller valued the pool at just 29,851 SUSHI (~$300k), “despite the pool having received over a hundred million dollars worth of other assets”. Once prepared, the attacker could deposit relatively small amounts of (now heavily over-weighted) SUSHI into the pool, minting a massively inflated number of DEFI5 tokens in return. These were subsequently cashed out for the assets in the pool. In total, about $16M of a variety of assets were stolen by the attacker, at the time of writing they remain in this address. In a follow up to the official post-mortem, Doctor Day has put out a statement: The knife twist is that we've realised that we believe that we actually know who did this: we spoke to them quite a bit prior to the execution of this attack. Starting on the 15th of September, we were approached by a Discord user under the name 'UmbralUpsilon' (currently BogHolder#1688), asking some questions about the way in which certain parameters were utilised in the oracle. Since every component of Indexed is open-source, we answered these questions, and upon asking the reason, were told that they were attempting to create an arbitrage bot for the pools. This is a key part of how Indexed generates revenue (exit fees on burns when arbitraging the NAV of tokens and their value on DEXes), and we were happy to engage with queries about the mechanics, explaining how reindexes work, the timing of reweights, how tokens are added and removed from candidate asset lists, and so on. We had no reason to be alarmed: all of these conversations were in the spirit of open-source collaboration. We are aware (courtesy of @pcaversaccio ) that the exploiter requested some Kovan testnet Ether via Gitter, using the (dead, presumably created for the purposes of the assault) Twitter account @ZetaZeroes. We have reached out to them via Gitter with the following message . We speak now directly to the exploiter, if they ever read this: you’re clearly incredibly skilled: this is something that has been overlooked for ten months in production, and you’re the only one that found it. While it would have been so much more productive for you to instead choose to work with us: be the antihero of this story rather than the villain. Take a 10% whitehat, and save a lot of people the effort of engaging law enforcement. The people that are affected by this are those that are trying to diversify risk within a volatile space. That’s part of what makes this particularly cruel: no one deserves to have their funds whisked away, but the context here is an irony that can’t be ignored. Our door’s open, and it’ll make a much more satisfying footnote to our appearance on rekt.news. Wise words from the Doxxed Doctor, who’s been put in the hot seat through no fault of his own. The damage dealt by these attackers is not just financial. No DeFi developer should have to receive death threats. Is anonymity the only way to stay safe?

Team Finance , the self-proclaimed “ Industry Leader In Project Security & Automation ”, lost $15.8M of funds that it was supposed to be safeguarding. Of the four pools drained, FEG , Caw , and Kondux were the worst hit. Tsuka was also affected, but experienced less price impact due to a secondary liquidity pool on Uniswap v3. The project’s website claims to protect over $2.5B of assets, but considering the low liquidity of their selection of shitcoins, we can consider this claim to be optimistic at best. #46 on the leaderboard . Teamwork. Credit: Peckshield The announcement of the hack explained that the exploit targeted “ the audited v2 to v3 migration function. ” The vulnerability was contained in one of the Liquidity Locks ’ “bulletproof smart contracts” which allowed projects to migrate locked LP positions from Uni v2 to Uni v3. According to Peckshield’s analysis : The protocol has a flawed migrate() that is exploited to transfer real UniswapV2 liquidity to an attacker-controlled new V3 pair with skewed price, resulting in huge leftover as the refund for profit. Also, the authorized sender check is bypassed by locking any tokens. The breakdown of the loss to each project’s Uniswap v2 pool is as follows: $11.5M CAW $1.7M TSUKA $0.7M KNDX $1.9M FEG Exploiter address 1: 0x161cebb807ac181d5303a4ccec2fc580cc5899fd Exploiter address 2 (containing stolen funds): 0xba399a2580785a2ded740f5e30ec89fb3e617e6e Attack tx: 0xb2e3ea72… Attacker’s contract: 0xcff07c4e6aa9e2fec04daaf5f41d1b10f3adadf4 The vulnerable migrate() function was included in Zokyo Security’s audit of Team Finance contracts from August this year. “DAO tooling” was amongst the most popular buzzwords throughout the last cycle. For small, anon teams working on innovative protocols, it may be tempting to outsource trust to a third party. But given the array of shitcoins “secured” by Team Finance, the vaults seem more likely to be a way for projects to appear trustworthy by proxy. Now that it’s clear that trust has been lost.

This attack got the experts attention. A professionally executed hack allowed an anonymous actor to manipulate the price of INV and help themself to an exclusive deal from the ETH based lending protocol. How did it happen? Credit: Igor Igamberdiev & Peckshield. ~$15.6M was stolen in the form of: 1588 ETH 94 WBTC 4M DOLA 39.3 YFI First of all, the exploiter withdrew 901 ETH from Tornado Cash. Then they transferred 1.5 ETH to 241 clean addresses via Disperse and deployed five different smart contracts, of which only one was real. He then swapped 500 ETH to 1.7k INV so that it went through the INV-WETH pair on SushiSwap, significantly changing the price due to low liquidity (50x). At the same time, he began spamming transactions with an exploit to be the first to get into the next block and get an inflated price from SushiSwap. The Inverse Finance oracle, through Keeper Network, ended up using SushiSwap TWAP as an oracle, returning the price that made the INV token on the platform incredibly expensive. The attacker then deposited his 1.7k INV (fair price - $644k) as collateral and (permanently) borrowed $15.6M. Peckshield provided the following visualisation. We would prefer that hackers take the weekends off, but at least this wasn’t another case of “compromised keys”. Inverse Finance have since released their official statement , and several knowledgeable community members have pointed out the complexity / efficiency of the attack technique. Flash bot expert himself, @bertcmiller , said that: ""The InverseFinance hack is one of the most MEV aware hacks I've seen."" ""[the attacker] held an oracle's price at an insane level across multiple blocks, prevented arb bots from bringing prices back in line, and protected against generalised frontrunners."" Chainlinkgod , (who always has something to say when an oracle is exploited) also pointed out that: ""Relying upon a TWAP oracle generated from a single thinly traded DEX trading pair with a short time sample compounds market manipulation risks."" After the attack, in Twitter Spaces, Inverse Finance stated that they are working with Chainlink to launch a INV price feed once liquidity requirements have been met. This would then replace the current TWAP oracle. Although these risks are obvious in hindsight, it’s clear that this was not an amateur job. Even the best in the business wear black hats sometimes… Maybe it’s better not to aggravate them.

The crypto community went into yet another frenzy last night, as Andre Cronje's unreleased project became the focus of hundreds of users, who quickly bought $15 million of the mysterious $EMN token. After some unexplained promotional tweets, users were keenly watching Cronje's account for any clues as to what was coming. As soon as the new contracts were deployed from the yEarn finance address, the game was on. Hundreds of users joined in the crowd-sourced investigation project to try and understand what was going on, and how to profit.

— Kiyo (@IslandKiyo) September 28, 2020 The contracts that had been deployed included the EMN token, which could be exchanged for other tokens such as eYFI, eAAVE, or eSNX. These tokens, plus the surprise launch, matched perfectly one of Andre's previous tweets about the upcoming yEarn finance project. The new yearn system is probably the most complex to date. It incorporates @synthetix_io @AaveAave @chainlink @iearnfinance and will be running on L1/L2 Trying to decide if we should do whitepaper-esque writeups to explain before launch, or just launch and surprise everyone?
— Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) September 23, 2020 Cronje's reputation as a leading DeFi builder, combined with his promotion of the Eminence Twitter account, caused a full on frenzy, and $15 million flowed into the unexplained contract to be exchanged for EMN or one of the eTokens. 🚨 yearn system confirmed.

At around 04:00 UTC, the $15 million contained in the contract was suddenly drained. @fifikobayashi wrote a short summary of how the attack took place. Use flash loan to mint EMN Manipulate EMN price downwards by burning EMN for eTokens EMN is based on a bonding curve, so when supply goes down, price goes down. Short EMN by burning the other half of the flashed EMN back into DAI, which was then inflated in comparison due to the curve-induced drop in EMN value. Although hacks are certainly not unusual in crypto, what happened next certainly is. 11 minutes after removing $15 million in DAI, the attacker returned $8 million to the Yearn: Deployer contract 01:31:04 AM +UTC.

Theories are running wild about who was behind the hack, and why they would return any money,  with some pointing the finger at the creators of Yearn Finance, and claiming it was an inside job.

Despite this major setback, Andre continues to build, and released this tweet earlier today. I am still building @eminencefi . I love the metaverse and metaconomy.

The previously unblemished reputation of the YFI developer has taken a hit, and we are now at what feels like a turning point in DeFi, where hopefully both developers and users can learn from this event.

Furucombo - REKT,14000000,02/27/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/furucombo-rekt/,"Furucombo -  Monday, March 1, 2021 Furucombo - rekt read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh Better to wait than to swing and miss. We heard about Furucombo but our hands were tied - small teams can’t always ship on time, especially when the hackers work weekends. If you’re a DeFi detective with skills to share, then reach out and tell us about your experience - we might have a spot for you here at rekt.news. A hacker hit back with a counter attack, broke Furucombo and knocked out $14 million from various wallets who had given the app “infinite approval”. Infinite approval means unlimited trust - something which we know we shouldn’t do in DeFi. “Don’t trust, verify”, but who has time or the cash for gas to approve set amounts each time they transact? People who used Furucombo had to give some amount of approval, but it seems too many gave too much, and they received a harsh lesson in return. In what is known as an “evil contract” exploit, the attacker made the Furucombo proxy contract think that Aave V2 had a new implementation . The new implementation was, of course, malicious, and had the ability to transfer all approved tokens to addresses controlled by the attacker, as users had approved the Furucombo contracts to use their tokens on their behalf. Kurt Barry provided an analysis: One of the fund stealing transactions was sent to the Furucombo proxy, specifying the AAVE v2 Lending Pool proxy as the ""handler"" for the first and only action. You can see the execution trace below, as shown on ethtx.info . Notice the nested delegatecalls. Handlers must be approved in a registry; at the time of the transaction (but not at present), this proxy was a valid handler. The FC proxy delegatecalls the AAVE v2 proxy, which then reads out the implementation address from a special storage slot, but as this is a delegatecall, it reads from the storage of the FC proxy, and the extracted address is the hacker's exploit contract. If we look at the hacker's previous transaction : We see that the hacker used their malicious contract to make the FC proxy delegatecall to the AAVE v2 proxy, invoking the initialize function, setting the implementation slot. Once the delegatecall executed the hacker's code in the FC proxy's context, it was all over. The victim had approved the FC proxy to move their stETH, and the exploit code sent it all to the hacker. Rinse and repeat for the rest. Summary: FC proxy made caller-specified delegatecalls to trusted handlers, letting its storage be modified a handler made caller-specified delegatecalls to an address read from storage the handler exposed a function for setting that address What have we learnt: a ""trust list"" is useful but not a guarantee developers should audit how a delegatecallee's functions can affect the caller's storage consider restricting functions or parameters of callees be wary of user-supplied inputs It wasn’t just individuals who lost out, even Cream Finance suffered a loss, as the attacker “borrowed” directly from their treasury. Igor Igamberdiev gave a list of the assets which were stolen. 3,9k stETH 2.4M USDC 649k USDT 257k DAI 26 aWBTC 270 aWETH 296 aETH 2.3k aAAVE 4 WBTC 90k CRV 43k LINK 7.3k cETH 17.2M cUSDC 69 cWBTC 142.2M BAO 38.6k PERP 30.4k COMBO 75k PAID 225k UNIDX 342 GRO 19k NDX We spoke to DeFi enthusiast Limzero (@pleyuh) after we found out he was one of the worst affected. rekt: How did the situation play out for you? How did you realise Furucombo was being attacked and when did you take action? Limzero: I was chilling with some friends in my home. I opened TG from mobile to see what's up and saw from Darren's ""The daily ape"" channel that there was a Furucombo related exploit. I checked one of my addresses I had used furucombo from and noticed the transfer of my aAAVE and some aETH. I got scared because I had some active loans and didn't want to have my deposits liquidated. I found out that my health factor had dropped to 1.15, so i repaid the loans fast. What i noticed is that the attacker drained all my aAAVE but only 1/3 of my aETH. I suspect that the low HF blocked them from transferring more funds out. I might have been lucky having active loans. After I repaid the loans to protect the deposits, I revoked all token permissions I had given from that address. That was an action I was postponing for weeks (for when fees would be lower). Apparently it was a costly delay. I noticed the transfer of my funds by the hacker 90m after the hack had taken place. rekt: Was it a big loss for you? How did it feel psychologically, do you feel more cautious or less confident about using DeFi after the attack? Limzero: It was a big loss in absolute numbers but nothing my portfolio couldn't survive. I got very scared for a couple of minutes as I was afraid that all my aTokens could have gotten liquidated, when I saw my health factor above 1.1 I felt relief. I treat the whole experience as an expensive security lesson- having infinite allowances on from an address with large amounts was a very silly mistake by my side. All things considered, that was an ape tax I had to pay eventually. It's the first smart contract hack / exploit that affects me after so many years in the space. I feel lucky that more serious situations haven't touched me yet. Actually the first exploit after the COVER exploit but I forgot about that :P I do not feel less confident about using DeFi. These kinds of risks were known. I have taken measures to increase my cyber security though. rekt: What can you tell us about these measures? Limzero: I'd rather not say sorry. It's part of the measures  😋 rekt: What steps would you recommend our readers take to improve their security? Limzero: use hardware wallets avoid windows web 3 dedicated machine for contract interactions unique passwords or password managers + VPN low social media profile use multiple addresses to spread risk fresh addresses for new farms revoke approvals from frequently used addresses I am not a security expert by any means. These are standard guidelines suggested by more knowledgeable people in crypto. read  xD rekt: Any final message for our readers? Limzero: ""Please don't hack me again"" Also, unless you feel very confident about your security, consider keeping a small fraction of your holdings on top tier CEXes like Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, Binance in case your personal wallets get hacked. That's all from me. rekt: Thanks for talking to us. Limzero: Thank you! I hope we never talk again lol. A simple attack with a simple fix - don’t use “infinite approve” unless you have unlimited trust. Individual approvals are no small expense, but don’t cut costs when it comes to security. Sites such as Debank or Etherscan allow you to monitor and revoke your wallet approvals, and as Limzero stated, this is not a task that should be delayed until another day. Never drop your guard, hackers are always looking for an opening, and these attacks occur much more regularly than you might expect. There’s no referee inside this ring; you are responsible for your own safety, but once you learn the ropes, the prize money is worth the risk. EDIT: 18th July 2021: Haechi reached out to us with the following statement: Although their contract(proxy) was in our scope of audit, the exploit that infected the proxy was not our scope of the audit. What furucombo team provided to us was only two contracts; furucombo proxy and compound adapter. So their scenario that furucombo team has provided is accessing the compound protocol using a compound adapter with proxy, that’s all. But, as you know, the exploit was caused by the scenario of using AAVE. We were not able to find this issue since they already had whitelist functionality which should have worked as a guard for this kind of situation.

In an unusual twist, the UAE-based exchange was first to report their own $13.7 million nightmare - after they'd already recovered the funds. A ghost story with a suspiciously spooky ending. The Abu Dhabi platform claimed to have detected and resolved the incident within 16 minutes, wrapping up their security breach faster than most people carve a pumpkin. ZachXBT's confirmation added another layer to the mystery, revealing the attack had spread across ETH, BTC, and SOL chains like a digital haunting. When an exchange races to announce their own hack - with funds already recovered - dark shadows whisper: what demons are they trying to keep locked in the vault? Credit: M2 , ZachXBT , Cyvers , Hacken In the dead of night on October 30th, digital shadows began to stir. Cyvers' AI sentinels were the first to spot the darkness spreading, as multiple suspicious transactions slithered across ETH, SOL, and BTC chains. Their warning, lost in LinkedIn's corporate labyrinth, maye have died unread in M2's inbox. But like a carnival mask, M2's vague explanation barely concealed what lay beneath. It wasn't until Hacken stepped in that the true nature of the exploit emerged: an access control breach. Hacken's technical breakdown peeled back layers of digital darkness, revealing the methodical nature of the attack. As the witching hour struck, funds began flowing like dark water from M2's hot wallet: 0xE26abc37b06B819243B4B104270Cc18f7C835FcE First to an EOA: 0xb5f798096bd4D969466E2284Bda01F7A51049d3A Before being moved to another EOA for further distribution: 0x968b6984cba14444f23ee51be90652408155e142 The attacker's haul materialized across three chains, in a trinity of terror. On Ethereum, approximately $10.1M worth of assets were drained: 97M $SHIBA tokens $3.7M in $USDT 1,378 $ETH All swiftly transformed into ETH, like shapeshifters under a full moon.

A feat that would make even Houdini raise an eyebrow. According to their security update, ""We would like to report that the situation has been fully resolved and customer funds have been restored."" The exchange hastily assured users they had ""taken full responsibility for any potential losses,"" while demonstrating their ""unwavering commitment to safeguarding customers' interests."" The official statement read like a hastily performed seance - full of assurances about service restoration and additional controls, yet mysteriously light on details about how their security actually failed. Their final act? A solemn pledge to cooperate with ""relevant legal and regulatory authorities"" - as if Abu Dhabi's regulators could chase down digital phantoms. When an exchange performs its own exorcism this quickly, shadows dance with doubt: did they banish all their demons, or just the ones we can see? As dark shadows retreat from this Halloween tragedy, M2's story fractures like a broken mirror. Their claims of swift recovery and resolution ring hollow while $13 million worth of digital treats still sit in the attacker's bags, unmoved and untouched - like a haunted house with its lights still on. The speed of their response, matched with their rush to downplay the incident, reads like a script written before the attack even began. Yet unlike most crypto crime scenes, where victims cry foul and attackers vanish into digital mist, M2 seems almost... comfortable with their haunting. When an exchange claims to have recovered from a ghost story while the spirits still dance in plain sight, in this house of horrors, who's really holding the keys to the crypt?

It was then announced on Discord on March 19th that “Muon oracles are ready and implemented”. But it seems the new system wasn't enough to keep the protocol safe. How did the attacker bypass the new oracle? This exploit was not as straightforward as the last. The hacker needed to trick the off-chain (Muon) oracle as well as manipulate the on-chain price feed (the same USDC/DEI pool as before) . The Muon oracle monitors transactions within the Solidly USDC/DEI pool to calculate a Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). Four minutes before the main attack transaction, a separate transaction was able to “fake” a swap of ~2M USDC to 100k DEI. The funds necessary to finance this manipulation were initially withdrawn from Tornado Cash before being sent on to the exploiter’s address, swapped for $2M USDC and then sent via Multichain to Fantom (example tx: send , receive ). In what Tabor claims to be a “ a zero-day exploit on Solidly swaps ” , a series of flash-swaps inside the same pool outputs a manipulated price, which is read by the Muon oracle. He went on to explain via DM that: ”we came to the conclusion it all is based on the fact the muon oracle implementation only used Solidly as a price source, they have been working on upgrading that already. the swap used flashswap() that wasnt filtered out properly by muon leading to a short term VWAP price glitch… …Main takeaway based on the whitehackers anlysis is to change muon vwap pricing to filter out obscure swaps and use multiple data sources."" After having prepared the Muon oracle, at 02:40 UTC, the main attack targeted the USDC/DEI pool used by the lending contract as an on-chain oracle for DEI, using the same process as before. Credit: Peckshield 1: Flashloan 143,200,000 USDC 2: Swap 143,200,000 USDC to 9,547,716 DEI via sAMM-USDC/DEI_USDC_DEI (so DEI becomes extremely expensive) 3: With 71,436 DEI as collateral, attacker borrows 17,246,885 DEI from DeiLenderSolidex due to the manipulated price in step 2 4: Repay flashloan with ~$13M as hack profit While last month’s attack manipulated collateral price in order to liquidate borrowers, this time, the collateral was used to borrow funds directly from the protocol. The loot (5446 ETH, including the funds used to finance the Muon manipulation) was sent from the attacker’s address on Fantom to Ethereum and then on to Tornado Cash. Muon oracle manipulation tx: 0x8589e1… Main flashloan attack tx: 0x39825f… Attacker’s address (FTM): 0x701428… Attacker’s address (ETH): 0x701428… Despite this being the second incident to affect the project in as many months, the price of DEUS has returned close to pre-hack prices, after an initial ~20% drop. DEI has been trading under peg since the incident, but appears to be stabilising over time. Given the oracle is a new product and the swap vulnerability is allegedly previously unknown, it's no surprise that the Armors Labs’ audit of Deus’ lending product did not pick up the issue. However, even if the claims of a novel vulnerability are accurate, Tabor’s admissions show that the Muon oracle wasn’t up to task - it shouldn’t have been using a single price source, and had inadequate filtering of “obscure swaps”. Both of these factors will be addressed and, similarly to last time, the project will be covering losses , this time via veDEUS funds. There are reliable, established and already battle-tested options to choose from. While innovation is admirable, security standards emerged from our baptism of fire. Let’s make sure to use them.

Ronin Network - Rekt II,12000000,08/07/2024,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/roninnetwork-rektII/,"Ronin Network - Rekt II Wednesday, August 7, 2024 Ronin -  read this article also in : en - es The Ronin Network bridge was exploited for roughly $12 million, due to a critical oversight in a contract upgrade. For the Axie Infinity community and Ronin Network users, the words ""bridge exploit"" likely trigger PTSD. After the monumental $624 million hack in March 2022 , many hoped those days were behind them. But on August 6, those old wounds were reopened as Ronin faced yet another attack. This time the damage was significantly less, but the psychological impact resonates deeply. It's as if the crypto world is watching a horror movie sequel, wondering if the protagonist has learned from past mistakes or if they're doomed to repeat them. As Ronin stumbles yet again, we're left wondering, how many wake-up calls does a project need before it finally masters the basics of operational security? Credit: Chaofan Shou , Ronin Network , Verichains Just when you thought it was safe to cross the Ronin bridge again, history repeats itself in a smaller, yet equally alarming fashion. On August 6, the Ronin Network, still wearing the crown for the largest hack in crypto history, stumbled into another exploit. This time, the damage was $12 million, a far cry from the $624 million heist of 2022, but no less embarrassing for a project that should have learned its lesson. It's as if the Ronin team decided to reboot their horror franchise with a low-budget sequel that nobody asked for. As the saying goes, ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" But what do we say when a project gets fooled twice by similar oversights? Perhaps it's time for a new adage: ""Hack me once, shame on the attacker. Hack me twice, shame on my operational security."" Like a digital Paul Revere, Chaofan Shou was the first to sound the alarm on X, alerting everyone that once again, the Ronin bridge was under attack. Unlike their previous six-day delayed reaction, this time Ronin was a little quicker on the draw. Psycheout.ron, COO of Ronin, responded shortly after the exploit was detected. ""The Ronin Network bridge has been paused while we investigate a report from whitehats about a potential MEV exploit. The bridge currently secures over $850M which is safe."" Approximately three hours later, the official Ronin Network account confirmed the exploit , stating that white hats had alerted them and the bridge was paused 40 minutes after the first on-chain action was spotted. They revealed that the attackers had withdrawn just under 4K ETH and 2M USDC, valued at around $12M, which was the maximum single transaction withdrawal limit , a safeguard that prevented further damage. As with many crypto heists, the devil was in the details, or in this case, in the upgrade process. Verichains highlighted the root cause of this exploit , a failure to properly initialize a critical parameter during a contract upgrade. Following is how it unfolded. The Fateful Upgrade: On August 6, the Ronin team deployed an update to their bridge manager , moving from version 2 to 4. This upgrade introduced a new implementation contract, MainchainGatewayV3 , which was deployed just 6 days prior. The Ronin upgrade hub shows the changes in this new implementation, including modifications to how the contract handles operator weights and withdrawal submissions. The Critical Oversight: In their haste, they called the initializeV4 function but neglected to call initializeV3. This seemingly minor oversight would prove costly. The Unintended Consequence: The _totalOperatorWeight variable was left uninitialized, defaulting to zero. This meant that the minimumVoteWeight parameter, crucial for cross-chain verification, was effectively disabled. The Exploit: With security checks effectively disabled, the vulnerability was ripe for exploitation. An MEV bot identified the vulnerability and front-ran any potential manual exploit attempts, executing the attack and directing the funds to its own address. The Damage Control: Thanks to a daily withdrawal limit, an additional $72 million was saved from being pilfered. The Ronin team managed to pause the contract about 38 minutes after the exploit began. In a surprising turn of events, the stolen funds were swiftly returned, thanks to lightning-fast MEV white hats who outpaced potential malicious actors. The ETH, valued at approximately $10 million, was promptly sent back to the Ronin team . The remaining USDC was returned shortly after. In recognition of their vigilance and integrity, the Ronin team announced a $500,000 bounty for the white hat hackers involved. Ronin also stated that the bridge will undergo an audit before reopening, with Ronin aiming to shift its operation away from the current structure. A post-mortem is scheduled for next week, promising deeper insights into the technical details and planned preventive measures. This incident highlights the double-edged sword of upgradeable contracts and the critical importance of meticulous implementation. Ronin's oversight turned a routine upgrade into a $12 million lesson in humility. How many more wake-up calls can a project survive before users decide it's time to cross a different bridge? Despite their improved response time, Ronin's failure to properly implement and test their latest upgrade reveals a project still stumbling over basic security practices. They dodged a bullet thanks to the fortuitous intervention of MEV white hats, but luck isn't a sustainable security strategy. For a project that's already suffered the largest hack in crypto history, this near-miss should be a final wake-up call. It's time to prioritize rigorous security measures over hasty upgrades. Moving forward, Ronin and indeed all blockchain projects should do the following: Always implement thorough tests for contract upgrades. Collaborate with auditors to verify correct deployment. Be cautious with the Initializable contract from OpenZeppelin, understanding its potential pitfalls. Ronin Network wobbles precariously between redemption and infamy. In an ecosystem where reputation is as volatile as the assets it secures, how many near-misses can a project survive before users decide to seek safer shores?

Compounder Finance - REKT,12000000,12/02/2020,out of scope,https://rekt.news/deathbed-confessions-c3pr/,"Compounder Finance -  Wednesday, December 2, 2020 c3pr - audit - rugpull read this article also in : en - es - fr - zh The rekt reaper has a way of making people talk. In the final moments, as TVL approaches zero, and the drawdown becomes unbearable, a faceless figure enters the chat. When a protocol is wounded beyond repair, and it’s time has come to shuffle off this mortal coil, the fourth and final horseman arrives to guide them to the afterlife, presenting himself in .gif format. Compounder.finance was rug pulled for over $12,000,000. In our volatile community, greed and desperation are punished and rewarded in equal yet unpredictable ways. Here there is hope for the sinner, whose transgressions are forgotten as they escape down-chain in their cloak of anonymity. Rekt is here to shine a light on the sinful - to expose their methods so that we all can learn. The compounder.finance site and Twitter account were deleted instantly. A completed security audit offered our detectives the only lead. These are busy times at RektHQ , a few hours had already passed when we started to investigate… When we contacted the auditors for a quote, they were less than pleased to see us. Please don’t send death shit like that, you for real had me scared for my safety for a minute over here and weaker hands might report that or some shit. After our detective offered some reassurance, Solidity.finance provided us with the full chat logs of their conversation with compounder.finance. Other victims also reached out to us, showing early conversations with compounder admins where they voiced their concerns. Solidity.finance told us that they had only briefly spoken with the admins, and although they had indeed audited the contract, they had stated in the document that although the pools were treasury controlled by a timelock, that the timelock offered no protection. The following message is from their chat logs. At this stage in our investigation, solidity.finance was still a suspect. We wanted to know why they had thought that the compounder.finance team seemed ”very trustworthy” When reading the chat logs, we noticed that although the accounts had been deleted, one username remained - “keccak”. Although solidity.finance said keccak had deleted their account, we had already found their account and were trying to make contact. Unfortunately, Vlad didn’t want to talk on the phone, so we sent them a message, not expecting him to respond. Until… Vlad was ready to talk. Unfortunately, he wasn’t very cooperative. Vlad / keccak can still be reached on Telegram via @keccak, however he no longer responds, and has since deleted the images on his account.
We attach his old avatars here for your consideration and investigation. We have been informed that - The wolf one is from a famous Ukrainian cartoon in Russian, which says “come by if something comes up” The left one is a anti-nuclear-weapon poster. Not much help for the affected users unfortunately. Once it became clear Vlad wouldn’t talk, we visited the official Compounder telegram group, where it became apparent that our reputation precedes us. As we scrolled through the content of the chat, we saw all the typical behaviours that are caused by a freshly pulled rug. Even large players are humbled by the power of a rug pull. This group leader lost $1,000,000 and has opened his own investigation group (686 members) in an attempt to have some revenge. The thread can be found here . The Statistics As part of our investigation, we introduced Solidity.finance to @vasa_develop from Stake Capital and asked them to work together to create a full post-mortem of the incident. The following data is taken from their report . Assets Rugged (8): 8,077.540667 Wrapped Ether ($4,820,030.07) 1,300,610.936154161964594323 yearn: yCRV Vault ($1,521,714.80) 0.016390153857154838 Compound (COMP) ($1.79) 105,102,172.66293264 Compound USDT ($2,169,782.85) 97,944,481.39815207 Compound USD Coin ($2,096,403.68) 1,934.23347357 Compound Wrapped BTC ($744,396.89) 23.368131489683158482 Aave Interest bearing YFI ($628,650.174379401) 6,230,432.06773805 Compound Uniswap ($466,378.99) Wallets with the funds after rug-pull 0x944f214a343025593d8d9fd2b2a6d43886fb2474 1,800,000 DAI 0x079667f4f7a0b440ad35ebd780efd216751f0758 5,066,124.665456504419940414 DAI 39.05381415 WBTC 4.38347845834390477 CP3R 0.004842656997849285 COMP 0.000007146621650034 UNI-V2 From the time the Deployer was first funded via Tornado.cash to the time of the rug pull, the Deployer sent ETH to 7 different addresses. Most of these were one-off payments. One of these addresses , however, received 4 separate payments on Nov 19th, 20th, 22nd, and 23rd. Much of the funds from that address ended up an another address holding over 1 million KORE (Only 10k KORE existed before they rug pulled). The main culprit(s) of this hack were the 7 malicious Strategy contracts that were added to the codebase after the audit. A non-malicious withdraw() function from a Strategy contract looks something like this. Notice that we have some checks like: These checks were missing in the 7 malicious Strategy contracts. This allows the Controller contract (which was controlled by the rug-puller strategist ) to withdraw the assets from the Strategy. (Note the missing checks below in the malicious withdraw function) The complete rug-pull can be explained in 4 steps. Step 1 Compounder.Finance: Deployer deployed 7 Malicious Strategies with manipulated withdraw() functions. Step 2 Compounder.Finance: Deployer Set and Approve 7 Malicious Strategies in StrategyController via Timelock (24h) transactions. Step 3 Compounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) called inCaseStrategyTokenGetStuck() on StrategyController which abuse the manipulated withdraw() function of the Malicious Strategies to transfer the tokens in the Strategies to the StrategyController. Do this for all 7 Malicious Strategies. Step 4 Compounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) called inCaseTokensGetStuck() on the StrategyController which transfers the tokens from the StrategyController to the Compounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) address. Now the Compounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) has full control over 8 assets valued at $12,464,316.329. From here the assets have been transferred to multiple addresses listed here . Excellent work from @vasa_develop . If you are a whistleblower, cyber sleuth or Etherscan detective and you have something to contribute, contact us. Judgement Day: Who is to blame? After our analysis, we know it’s not the auditors, who dutifully completed their task, making sure that Compounder Finance stayed safe from external attacks, while also voicing their concerns in their audit report and the TG chat . Perhaps they could have voiced these concerns slightly louder, but in the end, the ultimate responsibility will always lie with the depositor. Compounder.finance used a timelock as an indicator that they wouldn’t pull the rug. We know now that this method can’t be trusted. If it is used, an automated alert system or dashboard should be put in place to monitor transactions at that address. 24 hours appears to be insufficient to provide enough warning for users to remove funds. Not all projects with anonymous founders are scams. This entire industry was founded by an anon. However, nearly all scams are projects with anonymous founders. As a community, we need to be wary of these projects; especially those who use untraceable sources of funds like Tornado.cash. The mere existence of an audit report is not sufficient to assure a projects' safety or legitimacy. Audits often focus on risks from external attackers more than internal - perhaps this is an area where auditors need to improve. Even with audits, timelocks and burnt keys, depositors are always at the mercy of other users, who may dump huge amounts of tokens onto the market at any time. Solidity.Finance: The Official Statement The Compounder team swapped the safe/audited Strategy contracts and replaced them with malicious 'Evil Strategy' contracts that allowed them to steal users funds. They did this through a public, though clearly unmonitored,  24-hour timelock. This issue of centralized control by the C3PR team was raised in our audit report and our discussions with their team. The team had the power to update strategy pools and they did so maliciously here to steal users’ funds. In an effort to be transparent, anyone can view our chat logs with the C3PR team here: Historically, our audits have focused on the risks to projects from external attackers, with some discussion on risks posed by project teams as we did here. We will take this unfortunate event as a learning opportunity, and moving forward will provide more robust details in easy to understand language on risks stemming from developers’ control. We all know we should read smart contracts before we invest, but the knowledge barrier is high. Not everyone knows what to look for, and those who do are not incentivised to share their findings. In the case of C3PR, users who listened were made aware of the danger very early on, and the code that made the rugpull possible was always present. Despite this, over $12,000,000 accumulated in the contract, which can now be labelled as one of the largest rug pulls of all time.

"Agave DAO, Hundred Finance - REKT",11700000,03/15/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/agave-hundred-rekt/,"Agave DAO, Hundred Finance -  Tuesday, March 15, 2022 Agave - Hundred -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh Two forks met the same fate. Agave DAO , (an Aave fork) , and Hundred Finance , (a Compound fork) , both fell victim to the same reentrancy attack. 2116 ETH ($5.5M) was lost from Agave, and 2363 ETH ($6.2M) from Hundred Finance, giving a total of $11.7M stolen by the anonymous attacker. This is the first attack we’ve seen on the Gnosis (xDai) chain, and the first time we’ve seen two protocols be directly targeted like this. However, considering the structure of DeFi today, the double damage is not surprising. Forks upon forks create a house of cards. If the code is copied and pasted, vulnerabilities can open up where they're least expected. When one fork falls, all others have to check their foundations. Credit: Daniel Von Fange and Mudit Gupta The attacks were made possible due to the design of the xDAI token which contains the function callAfterTransfer() creating a reentrancy vulnerability. Using flash loans as initial collateral, the attacker(s) nested additional borrow functions inside one another, increasing the amount borrowed before the protocol could update the debt balance. Repeating this process led to borrowing assets worth far more than the collateral supplied. The attack vector is the same as in the $18.8M case of CREAM Finance last August. Agave DAO Exploit tx (March-15-2022 11:25:40 AM +1 UTC) The stolen funds were then sent to the attacker’s ETH address and after a few hours 2116 ETH ($5.5M) were sent to Tornado Cash. Hundred Finance Exploit tx (March-15-2022 11:28:40 AM +1 UTC) The stolen funds were then sent to the attacker’s ETH address and after a few hours 2363 ETH ($6.2M) were sent to Tornado Cash. While the price of HND hasn’t suffered too badly from the news, AGVE plunged >20%. Forking strong code is not enough to ensure security after changes are made. The idiosyncrasies of each new environment bring new threats. In this case, the Gnosis (xDai) design revealed hidden dangers not considered when porting the protocols from Ethereum. Though both projects are forks from foundational DeFi protocols (Aave and Compound), the original projects have strict vetting in place to avoid allowing tokens with reentrancy vulnerabilities to be used as collateral. Additionally, as Mudit Gupta pointed out, following a “checks-effects-interactions pattern” is another way to mitigate such attacks from taking place. Another entry on our leaderboard (#35) , and another lesson learned the hard way.

PrismaFi - REKT,11600000,03/28/2024,PrismaFi,https://rekt.news/prismafi-rekt/,"PrismaFi -  Thursday, March 28, 2024 PrismaFi -  read this article also in : en PrismaFi, the self-described end game for liquid restaking, is the first restaking platform to be gamed. PrismaFi fell victim to a flash loan attack, resulting in a loss of 3258 wstETH tokens, valued at approximately $11.6 million. Cyvers caught the exploit quickly on March 28th, alerting PrismaFi to check their TroveManager contract. PrismaFi commented soon after , informing the community that Core engineering contributors will pause the protocol and investigate. Soon after , PrismaFi instructed vault owners to disable delegate approvals. Around 4 hours later, PrismaFi announced that the protocol was paused by the emergency multisig and the remaining funds are safe. They also stated mkUSD and ULTRA, as stablecoins, are overcollateralized and are not at risk. Decurity detected a copy-cat exploit that someone deployed, but not yet used. The market has been waking up from its extended winter, but with that, the attacks are increasing. PrismaFi is a fork of the Liquity Protocol , with some changes to the code. Liquity claims the exploit on Prisma is not replicable on Liquity. With restaking being a hot trend lately and this being the first exploit on a restaking protocol, could restaking exploits become a hot trend as well? Credit: Cyvers , Prisma Finance , Decurity , ExVul , Nick Franklin According to ExVul's root cause analysis , the exploit occurred due to a vulnerability in the MigrateTroveZap contract. This contract is designed to automate the migration process between different versions of Trove Managers for the same collateral. The contract's onFlashloan() function lacked proper input validation, allowing the attacker to manipulate input data. By doing so, the attacker could trigger the closeTrove and openTrove functions on arbitrary addresses, even those not owned by the attacker. In the exploit transaction, the attacker targeted a specific address and closed its trove, resulting in the MigrateTroveZap contract being refunded with 1745 wstETH. Subsequently, the attacker opened a new trove, spending 463 wstETH. After the onFlashloan callback execution, around 1282 wstETH remained in the MigrateTroveZap contract. The attacker then opened their own trove and called MigrateTroveZap to migrate it, using the remaining 1282 wstETH for their own trove. Finally, the attacker closed the trove and extracted the profits from the exploit. The exploiter was able to gain $11.6M after several successful attacks.

PrismaFi has indicated further steps will include a Post-Mortem and attempts to retrieve funds. No word on a timeline. There were 3 audits conducted, MixBytes in September 2023, Nomoi in early 2024 and Zellic in July of 2023. Since the MigrateTroveZap contract migration was within the past week, there is no word on this particular contract being audited recently. With a trail of audits in its wake, PrismaFi's MigrateTroveZap contract may have slipped through the cracks. Do you think PrismaFi did their due diligence? In the high-stakes world of DeFi, even the ""end game"" can be gamified. The PrismaFi exploit marks the first known attack on a restaking protocol, possibly opening Pandora's box for future incidents. A part of the story may have yet to unfold, the copy-cat exploit someone deployed, but have yet to use. Could this be foreshadowing? As restaking platforms gain traction, the DeFi community must stay sharp, prioritizing security and constant vigilance against emerging threats. The PrismaFi incident serves as another cautionary tale, reminding us that hype and growth can attract bad actors and vigilantes eager to exploit vulnerabilities. Granted, new innovations come from experimenting, but trial running in real time, with real funds, as opposed to doing everything possible in a testing environment is a dangerous game. As we chase innovation, maybe we are gambling too much with the security of users' funds. Will we learn from our mistakes or continue to play Russian Roulette with our digital fortunes?

Over two years since its first leaderboard entry , Yearn has landed back on rekt.news having lost over $10M. Considered by many as one of DeFi’s most reliable, secure platforms, Yearn made it’s name by offering some of the sector’s simplest farming opportunities. The immutable yUSDT contract that was attacked was deployed over three years ago, back when Yearn was Andre Cronje’s iearn finance. While the strategy was superceded by newer versions, plenty of funds still remained in the original contract. Later Yearn vault contracts are not affected . Despite a last-minute warning on Twitter, immutable contracts can’t be saved. Team member storming0x acknowledged the attack before Yearn reassured users that current contracts were unaffected. 1156 days to spot a multimillion dollar vulnerability in one of DeFi’s longest established protocols. How did it take so long? Credit: Samczsun , OtterSec , SlowMist The attacker exploited a misconfiguration in the iearn yUSDT token contract . The token generated yield via an underlying basket of yield-bearing tokens, including USDT positions on Aave, Compound, DYDX and BzX’s Fulcrum. However, since launch, the yUSDT has contained what appears to be a copy/paste error whereby the Fulcrum USDC address was used instead of the Fulcrum USDT contract. The exploiter was able to take advantage of the misconfiguration to vastly manipulate the underlying share prices of yUSDT, and mint a large quantity (1.2 quadrillion) of yUSDT using just 10k USDT. Theori’s junomon.eth provided the step-by-step analysis: Exploiter address 1: 0x5bac20beef31d0eccb369a33514831ed8e9cdfe0 Exploiter address 2: 0x16af29b7efbf019ef30aae9023a5140c012374a5 Exploiter address 3: 0x6f4a6262d06272c8b2e00ce75e76d84b9d6f6ab8 Attack transaction 1: 0xd55e43c1… Attack transaction 2: 0x8db0ef33… The minted yUSDT was then swapped for other stables totalling $11.4M, BlockSec provided the following breakdown: The attacker was funded via Tornado Cash and redeposited 1000 ETH for laundering. At the time of writing, the first two exploiter addresses contain approximately $1.5M of assets each, and address 3 contains 7.4M DAI. Certik conducted an audit of iearn finance in Feb 2020, however it appears that only the yDAI contract was investigated. The test in prod attitude, Cronje’s preferred method, has been responsible for plenty of incidents, providing much of rekt.news’ early content. Generally, though, new protocols and features got rekt within hours or days, not years… In the wake of each attack, a decentralised monopoly began to grow. The wider Cronje-verse has experienced enough incidents to have its own leaderboard, as we discussed after CREAM Finance was hacked for the second time, in October 2021. Despite the significant losses, it’s lucky that this case only affected an old and deprecated strategy, and didn’t threaten the $450M of TVL across current Yearn strategies.

This latest attack makes the Curve knock-off take their second position (#43) on our leaderboard , much higher than their rekt.news debut in January of last year. Despite claiming that “user funds are safe”, Saddle later clarified they were only referring to the amount that was not stolen. rekt.news can clarify that the $11 million that was stolen, is definitely not safe. Credit: SlowMist and PeckShield The funds were taken from the protocol’s sUSDv2 metapool in which Synthetix’ sUSD is paired with saddleUSD-V2 LP tokens (from the DAI, USDC, USDT pool). The exploit was possible due to a bug in an old version of the MetaSwapUtils library which doesn’t use a VirturalPrice to calculate the value of the LP token during metapool swaps. The issue had been fixed in the current version , but the swap calculation was still using the old version. The hacker made a series of flash loan assisted sUSD/saddleUSD-V2 swaps in the metapool, manipulating the price of the LP token which could then be swapped back for more sUSD. Exploiter’s address, initially funded via Tornado Cash: 0x63341b… Main hack tx for (3375 ETH): 0x2b023d… Second hack tx (for 557 ETH): 0xe7e047… BlockSec whitehat tx for (1357 ETH): 0x9549c0… Though funds have begun to move through Tornado Cash, at the time of writing, the majority remains in the exploiter’s address. In November of last year, Saddle published a report on the vulnerability after a $8.2M near-miss for Synapse protocol who were using some Saddle code. BSC-based nerve.fi were also hit via the same attack vector. The resulting fix to the MetaSwapUtils library was made in December but, apparently, the code wasn’t implemented into metapool swaps properly. Saddle forking Curve: if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

Value DeFi - REKT 3,11000000,05/07/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/value-rekt3/,"Value DeFi -  3 Saturday, May 8, 2021 Value DeFi -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh Twice in one week. Value DeFi is a trainwreck. Six months ago they lost $7M. Three days ago they lost $10M. Now they’ve lost another $11M. Brutal, savage, rekt. The “co-founder” was a paid actress , the code was copied and used incorrectly, and as a result, Value DeFi has been absolutely taken down . Is this the third and final time, or will the apes continue to forgive and forget? What went so wrong with Value DeFi? Approximately $11 million was stolen from the vSwap AMM vSwap pools. The incident was due to the improper use of a complex exponentiation power() function behind the calculation and enforcement of the weighted constant product invariant. Any pool which did not have its liquidity split 50/50 between assets was exploited. Since Uniswap only supports pools with a 50/50 asset ratio, Value DeFi used the Bancor formula for their non-standard pools. Reference Transaction: 0x2fd0aaf0bad8e81d28d0ee6e4f4b5cbba693d7d0d063d1662653cdd2a135c2de 1. First of all, the attacker sends a small amount of a second token to pair addresses 2. They then make a swap in which they want to withdraw a small amount of the first token and a large amount of the second token. 3. Due to incorrect use of the Bancor formula, the pair contracts consider the swap to be successful. (root of exploit) Stolen funds: 15k BNB 2.7k FARM 1.7k BASv2 8.5M BDO 68.3k BUSD 41.4k MDG 945k VBOND 1.2M BAC 11k FIRO Credit: frankresearcher Note the power() routine takes four arguments (baseN, baseD, expN, and expD) and is used to calculate an integer approximation of (baseN/baseD)^(expN/expD)*(2^precision) where precision is used for the calculated result. However, there is a caveat in how this power() function should be used. It makes an explicit assumption that baseN must be no less than baseD, i.e., baseN >= baseD. In this attack, the pool’s swap() function is called with a crafted input that intentionally violates the above assumption. As a result, the weighted constant product enforcement is passed while the pool funds are being drained. Credit: peckshield Despite achieving their third place on our leaderboard , the native token of Value DeFi has recovered somewhat since the latest exploit. However, Nansen shows us that the DEX volume has been decreasing consistently. Will another rebrand save the most hacked protocol from losing all their users, or is this the end for Value DeFi? The Value DeFi team were reassuring users of the safety of their platform only hours before the latest exploit, tweeting about increased security measures which clearly had zero impact. Going forward, it’s hard to see how anyone could trust the anonymous developers, who admitted to using a paid actress on fiverr to play the role of their founder, and when they were confronted about it by a user, responded with something similar to; The girl we caption as our co-founder in that video is actually just a paid actress, but one of our devs happened to go by that online alias, so then we coincidentally tracked down an actress by that same name on Fiverr to feature in our video! Ape tax is high for users of Value DeFi, the least secure DeFi protocol. Who can have any sympathy for users of such blatant low quality projects? We’re very thankful for all the new readers that Value DeFi has brought us over the recent months, but hopefully this will be the last time. Although we ridicule the repetitive failures of the founders, these are not their funds that are being stolen. If they plan to continue their operations, then they will have to try much harder. Instead of focusing on fake communications, focus on real users safety, not piling up worthless security audits. Or maybe it’s time to call it quits and stop putting users funds at risk. Can Value DeFi close their operations safely, or will we soon see a final exit scam?

The extreme power of flash loans makes blue chips fade to black. An arbitrage attack on the Yearn DAI v1 vault shows that even our most experienced developers can still make mistakes. The vault was attacked using 9 flash loans. $11 million was lost from the vault, $2.7m of which went to the attacker, $3.5m went to Curve liquidity providers, $3.5m went to Curve stakers, and $1.4m was paid in Aave v2 fees. DeFi systems are in constant flux. Increasingly intertwined protocols create an infinite machine with countless moving parts. The development of our industry moves at breakneck speed, and new ideas and potential attack vectors are uncovered everyday. A constantly changing environment means even time tested products can’t guarantee absolute security. Falling victim to an arbitrageur must be humiliating for the team who were once seen as unbeatable, but there is no pleasure to be taken from pointing out flaws in the work of developers who create so much value in our field. The Yearn team have issued their version of a post-mortem, although flashloans are not mentioned. Igor Igamberdiev gave a more detailed analysis of the attack on Twitter. Attacker profit: - 513k DAI - 1.7M USDT - remaining 506k 3CRV (~$1) The attacker executed 11 transactions. 1/ Flash loaned 116k ETH from dYdX 2/ Flash loaned 99k ETH from Aave v2 3/ Borrow 134M USDC and 129M DAI using ETH as collateral on Compound 4/ Add 134M USDC and 36M DAI to 3crv Curve pool 5/ Withdraw 165M USDT from 3crv Curve pool 6/ Repeat five times - Deposit 93M DAI to yDAI vault (less w/ each time) - Add 165M USDT to 3crv pool - Withdraw 92M DAI from yDAI vault (less w/ each time) - Withdraw 165M USDT from 3crv pool 7/ In the last time withdraw 39M DAI and 134M USDC instead USDT 8/ Repay Compound debts 9/ Repay flash loans Each time the attacker had more 3crv tokens, which he was later able to swap for stablecoins. Attacker contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x62494b3ed9663334e57f23532155ea0575c487c5Attac Tornado TX #1 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7ee28e342573ff7b8fb4bd2e4373e742cf80d8f8c7f8764cc6b70439dc33f037 Tornado TX #2 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x13c12895d44f8b890af2187b93b97bec01dd34eeb026ac9669d8412e57d64446 Tornado TX #3 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b07e3faaa419ea5a3d58929e07b872f8529441064eb576d61ef5edd697f7256 Tornado TX #4 https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcacdc95bd65556426bae39025ddb1deafb65acb908be49fb7186bb750f7a369f The profit opportunity was created because the withdrawal fee had been turned off for vault migration. Readers will know there’s nothing new about flash loan attacks , and so will Yearn developers, who are competent enough to have prevented this from happening, suggesting this was just an opportunist taking advantage of a mistake made during the vault migration. Gossip and drama remains high in the DeFi community; and many considered this attack to be a reprisal for Cronje’s earlier accusations of hypocrisy against Julien Bouteloup; one of the contributors to Stake DAO. Although many of our readers (and your anonymous author) would secretly enjoy watching such a battle between the two developers, these accusations were proven to be false as the attackers account was funded and the contract written hours before this criticism was made. As two of the most prominent developers in our industry, there is bound to be some competition. Passion for their work and the responsibility of tying your reputation to code housing hundreds of millions of dollars puts working relationships under huge amounts of stress. It’s also worth remembering that not all of our best developers are on Twitter. If a DeFi protocol receives refunds from a centralised company, at what point does it stop being DeFi? Tether has frozen 1.7M USDT that was stolen during the hack. In the past, Tether has reimbursed users who mistakenly lost money by sending tokens to the contract address. If Tether burns these stolen tokens and mints the equivalent in order to return the funds to Yearn, then they are no different to any central bank. Yearn developer @fubuloubu has spoken out against the use of Tether in the past, but seems to have changed his mind after their intervention. We all love decentralisation when it brings us profit, but refunds are best served centralised. This attack went straight to the heart of one of the biggest DeFi conglomerates, shaking the foundations of what was once seen as an impenetrable fortress. Even the best in the business make mistakes, but this should not deter us from encouraging them to build. When tensions are high and DeFi teams begin to take sides against one another, we would all do well to zoom out and look at the bigger picture. We build weapons against traditional finance . We should not oppress the flow of innovation by fighting amongst ourselves, when the real fight is us vs them . Eventually we will look back on this period with nothing but respect for all those who shared the vision at such an early stage Last night, the first crack appeared in Yearn’s armour. Will their mistake make the community lose their faith, or can we all rally behind this giant of DeFi, and help them to grow even stronger?

Rug pulls are common on Binance Smart Chain. We’re only mentioning this one because it was larger than most. ~$10 million taken, and no advanced attack techniques in sight. Arbix Finance labelled themselves as an arbitrage-focused project on BSC, in which users could deposit into single-asset vaults in order “to gain optimal yield with low risk”. However, their users got the opposite. Starting around 3 AM +UTC on Jan 4th, the project drained the vaults of users’ funds and deleted their website , Twitter and Telegram accounts. Around $10M in user’s assets were drained directly from the vaults into this wallet , beginning with ~$1M in BTCB. Also stolen were: $920k Binance-pegged ETH $2.25M in BSC-USD $1.7M BUSD $1.4M CAKE $1M BSC-USDC As well as lesser amounts of ADA, DOT, DOGE, LINK, XRP and WBNB. In addition to the vault funds, on the 10th December this address minted 4.5M ARBX . Once the rug pull had begun, these tokens were dumped via PancakeSwap, tanking the price from $1.42 to ~$0.00. The ~$50k in proceeds were then sent to the main rug wallet. Funds were sent from the BSC wallet: 0x4714a26e4e2e1334c80575332ec9eb043b61a2c4 To Ethereum: 0x4714a26e4e2e1334c80575332ec9eb043b61a2c4 And from there, converted into ~2.5k ETH (currently worth ~$9.9M), then sent to 0xdc85c1eb22b0ece7be559a83fd788fe57f5a7a9f . Despite providing the project’s audit in November of last year, and marking all major or critical issues as resolved, Certik decided to publish a basic incident analysis.

Rari Capital - REKT,10000000,05/08/2021,Quantstamp,https://rekt.news/rari-capital-rekt/,"Rari Capital -  Saturday, May 8, 2021 Rari Capital -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh Young blood and new money. After a quick break for lunch, it was Rari Capitals turn to get rekt. The youthful yield aggregator has fallen victim to a serial attacker, as the same wallet which attacked Value DeFi only hours before, turned their eyes onto the Rari Capital ETH pool , removing $10 million worth of ETH. Rari Capital has attracted attention due to the young age of their developers, causing the community to argue amongst themselves as to whether age is of much relevance when the whole DeFi industry is only 2 - 3 years old. Although some might say they “ had it coming ”, we take no pleasure in learning that people have lost their money. There are no developers with 10 years experience in DeFi system design, this is a meritocracy that depends on the skill and maturity of the person rather than the length of their CV. Each attack presents us with a valuable lesson, and we must study the techniques in order to build a safer future. We’re looking at the actions of a cross-chain killer, who used the blood money from Value DeFi to fuel their attack on Rari Capital. 5,346 BNB ($3.8M) were stolen and swapped to 1k ETH. The attacker’s actions on BSC were as follows: 1: Create a fake token and pool it with BNB on PancakeSwap in order to use Alpaca Finance. 2: Interact with Alpaca Finance, where when calling approve() for a fake token, a payload is called, which allows an attacker to use VSafe through Codex farm to get vSafeWBNB 3: Convert vSafeWBNB to WBNB 4: Transfer WBNB to Ethereum through Anyswap. Repeat 2x. The attack on Rari was as follows: 1: Create a fake token and pool with it on SushiSwap 2: Interact with Alpha Homora , where a payload is also called so that the attacker can get ibETH in the Rari ETH pool contract. 3: Convert ibETH to ETH in the Rari ETH pool. As a result, 2.9k ETH ($11.1M) was stolen, and another 1.7k ETH was at risk before the actions of the Rari team. The total profit from the two attacks was $15M in ETH. credit: frankresearcher The Rari Capital governance token $RGT fell sharply in price following the attack. The attacker decided to voice their opinion on the involved protocols, but it seems they had second thoughts, as they tried to cancel the transaction. However, they set the gas too low and the cancellation didn’t go through for 20 minutes, giving everyone time to see their message. Credit: banteg & dudesahn This attack technique was similar to the Evil Pickle Jar , one which looks likely to become even more common in the future. Even though various protocols were used, the same exploit mechanism was applied. Alpaca/Alpha, vSafe/Rari, PancakeSwap/SushiSwap - the interaction between them was built in such a way that the exploit was easily repeated on another chain. The interoperability between DeFi protocols is increasing, and the blurred lines make for even easier escape routes. In the roaring twenties, the ruthless are rewarded, and any prosecution seems unlikely. With so many other surface-level crimes in crypto, who’s going to try and prosecute someone for exploiting contracts where so many remain anonymous?

Value DeFi - REKT 2,10000000,05/05/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/value-rekt2/,"Value DeFi -  2 Thursday, May 6, 2021 Value DeFi -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh 2 for 1, that’s Value DeFi: The first protocol to feature twice on the rekt leaderboard . When we first covered Value in November of 2020, they had just lost $7,000,000 after bragging about their “flash loan protection”. Back then we learned that Value DeFi did not really know flash loan . Now they have lost another $10,000,000, and we find out that Value DeFi do not really know copy paste either, as they report the exploit was made possible due to losing a line of code by “human error” Ten million dollars lost due to basic mistakes by the team, yet the native token $VALUE barely dumped at all. The following analysis is taken from the official post-mortem. On May 5th 2021, 3:22 AM UTC, the exploiter re-initialized the pool and set the operator role to himself and _stakeToken to HACKEDMONEY. By doing so, the exploiter took control of the pool and called the method governanceRecoverUnsupported() and drained the original stake token (vBWAP/BUSD LP). The exploiter then removed 10,839.16 vBWAP/BUSD LP , then burned the LP tokens and received 7342.75 vBSWAP and 205,659.22 BUSD. The exploiter then sold all 7342.75 vBSWAP for 8790.77 BNB at 1inch. The exploiter used both BNB and BUSD to buy renBTC and used renBridge to move the funds back to BTC, sent to the following address: 1Cm6WGvXQ9EgvvWX5dRsBxE2NvxFjfbcVF The actions can be verified on-chain here . The affected pool contract had an initialize() function that should have been activated after deployment. The line: initialized = true ; is missing from the function. This meant anyone could re-initialize the pool and set themself as owner, thereby taking full control. As owner, the exploiter used the governanceRecoverUnsupported() , which is used for recovering pool funds in the event of a bug or undesired event. During set up of the profit-sharing vStake pool, the code was not written from scratch but migrated from the old implementation of the Value DeFi Reserve Fund, which had the correct setting. When merging the code, the line was not included. In the end, the hacker was the only one who got their value for their money, a ten million dollar prize without even taking out a loan. The Value DeFi team however, just got another spot on our leaderboard .

LiFi/Jumper - Rekt,9730000,07/16/2024,n/a,https://rekt.news/lifi-jumper-rekt/,"LiFi/Jumper - Rekt Tuesday, July 16, 2024 LiFi Protocol - Jumper Exchange -  read this article also in : en - es - zh Infinite approvals... the ultimate leap of faith strikes again. LiFi protocol lost $9.73M to an attack draining addresses that had previously approved infinite permissions to the protocol's contracts across multiple chains. Shortly after the alarm was raised by security firm CertiK , the LiFi team acknowledged the hack roughly an hour later . Jumper Exchange, which is powered by LiFi's services, also informed their users about the exploit and appears to be unaffected as of now . Both LiFi and Jumper urged users to check whether their addresses were affected and revoke approvals via revoke.cash . What's more concerning is that LiFi suffered from an almost identical exploit back in March 2022 , losing $600K from 29 wallets. Why did a known bug make it to production on a live protocol... again? Credit: CertiK , Nick L. Franklin , Peckshield , LiFi , Jumper Exchange , Rivanorth Five days is all it took for history to repeat itself. On July 11th, a new contract facet was added to the LiFi protocol. This new contract contained a vulnerable function that lacked proper validation. As Nick L. Franklin pointed out that the attack was due to a lack of validation in the ""swap"" function of the new contract facet added to the protocol. The vulnerable contract failed to properly check the call target and call data, allowing an exploiter to perform a ""call injection"" attack. This enabled the attacker to execute arbitrary functions using the permissions granted to the LiFi contract. Because of this, users who approved the contract for infinite approvals lost their tokens. LiFi router set this implementation recently: Attacker's address: 0x8B3Cb6Bf982798fba233Bca56749e22EEc42DcF3 Affected contract addresses: EVM Chains: 0x1231deb6f5749ef6ce6943a275a1d3e7486f4eae zkSync: 0x341e94069f53234fE6DabeF707aD424830525715 Linea: 0xDE1E598b81620773454588B85D6b5D4eEC32573e Metis: 0x24ca98fB6972F5eE05f0dB00595c7f68D9FaFd68 Funds stolen include USDT, USDC, and DAI totalling approximately $9.73M, which were subsequently swapped for 2,857 ETH. The stolen assets have been distributed to multiple wallets controlled by the attacker. As the $3.3M Socket protocol hack on January 16th shows, cross-chain bridges and aggregators continue to be prime targets for blackhats. Let me know if this sounds familiar? The Attacker targeted wallets that had granted infinite approvals to Socket contracts exploiting a recently added route to their bridging contract. Peckshield provided some further analysis on the hack and seen a direct parallel to the previous attack on LiFi: In the post-mortem of the previous exploit , LiFi stated “We then implemented a whitelist to only allow calls to approved DEXs. Our contract was upgraded to include this new whitelist functionality, and swaps were reenabled. On top of that, we have disabled infinite approvals by default.” No word on the most recent contract facet being audited. Looks like this fell between the cracks, proving once again that in DeFi, yesterday's patch is tomorrow's exploit. With millions at stake, how many more ""infinite approvals"" will it take before users stop playing Russian roulette with their assets? Infinite approvals: The gift that keeps on grifting. Despite LiFi's response that only wallets affected were set to infinite approvals and represented only a very small number of users, the magnitude of the loss suggests otherwise. It's hard to believe that so many users would be vulnerable if infinite approvals weren't commonplace. With nearly $10M stolen, this will have been a costly lesson in approvals hygiene for many. Without a regular revoking detox using a tool such as revoke.cash , token approvals sit waiting for a live (or forgotten) project to be exploited. However, all this could have simply been avoided by not making risky, unaudited upgrades to an existing protocol contract. Infinite approvals to upgradeable contracts should come with warnings by every wallet Maybe it's time to start questioning those ""infinite"" permissions. Have you checked your approvals lately?

zkLend - Rekt,9570000,02/11/2025,N/A,https://rekt.news/zklend-rekt/,"zkLend - Rekt Friday, February 14, 2025 zkLend - Rekt - Starknet read this article also in : en Looks like someone skipped math class at zero-knowledge school. zkLend just learned the hard way that fancy cryptography can't save you from basic arithmetic. Whether you call it a rounding error or precision loss, the result is the same—zkLend got drained for $9.57M by an attacker who knew exactly where to find the mathematical weak spot. While their devs were busy flexing Starknet integration, someone walked in and started printing money with a calculator. Over 2,200 ETH, along with USDC, STRK, and USDT, vanished faster than a dev’s promises during a rugpull—totaling $9.57M. Starknet's latest ""secured by math"" narrative just got an expensive reality check. When your protocol bleeds $9.57M because someone remembered their grade school decimals, maybe it's time to dust off that calculator? Credit: zkLend , Starkware , CertiKAlert , SlowMist , coincu , Vitalik Buterin , Cos zkLend broke the news themselves on February 11th - at least they could spot a catastrophe after it happened. StarkWare's damage control squad swooped in the next morning with the classic ""not our circus, not our monkeys"" defense - core tech intact, just the application layer bleeding millions. CertiKAlert started peeled back the layers on the exploit mechanics - revealing how our mathematical mastermind turned a single lending_accumulator variable into their personal money printer. The exploit showcases precise mathematical manipulation - starting with a single wei deposit into an empty market. Our mathematical virtuoso spotted a gaping hole in zkLend's token accounting - their lending_accumulator was about as precise as a drunk darts player. Using flash loans like a financial accordion, they squeezed the lending_accumulator from 1.0 to 851.0 in a single transaction. Each loan repayment inflated the number further, until it hit the magic target: 4.069297906051644020. By manipulating this accumulator to 4.069297906051644020 (because who doesn't love a good 18-decimal precision number?), they created their own money printer. Deposit 4.069297906051644021 wstETH, get 2 wei back, then withdraw 6.103946859077466029 wstETH - spending just 1 wei in the process. The attacker turned this numerical sleight-of-hand into a $9.57M payday, proving that sometimes the biggest exploits don't need fancy zero-day vulnerabilities - just a calculator and a keen eye for misplaced decimals. The attacker didn't drain zkLend manually—they deployed a custom attack contract to orchestrate the exploit. Through a series of flash loan transactions, they artificially inflated the lending accumulator to an extreme value, exploiting rounding errors to mint free tokens at will. Let's follow the money through their mathematical maze… Starknet Phase Attacker on Starknet: 0x04d7191dc8eac499bac710dd368706e3ce76c9945da52535de770d06ce7d3b26 Attack Contract: 0x0193da87dc0b317f8418ae0c8fb3e0301698ed2d1a4047191d4641ddabc1e2bf zkLend Market Targeted in Attack: 0x04c0a5193d58f74fbace4b74dcf65481e734ed1714121bdc571da345540efa05 Bridging to Ethereum Attacker Bridged 1801 ETH to Ethereum: 0xee7887af574928f92cc80384cd9febb41aa4f18c97133c974206f8a2b9baba09 Bridge Transaction on Ethereum: 0xe107aca6535c8b67356dfa2d741bb3d4c4374f558b58a70f8e34e4c1bf1328e7 Attacker on Ethereum: 0x645c77833833A6654F7EdaA977eBEaBc680a9109 While zkLend assembled their crisis management squad - their stolen funds took a scenic tour through Railgun's privacy mixer.

Six hours after the exploit , they slid the attacker an onchain message with the standard 10% white hat offer - return 3,300 ETH by 00:00 UTC on February 14th or we’ll prosecute you. The deadline passed without a response. Instead of returning the funds, the attacker sat tight while zkLend released their post-mortem - not through any professional channel, but via an unverified Google Drive link. The document makes bold claims of FBI and Homeland Security involvement, but like their security measures, their choice of platform raises eyebrows. When you're dealing with a $9.57M exploit, maybe skip the sketchy links and spring for a proper publication? Here's where things get interesting - according to SlowMist's in-depth analysis , on-chain evidence reveals the zkLend attacker is directly linked to the EraLend reentrancy exploit of July 2023 . Before hitting zkLend, the attacker used their Starknet address to test transactions with three Layer 1 Ethereum addresses. Starknet Address: 0x04d7191dc8eac499bac710dd368706e3ce76c9945da52535de770d06ce7d3b26 L1 ETH Addresses: 0xd95b3c1e638ce3cdc070ad6d4f385c61e2ee8662 0x93920786e0fda8496248c4447e2e082da69b6c40 0x34e5dc779cb705200e951239b6a89aaf5c7dbfc1 Two of these L1 addresses - 0x9392 and 0x34e5 - were previously used to receive funds from the EraLend attack. This isn't just a similar exploit - it's the same operator, back for seconds. While this specific wallet has been active since June 2024, earlier linked addresses show connections to EraLend’s exploiters, suggesting a repeat player with a familiar playbook. zkLend's post-mortem suggests the attacker's trail extends beyond EraLend , naming OnyxDAO, Yei Finance, Channels Finance, and Starlay Finance as previous targets. But while the EraLend connection is backed by verifiable on-chain evidence, these additional claims come without transaction links or proof. Until zkLend provides receipts, these connections remain speculative at best. zkLend was audited twice by Nethermind - once in May 2022 for their Cairo 0 contracts and again in September 2023 for Cairo 1. According to zkLend , ""no critical issues were found in either report."" But the fatal rounding error that cost them $9.57M somehow slipped through. The post-mortem describes it as three ""individually harmless"" design details that became lethal in combination - empty market deposits, accepted ""donations,"" and withdrawal rounding. Whether these issues existed during the audits or snuck in through later changes remains unclear - zkLend's Google Drive post-mortem conveniently skips that detail. But one thing's certain - ""audited"" doesn't mean ""invulnerable,"" especially when decimal points are involved. Between flawed math implementations and inadequate safeguards, zkLend's saga reads like a cautionary tale of what happens when you skip the basics in pursuit of the cutting edge. When a privacy mixer has better input validation than your protocol, maybe it's time to reconsider your priorities? Layer 2s were supposed to be crypto's promised land - where advanced math meets bulletproof security. Instead, we're watching protocols get rekt by the same basic arithmetic that trips up first-year coding students. zkLend's $9.57M stumble proves that even the fanciest zero-knowledge proof can't protect you from a misplaced decimal point. While Starknet's core tech remains unscathed, their ecosystem just got an expensive lesson in the basics. Perhaps it's time for DeFi protocols to spend less time flexing their L2 credentials and more time double-checking their math homework. The race to build the future of finance continues - calculator batteries not included. How many decimal places does it take to reach the bottom of DeFi's math class?

Cover - REKT,9400000,12/29/2020,Arcadia Group,https://rekt.news/cover-rekt/,"Cover -  Tuesday, December 29, 2020 cover - Rekt read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh Next time, take care of your own shit. Infinite mint but it’s no Willy Wonka - this is a Hollywood classic insurance themed noir. The black and white outcomes of insurance policies lend themselves well to Hollywood storylines. In Double Indemnity (1944), insurance is the motivating force for both good and evil. The film takes its name from a life insurance clause that offers double payouts if the death of the policyholder is accidental. This results in a twisting plot as an insurance salesman is roped into a murderous scheme by his lover, who wants him to murder her husband and frame it as an accident in order to profit from the payout. Never take anything at face value. DeFi plot lines are rarely straightforward. Anonymity and composability are the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy; there are multiple ways one can profit from a single incident, meaning smart players don’t always take the most obvious reward. $9.4m taken, $3.2m recovered and $6.2m lost. COVER (formerly known as SAFE) fell ~ 90% when an infinite mint loophole was uncovered and exploited, causing the total supply of tokens to increase by 48 quadrillion percent, from 84,477 to 40,796,131,214,802,600,000. Six different addresses minted COVER via this loophole before it was closed. Some kept the money, others did not. Of the six addresses to use the loophole, the previously unknown Grap Finance gained the most attention, as they took the opportunity to present themselves as a “White hat” by selling minted COVER for ETH and returning it with a sassy message. Code is law, but loopholes remain - we can rely on attackers to take advantage, but we know things are rarely as simple as they seem. Who had cover on their $COVER? We went undercover to find out. Rekt OPSEC The original attack had four steps and one attacker, but the story became more complicated once the loophole was made public , and other wallets replicated the process. The following timelines are taken from the official Cover Post-Mortem , for a more detailed analysis, please see the step by step from @vasa_dev . Timeline for Exploiter 1 Dec-28–2020 04:09:27 AM +UTC A new Balancer pool was added to the Blacksmith contract from the team’s multisig via a transaction for the new coverage expirations. Dec-28–2020 08:08:12 AM +UTC An attacker executes the first deposit to the contract , depositing 1,326,880 BPT tokens Dec-28–2020 at 08:11:16 AM +UTC The same attacker then called withdraw(), exploiting the contract for ~703.64 $COVER and withdrawing 1,326,878.99 BPT Dec-28–2020 08:47:15 AM +UTC The first sell of the exploited $COVER tokens can be found here . During this time there were multiple accounts abusing the exploit, and selling their $COVER on market. Dec-28–2020 09:18:28 AM +UTC The attacker continues minting while the attack vector is still present. In total, Exploiter 1 stole around $4.4 million of user funds and transferred it to this address . It seems the loophole was discovered accidentally at first, as exploiter 1 had poor OPSEC, a normal wallet funded by an exchange with KYC, trading for 3 years. Some claim to know the identity of this exploiter, and suggest that they return the funds. In a classic DeFi plot twist, the original attacker attracted little attention compared to Grap Finance, who seized the opportunity to play the role of “White Hat”. Timeline for Grap Finance Dec-28–2020 11:54:47 AM +UTC Grap Finance: Deployer (Externally owned account) deposited 15,255.552810089260015362 BPT (DAI/Basis pool) into the Blacksmith farming contract. Dec-28–2020 11:58:04 AM +UTC Grap Finance: Deployer withdraws their 15,255.552810089260015361 BPT (DAI/Basis pool), leaving just 1 wei in their balance in the Blacksmith farming contract. Dec-28–2020 11:58:56 AM +UTC Another user withdraws most of his full balance (1,007.599009946121991627 BPT) from the Blacksmith. Now Grap Finance alone has all liquidity for the DAI/Basis pool on the shield mining Blacksmith contract, exactly 1 wei. Dec-28–2020 12:00:21 PM +UTC Grap Finance: Deployer deposited back 15,255.552810089260015361 BPT (DAI/Basis pool) on the Blacksmith farming contract.. Dec-28–2020 12:02:04 PM +UTC Grap Finance: Deployer claimed the rewards , and because of only 1 wei of balance combined with the storage/memory issue this led to the minting of 40,796,131,214,802,500,000.212114436030863813 $COVER. Dec-28–2020 12:29:03 PM +UTC Grap Finance: Deployer starts to sell as many tokens as possible through 1inch.exchange in multiple transactions. Dec-28–2020 12:59:27 PM +UTC Grap Finance: Deployer burns minted tokens Dec-28–2020 at 01:41:01 PM +UTC Grap Finance: Deployer sends the 4351 ( 1 + 4350 ) ETH they have extracted by selling $COVER to the deployer account , which accounts for 34% of the total exploit damage ($9.4 million) Coverage from Cover It took six hours for Cover Protocol to publicly acknowledge the attack. The team is still investigating the current incident. The exploit is no longer possible. Please do NOT buy $COVER tokens, and remove your liquidity from the COVER/ETH pool on sushiswap. CLAIM/NOCLAIM balancer pools are unaffected Eight hours after the attack, Cover protocol announced their plan to refund affected users. Hello everyone, we are exploring providing a NEW $COVER token through a snapshot before the minting exploit was abused. The 4350 ETH that has been returned by the attacker will also be handled through a snapshot to the LP token holders.We are still investigating. Do NOT buy COVER “What is dead may never die” appears never more true than in DeFi . A fourth iteration of the Cover Protocol token will be issued to refund the affected users. SAFE - SAFE2 - COVER - $RECOVER? Persistence is admirable up to a certain extent, but when is enough enough? Some readers will remember the full history of Cover Protocol, who rebranded from SAFE after both @azeemfi and @chefcoverage made poor decisions. They then launched SAFE2, which was migrated to the COVER which we know today. Is the community is willing to give them a FOURTH opportunity? Grap Finance is a fork of YAM - who having failed to ship anything noteworthy during DeFi summer, jumped at the opportunity to gain attention by presenting themselves as a White Hat, which gained them thousands of followers in just one day. What they will do with this new found following remains to be seen. Grap Finance ’s unusual activity puts them within the top five balance changes for COVER within the last 7 days. They say there’s no such thing as bad publicity, and this seems to be confirmed by the next chart - unique addresses for COVER increased on the day of the attack by 1,778, as opportunist traders tried to catch a falling knife. Here we see Binance shown in green, a huge increase in COVER deposits as the community tried to jump ship before they eventually paused trading for the token. Responsible behaviour may not offer much reward, but wages of sin are always paid in full. Some say this was an insider job gone wrong. Perhaps the attackers got doxxed, couldn’t keep the funds, so sent them back and profited from promo instead. We don’t claim that these rumours are based in fact, but it’s easy to see how such ideas arise when the day's events lead to announcements such as this . Pure coincidence is out of the question , this is foul play or desperation. MXC must have fallen on hard times if they’re listing tokens based on gossip. Crypto Twitter has proven that their risk appetite remains strong by pumping the price of their “rescuers” token by several thousand percent, increasing its 24hr trading volume from $236 to $5,458,084 at the time of writing. Emiliano Bonassi provided the following quote: Setting a side the technical issue, this event showed again how this ecosystem is cohesive and supportive. We are antifragile. I am pretty sure that after this event not only a new Cover will emerge but more importantly a collective to guarantee safety and prompt reaction in the ecosystem - maybe The WhiteHack Group Blood is a big expense. The DeFi insurance market is in a sorry state. First NXM and now Cover. It doesn’t matter if the protocol is unaffected, if we have to write an article about you, then the user's confidence in your project has already gone. DeFi insurance must be fully comprehensive. Acts of god don’t happen here. Insecure protocols pay high premiums, while others work hard to build their no claims bonus. COVER went down 40x in 4 hours while $GRAP went up 40x. “No gains” say Grap team from behind their screen , a tall tale that tells half the truth.

dYdX - REKT,9000000,11/18/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/dydx-rekt/,"dYdX -  Monday, November 20, 2023 dYdX - YFI -  read this article also in : en Weekend wipeout. dYdX lost 40% of its v3's insurance fund ($9M) in a ‘ targeted attack ’ involving manipulation of Yearn’s YFI token. One exploit, two losers… …not to mention YFI’s holders. Alarm bells began to ring when YFI tanked by ~40% (after having pumped 2x in a week), wiping $200M off the token’s market cap and leaving the chart looking like a PnD memecoin. But, despite engagement-baiting chain-checkers jumping to conclusions , this wasn’t a case of insiders dumping. The brutal price action was, in fact, caused by liquidations of YFI longs looking to ride the pump on dYdX, who fell victim to what looks suspiciously like another ‘ highly profitable trading strategy ’. That didn’t end well last time, did it ? Credit: Antonio Juliano As it started to become clear what had happened, dYdX officially acknowledged the damage: Last night about $9m from the dYdX v3 insurance fund were used to fill gaps on liquidations processed in the YFI market. The v3 insurance fund remains well funded with $13.5m in funds remaining No user funds were affected and our team is working to investigate the event The incident was characterised as an attack by founder Antonio Juliano shortly after. A follow-up tweet elaborated on what had gone on behind the scenes: in the part few days $YFI open interest on dYdX spiked from $0.8m -> $67m basically all of this was driven one actor (traceable through on chain fund movements) this same actor attempted unsuccessfully to attack the dYdX $SUSHI market 2 weeks ago in a similar way $YFI OI was higher on dYdX than any other perp venue ... the $YFI price crash in the spot market seems like an intentional effort by a single actor (unsure whether the same or different one) to target the large OI on dYdX. We are still in communication with CEXs to confirm their understanding of this This information strongly makes me think this was an intentional market manipulation attempt by a well capitalized actor(s) designed to drain funds from the dYdX insurance pool The team appears to be confident that they’ll track down whoever is responsible, though, offering bounties to anyone who can provide info, but refusing to negotiate with the exploiter themself. Maybe the way things worked out for Avi has given dYdX a confidence boost? In response to the attack, dYdX have added extra margin requirements for lower liquidity tokens. However, the responses have provoked criticism for perceived hypocrisy and skirting decentralised decision-making. Not to worry, though, negative feedback “ doesn’t matter ”. While DEX code may be a case of set-and-forget, margin and lending protocols need constant tweaking in response to market conditions, and dYdX’s coming pivot to a standalone chain is set to feature full decentralisation. Governance may have its own flaws ( and weaknesses ), but decisions made behind closed doors usually don’t sit well with the community. However, when everyone gets their own say on risk management… …who’s to blame when things go wrong?

Punk Protocol - REKT,8950000,08/10/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/punkprotocol-rekt/,"Punk Protocol -  Friday, August 13, 2021 Punk Protocol -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh Punk is dead. On Aug 10th, Punk Protocol was hacked for $8.95M, ~$5M of which was later returned. The platform planned to offer a DeFi annuity scheme backed by ETH, WBTC and stablecoins. Because there’s nothing more “Punk” than a pension plan. Luckily, a whitehat was able to frontrun the transactions and return over half of the funds. But not without taking a million dollars for themselves. The project planned to use a Fair Launch to bring  $3M of deposits into 3 stablecoin pools: USDC, DAI and USDT. The Punk post-mortem details the vulnerability that led to the attack, and describes the root cause as a missing Modifier in the initialize() function within the CompoundModel code . The hacker used delegateCall() to replace what should have been the protocol’s forgeAddress with their own malicious contract , as a parameter of the CompoundModel’s initialize() function. The lack of an “initializer” Modifier meant that the manipulated function was executed despite being associated with an unknown (and in this case malicious) contract. With the contract address now updated, the attacker was then able to call withdrawToForge , sending the assets controlled by the CompoundModel directly to the malicious contract, and into their wallet. Although the withdrawal mechanisms are protected by the OnlyForge Modifier, the initialize() function had already defined the malicious contract as the forgeAddress , and as such OnlyForge did not detect any abnormality. The stolen USDC was swapped to ETH via 1inch and then sent to TornadoCash in transactions of 100 ETH each. The other assets were not swapped due to the whitehat intercepting them. The hacker’s plan only paid off for one of the three pools however, as the owner of a frontrunning bot decided to put on their white hat upon noticing the transactions. The saviour made their motives clear via tx input data , and negotiations began via email. Original attack tx: 0x7604c7dd6e9bcdba8bac277f1f8e7c1e4c6bb57afd4ddf6a16f629e8495a0281 Whitehat frontrun tx: 0x597d11c05563611cb4ad4ed4c57ca53bbe3b7d3fefc37d1ef0724ad58904742b However, the whitehat didn’t manage to stop all the funds from reaching the attacker: Unfortunately, it looks like my frontrun was not perfect, as I did end up sending $3M USDC to the original hacker. Rewriting txs can be tricky. Following a brief exchange between the two, the Punk team managed to convince the whitehat that the incident had not been an inside job. A bounty of $1M was decided by the protocol’s anonymous ally and after a halfhearted attempt to negotiate, the team eventually agreed, and the remaining ~$5M was returned. Approx $1.95M DAI: 0x008dd92f8bcfcee400aed26d13495fbfc8351f9b21289792fc2bb9e771668147 Approx $3M USDT: 0xace7c07695ec1bbf917486c3c81ee7de79c04e0309d4f6a149688463e6f83247 Punk Protocol states that all recovered funds will go towards compensation efforts for their users, and that they will release an update within the next few days. The Punk team is also still hoping for a change of heart from their attacker, although any amount of refund made would be insignificant compared to the previous day's events at Poly Network. Is a white hat white if they refuse to return part of the money they save? Although the anonymous actor only kept 16% of what was stolen, it was still worth $1M when they forced the deal onto Punk Protocol. Something is better than nothing, and the Punk team have little reason to be angry at the whitehat, but that money could have gone back to its original owners... Anti-heroes are everywhere in DeFi. It's white hat by day, and black by night. Security auditor salaries are nothing compared to what they can earn by using their skills for themselves, and they're given the first and best opportunity to do so. Whitehats set their own wages, while security auditors take their salaries and the blame.

Yesterday, Safemoon lost $8.9M worth of ‘locked LP’ thanks to a bug introduced in the project’s latest upgrade. The attack, which drained the SFM/BNB pool, was announced by the project and its CEO, John Karony , with replies disabled on both tweets. A few hours after the attack, the hacker sent a message to the Safemoon: Deployer address, claiming to be MEV bot operator willing to return the funds: Hey relax, we are accidently frontrun an attack against you, we would like to return the fund, setup secure communication channel , lets talk However, past on-chain activity suggests they are no white knight after all… Even if the team has dodged a bullet this time… …can they be trusted after such a basic error? Credit: Peckshield , MoonMark Just over six hours before the attack, the Safemoon: Deployer address upgraded the token contract to a new implementation . In doing so, the team introduced a vulnerability leading to an astonishingly simple exploit. The new code left the burn() function publicly callable, allowing anyone to burn SFM tokens from any address. This allowed the attacker to burn large quantities of SFM held inside the SFM:BNB liquidity pool, vastly inflating the price of SFM tokens in the pool. Then, by selling (previously acquired) SFM tokens into the skewed pool, the attacker was able to drain it of BNB liquidity, for a profit of 28k BNB, or $8.9M. Exploit tx: 0x48e52a12… Attacker’s address: 0x286e09932b8d096cba3423d12965042736b8f850 The hacker claims to have frontrunned attack and has reached out to Safemoon to negotiate the return of funds, the majority of which have since been transferred to 0x237D where they remain at the time of writing. Since its launch two years ago, Safemoon has been beset by scandal. Initially labelled as a pump and dump scheme, Safemoon shillfluencers were later slapped with a class action suit , before Coffeezilla published a series of detailed investigations into what went on behind the scenes. The favourite of tiktok investors during the peak of Spring 2021’s BSC hype , Safemoon claimed it was un-ruggable due to locked liquidity, which was topped-up with every transfer of tokens. However, the transfer fees were also criticised as ponzinomics as bagholders were disincentivised to sell. At the peak of shitcoin szn , we wrote: the shitcoins show no sign of stopping The markets have cooled down significantly since then, and it seems hardly believable that some of these projects have managed to survive this far…. Given the vulnerability was introduced by the project’s deployer address, Peckshield (perhaps charitably, or perhaps via Hanlon’s Razor) suggested that admin keys may have been leaked or phished. Regardless of whether the funds are in the hands of a blackhat hacker or whitehat MEV frontrunner, the lack of trust in Safemoon from the wider crypto community suggests they’ll unlikely be safe, even with the team… Whether a botched rug attempt, or sheer incompetence, this episode is not a good look for a project that was never very highly regarded. Despite all the bad press, any remaining soldiers in the SFM army appear to still believe, or are suffering from a bagholder’s case of Stockholm Syndrome. Perhaps if they haven’t been put off by now, they never will be. And even if this turns out to be a lucky escape for Safemoon, errors like this don’t bode well for the project’s future.

Crema Finance , a concentrated liquidity AMM on Solana, was exploited into issuing millions in excess LP fees. The theft was announced by the team on Sunday at 04:07 UTC, though the attack took place the day before. Given that the same vulnerability was spotted by auditors in a different method, this one will be sure to leave a bitter taste for the Crema team. Credit: Crema Finance , PierreArowana The attack was made possible due to faulty owner validation on one of the protocol’s accounts storing price tick data. These data are used by Crema to calculate LP fees. The hacker created a false tick account, with fake data, and used flash loans to add liquidity to the protocol. They could then withdraw the liquidity and claim the fees they were “owed” according to their own contract’s data. The proceeds were swapped to 69422.9 SOL and 6,497,738 USDCet (which was bridged to Ethereum and swapped for ETH) and remain in the hacker’s SOL and ETH addresses. Exploiter’s SOL address: Esmx2QjmDZMjJ15yBJ2nhqisjEt7Gqro4jSkofdoVsvY Exploiter’s ETH address: 0x8021b2962dB803b73Aa874030B0B42c202E8458F The Crema team have reached out to the exploiter in Solana transaction data, offering a whitehat bounty of $800k valid for 72 hours. ”To the Crema hacker: Your addresses on both Solana and Ethereum have been blacklisted and all eyes are on you right now. You have 72h from now to consider becoming a white hat and keeping 800k USD as the bounty. And transfer remaining funds back to our contract-update-authority address (DR1tLcKEmiNFxF5dxgdWCANdeBMNu9FjuHur2i4vAPHV) . Otherwise the police and legal force will officially get involved and there will be endless tracing waiting for you” Bramah Systems’s audit identified the same vulnerability in the Crema’s swap method (p. 7), which was fixed, but the issue also existed in the claim method, where it was not picked up. The lack of sufficient validation has been the root cause of other high profile attacks on Solana this year. In the case of Wormhole , faulty signature verification across the bridge led to the loss of $326M, and Cashio suffered a loss of ~$48M due to incomplete validation of LP tokens used for collateral.

Polter Finance, the latest victim in DeFi's parade of recklessness, lost roughly $8.7 million when their unaudited protocol met a classic price manipulation attack. Their newly launched BOO market proved to be more trick than treat, as an attacker turned spot price dependencies into their personal ATM. The team's response was a masterclass in damage control theater - filing a possibly inflated $12 million police report while their TVL bled out through a painfully predictable oracle exploit. Like a crypto soap opera, we watched the familiar scenes unfold: platform pause, bridge notifications, Binance wallet traces, and the obligatory ""dear ser hacker"" negotiation attempts. Another day, another protocol learning that copying code doesn't copy security. But who needs audits when you have optimism? Credit: whichghost , BcPaintball , Polter Finance , William Li , Nick Franklin Turns out BOO markets can haunt you. BcPaintball first spotted the ghost in the machine, reporting suspicious activity on Polter's newly launched BOO market. The team, perhaps too busy counting their unaudited chickens , took roughly 7 hours to acknowledge what was already painfully obvious to everyone else. Nick Franklin's autopsy revealed a textbook case of oracle manipulation - proving yet again that spot prices make better victims than oracles. William Li's initial analysis pointed to what looked like an ""empty market"" rounding error, but deeper investigation exposed something far more fundamental - a faulty oracle implementation that practically begged to be exploited. The protocol's critical mistake? Trusting SpookySwap V2/V3 pool prices for their BOO token oracle - about as secure as using a paper lock on a bank vault. By draining the BOO token reserves through a flash loan, the attacker manipulated the price feed like a puppeteer with particularly profitable strings. One BOO deposit was all it took to borrow against artificially inflated collateral, proving that in DeFi, sometimes the simplest tricks are the most expensive. Exploiter: 0x511f427Cdf0c4e463655856db382E05D79Ac44a6 Exploiter contract: 0xA21451aC32372C123191B3a4FC01deB69F91533a Flow of Funds on Metasleuth . The team's post-exploit performance deserves its own review. Hours after watching roughly $8.7 million evaporate, they filed a police report claiming $12 million in losses - perhaps hoping inflation would make up the difference. The team's crisis management playbook rolled out with clockwork predictability. Within hours, they'd paused the platform, notified bridges, and claimed to have traced the exploiter's wallet to Binance - though blockchain analysis suggests the funds had already begun their journey through different paths. ""Platform paused soon after the exploit was identified. Bridges were notified. We identified wallets involved and traced it to Binance,"" announced the Polter team, punctuating their statement with the DeFi equivalent of ""thoughts and prayers"" - a promise to contact authorities. Like a jilted lover sliding into DMs, Polter took to the blockchain to negotiate - though perhaps their time would've been better spent sliding into auditors' inboxes months ago. In the grand tradition of ""move fast and break things,"" Polter Finance skipped the tedious business of security audits entirely . Their confidence in unaudited code proved almost as inflated as their BOO token prices. ""As the smart contract used is identical to Geist, except for the removal of the flash-loan function in Lending Pool, we are providing the Geist audit report here"" - proclaims Polter's audit page , demonstrating the kind of security theater that gives Broadway a run for its money. The aftermath serves as yet another case study in the false economy of skipping audits. Close to $8.7 million lost to save what - a few weeks and a few thousand dollars? But who needs professional security reviews when you can CTRL+C CTRL+V your way to launch? The only audit they got was from the exploiter - and those results just came in. Crypto may be rocketing into the mainstream, but unless protocols like Polter start getting their act together, it’s more likely to crash and burn before it ever reaches the moon. The industry's growing pains are already painful enough, and without addressing these basic security flaws, mainstream adoption could end up being a full-speed disaster. Anyone else think Polter won’t stick around for the full ride? Another day, another protocol proving that copying code doesn't equal competence. Polter Finance's roughly $8.7 million lesson in basic oracle security came with extra credit in creative accounting - their $12 million police report suggesting they're better at inflating numbers than securing them. From skipping audits to serving up manipulatable oracles on a silver platter, the team demonstrated a masterclass in ""how not to run a DeFi protocol."" Their security strategy amounted to little more than hopes, prayers, and someone else's audit report. The exploiter didn't discover a novel vulnerability - they simply walked through the front door Polter left wide open. In crypto's current surge toward mainstream adoption, such amateur-hour security practices aren't just embarrassing - they're dangerous. Polter now takes its place among the countless protocols that mistook convenience for competence. But here's the real haunting question - how many more users need to get rekt before protocols realize that copy pasta code doesn't make you ready for primetime?

Superfluid - REKT,8700000,02/08/2022,Peckshield,https://rekt.news/superfluid-rekt/,"Superfluid -  Wednesday, February 9, 2022 Superfluid -  read this article also in : de - en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh $8.7M drained from Superfluid. The crypto streaming protocol was hacked at 06:17 +UTC 08/02/22. Other projects who were using the service for contributor payments or investor escrow contracts suffered negative price impacts as the attacker dumped their native tokens. The affected protocols included Mai Finance (QI) , Stacker Ventures (STACK) , Stake DAO (SDT) , and Museum of Crypto Art (MOCA) . QI was the worst affected token, dropping initially by almost 80% following the dump, but it has since recovered to ~62% of its pre-hack price. Superfluid’s @francescorenzia told rekt.news that the attack was focussed only on the platform’s larger wallet balances. In the time before the vulnerability was patched, the hacker left plenty of ETH, USDC and DAI untouched, presumably because the attacker had “ had enough ”. How did it happen? Attacker’s address: 0x1574f7f4c9d3aca2ebce918e5d19d18ae853c090 Exploit tx: 0xdee86cae2e1bab16496a49… Assets taken: 19.4M QI (pre-hack value of $24M) sold in four transactions for a total of 2.3k WETH (~$6.2M) 24.4 WETH - (~$76k) 563k USDC sold for 173 WETH 45k SDT - sold for ~17 WETH - (~$54k) 24k STACK - sold for ~6.2 WETH - (~$19k) 39k sdam3CRV - Swapped to am3CRV , then to ~44k amDAI 1.5M MOCA - 1M of 1.5M sold for 173 WETH (~$500K) 11k MATIC - Not yet sold Total - ~$8.7M ~6 hours after the attack, Superfluid patched the bug with help from Mudit Gupta. The patch can be found here. The text below is taken from Superfluid’s own post-mortem. Vulnerability Explanation Superfluid.sol, known as the host contract, is the contract that allows composable Superfluid agreements (ConstantFlowAgreement, InstantDistributionAgreement) in one single transaction, and the composed systems are often called Super Apps. However, in order to have a trusted and shared state through the entire transaction between different agreement calls, a concept called “ctx” (a serialized state managed by the host contract) is introduced. The “ctx” contains all the context an agreement function needs to know, that includes especially who is the “msg.sender” of the initial call. That’s where an unfortunate vulnerability was exploited. The attacker was able to skillfully craft the calldata such that the process of serialization in the host contract and succeeding de-serialization in the agreement contract resulted in the agreement contract operating on a context object forged specifically to impersonate other accounts. This mechanism was used in order to create IDA indexes “on behalf” of other accounts and move out their tokens that way. The Exploiter Contract: The following exploiter contract demonstrates how the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other accounts to close their open streams. In the actual exploit transaction , the attacker used the IDA contract to drain funds from other accounts using the same technique: Chain of Function Calls deleteAnyFlowBad The convention to callAgreement is to use the placeholder ctx, so that later agreement solidity code can read it directly as an argument “ctx”. To read more about this concept, see About-Placeholder-Ctx . This is where the attacker managed to inject a faked “ctx”, where an arbitrary sender could be set. Superfluid.callAgreement In the normal case, Superfluid.callAgreement creates the ctx and puts a stamp on it (stores its hash in a state variable), such that it can be validated using Superfluid.isCtxValid. ConstantFlowAgreementV1.createFlow The agreement then uses AgreementLibrary.authorizeTokenAccess to verify that the calling host contract is authorized to do state modifying calls on the token contract. AgreementLibrary.authorizeTokenAccess Once the calling host is authenticated, the agreement would transitively also trust the handed over ctx and decode (de-serialize) it into a memory structure. But Fake Ctx! The problem was that as in the exploiting function deleteAnyFlowBad , one can inject a fake ctx. After being merged into one bytes object by Superfluid.replacePlaceholderCtx (the Host doesn’t make any assumptions about agreement specific data), the resulting dataWithCtx now contains 2 ctx variants, the legitimate one and the injected one. When the agreement contract decodes this data, the abi decoder takes the first (injected) variant and ignores the remaining data which contains the legitimate ctx. In order to solve this, Superfluid added a verification step in the agreement contract: ISuperfluid.isCtxValid. This verifies the decoded ctx by comparing its stamp (hash) stored in the host contract. This check was already in place for handling ctx data provided by SuperApp callbacks, but was not in place for data handed over by the trusted Host contract. Superfluid has reached out to the attacker on-chain and, according to the post-mortem, a $1M bounty remains on the table in exchange for the return of the funds. The team also states that most of the affected accounts have already been refunded, while the larger QI and MOCA losses will be compensated more gradually. Although this was not the largest exploit (number 42 on our leaderboard ) , and no user funds were lost, it is notable for the manner in which it affected other protocols. The growing area of DAO infrastructure presents more targets for the anonymous attackers who are so prevalent in DeFi. The stolen money still sits in the attackers wallet. Will they take the bounty, or leave Superfluid high and dry?

Platypus Finance - REKT,8500000,02/17/2023,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/platypus-finance-rekt/,"Platypus Finance -  Thursday, February 16, 2023 Platypus Finance - Avalanche -  read this article also in : en - es - tr - zh Evolution works in mysterious ways. Avalanche-based Platypus Finance lost $8.5M to a flash loan attack on its new stablecoin. A highly-specialised creature may be well suited to its own habitat, but Platypus’ attempts to adapt have ended up dead in the water. Adding to its existing stableswap AMM platform, Platypus recently launched its own stablecoin, USP. However, just 10 days after launch, the new mechanism was attacked, depegging USP and leaving it heavily undercollateralised. The Platypus team announced the attack: Dear Community, We regret to inform you that our protocol was hacked recently, and the attacker took advantage of a flaw in our USP solvency check mechanism. They used a flashloan to exploit a logic error in the USP solvency check mechanism in the contract holding the collateral. According to a recent announcement on the launch, USP “ provides an extra layer of protection from the volatility that other stablecoins may experience ”. A statement worthy of a Darwin award? Credit: Daniel Von Fange , Peckshield The exploit took advantage of a faulty check mechanism when withdrawing collateral. The attacker first took a flash loan of 44M USDC which was deposited into Platypus. The resulting LP tokens were then used as collateral to borrow 41.7M USP. The emergencyWithdraw() function only checks whether the user’s position is currently solvent, but neglects to first check against any the effect of any borrowed funds. This allows the attacker to withdraw the supplied collateral while keeping the borrowed USP. The collateral was then withdrawn to repay the flash loan, and the USP was swapped via Platypus pools, draining the existing liquidity of other stables (USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, etc.). Attacker’s address: 0xeff003d64046a6f521ba31f39405cb720e953958 Attack tx: 0x1266a937… Attack contract: 0x67afdd6489d40a01dae65f709367e1b1d18a5322/ The hack has left USP depegged by over 50% as the attacker swapped the USP for other stables. The stolen $8.5M remain in the hacker’s contract , of which, $1.5M of stolen USDT has been blacklisted . The rather simple vulnerability, combined with the loot being left ( or possibly trapped ) as freezable, centralised stables suggests this heist may have been pulled off by a relatively inexperienced amateur. Why not swap to a less controlled asset? Or bridge the funds and send them to Tornado? As it turns out, OPSEC is not this hacker’s strong suit. After just a few hours, fellow platypus ZachXBT managed to identify the culprit via their ENS address, linked to the exploiter’s transaction history. The same alias was used for now-deleted Twitter and Instagram accounts. The Platypus team have since appealed to the doxxed exploiter: We're in the process of setting up a bounty & encourage the hacker to reach out to us. We also welcome anyone with useful information to come forward to us. Safety in numbers… Just like the Platypus itself, DeFi is a strange and unique beast. A hybrid species born of cypherpunk hackers and finance bros, every protocol must speedrun their way through natural selection. It’s a jungle out there… …and, as ever, it’s survival of the fittest.

Similarly to last week’s Mango Markets case, the exploit was carried out via price manipulation of a collateral asset, this time netting the attacker $8.4M. The Moola team announced the incident on Twitter, appealing to the CEX-funded attacker to return funds in exchange for a bounty. Fortunately, just six hours later, over 90% of the funds were returned to the Moola multisig , with the exploiter keeping ~$525k as a bounty, of which $37k was donated to charity… A guilty conscience or a planned whitehat? Credit: FrankResearcher This attack was a simple price manipulation which didn’t require any coding. Using initial funding of 243k CELO (~$180k), the attacker supplied 60k CELO in order to borrow 1.8M of the protocol’s native token, MOO, which could itself be used as collateral to borrow against other assets. Then, using the remaining CELO to buy MOO on Ubeswap, the attacker pumped the price of their MOO collateral… …allowing them to borrow the remaining assets on the protocol, draining all liquidity: 8.8M CELO ($6.5M) 765k cEUR ($0.7M) 1.8M MOO ($0.6M) 644k cUSD ($0.6M) Attacker's address: 0x95b5579b323ddc6cd290bd4da6e56ba019588efc In addition to returning the majority of the funds, the whitehat also donated 50k CELO ($37k) of the bounty to Impact Market , a protocol focused on providing UBI for vulnerable families in developing countries. Bear markets offer easy opportunities to market manipulators, who find it easier to move prices when liquidity is low. Especially when smaller protocols allow use of their native tokens as collateral, whose dollar value dies away as the bear drags on. Moola Markets have learned their lesson, and are proposing to remove MOO as a viable collateral asset via protocol governance. But anyone with deep enough pockets can stress test DeFi markets in their current state. Who will be next?

Hacker’s address: 0x8efab89b497b887cdaa2fb08ff71e4b3827774b2 Funded by Tornado Cash a few mins before the execution of the attack. Due to a vulnerable require() check in the vVISR Rewards Contract ’s deposit() function, the hacker was able to mint unlimited shares using their own contract. As long as the hacker passes their own contract as “ from ” and the contract has an Owner() method of msg.sender , then they can mint as many shares as they want to any address using vvisr.mint() .

Bittensor - Rekt,8000000,07/02/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/bittensor-rekt/,"Bittensor - Rekt Wednesday, July 3, 2024 Bittensor - Rekt read this article also in : en - es - zh On July 2, Bittensor's blockchain enlightenment was rudely interrupted by a $8 million hack, due to a compromised PyPi Package Manager. As validators meditated on their nodes, an attacker silently drained their wallets faster than you can say ""om."" The path of the TAO led straight to the hacker's wallet, with approximately 32,000 TAO tokens making an unauthorized journey. The Bittensor team swiftly responded to the situation by immediately halting all network operations, taking decisive action to address the issue at hand. The network entered ""safe mode,"" allowing blocks to be produced but preventing any transactions from being processed. This measure was taken to prevent further losses and protect users while a thorough investigation is conducted. The incident led to a swift 15% decline in the value of the TAO token, demonstrating that in blockchain, as in life, everything flows... including market cap. According to Bittensor’s Telegram , users and stakers are fine. It's just the owners of some validators, subnets and miners that were drained. Ready to unpack this clusterbleep of cosmic proportions? Credit: Bittensor , ZachXBT Bittensor initially announced in their Discord that a number of their wallets were attacked, going on to state that they’re investigating and have halted all on-chain transactions as a precaution. The attack on Bittensor's blockchain unfolded with the precision of a well-practiced qigong routine. Over a mere 3-hour span, the attacker managed to compromise multiple high-value wallets, making off with approximately 32,000 TAO tokens. As the Bittensor team scrambled to respond, the crypto community's favorite on-chain sleuth was already on the case. Shortly after the theft, ZachXBT identified the address that stole the funds: 5FbWTraF7jfBe5EvCmSThum85htcrEsCzwuFjG3PukTUQYot Zach, ever the crypto detective, may have tied it to a previous incident on June 1st, where a TAO holder had over 28k TAO stolen , worth $11.2M at the time of the theft. The day after the attack, the Opentensor Foundation (OTF) dropped their post-mortem , revealing the root cause of the attack was a compromised PyPi Package Manager. Here's how this digital dumpster fire unfolded: A malicious package, masquerading as a legitimate Bittensor package, snuck its way into PyPi version 6.12.2. This trojan horse contained code designed to steal unencrypted coldkey details. When unsuspecting users downloaded this package and decrypted their coldkeys, the decrypted bytecode was sent to a remote server controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability affected users who downloaded the Bittensor PyPi package between May 22 and May 29, or used Bittensor==6.12.2, and then performed certain operations like staking, unstaking, transferring, delegating, or undelegating. In response to the attack, the Bittensor team quickly put the chain into ""safe mode”, halting all transactions while continuing to produce blocks. This swift action may have prevented further losses, but it also highlighted the centralized control the team maintains over the supposedly decentralized network. The OTF has taken immediate steps to mitigate the damage: Removed the malicious 6.12.2 package from the PyPi Package Manager repository. Conducted a thorough review of Subtensor and Bittensor code on Github. Worked with exchanges to trace the attacker and potentially salvage funds. Moving forward, the OTF has promised enhanced package verification, increased outside audit frequency, improved security standards, and increased monitoring moving forward. The OTF stated that the incident did not affect the blockchain or Subtensor code, and the underlying Bittensor protocol remains uncompromised and secure. They have also been working with several exchanges, providing them with details of the attack in order to trace the attacker and potentially salvage funds. As the dust settles, the community is left pondering how the malicious package slipped through PyPi's defenses and whether this attack is linked to the June 1st theft. It seems in the world of Bittensor, the path to enlightenment is paved with some empty wallets. The Bittensor hack exposes a critical vulnerability in the crypto ecosystem, the reliance on third-party package managers. While blockchain protocols themselves may be secure, the tools developers use to interact with them can become unexpected points of failure. This incident raises questions about the security practices of PyPi and other package repositories that the crypto community depends on. The timing and similarity to the June 1st theft can't be ignored. Are these isolated incidents, or is there a more widespread campaign targeting Bittensor and similar projects? As the OTF works with exchanges to trace the stolen funds, the community watches with bated breath, hoping for a recovery that rarely comes in the wake of such hacks. Bittensor's swift action in halting the network demonstrates the double-edged nature of centralized control in ""decentralized"" projects. While it may have prevented further losses, it also highlights the fragility of the system. In the Tao of crypto, the only constant is change and occasionally, an $8 million vanishing act.

THORChain - REKT 2,8000000,07/22/2021,THORChain,https://rekt.news/thorchain-rekt2/,"THORChain -  2 Monday, July 26, 2021 THORChain -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh THORChain took a hammering. Recently the protocol was hit for $5M. A second strike saw them lose another $8M. The hacker left a clear message for THORChain, but apparently it was not clear enough, as THORChain initially believed they had lost just $800k to a whitehat hacker. The tx data told a different story: Source THORChain has always used a very conversational tone from their official Twitter account, and they continued to do so even after the attack. When you’ve lost over 10 million of your users' funds in 10 days, it’s not a good idea to celebrate an increase in followers. The new followers arrived to watch you bleed, they are not a sign of your success. The passion of the THORchain community remains high, but it manifests itself differently now that they are suffering. The following message was found in a transaction from a RUNE holder to the attacker. “Savage.” What happened to cause such anger? Credit: Halborn Security The observation of an attack began on the 22.07.2021 - 21:42 GMT An attacker targeted the Thorchain Bifrost component through the ETH Router contract. During the transactions, the following addresses are seen in the transactions. Router: 0xc145990e84155416144c532e31f89b840ca8c2ce Vault: 0xf56cba49337a624e94042e325ad6bc864436e370 Attack contract: 0x700196e226283671a3de6704ebcdb37a76658805 Attack wallet (spawned from Tornado Cash): 0x8c1944fac705ef172f21f905b5523ae260f76d62 The simple attack steps can be seen below. The attacker created a fake router (Contract Address), then a deposit event emitted when the attacker sent ETH. The attacker passes returnVaultAssets() with a small amount of ETH, but the router is defined as an Asgard vault. On the Thorchain Router, it forwarded ETH to the fake Asgard. This creates a fake deposit event with a malicious memo. Thorchain Bifrost intercepts as a normal deposit and refunds to an attacker due to a bad memo definition. Contract Address Transaction 1 Transaction 2 Transaction 3 Transaction 4 Transaction 5 Transaction 6 Last Transaction By An Attacker Transactions to THORChain pass user-intent with the MEMO field on the chains which contain custom user input. The THORChain inspects the transaction object, as well as the MEMO in order to process the transaction, so care must be taken to ensure the MEMO and the transaction is valid. If not, THORChain will automatically refund. (Reference.) The hacker targeted a refund logic. The attack can be named as Lack of proper multi-event handling. Impact (~$8M USD) 966.62 ALCX 20,866,664.53 XRUNE 1,672,794.010 USDC 56,104 SUSHI 6.91 YFI 990,137.46 USDT The price of RUNE dropped by 25% , however, holders were about to receive more bad news. Just as with the previous exploit, a vulnerability present due to decisions actively made by developers was found within the RUNE token contract code. Hours after the attack, many addresses began to receive a previously unknown token; UniH. Those who tried to sell this token had their full RUNE balances drained upon approving its use. RUNE’s transferTo function used tx.origin instead of msg.sender, something explicitly advised against within the Solidity documentation as it allows interactions with malicious contracts to move your RUNE. In this case, granting approval to a protocol to spend UniH was all it took for any RUNE in a wallet to be stolen, as in this example. As can be seen in the code’s comments this was a vulnerability that the team had foreseen, and had been acknowledged as “non-standard”. Another instance of the THORChain devs leaving instructions for the hackers. Credit: Mudit Gupta THORChain rekt again, and they have no one to blame but themselves. Although perhaps not a DeFi “blue-chip”, THORChain were a well-established player, and many will be disappointed to see them go downhill so quickly. Why now, and in such quick succession? Has something changed internally on the THORChain team, or did they upset somebody who had a motive to hurt them? An $8M payday would be enough motive for most, but this anonymous antihero left most of the loot behind… This was for power, not wealth. What’s next for THORChain and their fanatical followers after such a string of major mistakes?

Hack Epidemic (Origin Protocol - REKT),8000000,11/17/2020,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/hack-epidemic/,"Hack Epidemic (Origin Protocol - ) Tuesday, November 17, 2020 hack - flash loan - origin - cheese bank read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh Stay at home, wear a mask, the hack epidemic is spreading. These are dark times for weak code. Developers need to put their protocols into lockdown. Greed is contagious, and hacks bring eye-catching prizes. In just 24 hours we hear of two more attacks. Cheese Bank - $3.3m via flashloan AMM oracle attack, Origin Protocol , $8m via flash loan and faketoken re-entrancy In the last 30 days, we’ve seen over $45 million of users funds removed from unsecure protocols. In addition to the most recent attacks, we’ve seen Harvest ( $25M) > Value DeFi ( $7M)> and Akropolis (~$2M) In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, or “R number” is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. In cryptocurrency, the R number is the quantity of protocols that are currently getting totally  by flash loans and fake tokens. We’re seeing the R number increase day by day as the publicity of each attack serves as duplication instructions for the next capable coder who’s willing to take risks. Although each hack attracts attention and even some compliments on their expertise, we should remember not to glorify this behaviour. Any “Robin Hood” comparison is way off the mark here. Hackers are stealing money from those who have less. Although, we are learning from the experience. We can hold the opinion that flash loans are good for the space without promoting greed and theft. Having said that, greed is not without its benefits. Would banks be secure if there were no robbers? Greed is at the core of our capitalist system, yet it brings us vaccines... If, as some say, the hackers are acting simply to expose weak code and educate the space, perhaps it would be best to eventually return all funds, rather than rely on their personal judgement to decide who should be refunded. However, perhaps there is also some greed in the behaviour of the developers, who could wait and have their code thoroughly audited pre-launch instead of gambling with users funds. On the other hand, if there was no predatory risk to shit code, then the developer would become the apex predator, and the cycle would continue. All parties involved in these attacks have some degree of responsibility. The amount of responsibility varies, yet the motivation is identical. Greed is human nature, and it's a key concept in the game of DeFi. Each actor involved in these unfortunate events presents their greed through different actions. The Ape - Hopes to make a profit and bet on the untested code. Greed shows through their impatience, yet the early bird has been rewarded well in the past, so their desired outcome is not without precedence. The Dev - Expecting to profit the most from their newly released code, the greedy dev is blinded by their expectations, and skips the essential safety audit as they rush their code to market. The Hacker - The apex predator is not immune, but is able to use superior knowledge to weaponise his greed while others are handicapped by it. If you had worked to acquire knowledge that enabled you to take money in this way, would you return millions of dollars? While there is no cure for greed, we should remember that it can create things which are positive, and that there are steps we can take to protect ourselves from its negative consequences. Audits are not cheap, but they’re a small price to pay compared to losing funds or your reputation to a hack or exploit. DeFi winter is here , and there probably will be more casualties in the coming months. Although immunity is never 100% guaranteed, we can take steps to reduce the likelihood of infection. The R number changes according to our behaviour, developers must put protocols into lockdown immediately. This is an epidemic that affects only the weak. Once infected, there is no cure. The only protection is in prevention, code needs to be audited thoroughly if it is to survive the winter. Audit your code, wash your hands, don’t get rekt.

HTX (Huobi) - REKT,7900000,09/24/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/htx-huobi-rekt/,"HTX (Huobi) -  Tuesday, September 26, 2023 HTX - Huobi - CEX -  read this article also in : en It’s shaping up to be a big week . Two crypto platforms rekt already… and that was just Monday. Yesterday, Justin Sun announced a $7.9M hack on HTX (formerly Huobi), less than 12 hours after Mixin Network admitted to a $200M loss . In a thread oozing with His Excellency’s typical arrogance, Sun brushed off the loss as a drop in the ocean compared to the $3B of assets held on the platform, also noting the stolen amount represents “ just two weeks' revenue ” for the exchange. In an amusing case of foreshadowing , the hack comes just after Huobi rebranded to HTX. Sounds eerily similar to disgraced SBF ’s now bankrupt exchange, doesn’t it? Sun claimed (somewhat implausibly) not to have noticed the similarity, after CZ wasted no time in poking fun at the irony. What do they say about people in glass houses again? First FTX , then 3AC’s GTX , now HTX… Do we really have to get to ZTX before we hit the bottom? As often is the case with hacks of centralised exchanges, details of the attack vector are scant. The 4999 ETH ($7.9M) was drained at 10AM UTC on Sunday, with the remaining 633 ETH (worth $1M) secured by HTX just over two hours later. Attacker addresses: 0xdb1D74467c9042517A354304256E0d658D8AEC83 0x799982b75Ba538F211871cBa50Fa1A42ADa9ab5E It seems strange that all funds were not drained, and that, if HTX were immediately aware of the incident ( as Sun claims ), that the rescue of the leftovers took so long . Sun also says that the hacker has been identified ( why not prove it? ) and has extended an offer on-chain of 5% bounty, and a job , valid for seven days after which law enforcement will be informed. Despite the initial downplaying, Sun followed up with a thread announcing livestreams to talk exchange security. The thread also states : we have implemented real-time monitoring mechanisms to prevent such losses. You’d have thought an exchange holding $3B in user assets (as Sun claims) would already have this kind of system in place, right? But given that Sun tends to use Huobi to YOLO mind-boggling sums of crypto around on a daily basis ( presumably part of his duties as some kind of self-proclaimed crypto superhero ), such a system might have set off alarm bells a little too often. There appears to be a sudden wave of bad news coming out of the asian crypto markets recently. Yesterday Mixin topped the 2023 leaderboard . Before that, another HK exchange, JPEX, abandoned ship following a warning from the regulators, and Upbit fell for a fake token top-up scam . To top it off, Tether is dismissing rumours of trouble in Singapore as FUD, but someone looks to be trying to get rid of USDT. Will this $7.9M drop in the ocean turn out to be a simple case of ‘4’ for Huobi? Or are there bigger things to come?

Anyswap - REKT,7900000,07/10/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/anyswap-rekt/,"Anyswap -  Tuesday, July 13, 2021 Anyswap -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh The bridges are burning. AnySwap and Chainswap in a 24 hour period. Anyswap were quick to announce the incident. An exploit was detected in the new anyswap v3 prototype, all bridge funds used in v1/v2 are safe.
Remedial action already in place for all exploited funds. Attacker’s address: 0x0aE1554860E51844B61AE20823eF1268C3949f7C The funds lost were all $ pegged stablecoins totalling approximately $7.9M. Just over 5.5M $MIM were taken in this transaction. A further 3 transactions saw a total of ~2.4M USDC stolen. 1: via Ethereum - 1,536,821.7694 USDC 2: via BSC - 749,033.37 USDC 3: via Fantom - 112,640.877101 USDC The root of the exploit lay in the prototype V3 Router’s use of ECDSA , the algorithm securing its MPC wallet by generating private keys. The key here is that every k value calculated in the algorithm should be based on a different, random number for each signature. If two or more transactions contain a repeated k value, then the private key can be back-calculated. This potential security flaw has been known since 2010, when console hacking group fail0verflow detailed the process here (p123-129). And its application to blockchain keys was later detailed in 2013 . Credit: Tayvano Despite this, Anyswap’s post-mortem states that the attacker detected a repeated k value in two of the V3 Router’s transactions on BSC, and was able to back-calculate the private key. Anyswap stressed that “only the new V3 cross-chain liquidity pools have been affected” and that the bridge remains operational via V1 and V2 Routers. The post-mortem also states that the V3’s code has been fixed and will reopen after the 48hr timelock installed by the team expires. The team has also reached out to potential bug bounty hunters: Anyswap will reward anyone who reports bugs to us. This will help us build truly secure and even better cross-chain solutions. The need for fully secure bridges grows stronger by the day, as crypto capital spreads across multiple chains. However, the security architecture for cross-chain bridges is complex - proposing a puzzle to developers which has yet to be solved. Anyswap V3 was a prototype, so perfection was not expected, but considering the nature of the exploit, it seems this loss was preventable. Although action was taken relatively quickly to prevent another attack, @nicksdjohnson is of the opinion that the patch does not do enough. Setting aside the fact that there's a much better, industry standard solution to this, their patch:
Fails catastrophically (exposing users to another hack) if you accidentally delete a file, or restore from an old backup, or move to a new server. And it requires every signature request to scan every previous one, but really that's the smallest problem here. Anyswap call themselves a “trustless protocol”, but perhaps that label no longer has the desired effect after such a damning evaluation from a leading Ethereum developer.

All human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: two faces and two personas that share a set of hidden goals. As Jekyll was to Hyde, so white hat is to black. The developers we trust in daylight could be different in the night. A potion of knowledge with irresistible results - who among us could resist such prizes when the punishment is zero? As there are so few developers with these particular capabilities, we are faced with the probability that they give with one hand whilst they take with the other. Warp Finance is the latest victim of an increasingly unremarkable hack epidemic. An account which had been funded with only one ETH via Tornado cash executed a contract which flash swapped $180m from Uniswap and flash borrowed $51m from dYdX. Using this technique, the attacker was able to remove $7.8m of DAI, aided by the fact that Warp.finance relied on vulnerable Uniswap LP token prices. This allowed them to borrow more than their collateral, and resulted in a loss of stablecoin lender funds.

The attack was initiated at 10:24:41 PM +UTC, Dec. 17, 2020 ( Transaction ), The root cause of this incident was the use of AMM-based oracle (Uniswap), which allowed the attacker to manipulate the price of UniswapV2 pair (WETH-DAI) LP token. This flash loan induced price manipulation on Uniswap lead the attacker to borrow more (approximately double) amount of USDC and DAI from the WarpFinance lending platform than it should. An interesting point to note is that the attacker does not profit from this immediately. The LP tokens deposited by the attacker are held as collateral and are locked in WarpFinance due to an under-water borrow position. Transaction Walkthrough: Take four different flashloans of 2.9M DAI + 344.8K WETH from dYdX and UniswapV2; WETH-WBTC 90k WETH WETH-USDC 82k WETH WETH-USDT 96k WETH dYdX 76k WETH dYdX 2.9m DAI Deposit the dYdX flashloan (of 2.9M DAI + 76K WETH) to UniswapV2 pair (WETH-DAI) and mint in return 94.349K LP tokens. The minted tokens are then transferred to WarpVaultLP as collateral to the credit of the attacker; (current price of UniswapV2 pair WETH-DAI LP token is 58,815,427) Swap 341K WETH for 47.6M DAI via UniswapV2 so that DAI becomes very expensive, which cascadingly at least doubles the LP token price to 135,470,392; With the higher LP token price and the higher computed collateral value, the attacker is able to borrow 3.86M DAI and 3.9M USDC from WarpFinance (valued about $~7.8 million) Return the flashloans in Step 1 back to dYdX and UniswapV2. The attacker lost most of the gains in the transaction fees. Though this incident leads to ~$7.8 million loss, the attacker does not immediately benefit from it. Specifically, the attacker currently has an under-water borrow position in WarpFinance, which still locks the 94.349K LP tokens. In the meantime, we are actively monitoring the attackers wallet for any movement. Pie chart credit - @n2ckchong There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul. How long until the attackers have had their fill? Just one of these heists provides enough money that the recipient would never need to work again, so the continuation suggests that these actors seek power, not riches. Or perhaps money is of little interest to the technical mind, who plays with their victims like a cat with a mouse. It shows the immaturity of the industry when these attacks draw so little attention. Outside of cryptocurrency, a seven million dollar heist would create international headlines, yet to DeFi natives, this latest exploit appears somewhat dull, a basic repetition of a known attack vector. As the majority of funds are held, and can be recovered via liquidation with a new controller from the vault, the attacker has created a sizable bounty. Perhaps in the future, an altruistic attacker will use this method to provide users with a chance to redeem their funds instead of just taking them. Attackers could hold funds at ransom and request a payment for their return; forcing the protocol to pay or further ruin their reputation. Dr Jekyll did not create a potion to remove the evil parts of his nature. He made a potion that allowed him to express his urges without feeling guilty and without any consequences to his reputation. DeFi is a world of pseudonyms and plotting, where anonymity gives power and white hats turn to grey. When warp.finance used Twitter to thank their white hat developers, there was a conspicuous familiarity to the names they mentioned. We all break bread with these familiar faces, but do they drink our milkshake when our backs are turned?

Another attack sees $4.4M taken from Meter.io on BSC, making Hundred Finance lose $3.3M in collateral damage. This is the 7th bridge attack on our leaderboard , showing a rising trend in cross-chain criminality. How long will it take to perfect the tech and stop these losses? The meter is running. Credit: @ishwinder The attack started at ~6am PST on February 5th, when the attacker maliciously minted a substantial amount of BNB and wETH tokens, draining the bridge reserve of its BNB and wETH before all bridge transactions could be halted by Meter. Meter_io Passport is a fork of ChainSafe 's ChainBridge, but with one change introduced to the deposit method of the ERC20 Handler. This change basically assumes that if the token being bridged is wrapped Native token then it doesn’t burn or lock since the wrapped Native token is already unwrapped and the amount transferred to the handler contract. The assumption holds true for one of the deposit methods depositEth which also asserts the value of amount in calldata(which will then ultimately get passed to the handler's deposit method): But the assumption doesn't hold true for another method deposit in the same contract which is mostly unguarded. Hacker notices this and sends an arbitrary amount in the calldata, which gets passed on the handler's deposit. The loot was then moved into Tornado Cash across multiple transactions over the space of one hour. This attack created collateral damage. Hundred Finance lost $3.3M due to their reliance on the Meter bridge. Hundred announced the loss in a tweet. Today Hundred Finance's @MoonriverNW deployment was affected by a bridge attack on @Meter_IO that resulted in the local depreciation in the price of BNB.bsc. Accounts were able to purchase BNB.bsc at a reduced price and use these tokens as collateral at the global Chainlink price to borrow uncompromised assets on our platform. Of these, MIM and FRAX are currently impacted. We would like to request that owners of the accounts that did so consider returning the assets borrowed so that other users are able to access their liquidity. 1 acc. holder has already done so and we are willing to pay further bounties to the remaining 3 for doing the same. We spoke to the founder of Hundred Finance, vfat : rekt: Will Hundred Finance be making any changes following this incident? You mention you are working with Meter towards a possible resolution - could you provide any more details? vfat: Hello, so yes of course this is an issue we are all too aware of, each new chain / bridge we add has its own risks, and a lending protocol is a natural target for bridge attackers. We used Meter as they were the main source of wrapped BTC on Moonriver, this combined with the native bridge and Multichain puts us at 3 bridges on that chain which is the maximum we would use. Going forward we will be stricter on this, and publish more detailed information about which bridges are used for which assets. We will also look into extra monitoring for possible attacks like this. Meter have of course accepted responsibility for this hack and are intending to use their native token for reimbursement to the extent that they can, currently we are in the gathering addresses and amounts stage. One interesting thing is that there were 4 opportunistic loans at Hundred in total, but the first 2 have been repaid, so there is some modicum of hope still for the other 2. Current loss to Hundred users is $3.3M. The voluntary repayments of the “opportunistic loans” taken on Hundred Finance are a rare sight to see, and it is commendable that Meter are accepting full responsibility for all losses. Meter claim to have some evidence as to the identity of the hacker, and have stated they are working with authorities to bring justice. However, on-chain crime rarely has off-chain consequences, and it won’t be long until we see another attack of this type. There will be more bridge attacks, and more users will lose money, but eventually someone will succeed in building a safe bridge. We are still too early to be risk-free, but that just means more opportunity.

Rho Market - Rekt,7500000,07/19/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/rho-market-rekt/,"Rho Market - Rekt Friday, July 19, 2024 Rho Market -  read this article also in : en - es An oracle's misconfiguration turns into a $7.5 million windfall for an alert MEV bot. What began as a simple misstep in Rho Market's oracle configuration turned into a payday for an opportunistic MEV bot on July 19th, as it swiftly seized upon the opening within the protocol built on Scroll. In the high-stakes world of DeFi, even the slightest miscalculation can lead to catastrophic losses. Millions can vanish in the blink of an eye. In this digital Wild West, MEV bots are the new gunslingers, their algorithms primed to outdraw any protocol that leaves its vault unlocked. But when the quick-draw artist holsters their gun and offers to return the loot, who's really the outlaw in this digital frontier? Is it still an exploit if the attacker offers to give it all back? Credit: CJ the ""Doughnut"" , ZachXBT , Scroll , Rho Markets , DefiLlama , Sudo , Miszke Oracles are the eyes and ears of smart contracts, providing crucial off-chain data to on-chain systems. But when these digital soothsayers falter, chaos ensues. According to DeFiLlama , Rho Markets is a fork of Compound Finance and held approximately $38 million worth of assets shortly before the exploit. Compound itself was at the heart of last week’s panic over the wave of front-end hijacking incidents on popular DeFi platforms. Rho Market's oracle misconfiguration allowed an MEV bot to manipulate price data, creating an arbitrage opportunity that drained $7.5 million from the protocol in a matter of minutes. First reported by CJ the “Doughnut”, who noted that the platform was drained of USDC and USDT. CJ linked to the possible attacker’s address , which showed a gain of $7.5 million over the past hours. Rho Markets acknowledged the unusual behavior and paused the platform. The incident prompted Scroll, the L2 network hosting RhoMarket, to temporarily halt the chain . ZachXBT highlighted that “Exploiter has a ton of exposure to centralized exchanges so would say there’s a good probability this gets recovered and they are gray or white hat.” Zach was not too far from the mark, as he shared an on chain message shortly after: “Hello RHO team, our MEV bot have profited from your price oracle misconfiguration. We understand that the funds belong to users and are willing to fully return. But first we would like you to admit that it was not an exploit or a hack, but a misconfiguration on your end. Also, please provide what are you going to do to prevent it from happening again?” They honored their word and the funds were returned shortly after. Rho Markets confirmed that the issue was resolved, without any loss of funds and they are currently reassigning funds back to the borrow pools. In response to the recent events, Rho Markets has outlined the following three-step plan: Identify accounts that supplied funds during the oracle malfunction. Replenish the USDC, USDT, and wstETH pools to restore affected balances. Reinstate borrowing and transfer functionalities while adhering to strict security protocols. While a prior security audit had identified potential vulnerabilities in the protocol's oracle implementation, the incident stemmed from a human error during deployment rather than a code flaw. In a space where censorship-resistance and permissionless are more than just buzzwords, incidents like these force us to confront uncomfortable truths about the current state of blockchain infrastructure. While Rho Market dodged a bullet this time thanks to a benevolent bot operator, will the next white hat be so generous? The recent DeFi debacle not only exposed oracle misconfiguration issues but also reignited the debate on decentralization in Layer 2 solutions. As Rho Market's blunder prompted Scroll to halt its chain, Sudo pointed out that L2s touting permissionless and censorship-resistant values are merely posturing to attract VC money, making L1 Ethereum's genuine decentralization all the more appealing. L2 operators now face a catch-22, censor to save funds and risk centralization accusations or stay true to permissionless ideals at the users' expense. With centralized sequencers and provers becoming common on L2s, liability concerns grow as operators potentially become centralized failure points vulnerable to legal and regulatory pressure. While Layer 2 solutions promise scalability and decentralization. Are we building a censorship-resistant future or just creating a more efficient version of the systems we aimed to replace?

Over $7M was drained from multiple Fantom Foundation-labelled wallets were drained yesterday. Fantom’s semi-retired figurehead Andre Cronje quickly clarified that the thefts affected an employee, rather than the Foundation itself. However, the Foundation’s acknowledgement of the incident which came three hours later did admit to a $550k loss. There’s been plenty of rushed messaging this week… The statement went on to explain that some of the affected addresses were “ no longer utilized ” Foundation Wallets, which had been “ reassigned ” to an employee. Why not use new addresses? With the Fantom Foundation never publicly disclosing their wallet addresses, even after their claims of having 30+ years of runway (thanks to farming 2020’s DeFi Summer), we’ll just have to take Cronje and the Foundation’s word for it. When did DeFi become ‘trust, don’t verify’? Credit: Tayvano , Spreek Starting just before 4am UTC yesterday, at least 12 addresses were drained across five chains: ETH, FTM, OP, BSC and AVAX. While it remains unknown precisely how the attacker(s) gained access, the fact that multiple associated addresses were drained in short succession may suggest a compromised password manager, potentially LastPass . The initial explanation , which came via a FTM Foundation TG admin, of a “ zero day exploit on crome ” doesn’t sound so plausible, after all. Attacker addresses (totalling $7.5M): 0x1d93c73d575b81a59ff55958afc38a2344e4f878 ( ETH , FTM , OP ) 0x2f4f1d2c5944dba74e107d1e8e90e7c1475f4001 ( ETH , FTM , OP , AVAX , BSC ) 0xdadc0421ee1b5426fca3db22f0a94a3bad5a329d ( ETH , FTM ) Attacker consolidation address on ETH (holds 4.5k ETH, $7.1M): 0x0b1f29df74a19c44745862ab018d925501fe9596 For a full list of victim addresses, labels and relationships, see Tay’s thread . Beosin also provided a summary table . The mixed messaging around the incident was bound to lead to some slight errors in reporting. However, given the $100M+ in liquidations caused by Cointelegraph’s unsourced Bitcoin ETF announcement on Monday, you’d have thought they would be being tweeting extra carefully. Apparently not. For a website that holds itself to “ high journalistic standards ”, blaming the social media team ( as well as “the society” and “the technology” at large ) should probably be followed up by fact-checking tweets… …at least for a couple of days… …and against the article it refers to. Bad luck seems to haunt the Fantom ecosystem like a spectre. Cronje may have boasted of the Foundation’s treasury holdings last year, presumably to bolster confidence in the ecosystem in the wake of the uncertainty which followed FTX’s blowup. But, assuming the funds ( which apparently include over $100M in stables ) are still there, the Foundation now holds far more than the chain’s entire TVL, which has been gradually bleeding from over $500M earlier this year, to just $40M today. A general downtrend was punctuated in July by the Multichain debacle. Now, whether for good reason or not, yesterday’s news has spooked users once more. Is FTM cursed?

Are we seeing a repeat of Spring 2021’s carnage on BSC? Credit: Peckshield , Numen Cyber The hack was due to a lack of slippage control in the shift() function of the JimboController contract . The attacker took a flashloan of 10k ETH and used the funds to buy JIMBO, heavily increasing the token’s price. Then, by depositing some of the overvalued JIMBO into the JimboController, a rebalance was triggered via shift(), transferring the contract’s WETH back into the pool. The attacker was then able to sell the remaining JIMBO back into the pool, draining all WETH liquidity and crashing the price of JIMBO.

Hundred Finance - REKT 2,7400000,04/15/2023,WhiteHatDAO,https://rekt.news/hundred-rekt2/,"Hundred Finance -  2 Tuesday, April 18, 2023 Hundred Finance -  read this article also in : en - es - tr - zh Hundred Finance finally gets its very own article. No sharing the spotlight this time… Shortly after 2pm UTC on April 15th, Hundred Finance suffered a $7.4M exploit on Optimism. The team’s announcement sounded more like a bystander’s observation than a protocol informing users of a multimillion dollar hack… It looks that Hundred got hacked on #Optimism. We will update when there is more information to it. But, then again, Hundred have been through all this before. Last February, Hundred caught a stray to the tune of 3.3M when Meter got rekt . The following month saw Hundred’s leaderboard debut , when $6.2M was lost on xDAI chain to a dual-edged attack which also hit Agave DAO for $5.5M. That time, the attack vector was the same reentrancy mechanism which hit CREAM Finance in August 2021. With Hundred’s leaderboard total now standing at $16.9M… …what was it this time? Credit: Daniel Von Fange , Peckshield , Beosin , Numen Cyber Hundred is a Compound fork which uses hTokens to track lending positions. It was audited in Feb 2022 by WhiteHatDAO. As Daniel Von Fange points out : the project setup two wBTC cTokens, one of which was used by the UI, one of which was empty. Using a flashloan of WBTC from Aave, the attacker was able to donate large amounts of WBTC to the empty hWBTC contract, manipulating the exchange rate between hWBTC and WBTC. To top it off, the redeemUnderlying function contained a rounding error. Attacker’s address ( OP , ETH ): 0x155da45d374a286d383839b1ef27567a15e67528 Hack tx 1: 0x6e9ebcde… Hack tx 2: 0x15096dc6… Peckshield summed up the exploit as: The root cause appears the attacker donates 200 WBTC to inflate hWBTC's exchange rate so that even a tiny amount (2 wei) of hWBTC can basically drain current lending pools. Beosin also provided a step-by-step analysis: The root cause is that the attacker can manipulate the exchangeRate by donating a large amount of WBTC to the hWBTC contract. In the getAccountSnapshot function, the value of exchangeRateMantissa relies on the amount of WBTC in the contract. The attacker flashloaned 500 $WBTC, then called the redeem function to redeem the previously staked 0.3 WBTC. Next, the attack contract 1 sent 500.3 WBTC to attack contract 2. Contract 2 used 4 BTC to mint 200 hWBTC. The redeem function was then called to redeem the 4 BTC. Here the attacker can redeem the 4 WBTC previously staked with less than 200 hWBTC. At this point the attacker had a very small amount of hWBTC left on contract 2. Attack contract 2 then sent 500.3 WBTC to the hWBTC contract and borrowed 1021.91 ETH via the remaining 2 hWBTCs. Finally the attack contract 2 repaid the previous debt by using 1 hWBTC, and withdrew 500.3 WBTC from the contract. The attacker bridged most of the stolen funds to ETH where centralised stables USDT and USDC were swapped, or deposited into Curve. At the time of writing, the hacker’s debank profile shows approximately $5.4M of assets on Ethereum and $0.9M remaining on Optimism. The price of HND token dropped around 50% over the day following the hack. It has since recovered somewhat, to ~$0.025, down from ~$0.039 before the attack. As we wrote last time : Forks upon forks create a house of cards. If the code is copied and pasted, vulnerabilities can open up where they're least expected. When one fork falls, all others have to check their foundations. Hundred have advised other COMP forks to get in touch, warning that the hack exploited “ a general flaw in the code and not specific to Hundred deployment ”. Likely spurred on by Euler Finance ’s recent success, the Hundred team have announced a reward for info leading to identification of the hacker: 48h passed since we sent an on-chain message to the hacker and tried to start negotiations with him. Today we are launching a $500k reward in the hope that this provides additional incentive for info that leads to the Hundred attacker’s arrest and the return of all funds. Hopefully the added pressure is as effective in recovering the funds… Will Hundred get lucky?

Exactly Protocol - REKT,7200000,08/18/2023,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/exactly-protocol-rekt/,"Exactly Protocol -  Friday, August 18, 2023 Exactly Protocol - Optimism -  read this article also in : en L2s have been going through something of a rekt-naissance lately. Exactly Protocol becomes the latest victim of this summer’s on-chain crime spree, after being hit for $7.2M. The lending platform, based on Optimism, was targeted by an exploit which drained users' collateral. Peckshield raised the alarm and the Exactly team responded that they were investigating. An update came almost two hours later, stating that the protocol had been paused: We're actively investigating a security issue within our protocol. To ensure user safety, the protocol is temporarily paused (you can still withdraw assets). Our team is on top of this and will share more details asap. While the losses are heavy, the collateral ( heh ) damage looks to have been even heavier. DeFiLlama shows the project’s TVL to have dropped from $37M pre-hack, to $26M post-hack . The figure has continued to drop since, presumably as users who are able to withdraw do so, and sits at less than $11M at the time of writing. The EXA token is also down almost 35% since the hack. Will Exactly ever financially recover from this? Credit: BlockSec The attack was made possible due to an insufficient check in the DebtManager contract ( proxy , implementation ) as to whether the market address was valid. This allowed the hacker to pass a fake market address, inserting the victim’s address as _msgSender, and thereby drain users’ collateral.

Of the 4324 ETH (~$7.2M) of total proceeds from the hack, 1500 ETH ($2.5M) have been bridged back to Ethereum, where they remain. BlockSec provided the following chart illustrating the flow of funds: Despite extensive audits from four firms (though none since the debtManager contract was uploaded to GitHub ), Exactly Protocol still got rekt. As we’ve said many times before, audits are not a silver bullet. They should be seen as just one, albeit very important, part of an overall holistic security approach.

BurgerSwap - REKT,7200000,05/28/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/burgerswap-rekt/,"BurgerSwap -  Friday, May 28, 2021 BurgerSwap -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh The hackers are really spoiling us this week with our fourth helping of the exact same meal. Can you ever really get tired of a classic? BurgerSwap was the next in a growing line of protocols to fall victim to the same hack that has been causing issues in recent weeks. Since the market crash, this type of Drive-thru convenience exploit has been flavour of the month, and yet protocols still seem completely oblivious to this weakness in the contract. It’s as if they welcome these hacks with open arms, turning their backs to the counter and feigning surprise as people leave without paying. It certainly appears as though even the easiest jobs can be royally messed up. BurgerSwap simply had to copy UniSwap’s code and yet there was something missing from their order. The question has to be asked, was this negligence? Or something a little seedier? Back to flipping burgers... At around 3 am on May 28th (UTC+8), $7.2M was stolen from #BurgerSwap in just 14 servings. Thieves managed to make off with the following: 4.4k WBNB ($1.6M) 22k BUSD ($22k) 2.5 ETH ($6.8k) 1.4M USDT ($1.4M) 432k BURGER ($3.2M) 142k xBURGER ($1M) 95k ROCKS And each attack looked like this: Flash swap 6k WBNB ($2M) from PancakeSwap. Swap almost all WBNB to 92k BURGER on BurgerSwap. Hackers created their own fake coin (a non-standard BEP-20 token) and formed a new trading pair with $BURGER of 100 fake tokens and 45k BURGER. The 100 fake tokens were then swapped to 4.4k WBNB through the pool from step 3. Attacker then made another swap from 45k BURGER to 4.4k WBNB. In total the attacker received 8.8k WBNB for the two latest steps. Swap 493 WBNB to 108.7k BURGER on BurgerSwap. Repay flash swap. Credit: @FrankResearcher This exploit was made possible by the fact that the attacker could do reentrance and make a second swap before reserves, which are used to calculate the number of tokens in swaps, were updated. Interestingly though, this seems to have been enabled by by a missing x*y=k check. Something which was present in the original univ2pair contract but was seemingly removed in this instance. It seems unlikely that the developers at BurgerSwap would be so careless in their coding but what is the alternative? With the x*y>k check removed, anyone can trigger a swap of any output size while paying only one unit of the input token, a deal straight from the saver menu. The number of hacks we have seen of projects on the BSC over the past week has been off the charts. This whole situation is eerily reminiscent of what happened in Autumn last year on ETH. A disappointing special offer which no-one wanted to see make a return. While no-one likes to see the customers get short changed, it is increasingly difficult to find sympathy for rogue, copycat entrepreneurs who try to emulate and profit from a tried and tested recipe, but who don’t care enough about the consumer to check the ingredients of their products, risking the health of the very people they derive profit from. That said, if you eat at a McDaniels or Burger Duke, are you not at least partly responsible for your own indigestion? BurgerSwap claims they are in the process of producing a detailed compensation plan for their customers. A welcome relief for many whose stomachs have been turned by this whole affair.

The value of a reputation is volatile. Humility brings stability, boast too much and you end up rekt. Value DeFi was exploited today for $7,000,000. Another harsh lesson from the flash loan family. Price before hack - $2.73 Price after hack - $1.87 Releasing this tweet a day before the hack? PRICELESS (The tweet has since been deleted, but our screenshot lives on.) Despite their bold claims of security, it appears the Value DeFi team didn’t know that withdrawals could be made not only through the main Bank contract, but also from the Vault contract through Proxy. Value DeFi used Curve spot price as an oracle. The manipulation occurred at steps 5 and 6. Withdrawal at step 7 is using the wrong Curve function to do the maths. Credit @emilianobonassi Credit @FrankResearcher 15:24 - The exploit came at a particularly bad time for Value DeFi, just 20 minutes before they were due to start an AMA. At 15:41 a user asked about the drop in TVL, which had been over $11M earlier in the day At 15:42, concern was growing, and group members hoped for a UI bug. Then at 15:49 the etherscan link dropped into the chat $7,000,000 had been removed from the Value DeFi vault, with $2,000,000 and the following note returned. At 16:00, just as the AMA was due to start, Stani Kulechov put out the following tweet. Meanwhile, in the AMA: The Value team acknowledged the hack in their Discord at 16:05, yet the AMA questions continued for 40 minutes on unrelated topics, until… $FARM , $AKRO and now $VALUE have been victims of the flash loan, as harsh lessons are dealt out to weak protocols, exposing the weaknesses in their platforms before returning some amount as a sign of “good faith”. Only semi-reputable projects have been targeted; those with high activity and a reasonable TVL. Are these attacks an attempt to teach us something? Flash loans are a controversial topic in the DeFi space, they’ve been behind many attacks and exploits in recent months, however it could be argued that this is simply accelerating our learning process and aiding in the removal of weak protocols. Without flash loans, we would be waiting for a whale to do the same. It’s best that we pass through this stage now, during the genesis stage of decentralised finance, as people who are prepared to take risks are experimenting, trying, and releasing new products daily. Flash loans are here to teach and humble anyone who rushes this process. They are the pinnacle of DeFi - impossible anywhere else, flash loans are a perfect example of the new capabilities that this technology brings. A feature of DeFi, not an exploit of the code. The strongest protocols aren’t affected by these attacks. Some are even benefiting. Flash loans forcibly raise the bar for DeFi developers. Until the new standards are met, people and protocols will get rekt. It will be painful, and it will be public, but because of this we will learn. DeFi will get stronger, and we will develop better practices, stronger code, and a safer environment for future users.

Ionic Money, fresh from rebranding their twice-hacked predecessor Midas, fell victim to the oldest trick in the DeFi playbook - fake collateral. The attackers, masquerading as Lombard Finance team members, convinced Ionic to list their counterfeit LBTC token. Within hours, the exploiters minted themselves a mountain of fake tokens, borrowed everything not nailed down, and vanished through the Tornado Cash mixer - leaving behind a trail of empty vaults and red faces. The Mode team rushed to Twitter with their best ""everything is fine"" impression while Ionic stammered about ""sophisticated social engineering."" In this game of digital masquerade, who's really wearing the mask - the attackers impersonating Lombard, or Ionic pretending they know what they're doing? Credit: Ionic Money , CertiK , Quill Audits , Lombard Finance , ZachXBT , fbslo , USD Denominated Deep in Mode network's backwaters, Ionic's ""ongoing exploit"" tweet on February 4th landed like a grenade in a chicken coop. But before we dive into this fresh disaster, ZachXBT dropped a truth bomb that puts everything in perspective - Ionic is just Midas wearing a carnival mask . The same Midas that got their pockets turned inside out twice in 2023 - first for $660k , then another $600k encore . Because nothing says ""trust us with your money"" quite like a protocol hat-trick of catastrophe. CertiK's front row seats revealed a performance worthy of DeFi's greatest scammer showcase. No complex choreography needed - just deploy fake collateral, drain every vault in sight, bridge to Ethereum, and disappear through Tornado's mixer like a magic trick with extra steps. QuillAudits traced our digital desperado's humble beginnings - 0.01 ETH and a dream. Their masterpiece? A counterfeit LBTC token that would make even the most seasoned rugging enthusiasts slow clap in appreciation. Lombard Finance's terse statement said it all: ""An unofficial LBTC has been deployed as collateral on the Ionic Money platform on Mode network. The on-chain breadcrumbs tell the tale. Exploiter Address: 0x9E34d89C013Da3BF65fc02b59B6F27D710850430 Fake LBTC Contract: 0x964dd444e3192f636322229080a576077b06fba3 The attack itself played out like a speedrunner's masterpiece.

Money Laundering Pipeline: 0x15Ed470607601274df6ED71172614B67001901Eb But our thrifty thief isn't done yet - they're still sitting on 38.34 MBTC worth north of $3.7 million in loans on Move, like a dragon hoarding its crypto treasure. Portfolio showing loans/borrows on Parsec Flow of Funds on Parsec The team's Discord damage control hit peak comedy when one team member explained : ""it was quite a sophisticated social engineering exploit. They had a legitimate oracle, a legitimate whitelisted balancer pool, and a legitimate token contract that had real bridging integrations with LBTC."" Translation: they got fooled by a well-dressed scam. And in a moment of pure DeFi poetry, one member of their Discord asked : “What the hell is social engineering?” Not sure you’re going to make it buddy. Surprised you made it this far. Some call it an inside job , others blame compromised comms. Either way, almost $7 million vanished faster than trust in centralized exchanges. The contagion spread through Mode's ecosystem like a bad case of crypto herpes. Our hacker's borrowed MBTC morphed into financial kryptonite, leaving Ironclad and Layerbank holding bags heavier than their hopium addiction. ""Our markets are solvent!"" Ironclad screamed into the void, right before Merlin's team dropped their selective snapshot bomb. Great news for their chosen ones - instant death for everyone else's MBTC collateral. In DeFi's game of musical chairs, some players start with the seats already bolted to their backs. Under the hood, this wasn't some 200 IQ exploit pulled from the depths of blockchain wizardry. Our craft social engineers skipped Lombard's security theater entirely, turning their mint function into a personal money printer that would make Jerome Powell blush. The scoreboard? 1,204 ETH ($3.2M) already living their best life in Tornado Cash's witness protection program, while another $3.7M sits pretty on Mode, probably waiting for its own spa day at the mixer. Not bad for a day's work impersonating Lombard Finance. Because in 2025's DeFi landscape, the highest APY comes from a well-crafted email signature and a Premium LinkedIn account. When multi-million dollar protocols can be fooled by a fake email address and a counterfeit token, are we building financial infrastructure or just elaborate digital trust falls? Social engineering - DeFi's favorite bedtime story just got another chapter. Ionic money joins the growing list of protocols who learned that smart contracts can't patch human gullibility. They ditched the Midas name after two exploits, but kept the same flawed recipe - trust first, verify never. Mode network's damage control couldn't hide the bitter truth - their flagship protocol got pwned. Meanwhile, Ironclad and Layerbank discovered that in DeFi's game of musical chairs, someone always loses their seat when the music stops. The attackers proved once again that the weakest link in our trustless future isn't code - it's the humans deploying it. No audit can catch a convincing LinkedIn profile, no multisig can stop a smooth-talking scammer. Between Radiant's RAT malware and Ionic's fake Lombard, DeFi's gatekeepers are collecting social engineering war stories faster than yield. While victims cope with empty vaults, somewhere a hacker is already practicing their next corporate signature. Smart contracts might be trustless, but DeFi still runs on trust - so when did we start handing out VIP passes to anyone with a good story and a GitHub repo?

Velocore - Rekt,6800000,06/02/2024,"Zokyo, Hacken, Scalebit",https://rekt.news/velocore-rekt/,"Velocore - Rekt Monday, June 3, 2024 Velocore -  read this article also in : en - es - zh Velocore's high-speed Defi ambitions screech to a halt. The velo in Velocore proved too fast and furious, as the L2 DEX lost over $6.8 million in a devastating exploit on June 2nd across its pools on Linea and zkSync. A vulnerability in Velocore's Balancer-style CPMM contract allowed an attacker to manipulate fee calculations, ultimately draining a sizable chunk of liquidity. The hack led the Linea team to halt block production, which has since resumed. Velocore has offered a 10% bug bounty to the hacker, who has yet to respond. The actions by Linea’s team to halt the chain due to the exploit is posing Centralization concerns . Despite undergoing multiple audits, Velocore's protocol still had an exploitable flaw. What's next for Velocore, a comeback or a permanent pit stop? Credit: Officer CIA , Beosin , Linea , Velocore The ever vigilant crypto gumshoe Officer CIA was the first to spot something fishy with Velocore’s liquidity pools. According to the post-mortem from Velocore , the attacker sourced funds from Tornado Cash, bridged over to execute the dastardly exploit, and then deposited the ill-gotten gains back into Tornado Cash. The flurry of transactions started with the attacker directly invoking velocore__execute() to simulate huge withdrawals and jack up the feeMultiplier. With that jacked-up multiplier inflating effectiveFee1e9 past 100%, the villain executed a flash loan to scoop up most of the tokens and contract the pool. Finally, a small single-token withdrawal minted an egregiously large amount of liquidity tokens due to an underflow error, allowing the drainer to easily repay the flash loan and skip town with $6.8 million in ETH. According to an analysis of the incident from Beosin , the LP Pool lacks permission verification. The attacker directly invoke the velocore__execute function (0xec378808) of the LP contract with a carefully constructed parameter to manipulate the feeMultiplier parameter of the contract. The value of feeMultiplier affects the number of tokens exchanged. The attacker then used the manipulated feeMultiplier parameter to call the execute function (0xd3115a8a) again through the router contract to drain funds from the LP pool.

While Linea stated its goal was to eventually take away the ability to halt the network from its team once significant decentralization had occurred, the protocol defended the decision to halt the chain. ""Most L2s, including Linea, still rely on centralized technical operations which can be leveraged to protect ecosystem participants. Linea's core value is a permissionless, censorship-resistant environment so it was not a decision we took lightly,"" the network wrote . Velocore has initiated negotiations with its attacker to recover the $6.8 million in stolen ETH, they are offering 10% as a white hat bug bounty reward. According to official documents, Velocore claims to have undergone three rounds of audits , completed by Zokyo, Hacken and Scalebit in August of 2023. With their pedal stuck to the metal on insecure code, Velocore has driven itself into a ditch, do they have enough horsepower left to get themselves out? For a protocol that boasted multiple audits and solidified security, Velocore is now looking more like a rusty junker left for scrap after this $6.8 million drain. While dangling a 10% bug bounty carrot, Velocore has yet to lure the hacker out from their Tornado Cash hideout. At this rate, the team may need to invest in psychic mediums to communicate with the drainer from the other side. The question is whether this was an isolated crash, or just the first fender bender in a longer line of recurring collisions for Velocore. With so many blindspots somehow missed in their audit cycle, cautious crypto travelers may want to steer clear until this project gets completely overhauled from the chassis up. Maybe Velocore finds a way to get their motors humming again or will this exploit force them to permanently park their DeFi dreams in the junker lot?

The lending platform was hacked for $6.5M on Ethereum, and Abra’s Magic Internet Money didn't look so magic after all… BlockSec and Peckshield raised the alarm, with the former also advising users to withdraw their assets. An official acknowledgement came shortly after, with the team promising to attempt to restore the MIM peg: To the best of its Ability, the DAO treasury will be buying back MIM from the market to then burn. Just over an hour after the attack began the issue had been mitigated, according to an Abra team member. And the team’s efforts brought MIM back up to around $0.95. With the stablecoin currently hovering around $0.97… …what dark arts will it take for MIM to fully repeg? Credit: Offside Labs , EXVULSEC , Kankodu The root cause of the exploit was, as initially thought , a rounding issue in the CauldronV4 code. The borrow function in CauldronV4 contracts was vulnerable to manipulation of the part parameter (the user’s share of total debt) via repeatedly borrowing and repaying an asset, taking advantage of the rounding error. For a more in-depth analysis, see here . This allowed the attacker drain MIM liquidity from the yvCrv3Crypto and magicAPE cauldrons, taking advantage of the incorrect debt calculation. Step-by-step : 1 Flashloan MIM token with Degenbox 2 Donate MIM token to BentoBox by depositing MIM token to BentoBox with recipient is BentoBox itself (this is a part of ERC-4626 first depositor attacker vector) 3 Repay liabilities for all other users by calling to repayForAll() . However the repayment is not complete such that the elastic value after the repayment is above a threshold 1000 * 1e18 . So the attacker needs to manually repay liabilities for other borrowers to decrease borrow elastic to zero 4 Repeatedly borrow and repay to inflate the share price. Here the vulnerability is well-known as ERC-4626 first depositor (or vault share price inflation) 5 Add collateral and borrow a large amount of MIM token 6 Repay flashloan and take profit The resulting dump of the stolen MIM (for ETH) caused the depeg.

Token holders lost a total of ~$6.5M on Arbitrum, BSC and Etherum, and the DEI stablecoin depegged over 80%. This incident, just over a year since their last appearance , makes Deus DAO the third protocol with three entries on our leaderboard . Deus’ two previous entries were on the project’s original home, FTM, where they don’t appear to have been affected. Since then, DEI has branched out onto other chains. After the alarm was raised , and the root cause identified , Deus eventually acknowledged the hack, as well as confirming a multisig address for whitehats to return funds. But how many times can a thrice-hacked protocol be trusted? Credit: _ adamb , Zellic , 0xProtosec A simple implementation error was introduced into the DEI token contract, in an upgrade last month. The burnFrom function was misconfigured, with the ‘_allowances’ parameters ‘msgSender’ and ‘account’ written into the contract in the wrong order. This created a public (or pubic, according to Peckshield ) burn vulnerability, which an attacker is then able to manipulate and gain control of DEI holders’ approvals and transfer assets directly to their own address. The mis-ordered parameters allow the attacker to set a large token approval for any DEI holder’s address. Then, by burning 0 tokens from the address, the approval is updated to the attacker’s address, who can drain the holder’s funds. See the following step-by-step: identify an address with a huge amount of DEI approve to this address call burnFrom with amount = 0 and this address During the burnFrom it grants approves all tokens from the address to your own call transferFrom Attacker’s address (Arbitrum): 0x189cf534de3097c08b6beaf6eb2b9179dab122d1 Example attack tx (Arbitrum): 0xb1141785… Frontrunner address (BSC): 0x5a647e376d3835b8f941c143af3eb3ddf286c474 Example attack tx (BSC): 0xde2c8718… Attacker’s address (Ethereum): 0x189cf534de3097c08b6beaf6eb2b9179dab122d1 Example attack tx (Ethereum): 0x6129dd42… According to BlockSec’s MetaSleuth , the losses were approximately $5M on Arbitrum, $1.3M on BSC and $135k on Ethereum. Luckily, the exploit on BSC was frontrun, and an on-chain message to the Deus Deployer shows the intent to return the funds. Other whitehats also sprang into action, and over $600k in USDC has so far been returned to a recovery multisig . However, there were also doubts about the usefulness of giving funds back to a team that produced such a trivial bug. Returning rescued funds to a thrice-hacked protocol seems rather counterproductive… An official update mentions a recovery plan for users who lost out in the exploit, and Deus have reached out to the attacker on-chain. But given the account was originally funded via Tornado Cash on BSC, it’s not looking good. Will this be finally be a killing blow for Deus DAO?

On Saturday, the price oracle of plvGLP collateral was manipulated, allowing the attacker to drain their lending pools for a profit of ~$6.5M. According to the official announcement , “ 2.8 Million of the GLP is recoverable, which is worth about $2.4 million. ” The team has appealed to the hacker to negotiate a white-hat bounty. The incident saw the token LODE dump by ~70% and TVL drop to just $11. That’s #77 on the leaderboard for Lodestar Finance. Among Lodestar’s collateral assets is the yield-bearing plvGLP, representing GLP locked in Plutus DAO ’s vault. Using flash loans, the attacker manipulated the plvGLP price reported by Lodestar’s GLPOracle contract, allowing them to “borrow” all the funds supplied on the platform. The Lodestar docs state that: we are relying on Chainlink Oracles for accurate pricing (with the exception of plvGLP) An inviting note for any would-be attackers… Solidity Finance summarised the root cause: The GLPOracle did not properly take into account the impact of a user calling donate() on the GlpDepositor contract, which inflates the assets of the GlpDepositor contract, and therefore the oracle-delivered price of the plvGLP token. Lodestar’s preliminary post mortem gives further details of the exploit, as well as pointing out that “ the oracle can’t be allowed to undergo instantaneous change within the same block. ” Certik’s report contains a full step-by-step of the attack flow. Attacker’s address 0xc29d94386ff784006ff8461c170d1953cc9e2b5c Example exploit tx: 0xc523c630… The 343 ETH ($430k) necessary for the attack was bridged from Polygon three months ago. Following the exploit, the funds were swapped to ETH, bridged back to mainnet and dispersed to multiple addresses . Manipulating the price of collateral has been a popular attack technique since the beginning of DeFi, but especially in recent times, as this incident follows the attacks on both Mango and Moola Markets, who lost $115M, and $8.4M respectively, in October. The above examples had funds partially or fully returned, ensuring users didn’t totally lose out. Yet two days have now passed since the initial attack on Lodestar, and no mention of any planned reparations has yet been made. Forking an existing project, even long-standing and resilient protocols, does not guarantee the same security. But this paragraph in the Lodestar documentation suggests they may not have realised as such… Lodestar is a Compound fork at the core, and Compound has some of the most battle-tested contracts in all of DeFi. We have added code to support a few changes we have made, namely adding Arbitrum support, DPX, MAGIC and plvGLP support, tweaking some Interest Models, and a few other small changes.

Alchemix - REKT,6500000,06/16/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/alchemix-rekt/,"Alchemix -  Friday, June 18, 2021 alchemix -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh DeFi is a volatile protoscience. When a protocol becomes caput mortuum , doctor rekt is on hand to study the elements and document the process, including the final reaction. The Alchemix post-mortem shows how modern-day alchemists almost succeeded at safely creating gold out of the ether. Alchemix's initial offering allowed users to deposit DAI and take a loan in alUSD, representing the future yield generated by their deposit. Over time, the loan is repaid with the yield, and thus; the transmutation is complete. However, when the team tried to expand their accepted collateral to include deposits of Ether, their experiment took an unexpected turn... When the same process was implemented with ETH, (minting alETH in return), some users discovered that the protocol assigned them no debt. Users were able to use their alETH as well as withdraw the ETH that was supposed to be locked as collateral. After being notified that their own users were exploiting them , the Alchemix team reacted quickly , and temporarily paused the minting of new alETH while they worked to find a solution. This reverse-rugpull has left alETH undercollateralized by ~2700 ETH, or ~$6.5M at time of writing; a debt which must now be repaid by Alchemix. The protocol has made a public appeal to their users to return the funds and help repay the debt. We spoke to Alchemix co-founder Scoopy Trooples to find out if he thought the appeal would be successful. rekt: Hi Scoopy. It’s been two days now since the bug was found, how has the incident affected you and your team? Scoopy: It's been stressful, but thankfully we have had a lot of support from our community and people all over the industry. We are confident in our ability to get alETH solvent again, and we are extremely fortunate that no user lost funds in this incident. Going forward our team will exercise an even greater abundance of caution in all areas of our operation. We realize that protocols are lucky to get second chances, and almost never get third chances. Our team is committed to being better and learning from our mistakes so we never repeat them. rekt: Alchemix had over $1b TVL at the time of the incident, that’s a lot of responsibility - can you give us some insight into how you felt when you were alerted to the issue? Scoopy: Having such a high tvl comes with an incredible burden. When we first realized something was wrong, the first thing we did was to pause the contracts. Constant worry filled my mind and it felt like my blood was on fire as we researched in the war room to find the root cause. We found relief when we got to the answer and realized all funds were safe, but still knew we had a lot of work to make things right. rekt: Alchemix made a public appeal for users to return the withdrawn funds - how successful has that been? Scoopy: We have had many in the community say they will do it but we have not yet started the program. We will have a portal up on our app page in a few days where users can voluntarily return their free eth or alETH. We will see how far that gets us, and are weighing several options for how to cover whatever doesn't get returned. We'll be sure to include community feedback in whatever course of action we end up taking. rekt: How many users took the opportunity to withdraw “free” ETH? Scoopy: In the end, it will be anyone who borrowed alETH. The bug repaid all the debt, so even those who wish not to exploit this incident have no choice but to. rekt: How will the missing $6.5m affect the future development of the protocol? Scoopy: It all depends on how much our users give back. If we get > 25% of it, our treasury's non-ALCX holdings of approx $4m will be able to cover it. It will mean we will not be able to be as aggressive in hiring and marketing for some time, but we will recover since we have good cash flow. If we have a more tepid response to the voluntary returning program, then we will explore further measures  to make it solvent. We have been offered help from many in the space, so we have some solid options. rekt: Thanks Scoopy. Any final message for our readers? Scoopy: We are conducting an internal review to ensure we can eliminate mistakes and errors. We thank the DeFi community for all the support and will move forward more battled-hardened and wiser. It seems the Alchemix team are confident that they can take on this debt and continue to build. The power of a loyal community can not be understated in DeFi, especially when a protocol requires some forgiveness. Despite this embarrassing incident, some users never lost faith in Alchemix, like this user who used the misappropriated funds to re-invest straight back into the protocol. Will the rest of the community return the required 25%, or will the Alchemists have to create a different solution?

Astroport - Rekt,6400000,07/30/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/astroport-rekt/,"Astroport - Rekt Wednesday, July 31, 2024 Astroport - Rekt read this article also in : en - es On July 30th, Astroport, a DEX on the Terra network, fell victim to a hack resulting in losses of roughly $6.4 million. The attack exploited a vulnerability that was known and patched in April, only to be accidentally reintroduced in a June upgrade. This oversight raises serious questions about the state of security practices in the wake of regulatory actions against Terraform Labs (TFL) by the SEC. The exploit sheds light on the complex interplay between regulatory actions and ecosystem security, highlighting potential gaps in the maintenance of critical infrastructure. It also underscores the importance of heeding security warnings and the need for robust processes to prevent the reintroduction of known vulnerabilities. This incident is more than just another entry in the long list of DeFi exploits, it's a stark reminder of the consequences of ignored warnings and regulatory actions. As the summer heats up, so does the frequency of crypto heists. But when old bugs come back to haunt us and warnings fall on deaf ears, who's really to blame? Credit: Rarma , Cyvers , Astroport , Terra , Jacob Gadikian , _gabrielShapir0 , Zaki Manian , FXStreet Terra aka Luna is a name that instills nostalgia and PTSD, depending on who you ask. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of its algorithmic stablecoin disaster , Terra 2.0 promised a fresh start. But old habits die hard in the wild west of crypto and it seems some bugs are harder to kill than others. First reported by Rarma , as he poured one out for ASTRO holders, including himself, as he spotted millions flowing through suspicious transactions. Astroport acknowledged the exploit shortly after. As the exploit unraveled, Terra's validators pulled the emergency brake, halting the chain . In a twist of crypto irony, a critical IBC bug , once vanquished in April's emergency patch across Cosmos chains, rose from the dead in Terra's June upgrade. Like a horror movie villain, the vulnerability came back with a vengeance, ready for its summer blockbuster debut. With the bug reintroduced, the stage was set for a classic crypto caper. The attacker, wielding the resurrected vulnerability like a cursed wand, took advantage of a reentrancy vulnerability in the timeout callback of ibc-hooks to conjure tokens out of thin air, leaving Terra's defenses in tatters. The dark magic summoned a haul of 60 million ASTRO tokens, 3.5 million USDC, 500,000 USDT, and 2.7 BTC from the abyss, totaling roughly $6.4 million in ill-gotten gains at the time of the exploit. Roughly 3.5 hours later after halting the chain, Terra's digital heart started beating again. The chain's emergency chain upgrade completed, transactions flowed once more through its veins. Validators holding over 67% of the voting power on Terra threw on their digital armor, upgrading nodes to fend off the exploit's encore, with more validators expected to upgrade soon. According to Astroport , the attacker's Terra address, hoarding 20 million ASTRO, was swiftly frozen by Astroport, leaving their loot as stagnant and lifeless as a tundra landscape. The final tally? A whopping 58 million ASTRO tokens pilfered, with 33 million making a bridge trip to Neutron. On Neutron, the stolen ASTRO tokens were removed from the exploiter’s wallet via TokenFactory Force Transfer. The remaining 20 million ASTRO on Terra? Blacklisted faster than a Trumper in Hollywood. ASTRO fell roughly 56% in the aftermath of the attack, according to Coingecko data . Attacker’s address on Terra: terra1wrve5z5vsmrgy6ldcveq93aldr6wk3qmxavs4j Attacker’s address on Neutron: Neutron16wynag7xgfy35sp8c5ls25c0je7dydmvq5pnd8 They also bridged some funds to Ethereum and swapped to ETH.

In a twist that adds a layer of frustration to this incident, it turns out that vulnerabilities had been flagged by Jacob Gadikian, a former prominent figure in the Cosmos ecosystem. Gadikian had recently highlighted the risks , but his warnings were largely dismissed by those in a position to act. ""This is why I stopped: coordinated harassment endured while making security reports,"" Gadikian stated following the hack. Jacob even shared a solution to mitigate the issue. “When there's a security patch in comet, IBC, cosmos, etc, that shows in go.mod and that is why I automated it. This PR changes two files , go.mod and go.sum” Gadikian added , ""If amulet were doing what I did, this would not have happened. It is trivial to set up monitoring for all cosmos chains based on go.mod. I know, cause I did."" His experience raises troubling questions about the ecosystem's approach to security and its treatment of those who raise alarms. However, in an ecosystem as intricate and often contentious as IBC, it's important to note that there are often multiple sides to every story. Adding fuel to the dumpster fire, it seems Terra's dev team may have been taken out at the knees. As pointed out by gabrielShapir0 , Terra/TFL patched the vulnerability back in April, only to accidentally un-patch it in a later update. With TFL potentially running on a skeleton crew post-SEC action, such an oversight was perhaps inevitable. Zaki Manian confirmed , ""Terra was part of the original vulnerability coordination but they accidentally reverted the patch in the June upgrade."" The exploit's success may be partially attributed to the reduced capacity of the Terra team following the SEC's actions against Terraform Labs. The SEC's actions, meant to protect investors, may have inadvertently left the henhouse door wide open. gabrielShapir0 could not have summed it up better , the SEC shuts down TFL, no one is left to patch known a Terra vulnerability, someone mints infinite $ASTRO and dumps it to oblivion. Slow clap for the SEC. As the Astroport saga unfolds, we're left with a patchwork of patched and unpatched vulnerabilities, ignored warnings and regulatory aftershocks. Terra's phoenix-like resurrection seems to have inherited more than just its predecessor's name. In this blockchain Groundhog Day of exploits and finger-pointing, how many more project implosions must we endure before crypto prioritizes unbreakable security over the blame game? The Astroport exploit serves as a stark reminder of the fragility within our blockchain ecosystems. From overlooked vulnerabilities to regulatory pressures, the crypto world faces challenges on multiple fronts This exploit could have been prevented and there could likely be more than one party at fault. From developers reverting patches to ignored warnings and regulatory actions leaving projects understaffed. This tangled web of oversights and missteps reveals a systemic vulnerability in how the ecosystem approaches security. The IBC community now faces a crossroads. Will it continue down the path of reactive patches and finger-pointing or forge a new way forward with proactive security and collaborative problem-solving? The stakes are high in defi, can we afford to keep treating security as an afterthought rather than a fundamental pillar?

First reported by spreekaway on X, the attack involved a critical approval exploit,  affecting users on Arbitrum and Ethereum. Roughly 80% of the funds were returned within a day, but the remainder has been transferred to 2 addresses, possibly as a bounty. During the canceled audit contest this past November, a security researcher caught the same bug behind the attack. “Seneca is using battle-tested code, publicly verifiable on Seneca's GitHub .” Seneca made this statement on X shortly after abruptly closing their Sherlock audit contest due to potential code licensing issues. Weeks later they went into battle and launched without fear, under the belief that they had enough armor thanks to the audit done by Halborn Security. The source of the bug, the Chamber contract, was audited prior to deployment, according to Seneca. To note, some of Halborn’s findings were approval related, this exact issue was not highlighted. Clearly the other warriors on the battlefield were up for the challenge, because it only took them less than 2 months to find cracks in Seneca’s armor. Post-hack, others in the community claimed they were getting booted from Discord for reporting the bug. Clearly Seneca knew there were issues, but chose the reckless route. Revoke approvals if you were unfortunate to invest in this disaster.

Credit: Crypto Smith , Seneca , Spreek , Beosin Alert The exploit took advantage of a bug in Seneca's code to drain assets from users who had active approvals to certain contracts. The attacker used constructed calldata parameters to call transferfrom and transfer tokens that were approved to the project's contracts to the attacker's address. This allowed the exploiter to steal any undeployed LSTs from the user's wallet. Contracts couldn’t be paused due to a bad implementation of the pause function. Because the pause and unpause functions are internal , there is no way to call them. The exploiter even stole 50k senUSD from the Seneca’s team’s address . 50K that was approved 33 days earlier , but never deployed. Should we wonder why? Over 1.9k of ETH was stolen involving various LSTs that were swapped for ETH. Currently being held in 3 addresses. Exploiter addresses 1: 0x94641c01a4937f2c8ef930580cf396142a2942dc Exploiter addresses 2: 0x5217c6923a4efc5bcf53d9a30ec4b0089f080ed0 Exploiter addresses 3: 0xe83b072433f025ef06b73e0caa3095133e7c5bd0 Example attack tx: 0x9f371267 Seneca addressed the exploit a few hours after. Instructing users to revoke approvals. But the damage was already done. A few hours later, Seneca posted an onchain message on X addressing a Whitehat, requesting the funds be returned for a 20% bounty. Shortly after, the hacker returned 1,537 ETH to the Gnosis Safe address and transferred 300 ETH to 2 new addresses. Address 1: 0x0C77350C4BDe539FfCee261A149dbc6e6afDA517 Address 2: 0xa07c64E55F52AAf5c361321CF01b316eCbddB5A9 They claim a post-mortem will be published once all of the information is collected. The exploiter's address behind the attack was funded 5 months ago through FixedFloat . It remained dormant, until shortly before the attack was carried out on Seneca. Follow the flow of funds : Will Seneca do their due diligence or continue the pattern of irresponsibility? The warning signs were there from several in the Web3 security community. Everybody sounded the alarm, except Seneca. Seneca acted bulletproof with their battle tested (i.e. forked) code. A team member, in a since deleted Tweet bragged about their pristine code, all while trashing Sherlock in the process. Claiming no legal liability is a nice shady cherry on top of this hot mess. There is a thin line between cockiness and ignorance and Seneca fell face first on one side. Which side do you think it is? Maybe they should have spent more time getting their code locked tight instead of marketing a broken project. There is no such thing as having too many eyes on your code. The more audits, contests and security reviews the better. The worst case scenario was likely avoided, thanks to the attacker returning most of the funds, but this could have been avoided. If you don’t pay the white hats to try to break your code, they'll be forced to make an example of you. But given the way Seneca handled this situation, can you blame them?

An incorrect share valuation helps to add another notch to the now infamous flash loan exploit season on the BSC. Yet another fork of a fork has rolled off the conveyor belt with $6.3M falling straight into the hands of the hacker. Despite this being a slightly more sophisticated attack than some of the previous occurrences, all the familiar hallmarks are present. Another BSC protocol caught with its trousers down. Why do these projects continue to leave themselves vulnerable to such savage beatings?

A startlingly familiar series of events led to the Harvest Hacker getting away with over $25m in stolen funds on that occasion and look who was boasting about their new collaboration just two days before this latest incident.

The attacker passed a malicious proposal transferring the funds directly from the treasury before dumping them onto the market for just ~$1M. AUDIO is used for user rewards and artist tips, as well as for governance purposes on the music-streaming service. Shortly after the alarm was raised , Audius announced the “ unauthorized transfer ”, whilst asking for help with the investigation: “ If you'd like to help our response team, please reach out. ” Pause, rewind, play… Credit: Audius , Spreek According to the official post mortem , the attacker was able to reinitialise governance contracts, delegating a large number of governance tokens to themself and bypassing safeguards meant to limit malicious proposals. Then, with their vastly increased voting power, they could pass a proposal to transfer 18M AUDIO tokens out of the treasury and straight to their own address. Audius uses AudiusAdminUpgradabilityProxy to make any upgrades to the governance contracts. The proxyAdmin address is set as the address of the main governance contract , in storage slot 0. However, this creates a collision with OpenZeppelin's Initializable contract , leading to a bug which allowed the attacker to take control of the governance contract and change parameters on any of Audius’ Governance, Staking & DelegateManagerV2 contracts. For further details, see OpenZeppelin docs on storage collisions. The post mortem summarises the actions of the attacker as follows: With this, the attacker was able to (1) Re-define voting on the Audius protocol and modify the governance contract’s guardian address (2) Set the governance address of both the Staking & DelegateManagerV2 contracts to that of a custom deployment of the Audius governance contract 0xbdbb5945f252bc3466a319cdcc3ee8056bf2e569) and abuse the Audius protocol by Mark an erroneous delegation of 10,000,000,000,000 $AUDIO to themselves in an attempt to pass a governance vote. (No circulating supply impact / confined to storage of Staking & Delegation contracts) Mark a second erroneous delegation of 10,000,000,000,000 $AUDIO to themselves in an attempt to pass a governance vote, which did pass and transferred the funds. (No circulating supply impact / confined to storage of Staking & Delegation contracts) Transferring 18,564,497 $AUDIO tokens from the community treasury: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4227bca8ed4b8915c7eec0e14ad3748a88c4371d4176e716e8007249b9980dc9 Attacker’s address: 0xa0c7BD318D69424603CBf91e9969870F21B8ab4c The attacker then went on to dump the AUDIO in a single transaction via Uniswap v2, incurring major slippage and making off with just 704 ETH (~$1M). The funds were then deposited into Tornado Cash around 10 hours later. Despite the extreme price action as the attacker dumped the loot, the price of AUDIO has held up well since the incident. A quick response time from the team (plus help ), and the loss coming from the treasury, rather than users pockets, likely minimised the fallout. The contracts had been audited twice, by Kudelski and OpenZeppelin , and the vulnerability is a known issue . However, this doesn’t look to have knocked Audius off the DeFi playlist for good.

DeltaPrime Blue on Arbitrum suffers $5.98 million loss in private key compromise. Seems like DeltaPrime's vision of the future doesn't include robust key management. Whispers of a notorious nation-state hacker group are already circulating through the cryptosphere. Could the infamous Lazarus Group be behind this precision strike? While DeltaPrime scrambles to reassure users, questions loom. Could we be entering a new era of state-sponsored hacks exploiting protocols caught with their pants down? Credit: Chaofan Shou , DeltaPrime , Hacken , ZachXBT The DeltaPrime drama unfolded like a well-rehearsed heist movie, with the attacker playing the role of a digital Danny Ocean. According to first responder, Chaofan Shou , a compromised admin address on Arbitrum was used to upgrade DeltaPrime's proxy contracts to a malicious contract. Compromised Admin Address: 0x40E4172e595Fb5B3076dC6d0A1a24d885b881Afb DeltaPrime’s Compromised Proxy Admin Address: 0xd550cfeA0BFFDC81B2dEe7B6d915D9D9e31d83A2 This nefarious upgrade allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their own deposit amounts across all pools. Talk about cooking the books. DeltaPrime, in a stunning display of captain obvious energy, acknowledged the loss , confirming the root cause to be a private key compromise. But let's dive deeper into this rabbit hole, courtesy of Hacken's breakdown . For the Opening Act: Our digital Danny received 0.19 ETH for gas fees, funded via Across Protocol . Even hackers need to fuel up. Funding Transaction: 0xeb034ecfa6b1eaa95bc659883eff8a106fd5d7262da54848525f656597f55d3f Setting the Stage: The attacker deployed their malicious proxy contract. The trap was set. Malicious Proxy Contract: 0xD4CA224a176A59ed1a346FA86C3e921e01659E73 The Main Event: The upgrading spree began. Five proxy contracts were upgraded with malicious implementations in just 8 confirmed blocks. Efficiency at its finest, folks. First Upgrade Transaction: 0x2e6748e92e4f833d3ea3c2aa7d11e74aa502e2cfcab8398dc2056a83a1b7caae The First Withdrawal: Barely seconds after the upgrades, 2.44M USDC vanished. Talk about not letting the ink dry.

The grand finale came with the attacker riding off into the sunrise with their ill-gotten gains. The loot bag? A mix of USDC, WBTC, and WETH – all swiftly swapped to ETH. Because who doesn't love a good money laundering challenge? As a parting gift , the Proxy Admin was changed on all victim contracts. Locking the barn door after the horse has bolted, attacker edition. DeltaPrime claims their Avalanche deployment is safe , tucked away behind multisigs and cold wallets. Cold comfort for the Arbitrum users left out in the cold, wouldn't you say? The team promises that ""the insurance pool will cover any potential losses where possible/necessary."" DeltaPrime was audited several times , but no amount of code scrutiny can catch a leaked private key. Auditors cannot audit human error. The attacker's loot currently sits untouched, a $5.98 million middle finger to DeltaPrime and the wider DeFi community. Here's where things get spicy. Our favorite blockchain sleuth, ZachXBT, dropped a possible tantalizing hint : ""Idk if related but they were one of the teams with the DPRK IT workers I reached out to warn (was told they were all removed)."" Could this be more than just a garden-variety hack? Are we looking at the handiwork of the infamous Lazarus Group? The plot thickens faster than a badly coded smart contract. DeltaPrime serves as yet another stark reminder in DeFi, your protocol's security is only as strong as your weakest private key – and your team's ability to keep it private. In this current era of digital heists, are we watching the evolution of crime or the devolution of security? DeltaPrime's $5.98 million stumble exposes the fragile underbelly of DeFi's grand ambitions. A single compromised key, and poof – millions vanish faster than you can say ""Defi."" The Lazarus Group whispers add a spicy geopolitical flavor to this already pungent dish of incompetence. As DeltaPrime scrambles to plug the holes in their sinking ship, users are left treading water, clinging to promises of insurance and cold comfort. This hack serves as another brutal wake-up call. In the world of DeFi, your protocol is one leaked private key away from becoming a cautionary tale. With nation-state actors potentially entering the fray, are we witnessing the birth of financial warfare 2.0? Or is this just the same old story of greed and incompetence, now with a shiny new blockchain bow?

The Inverse oracle “ misuses the balances of assets in the pool to directly calculate the LP token price. ” By using the flash loaned WBTC to make large swaps through the underlying pool, the balance of assets was manipulated before and after borrowing, allowing the exploiter to withdraw an inflated amount of DOLA. 1: Flashloan 27,000 WBTC via AAVE 2: Deposit 225 WBTC to crv3crypto with 5,375 crv3crypto minted 3: Deposit 5,375 crv3crypto to y Curve-3Crypto with 4,906 yvCurve-3Crypto minted 4: Deposit 4,906 yvCurve-3Crypto to Inverse Finance as collateral 5: Swap 26,775 WBTC to 75,403,376 USDT to manipulate the collateral price 6: Borrow 10,133,949 DOLA, which is extremely more than normal 7: Reverse swap 75,403,376 USDT to 26,626 WBTC 8: Swap 10,133,949 DOLA to 9,881,355 3Crv 9: Remove 9,881,355 3Cry to get 10,099,976 USDT 10: Swap 10,000,000 USDT to 451 WBTC 11: Repay flashloan Funds were then withdrawn from the contract and swapped to ETH, 1000 of which have been deposited into Tornado Cash, and 68 remain in the address. Exploiter’s address, funded via Tornado Cash 2 mins before exploit: 0x7b792e49f640676b3706d666075e903b3a4deec6 Exploit contract: 0xf508c58ce37ce40a40997c715075172691f92e2d Exploit tx: 0x958236… Withdrawing 100k USDT from the contract: 0x3d2f86… Withdrawing 53 WBTC ($1.1M) from the contract: 0x9959f8… Peckshield further confused matters after the attack by suggesting that the malicious tx had in fact been executed by a front-running bot, who had sniped the tx before the exploiter. Others disagreed with the claim, and as the address was funded, and then the loot laundered, via Tornado Cash so quickly. It seems unlikely that we’re dealing with an accidental attack, however, it’s not hard to imagine such a turn of events happening in the future. After two hacks in such quick succession, and with bad debt making up over half of the protocol’s 20M TVL, will Inverse be able to survive this crypto winter?

Attacks can happen at any time, but the weekends are always busiest. Social tokens haven’t taken off yet, but that doesn’t mean Roll didn’t get rekt. $5.7 million gone , ripped from the liquidity pools of multiple DeFi influencers and “celebrities”. DeFi is a danse macabre, where your status is irrelevant. The rekt reaper pays no heed to fame or influence, if there’s a hole in the code or in your own OPSEC then just it’s a matter of time until the music stops. Over 7 hours since the attack and still no public statement from @tryrollhq . Saying ""It's 4AM, we'll announce tomorrow"" is bad enough, but not following up on that is even worse. Igor Igamberdiev states that this attack was a possible private key compromise or inside job, and that “Currently, the attacker has sold all the stolen tokens, but it remains unclear whether they have access to other elements of Roll’s infrastructure.” The tokens were taken from a Roll hot wallet, which not only received social tokens from Roll’ multisig but was also sponsored by Roll multisig owners. As @ameensol pointed out on Twitter; this attack could have been avoided if Roll had not “insisted on a fixed supply token setup where they sit on a time bomb of 10% of the supply of each social token minted on their platform” The fixed token supply model introduces a lot of trust assumptions; someone has to LP vesting for both the creator and TryRoll incentive alignment fades as creator sells We reached out to the Roll team but had no response. Apparently, the hacker was not bullish long-term on any of the celebrities, as they chose to immediately dump each token for ETH and escape through Tornado Swap to enter a reasonable position of number 14 on our leaderboard . This disrespectful dump caused each token to drop in price. This was an unusual attack due to it’s personal nature. A direct insult to each token owner, and an interesting insight into the negative aspects of tokenising yourself. This hack gives a taste of what social token owners will experience in the future. How long until KSI has an RSI? When can we put Bollinger Bands on PewDiePie? In a not so distant future... A top Youtuber releases a particularly good “Elders react to unboxing challenge” video, goes viral, and everybody gets rich as their stochastic crossover goes through the 20 band due to everyone “smashing that subscribe button”. The next day somebody uncovers a tweet from 2014 - the Youtuber has been caught using discriminatory language against Tumblr users, a death cross forms between the 200 and the 50 MA and their token dumps into oblivion. The Youtuber is cancelled and everybody gets liquidated. No space is safe, even social tokens have their dark side. Poor management decisions built up a tempting treasury , and somebody decided to take it. If it was an inside job or an audit oversight is yet to be known, as we still await any announcement from Roll. This attack might slow down Social Tokens, but it won’t stop them.

An Un-SOL-ved Mystery,5300000,08/02/2022,N/A,https://rekt.news/unsolved-mystery/,"An Un-SOL-ved Mystery Wednesday, August 3, 2022 Solana -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh Panic, chaos, suspicion. All are inevitable reactions to an indiscriminate attack, where nobody knows who’s safe, and who’s next. Approximately 8,000 addresses on the Solana network have been compromised, draining a total of ~$5.3M. Shortly after 11pm UTC last night, news began to circulate of wallets being drained , with SOL and USDC transferred directly into exploiter addresses. Initially, the possibility of a network-wide bug led to panic over whether this would mean all Solana accounts had been compromised. But as the stolen funds were tallied, it became clear that the scope of the threat was not existential, but still perturbing. And although the exact vulnerability is still to be uncovered, some clues have emerged. But fear leads to rumours… …and separating the signal from the noise is no easy task. Credit: OtterSec , CIA Officer Early reports of missing funds from Phantom wallet users were followed by accounts of an identical breach affecting Slope wallets, with mobile users making up the majority of victims. It quickly became established that exploited addresses had been signing the transfers directly, i.e. this wasn’t a simple, but widespread, case of phishing for malicious approvals. However, that meant something far more worrying; the private keys to the affected addresses were compromised. Was there a leak in a browser extension? Mobile malware? Others suspected something deeper, such as an ECDSA nonce reuse issue (as in the case of Anyswap , now Multichain), though it seems unlikely that all 8k addresses would have made the 2+ transactions necessary for such an exploit. News even broke of a widespread malware attack on GitHub repositories, though was quickly dismissed as coincidental and overblown. Each new theory added to the confusion, and as the community battled to make sense of the exploit, the only safe havens seemed to be hardware wallets or even CEXs. And all the while, amid the chaos, the number of drained accounts (currently around 8k) continued to grow. At least one Ethereum address is also known to be affected. Potentially as a result of porting a common seed phrase between the two chains. With theories ranging from leaky extensions to a mobile malware epidemic to a bug in the underlying cryptography… it remains to be seen exactly how so many users came to be affected. However, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko points to an “ iOS supply chain attack ”, affecting users who have their “ key imported or generated on mobile ”. In order to help cut through the noise, any affected users should fill out this form . While investigations into the root cause continue, attention has also been directed towards the exploiter addresses. One whitehat took it upon themselves to DDOS the attacker , slowing their progress, but causing downtime for block explorers in the process. Another anon even claims to have obtained the exploiter’s info by sending an NFT linked to an image, which logged the IP that sent the request when viewed. The four exploiter addresses identified on Solana hold a total of $5,276,392.50 at time of writing: Htp9MGP8Tig923ZFY7Qf2zzbMUmYneFRAhSp7vSg4wxV ($3,618,270.02) CEzN7mqP9xoxn2HdyW6fjEJ73t7qaX9Rp2zyS6hb3iEu ($955,601.51) 5WwBYgQG6BdErM2nNNyUmQXfcUnB68b6kesxBywh1J3n ($446,965.00) GeEccGJ9BEzVbVor1njkBCCiqXJbXVeDHaXDCrBDbmuy ($255,555.97) This dashboard provides a useful breakdown of the stolen funds, including by token type (50% USDC, 35% SOL, 15% Other) and affected wallets by loss (top 3: $246k, $125k, $100k). While Solana’s appeal has always been focused on ( somewhat exaggerated ) claims of speed and affordability, will such a widespread attack erode users’ trust in the security of the ecosystem? Though this incident is unrelated to Solana’s underlying tech, it will be hard to shake the stigma that jumpy retail users will ascribe to the network. The price of SOL did show a noticeable drop around the time the news broke, but there has been no major crash, suggesting that the panic is now fully under control. But the cryptosphere is wary, yesterday’s attack on Nomad Bridge was as chaotic in its execution as today’s rumour mill. No surprise, then, that CT (as well as your anonymous author) loves a good conspiracy theory … In this wild-west industry, the promise of short term gains often blinds users to the basic tenets of personal security: Use a hardware wallet, diversify risks, and don’t go chasing APYs across risky bridges.

The number of names listed on our leaderboard is steadily rising, and these are not all fast forks or cheap copy-paste protocols. THORChain has a dedicated user base, and their peak market cap reached nearly $5 billion just two months ago (now at $1.2B).

The code contains an over-ride loop, designed only for use in vaultTransferEvent transactions, which the hacker was able to manipulate. The hacker was able to wrap the router with their own contract , allowing them to access this over-ride. A transaction was sent with call value of 0 and deposit amount of 0. However, the over-ride loop caused the transaction’s msg.value, set at 200, to be mistakenly read as the txvalue(). The exploit was then used in a loop, draining liquidity in various coins: 2,500 ETH 57,975.33 SUSHI 8.7365 YFI 171,912.96 DODO 514.519 ALCX 1,167,216.739 KYL 13.30 AAVE Although the code contains a comment that explicitly states... ”// it is important to keep this part outside the above loop” … the vulnerability was left open, and looks to have been a costly oversight for the ThorChain team. According to the incident report: ”The fix is to make the over-ride only happen if it specifically is a vaultTransferEvent” It seems this is something that could have been foreseen and prevented long ago. Creating a secure cross-chain bridge is one of the most important milestones for the industry right now, and the race is on to be the first to provide it. As AAVE have hinted that they will release something soon, it seems that this is a prize even the giants of DeFi cannot resist fighting for.

Shezmu - Rekt,4900000,09/20/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/shezmu-rekt/,"Shezmu - Rekt Monday, September 23, 2024 Shezmu -  read this article also in : en - es Shezmu's vault became the latest battleground where $4.9 million vanished faster than a mirage in the desert. But in a twist worthy of a crypto thriller, the saga unfolded not with a bang, but with a negotiation. On September 20th, Shezmu found itself in the crosshairs of an opportunistic hacker who had stumbled upon a critical flaw - a vault accepting collateral that could be minted by anyone. With this vulnerability, the attacker managed to borrow an arbitrary amount of ShezUSD, draining millions from the protocol. Yet, in a move that would make even the most seasoned poker players sweat, Shezmu called the hacker's bluff. They laid their cards on the table: return the funds for a 10% bounty and walk away scot-free, or face the full force of the law within 24 hours. The hacker, unfazed, countered with a demand for 20%. In a game of crypto chicken, Shezmu blinked first, agreeing to the 20% bounty. In a world where code is law, but negotiation saves the day, who really holds the winning hand - the hacker with the loot, or the protocol with the flexibility to bend? Credit: Chaofan Shou , Shezmu Chaofan Shou, co-founder of blockchain analytics firm Fuzzland, sounded the alarm : ""ShezmuTech has been hacked / rugged. ~$4.9M worth of $ShezUSD stolen."" The culprit? A vault with a gaping vulnerability - it accepted collateral that could be minted by anyone. This fatal flaw allowed the attacker to borrow an arbitrary amount of ShezUSD, effectively printing money faster than Jerome Powell on a sugar rush. Just 17 days before the exploit, on September 3rd, Shezmu had deployed a contract upgrade: 0x8db5356ec348a991adaadfd7f366d72eccafcb0113c7ac31f1dddde9c8c3f81e Did this upgrade introduce the vulnerability? Or did it merely fail to patch an existing one? In the fast-paced world of DeFi, even routine upgrades can become ticking time bombs. A trail of addresses and transactions emerged, painting a clearer picture of the exploit: Attack Contract: 0xEd4B3d468DEd53a322A8B8280B6f35aAE8bC499C Shezmu Attacker (created contract): 0xA3a64255484aD65158AF0F9d96B5577F79901a1D Attack Contract created: 0x39328ea4377a8887d3f6ce91b2f4c6b19a851e2fc5163e2f83bbc2fc136d0c71 The attacker didn't just stumble upon a vulnerability; they crafted a bespoke contract to exploit it. Sometimes in the world of DeFi, your greatest threat might be the anonymous dev next door. But even the most carefully laid plans can go awry in the volatile realm of crypto. During the exploit, Chaofan Shou noticed something interesting : “Due to low liquidity, these $4.9M worth of $ShezUSD are swapped to only $700K.” Could a master heist have been foiled by market mechanics? As news of the attack spread like wildfire through the crypto-sphere, Shezmu's team didn't waste a moment. Within hours, Shezmu's team sprang into action, issuing a statement urging users to steer clear of the dApp while they investigated. Shezmu reached out to the attacker with an offer they hoped couldn't be refused: a 10% bounty in exchange for the safe return of the funds. The message was clear - play ball, and we'll call it a white-hat hack. Refuse, and face the full force of the law. But our hacker wasn't about to fold so easily. The on-chain conversation unfolded with surprising civility, considering millions were at stake. Threats of legal action met with polite rebuttals, and in the end, a deal was struck. Shortly after, the funds began trickling back. Shezmu confirmed recovering the stolen funds, minus the agreed-upon bounty, and stated a post-mortem is forthcoming. Stolen Funds Returned: 0x058a453abb03803aacfcc94cbeb410ceb56aa8aa2edb4ad3efa3e78522980cba The community watched in real-time as a potential catastrophe transformed into a masterclass in crisis management. In the aftermath, Shezmu emerged battered but not beaten. But here's where the plot thickens. Remember that low liquidity mentioned earlier? Turns out, it might have been the key to this whole resolution. As Chaofan Shou, our eagle-eyed first responder, pointed out: ""Due to low liquidity, these $4.9M worth of $ShezUSD are swapped to only $700K."" Suddenly, that 20% bounty on the full $4.9 million starts looking pretty attractive, doesn't it? In the end, was it the threat of legal action, the allure of a hefty bounty, or a hacker's change of heart that saved the day? Or perhaps, it was the cold, hard math of a liquidity crunch that turned our black hat white. While Shezmu’s swift negotiation saved the day, it can't erase the glaring oversight in their security practices. Shezmu failed to scrutinize their September 3rd contract upgrade, leaving the door wide open for an enterprising hacker. In the end, was it skill or luck that kept Shezmu from total ruin? Their hasty 20% bounty might have saved millions, but it's a band-aid on a bullet wound. And the soundtrack to this all-too-familiar scene? Cue the broken record music - another exploit after an upgrade. In DeFi, yesterday's patch is tomorrow's exploit, and every upgrade is a roll of the dice. In a world where code is law, but human error is constant, who's really in control - the devs, the auditors, or the hackers waiting in the wings?

DeltaPrime - Rekt II,4850000,11/11/2024,Peckshield,https://rekt.news/deltaprime-rekt2/,"DeltaPrime - Rekt II Monday, November 11, 2024 DeltaPrime - Rekt read this article also in : en - zh Looks like lightning does strike twice – right in DeltaPrime's already scorched wallet. Two months after their $6 million private key catastrophe, DeltaPrime has achieved the dubious honor of a second spectacular security breach. This time, an unchecked input validation flaw has cost users another $4.85 million across Arbitrum and Avalanche chains. For a protocol that promises ""Delta-grade security,"" they're racking up losses faster than a gambler with a credit card addiction. While DeltaPrime scrambles to pause operations (again) and users watch their funds vanish (again), one has to wonder – is this a case of terrible luck, or terrible security? In an industry where ""twice bitten, thrice shy"" should be the motto, will anyone stick around for DeltaPrime's next security surprise? Credit: Certik , DeltaPrime The attack on DeltaPrime reads like the work of someone who actually bothered to study the ""Exploiting Unchecked Inputs"" chapter – unlike the protocol's developers. CertiK first spotted trouble as multiple pools on Arbitrum started hemorrhaging funds due to a critical flaw in the periphery adaptor contract. Seems someone skipped the ""check your inputs"" lecture. Within minutes, the attacker had drained $750K from Arbitrum – but they were just getting warmed up. Their next target? The protocol's Avalanche deployment, where another $4.1M would soon vanish. Different chain, same painful lesson. DeltaPrime, in a rare display of speed, quickly confirmed what everyone already knew: they'd been thoroughly rekt. Again. At this point, they should probably just laminate their ""We've Been Exploited"" announcement template. But how did this overachieving exploiter school DeltaPrime for $4.85 million? The exploit combined two vulnerabilities with the elegance of a well-planned heist and the subtlety of a sledgehammer. According to CertiK's detailed analysis , here's how DeltaPrime got schooled: The Arbitrum Exploit kicked off our exploiter's masterclass. Attacker Address on Arbitrum: 0xb87881637b5c8e6885c51ab7d895e53fa7d7c567 A flash loan of 59.9 ETH set the stage, supplied to DeltaPrime like bait in a trap. 1.18 WBTC was borrowed and immediately redirected through a swap adapter to their attack contract. Attack Contract on Arbitrum: 0x52ee5c0ea2e7b38d4b24c09d4d18cba6c293200e Using DeltaPrime's reward mechanism like a personal ATM, they retrieved their ETH collateral through an arbitrary input vulnerability.

On Avalanche, the stolen bounty found a new purpose, generating yield.

Not our ambitious apprentice. They've turned their stolen stash into a yield-farming empire, staking and earning with the confidence of someone who just found a genuine 100x gem (spoiler: they very rarely exist). PeckShield's audits specifically flagged these vulnerabilities – meaning DeltaPrime had two shots at fixing their security and still managed to miss the target. Two audits, both explicitly warning about admin key vulnerabilities and input validation issues. Yet DeltaPrime chose to keep their crown jewels behind a single EOA instead of the recommended multi-sig setup – like leaving your front door key under the welcome mat after a security consultant told you twice to install a proper lock. Peckshield Audit 1 Peckshield Audit 2 In a space where ""audit"" has become as meaningful as ""guaranteed APY,"" at least DeltaPrime is consistent – consistently rekt. When your exploiter starts farming yields instead of running, maybe it's time to reconsider your security strategy? While DeltaPrime scrambles to explain their second security disaster in two months, their exploiter is casually farming yields like they're following an alpha caller's medium post. The sheer audacity of staking stolen funds in public protocols suggests either supreme confidence or spectacular foolishness. Then again, when you're dealing with a protocol that's been exploited twice in sixty days, maybe there's not much fear of consequences. DeltaPrime's vision of the future seems to involve watching their users' funds evaporate at an increasingly efficient rate. With millions now being casually converted into yield-farming positions, the line between ""exploit"" and ""aggressive portfolio management"" grows thinner by the day. At this point, DeltaPrime might want to consider rebranding to ""DeltaDecline"" – or is that too optimistic given their current trajectory?

Super Sushi Samurai - REKT,4800000,03/21/2024,Verichains,https://rekt.news/sss-rekt/,"Super Sushi Samurai -  Friday, March 22, 2024 Super Sushi Samurai -  read this article also in : en - es - zh While you were busy playing with your food, someone stole your lunch. Blast L2-based game Super Sushi Samurai's LP drained $4.8m in contract bug exploit shortly after its launch, and the price dropped 99.9%. Spreek sounded the alarm around 14:00 UTC and the Super Sushi Samurai team responded within minutes , saying that they were pausing token transfers and investigating. Half an hour after getting sliced and diced, the Super Sushi Samurai team commented further on the exploit: We have been exploited, it's mint related. We are still looking into the code. Tokens were minted and sold into the LP. Gamma Strategies was hit with a similar mint exploit earlier this year, resulting in a similar loss on Arbitrum. Super Sushi Samurai’s code was audited, but failed to identify the infinite mint exploit. Will some of these protocols and auditing firms ever get this right or keep dropping the ball? Credit: Spreek , Super Sushi Samurai , Coffeexcoin , Sudo The Super Sushi Samurai LP was drained due to a critical bug in the token contract that allowed users to double their token balance simply by transferring the entire balance to their own address. The issue stemmed from a coding oversight in the contract's transfer function. When transferring tokens, the contract subtracts the amount from the sender's balance before adding it to the recipient's balance. However, if the sender and recipient are the same address, the contract fails to account for the deducted amount, causing the balance to double instead of remaining unchanged. This exploitable loophole enabled the attacker to repeatedly double their balance and ultimately sell the artificially inflated holdings, resulting in a $4.8M loss for the project. It only took the attacker around an hour to flip $35 into $4.6M . Quite a profit, isn’t it? Attacker Contract: 0xDed85d83Bf06069c0bD5AA792234b5015D5410A9 Attacker Address: 0x6a89a8c67b5066d59bf4d81d59f70c3976facd0a Attack Transaction 1: 0x80012bf784b83baaf28f5549a9f233cae5f70be7afcd8f594dc757d431ed93c4 Attack Transaction 2: 0x62e6b906bb5aafdc57c72cd13e20a18d2de3a4a757cd2f24fde6003ce5c9f2c6 Attack Transaction 3: 0xac3400e3d536ac23c10fdd2c06e1faf8d5de5b797df8433e9b5ab74b102a4e35 However, the funds may not entirely be lost. The person who drained the funds sent a message saying that it was a whitehat rescue hack . They provided details for contacting them and said that users should get reimbursed. The project said it had reached out to the exploiter. Verichains was responsible for the audit and missed the exploit.They let the contract go live with an infinite mint exploit. Another audit, another exploit. Is it time to start auditing the auditing firms? In the aftermath of the Super Sushi Samurai exploit, it's crucial for the crypto community to reflect on the importance of thorough security audits and the role of auditing firms in ensuring the safety of users' funds. The incident raises concerns about the effectiveness of current auditing practices, given that the contract was audited by Verichains but still went live with an infinite mint exploit. This event serves as a reminder for both projects and users to remain vigilant and ensure the highest security standards are being met. Collaborative efforts should focus on improving smart contract development standards and establishing industry-wide best practices. It may be time for the industry to consider stricter auditing requirements and establish better mechanisms for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in smart contracts. By working together to develop more robust security measures and promoting transparency in the auditing process, the crypto community can foster an environment where users feel confident in the security of their investments. Moreover, the Super Sushi Samurai incident should serve as a catalyst for reevaluating the relationships between projects and auditing firms. While the outcome of the Super Sushi Samurai incident remains uncertain, with the exploiter claiming to be a whitehat hacker and offering to reimburse affected users, it provides an opportunity to reevaluate and improve the overall security landscape.

Gamma Strategies - REKT,4500000,01/04/2024,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/gamma-strategies-rekt/,"Gamma Strategies -  Thursday, January 4, 2024 Gamma Strategies - Arbitrum -  read this article also in : en - es Bold strategy, Gamma, let’s see if it pays off… Gamma Strategies, an Arbitrum-based concentrated liquidity management protocol, was exploited for at least $4.5M, earlier today. Security researchers initially thought CryptoAlgebra was the affected protocol, before the victim was later correctly identified as Gamma. The attack began around 03:30 UTC, with the alarm quickly raised and Gamma acknowledging the hack approximately an hour and a half after it commenced. A follow-up announcement informed users that the team had paused deposits to mitigate further attacks: All public vaults/hypervisors have had deposits shut down. You may withdraw your funds if need be. Our vaults will continue to be managed normally for now, but deposits are currently shut down until we identify and mitigate the problem. When Orbit lost over $80M at New Year, we asked: Can we do better this year? So far, it’s not looking good … Credit: Gamma Strategies , CharlesWang , PeckShield Gamma published a thread outlining the preliminary cause of the exploit. However, a full post-mortem is forthcoming. Paladin’s CharlesWang outlined a potentially similar attack vector. Flash loans were used to manipulate the value of deposits, allowing the attacker to mint an inflated number of LP tokens. Despite four desposit protection measures, the attack was viable due to the broad ranges in allowed price changes within certain vaults. Deposits remain paused on Gamma vaults, as it is during deposits that the attack vector arises. As Gamma explained : The main issue is with the settings we placed on (2) the price change threshold. It was placed too high allowing for up 50-200% price change on certain LST and stablecoin vaults. This allowed the attacker to manipulate the price up to the price change threshold and mint a disproportionately high number of LP tokens. Peckshield provided an attack flow: Attacker address ( ETH , ARB ): 0x5351536145610aa448a8bf85ba97c71caf31909c Attack contract 1: 0x4b57adc00ac38f74506d29fc4080e3dc65b78a69 Example attack tx: 0x025cf285… The majority of funds were bridged back to the hacker’s Ethereum address . USDT was then swapped out for ETH for a total of 1535 ETH ($3.4M). Approximately $1.1M of DAI and gDAI remains on Arbitrum , however total losses to Gamma may have been higher . The attacker was funded via Tornado Cash two and a half hours before the attack began. The team has contacted the attacker on-chain, seemingly hoping for a whitehat. But the 1000 ETH deposited into Tornado Cash doesn’t paint an optimistic picture. Collateral damage threatened a number of other projects… First, Crypto Algebra suffered reputation-wise from the initial mis-labeling, then other protocols paused their contracts out of an abundance of caution. DEXs Camelot and Quickswap were also keen to point out that the issue was not with their own code. However, BlockSec did note a series of smaller scale attacks on similar protocol Dyson Money . Gamma Strategies has a somewhat chequered past. Before rebranding, the protocol then known as Visor Finance suffered three incidents in 2021 alone. In June they defended the loss of $500k via a privileged function as “ not a rug ”, then in November they downplayed another hack as “ economic arbitrage ”. December 2021’s loss of $8.2M to an infinite mint bug seems to have been the nail in Visor’s coffin, with the rebrand and token migration announced two days later. However, it bears mentioning that Gamma has had no issues since the rebrand, with apparently “ no original developers or founders remaining from the project ”. The protocol has undergone three audits , from Consensys Diligence ( March 2022 ), Arbitrary Execution ( March 2022 ), and Certik ( July 2021 ), but given that the vulnerability was due to the configuration of individual pool’s price change tolerances, the bug is likely out of scope. As we press on into 2024, it seems the constant stream of hacks and exploits shows no sign of slowing down. And if we do see a new bull run, at this rate it will surely eclipse the madness of last time.

Lending protool Radiant Capital lost 1900 ETH ($4.5M), yesterday, to a known bug affecting freshly-launched markets. Radiant, a fork of Aave V2, operates on Arbitrum and BSC, with the hack occurring on the Arbitrum deployment’s new native USDC market. It appears the attacker had been lying in wait, likely having identified the vulnerability in Aave-forks via updates to the Aave protocol itself. The attacker’s address , as well as Discord screenshots , were posted to Twitter, raising the alarm. An official confirmation came later, adding: No current funds are at risk. So, just the $4.5M that had already been stolen, then? Credit: Peckshield , Ancilia The issue in forked Aave V2 code affects recently-launched (and therefore empty ) markets. A potential attacker has a brief window after launch to use a flash loan to manipulate the value of collateral, thanks to the combination of a rounding error and a totalSupply value of 0. The exploiter wasted no time, deploying their attack contract just six seconds after the new market was activated . The bug was previously mitigated in the original Aave protocol by simply including an initial deposit with the creation of new markets, ensuring they are never sitting empty. Given the speed of the attack, the attacker had clearly prepared everything in advance whilst waiting for the proposal to add the market (which passed on December 25th) to be enacted.

Despite four audits , from OpenZeppelin, BlockSec, Peckshield and Zokyo, a constantly-evolving security landscape means updates must be made in a timely manner. Especially when dealing with forked code. We've discussed the risks of forks plenty of times, with multiple leaderboard entries down to vulnerabilities patched in one place before being exploited elsewhere. When copy-pasting an established project, more eyes are focused on the original project’s larger TVL, providing an early warning system for bugs like these.

At this point the attacker is holding ~1.5m SNX. 4: Swap of 1.5m SNX on Kyber for ~6.5m USDC, lowering SNX price considerably. 5: Swap of ~6.5m USDC for ~6.5m sUSD on Curve. 6: Transfer ~2m sUSD to xSNXAdmin contract (this is the contract that holds the assets managed by xSNX), with the intention of repaying the contract’s sUSD debt in order to unlock SNX. 7: Call of the callFunction function on xSNXAdmin contract, burning outstanding sUSD debt and swapping ~614k SNX for ~811k sUSD debt at artificially depressed price. That the attacker was able to call the callFunction function was the source of the vulnerability. This function should only have been callable from dydx’s SoloMargin flashloan contract that had been integrated to improve fund performance on rebalances. An erroneous require statement allowed the function to be publicly callable. require(sender==address(this) was used when xToken should have used require(msg.sender==soloMarginAddress) . 8: Swap of ~811k sUSD for ~811k USDC, which remains in the contract. 9: The attacker then reverses all actions, swapping back to ETH and repaying loans. The source of the value extraction was that the attacker used xSNX assets to pressure SNX price and create profitable external arbitrage opportunities. LINEBREAK The first time can be considered a mistake, but a second time? The X-token team say they’ll compensate their users (again), and that they have taken the decision to phase out their xSNX product.

We are highly confident in our other products and contracts, but can no longer say the same about the current implementation of our xSNX contract. Although their reputation will be permanently damaged from taking two positions on the rekt leaderboard , it does seem that this team care about their users, and are taking steps to make things right. The decision to withdraw their xSNX offering may be wise, however, by publicly admitting that it was too complicated for them, aren’t they just worsening the damage to their reputation? Perhaps a fresh start would be more appropriate. A sequel normally leads to a series. Will the X-ploiters try for a trilogy?

There’s no rest for the wicked - who would attack at such an ungodly hour? Credit: 0xdeadf4ce Transaction details here. The root cause was a function called emergencyBurn() in the intermediary vault used to track anySwap / Nerve-bridged assets nrvBTC, nrvETH and nrvFUSDT in the Eleven “MasterMind” farming contract. The attacker first took a Flashloan of each asset’s underlying token balance in the “MasterMind” contract (Binance-pegged BTC, ETH and USDT) to convert these into nrvBTC, nrvETH and nrvFUSDT respectively. Nerve 3Pool and PancakeSwap BUSD - NRV liquidity provider positions were also affected. A vulnerable function emergencyBurn() in the intermediate vault contract allowed the attacker to withdraw the deposited balance without having the withdrawal being accounted for internally. As a result the attacker was able to not only remove his own deposit but the full balance of the same amount that had been in the vault before as well. The attacker used the Nerve bridge to transfer out 2,293 ETH in proceeds to the address 0xdb2d590aCe7cAe51DF1fB3312738038Ec032Bf33. Steps 1: borrow underlying assets from PancakeSwap (Flash Swap) 2: convert amount (mint) to Nerve asset 3: deposit Nerve asset to “MasterMind” through intermediate vault 4: call emergencyBurn() on intermediate vault, transferring an amount equal to the previously deposited amount (equal to vault balance before attack) to the attacker 5: proceed with a regular withdrawal, transferring the previously deposited asset balance back to the attacker Funds lost 30.75 BTCB

Tapioca DAO - Rekt,4400000,10/18/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/tapioca-dao-rekt/,"Tapioca DAO - Rekt Monday, October 21, 2024 Tapioca DAO -  read this article also in : en - es Another day, another private key theft, another protocol rekt. Tapioca DAO on Arbitrum suffers a roughly $4.4 million loss in a private key compromise. Some funds have been recovered, though the full extent of the damage remains to be seen, though the full extent of the damage remains to be seen. Seems like Tapioca's recipe for success didn't include robust key management. The attacker, playing the role of a master chef, cooked up a scheme that left Tapioca's defenses as mushy as overcooked noodles. While the protocol scrambles to reassure users, whispers of a notorious hacker group are already circulating through the cryptosphere. Did Tapioca have a North Korean dev in their pocket, or just a bad case of compromised keys? These hackers are hitting us from all angles - yesterday's Radiant Capital got served a steaming hot plate of RAT malware , and now Tapioca's security is looking more half-baked than a botched soufflé. In this DeFi kitchen nightmare, are we watching the evolution of financial warfare, or just the same old recipe of greed and incompetence, now with a side of state-sponsored hacking? Credit: Daniel VF , 0xTeun , ZachXBT , Tapioca DAO , Hacken , Bleeping Computer , The Block As the crypto world slumbered, 0xTeun sounded the alarm : Tapioca was under attack. Seems our enterprising hacker managed to exploit the Emergency Rescue function on one of the Vesting contracts deployed by the Tapioca Deployer. Another day, another vulnerability laid bare. The attacker wasted no time, exploiting the vulnerability to withdraw roughly 30 million TAP tokens. With the finesse of a seasoned trader, they swapped this haul for 591 ETH, sending TAP's value into a 97% nosedive . But why stop there? Our hacker friend wasn't done cooking. They multi-called several other addresses including the $USDO stablecoin contract and minted themselves a jaw-dropping five quintillion $USDO. Because why settle for millions when you can have quintillions? Following the crypto equivalent of a high-speed chase, our blockchain sleuths tracked the stolen funds as they were bridged to the BNB Chain. As of press time, the suspicious address sits pretty with approximately $4.4 million in stablecoins like BSC-USD and USDC. Not a bad day's work for our digital desperado. Tapioca DAO finally broke their silence - a mere 6 hours after the attack. Their official response? A classic case of ""it's not a bug, it's a feature."" According to Tapioca, this wasn't just any old hack - oh no, this was a ""social engineering attack."" Apparently, the attacker managed to compromise the TAP token vesting contract's ownership, allowing them to claim and sell a whopping 30M vested TAP . But wait, there's more! The USDO stablecoin contract's ownership was also compromised, with the attacker adding a minter to infinite mint USDO and drain the USDO/USDC LP pair. Tapioca's damage report ? A cool 591 ETH and 2.8M USDC stolen. At least they're consistent with the blockchain detectives on this one. The attack centered on Tapioca's vesting contract, a piece of code that was supposed to keep tokens locked up tight. TAP Vesting Contract: 0x2997C5ddD3070A46E9938261ce0A16a237121cb0 Exploiter: 0x70285a11489bed93686410EBC727057CAfb8129D Attack Transaction 1: 0x8cf8def40fa2beab66f46863478bea71ad8f4512003caf2fa639cc5a00550753 Attack Transaction 2: 0x1abb8cf0b0af2ce19a30ce5103d51269d4600d9aeba045260feb588db89d76a4 Attack Transaction 3: 0x174c3deaf563be1bb6d873ba279421e8588acc888ef672bafd5efe7441aae74f But our hacker wasn't satisfied with just one course. For dessert, they set their sights on Tapioca's stablecoin, turning USDO into their personal money printer. USDO Stablecoin Contract: 0xEB99062643cA5Ab880c077288345E0B14B297432 USDO Infinite Mint Exploit: 0x0bca43cfb5b14ea039f2b329cb6074383d54ed8240963014ccb6400befa5a4e3 Stolen funds were bridged from Arbitrum to BSC: 0x69d91e56ca80f2a4d7b808b59053ea5c5505ffe2 But wait, there's more! Our favorite on-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, has stirred the pot with some spicy observations . According to Zach, this Tapioca tempest might be connected to a string of recent hacks targeting projects like Nexera, Concentric, Masa, SpaceCatch, and others. The common ingredient in this hacker's cookbook? Malware, possibly served up through fake job listings. It seems in the world of DeFi, ""We're always hiring!"" could be code for ""We're always hacking!"" And here's where it gets really interesting - Zach hints at a potential connection to everyone's favorite boogeyman of the crypto world: North Korean state-sponsored hackers. But just when you thought this story couldn't get any wilder, Tapioca serves up a plot twist that would make M. Night Shyamalan jealous. In a stunning turn of events, they've managed to pull a reverse uno card on the hacker. Tapioca announced in their Discord : ""We have hacked the hacker! Recovered 1000 ETH which is now safely in the DAO multisig. The 1000 ETH was DAO collateral within Big Bang Origins to mint USDO for USDO/USDC LP."" With this recovery, Tapioca's treasury now stands at $4.2M. The team promises more details in the upcoming post-mortem, crediting Seal911 and EnigmaDarkLabs for their assistance in this counter-operation. As Tapioca continues to work on resolving the situation, this story is far from over and should make for another interesting post mortem. And because no crypto disaster is complete without a side of phishing, scammers quickly moved in, impersonating Tapioca DAO and dropping malicious links like breadcrumbs. Hacken's warning to users? Don't take the bait. Well, somebody took the bait. But was it a Tapioca team member who swallowed the phishing hook, line, and sinker? Did our hacker chef serve up a specially crafted ""job opportunity"" that was too tasty to resist? After Tapioca's $4.4 million stumble, we're left with a familiar taste of incompetence garnished with a side of North Korean intrigue. It's another entry in the ""How Not to DeFi"" handbook, where your protocol is just one compromised key away from being the next cautionary tweet thread. The security game has leveled up, evolving from smart contract bug hunts to a twisted version of ""Who's the Mole?"" While we've gotten better at auditing our code, we've forgotten to run a virus scan on our devs. Rogue actors aren't just in our programs anymore; they're writing them. They're in our VS Code extensions , our job applicant pools , and probably in that weird Discord server you joined last week. At this rate, every Web3 project will have their very own pet North Korean hacker by 2025. Forget ""bring your dog to work day"" - it's now ""bring your state-sponsored cyber-criminal to work day."" In this crypto clown fiesta, where your next colleague could be coding for Kim Jong-un on the weekends. Is this the cyberpunk future we were promised, or just a really elaborate phishing scam that we're all falling for?

Almost two years after topping the leaderboard with a complex hack of over $600M, this time the losses totalled just $4.4M. And the attack was a simple case of a compromised 3-of-4 multisig. When Lazarus knocked Poly off the top spot with the Ronin bridge exploit, 5 of 9 validator keys were compromised. Apparently, Poly still thought that an even lower bar was acceptable. The team eventually acknowledged the attack, informing users that bridging services had been paused and making a call for help to the security community. In a follow-up, Poly clarified that “ 57 assets have been affected on 10 blockchains ” Prompting flashbacks of the first hack, which at the time totalled more than the entire rest of the leaderboard combined, initial reports used a notional value of $42B of minted assets. But low liquidity on destination chains meant the attacker was only able to cash out a few million. It seems we only ever hear of Poly Network when they’re hacked… …who knew they were even still around? Credit: Dedaub , Beosin In contrast to Poly’s last incident, this time appears to be a far simpler case of compromised keys; three of four multisig signers validated deposit proofs, granting the attacker access to funds. The attack process involved locking a small amount of tokens on one chain, then withdrawing a larger amount on a different chain via forged proofs, repeated for various assets and chains. A full, technical post-mortem can be found here .

A full list of assets stolen by chain is available here . Blockchain bridges create bottlenecks where funds accumulate on either side, often secured by a flimsy threshold of just a few EOAs. Time and again we have seen hundreds of millions lost to just a few signatures. Last time Poly was rekt, on-chain negotiations resulted in a happy ending, as funds were returned and the whitehat offered a Chief Security Advisor role on top of a $500k bounty.

On Friday, Raydium , a Solana-based AMM, lost a total of ~$4.4M in fees from its liquidity pools. The alarm was raised by the DEX aggregator PRISM, also on Solana: There seems to be a wallet is draining LP Pools from Raydium liquidity pools using admin wallet as a signer without having/burning LP tokens. We withdrew protocol provided PRISM/USDC liquidity from Raydium WITHDRAW YOUR PRISM/USDC LIQUIDITY FROM RAYDIUM The official announcement came 40 minutes later, stating that “ authority has been halted on AMM & farm programs for now ”. In a follow-up post , the team assured users that “ a patch is in place preventing further exploits from the attacker. ” While this incident doesn’t look to have caused a total protocol meltdown, losing millions is never a good look. But who’s still using Solana anyway? Credit: Raydium , OtterSec According to OtterSec, the incident appears to have been down to a compromised private key to the owner account of Raydium contracts. Raydium suspect “ a trojan attack and compromised private key for the pool owner account ”. The account had authority over certain functions of Raydium’s pools, allowing the attacker to drain accumulated trading/protocol fees via the withdraw_pnl instruction. The hacker also changed the SyncNeedTake parameter to increase expected fees and withdraw extra funds. The following pools were affected for a total protocol loss of $4.4M: SOL-USDC SOL-USDT RAY-USDC RAY-USDT RAY-SOL stSOL-USDC ZBC-USDC UXP-USDC whETH-USDC The majority of funds were bridged to Ethereum, swapped to ETH and have been deposited into Tornado Cash. 100k SOL ($1.4M) remains in the attacker’s Solana address.

The bear market promises a long, tough road ahead for many smaller teams, especially in this context... The future of Solana feels uncertain.

ChainSwap - REKT,4400000,07/11/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/chainswap-rekt/,"ChainSwap -  Tuesday, July 13, 2021 ChainSwap -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh A new type of attack is growing in popularity. As the demand for DeFi increases across chains, the bridges that join them turn into targets themselves. ChainSwap rekt, and not for the first time. This is the second incident this month in which the Alameda-backed “cross-chain hub for all smart chains” has lost users' funds. First $800,000, now $4.4 million. The ChainSwap team needs to increase security $ASAP. Attacker address: 0xEda5066780dE29D00dfb54581A707ef6F52D8113 On the Ethereum network, each token to be bridged has its own proxy Factory contract. The attacker was able to exploit the contract, minting tokens directly into different addresses, before reaccumulating them into the wallet from which the transactions were initially sent. 1. Call receive function to the Factory (minting) contract 2. Dodge the sloppy auth check system using a new address as signature each tx 3. Pay 0.005 ETH chargeFee 4. Set to parameter to the desired address, which receives the minted volume 5. Repeat x times Credit: @cmichelio Over on BSC, the exploit targeted a total of 20 tokens, according to ChainSwap’s post-mortem. Taking the example of the NFT platform WilderWorld, this is one of 40 repeated transactions, each of which minted 500,000 $WILD tokens each time. These 20M WILD were then sold for ~650 WBNB, or just over $200,000 USD via PancakeSwap, effectively depleting the WILD/WBNB pool in the process. By the time the hacker was finished, their wallet had filled with a variety of tokens, with a total value of approximately $4.4M. The evidence is present in the attacker's Ethereum wallet taking the form of a long series of 0.005 ETH transactions, each evidence of freshly minted tokens via the Chainswap bridge. The last few transactions show the attacker cashing out some of the ETH that had been bridged from BSC, via 1inch - a series of 5 transactions totalling 456 ETH, or approximately $935,000 at the time of writing. If the bridge isn’t the target, then it’s part of the escape route for this new style of cross chain attack. BSC, Solana, Polygon, are all seeing increased activity, and as the liquidity grows, the loopholes will show. This won’t be the last time we see this type of hack. We didn’t cover the initial exploit. With so many to choose from, we need to set some standards. If it’s under a million dollars lost then there has to be something that piques our interest. However, when we looked back at the first post-mortem, we found this email that we thought might interest you. A strange correspondence that the ChainSwap team claims to be from their attacker. Or did the “great people” at ChainSwap just send it to themselves? Everyone is free to speculate... We are left wondering... why would the hacker fund his wallet with money from Tornado and then change his bounty into a centralised stablecoin such as USDT? This leaves him vulnerable to having his funds frozen by Tether, and he hasn't tried to cover his tracks. Is this a ChainSwap insider trying to prove a point, or has the email sender with “fake KYC accounts” returned for more? Why has this money still not been laundered? ChainSwap have arranged a full compensation plan for those affected by the attack, but the reputation of their platform can’t be refunded.

AlexLab - Rekt,4300000,05/14/2024,CoinFabrik,https://rekt.news/alexlab-rekt/,"AlexLab - Rekt Friday, May 17, 2024 AlexLab -  read this article also in : en - es Another day, another private key was compromised. AlexLab, the self-proclaimed finance layer on Bitcoin, had a few layers stripped, as a compromised private key led to a $4.3 million exploit on AlexLab’s XLink bridge on the BNB network. Certik Alert caught a suspicious transaction affecting AlexLab on May 14th, with initial evidence pointing to a private key compromise. AlexLab did not officially confirm the exploit until the next day, where they stated that the misappropriated Alex Assets have been moved by the exploiter to major exchanges, where the assets were frozen by the exchanges. They offered a bounty equivalent to 10% of the stolen funds, with an expiration of May 18th at 0800 UTC. Why did they wait a day until they made an official announcement about the exploit? Credit: Certik , AlexLab , ImmuneBytes , Chain Aegis The AlexLab team became aware of an exploit using compromised private keys obtained via a phishing attack. In their official security update, they highlighted that the exploiter conducted a targeted attack, taking over as the admin of one of the vaults associated with ALEX liquidity pool. With the vault keys in hand, the attacker went buck wild, draining approximately 13.7 million STX from the compromised coffers . Around 3 million of those pilfered STX were rapidly shot out to various centralized exchanges in a blatant cash-out attempt. The Alex team mobilized and managed to recover all aBTC, sUSDT, xBTC, xUSD, ALEX, atALEX, and a handful of other assets from the vault. However, a sizable chunk of that STX loot managed to slip through the exchanges' hands before they could freeze the funds. According to further analysis by ImmuneBytes, the Deployer address carried out four malicious upgrades to the proxy contract associated with AlexLabs. The upgrades caused the address of the bridge endpoint contract to change to unverified bytecode. Attacker address: 0x27055aE433E9DCb30f6EbCC1A374Cf5CC03C484E Within an hour after the upgrade, the following withdrawals were made under these attack transactions. Attack Transaction 1: 0x94746d33792aeb27d2066b6d8f3c8a8c7410fe15c9500059f35e0b21c9bfb416 Attack Transaction 2: 0x47e123af93add709bc2516f6a5db057dfbb1d66a75b693cd7980cd3eb28c7357 A total of $4.3 million worth of digital assets were transferred to the following addresses. Stolen Funds sent to Address 1: 0xA747aF2a527E72cE303353b458a1c51eBCd53188 Stolen Funds sent to Address 2: 0x27055aE433E9DCb30f6EbCC1A374Cf5CC03C484E A portion of the stolen funds have been identified and are in the process of being recovered from one CEX. AlexLab is actively working through the required processes with other CEXs to claw back additional funds. They are now locked in a heated process of trying to retrieve the remaining STX and shared the current forensic data with all relevant CEXs. Since there is no assurance that all stolen funds will be recovered, they are evaluating deployment of ALEX reserves held by AlexLab Foundation towards funding of a treasury grant program to support their community impacted by the attack . In the meantime, they've got another Hail Mary in the works, possibly proposing that the Stacks community straight-up burn the unrecovered STX sitting in the exploiter's wallets, then reissue fresh tokens to the impacted users. AlexLabs is currently working with all relevant parties on a detailed post-mortem report, which we will share with you very soon. ImmuneBytes and Chain Aegis have indicated that the attacker involved in this exploit was also involved in the attack on Mars Defi 412 . Mars Defi 412 was attacked in a price manipulation attack for $100k on April 16th. AlexLab’s Security Audit page highlights that the Bitcoin Bridge is audited by CoinFabrik, covering both the contracts and the backends. The smart contracts are also subject to a bug bounty program on Immunefi. But it was a compromised private key that ultimately tried to blow up the lab, audits and bug bounties became an afterthought at that point. The $4.3 million-dollar question remains: Just how did this sly exploiter manage to phish or finagle those highly-coveted vault keys? The AlexLab team has their work cut out unraveling this $4.3 million private key caper. While they've managed to recover some assets and freeze funds, millions are still sitting in the exploiter's shady wallets. Their proposed solutions of treasury grants and token reissuance show they're pulling out all the stops to make impacted users whole. But at the end of the day, that won't undo the damage of sloppy opsec that enabled this breach in the first place. The day-long delay to make the exploit public is concerning. As investigators dig deeper into the phishers' tricks or if this is a potential inside job, this saga will be a case study in the perils of private key mishandling. The crypto Wild West is an unforgiving place, one mistake is all it takes for your vault to get looted. AlexLab can audit and bug bounty till the cows come home, but they'd be wise to quickly implement multi-sig and other robust key management practices. Otherwise, their shiny ""finance layer"" risks getting stripped bare by the next opportunistic vault raider. A raider who may be a repeat offender and is not afraid to use different attack vectors, who could be next? The game of crypto cat-and-mouse wages on.

Conic Finance - REKT,4200000,07/21/2023,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/conic-finance-rekt/,"Conic Finance -  Tuesday, July 25, 2023 Conic Finance -  read this article also in : en - es Lightning does strike twice. Conic Finance got double-rekt on Friday, losing a total of $4.2M from their ETH and crvUSD omnipools. Omnipools accept single asset deposits, which are then spread across a variety of Curve pools to earn LP rewards for depositors. As the news spread, Conic quickly acknowledged the first attack, which drained the ETH pool of $3.3M. Following the second incident, the team decided to shut down all pools. The initial hack was yet another instance of the notorious read-only reentrancy vulnerability which has wreaked havoc on DeFi over the last year. Sturdy Finance , Midas Capital and dForce Network , amongst others, have all suffered from the issue in recent months. Both attacks were frontrun, with the recipient of funds from the second incident (an MEV bot ) returning 90% of their profits (81 ETH) the following day. With the majority of lost funds (over 1700 ETH) still sitting in the address of the first attack’s frontrunner, there is still hope for recovery … …but given the address had previously been labelled by Blocksec as “LadyPepe Token Exploiter”, we probably shouldn’t hold our breath. Credit: BlockSec , Conic Finance The first attack exploited the common read-only reentrancy vulnerability in order to manipulate token prices, as discussed in many previous articles. In this case, the attack can be summed up with the following TLDR by pcaversaccio: TL;DR: Due to a read-only reentrancy vulnerability in the oracle contract CurveLPOracleV2 , the attacker can reenter rETH-f.totalSupply() (and other tokens like steCRV) and thus can manipulate the prices accordingly. Thus, the attacker can withdraw more than deposited. A more detailed breakdown can be found in Daniel Von Fange’s thread . According to auditors Peckshield, the vulnerability was identified in the audit , however a new oracle contract reintroduced the bug. FWIW, our audit identifies a similar read-only reentrancy issue. However, the same issue is introduced in the newly introduced CurveLPOracleV2 contract, which was not part of the audit scope. Conic dev 0xWicket later clarified that the contract did have inbuilt reentrancy protection, however it wasn’t triggered due to a mix-up between ETH and WETH addresses. We are currently in the process of writing a post-mortem. The root cause of this being exploitable was our assumption that ETH was treated as address 0xeee... by Curve, while it uses the the WETH address for V2 pools. Our reentrancy protection failed to trigger because of that Exploiter address (1st attack): 0x8d67db0b205e32a5dd96145f022fa18aae7dc8aa Over 1700 ETH (around $3.3M) was forwarded to a secondary address: 0x3d32c5a2e592c7b17e16bddc87eab75f33ae3010 Exploit tx (1st attack): 0x8b74995d… Original failed tx (1st attack): 0x97a8315e… Original exploiter address (1st attack): 0x10db234e02c3889d8e408c7084e8ce10892bdad7 The second attack was somewhat simpler and far less damaging , apart from to Conic’s reputation. The issue was described in Conic’s post-mortem as a type of sandwich attack on imbalanced pools. The attack steps are as follows: Exchange crvUSD to USDC in the Curve pool Deposit crvUSD into Conic Exchange USDC to crvUSD in the Curve pool Withdraw from Conic Repeat steps above The report goes on to explain that: The attacker would benefit from the exchanges in the Curve pool by exchanging at a favorable rate. While we did have some mechanism in place to ensure we did not interact with imbalanced Curve pools, the bounds that we had set were not tight enough and allowed the attacker to slowly drain funds from the pool. A total of approx. $934,000 was stolen from the crvUSD Omnipool, giving the attacker a profit of approx. $300,000. Exploiter address: 0xb6369f59fc24117b16742c9dfe064894d03b3b80 Example hack tx: 0x37acd17a… Frontrunning bot (returned 81 ETH): 0xd050e0a4838d74769228b49dff97241b4ef3805d For all the talk of the Curve Wars , the wider ecosystem feels Conic's pain. The Curve team got involved in warning users of the dangers, and even suggesting safe havens for farmers. Conic’s was one of the most hotly anticipated DeFi projects before launching earlier this year, and was seen by some threadoors as a contender for being the next cycle’s CVX/Yearn. Pre-hack, CNC was sitting at around $6. News of the initial incident caused a drop in price of around 35% with a further fall to just $1.72 following the second exploit. CNC has since settled at around $2.75, just below half of its pre-hack value. The TVL chart shows just how much damage Friday’s events have done, with less than a third of Conic’s pre-hack TVL remaining: Will such a promising protocol survive this double-blow?

This time, Kokomo Finance took off with approximately $4M, deleting their website, Twitter , GitHub and Medium in the process. The lending protocol had launched on Optimism less than a week ago, and its token, KOKO , less than 36 hours before the rug. Wrapped Bitcoin deposits were rugged via changes made by the project’s deployer address. Almost $2M of tokens still remain in the project’s pools on Optimism. But with the contracts paused and users unable to withdraw funds, the question remains… …will they be back for the rest? Credit: Certik , Beosin Certik explained how the rug went down: 1/ The deployer of KOKO Token, address 0x41BE , deployed attack contract cBTC.

Voltage Finance - REKT,4000000,03/31/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/voltage-finance-rekt/,"Voltage Finance -  Thursday, March 31, 2022 Voltage Finance - Ola Finance -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh Voltage Finance has been exploited for ~$4M via its “ Lending-as-a-Service ” partner Ola Finance on the Fuse Network. Rather than a Compound fork, Ola describes itself as a “ a technology provider that enables others to build Compound-like instances ”. Earlier this month, a similar incident on the Gnosis / xDAI chain gave the teams using Compound’s code plenty of warning. But somehow, neither Voltage nor Ola got the news. If only there was somewhere developers could keep up to date with exploits in DeFi… Similarly to the cases of Agave DAO and Hundred Finance , this exploit was due to a reentrancy vulnerability in the ERC 677 standard which Fuse Network uses for bridged tokens. These token types include a callAfterTransfer() function which can be abused to make additional transfers before balances are updated (provided the underlying code does not follow the recommended checks-effects-interactions routine of execution). The original Compound code does not follow this pattern, however all proposed collateral tokens are vetted for this vulnerability before being added to the protocol. Credit: BlockSecTeam Attacker’s address on Fuse: 0x371D7C9e4464576D45f11b27Cf88578983D63d75 Example tx (BUSD): 0x1b3e06b6b310886dfd90a5df8ddbaf515750eda7126cf5f69874e92761b1dc90 Attacker contract A: 0x632942c9BeF1a1127353E1b99e817651e2390CFF Attacker contract B: 0x9E5b7da68e2aE8aB1835428E6E0c83a7153f6112 1: Contract A transfers 550 WETH to Contract B 2: Contract B deposits 550 WETH, minting 27,284 oWETH 3: Contract B borrows 507,216 BUSD 4: Contract BUSD calls back to Contract B via callAfterTransfer() 5: Contract B transfers both 507,216 BUSD and 27,284 oWETH to Contract A. 6: Contract A returns 27,284 oWETH to redeem initial deposit of 550 WETH and keeping the 507,216 BUSD as profit. As BlockSecTeam explain: “ In the code logic of the borrow() function, the related internal states are updated after an external call. Specifically, the doTransferOut() function will invoke the transfer() function of the ERC677-based token, which will eventually lead to an external call. ” The above process was used repeatedly to take $USDC, $FUSD, $WBTC, $WETH & $FUSE. The resulting funds were first bridged to Ethereum (originally funded by Tornado Cash ) and then sent on to this address , where they remain in the form of ETH, WBTC, USDC (will Circle freeze these funds?) and FUSE, worth approximately $3.1M. When Agave and Hundred fell victim to the same attack vector, we said; When one fork falls, all others have to check their foundations. Voltage Finance didn’t do that, and that’s why they’re taking their place (#64) on the leaderboard.

Again. Less than a month ago they lost $7M. Now they’ve lost another $4M. We didn’t cover the first exploit, but if you get rekt on repeat then we’ve got to say something. Credit: Mudit Gupta DAOMaker’s init() function was left vulnerable, allowing the attacker to reinitialise 4 token contracts with malicious data. Then, the emergencyExit() function was used to withdraw the funds from each. The four contracts and the withdrawal transactions are listed below: 0x6e70c88be1d5c2a4c0c8205764d01abe6a3d2e22 - emergencyExit with 13.5M CAPS 0xd6c8dd834abeeefa7a663c1265ce840ca457b1ec - emergencyExit with 2.5M CPD, twice 0xdd571023d95ff6ce5716bf112ccb752e86212167 - emergencyExit with 1.44M DERC 0xa43b89d5e7951d410585360f6808133e8b919289 - emergencyExit with approx 20.6M SHO After the exploit and swap routine, the attacker then made init() calls on two more contracts. Both contracts, however, had already been called by a new address , whose transaction history shows a series of init()-emergencyExit() calls, extracting millions of SHO, as well as ALPHR and LSS. The final four transactions in this address show the extracted tokens being returned, then an ownership transfer; maybe some belated whitehat behaviour, or the devs trying to save what was left. The attacker went on to sell each token: Ternoa: 13.5M CAPS for 378,189 DAI on 1inch Coinspaid: 5M CPD for 158,216 DAI on 1inch DeRace: 1.44M DERC for 997,833 DAI on 1inch Showcase: 20.6M SHO for 67,663 DAI via MetaMask Swap Router Price effects (at time of writing). Ternoa CAPS dropped to -45%, now -11% CoinsPaid CPD dropped to -60% and now -25%. DeRace DERC dropped to -75% initially, now trading around -25%, Showcase SHO trading at approx. -75% The prices of all tokens involved have recovered somewhat since the exploit, although not as much as claimed by DAO Maker. The DAO Maker source code is not public. Was it exposed to an outsider, or is there an insider who should not be trusted? Live footage of a DAO Maker developer getting rekt by their own protocol. As Mr Gupta tweeted on Twitter; DaoMaker claimed that they had audits from 3 firms but looking at learn.daomaker.com/audits , 2 of the audits seem to be for unrelated contracts while the third one from @certik_io points to a dead link. We await clarification from Certik. Even if all three audits were real and relevant, no hacked protocol should try and pass the blame to their auditors. Good security has to come from the team, not outsourced to an audit company. Every step has to be perfect.

Onyx Protocol - Rekt II,3800000,09/25/2024,CertiK,https://rekt.news/onyx-protocol-rekt2/,"Onyx Protocol - Rekt II Thursday, September 26, 2024 Onyx Protocol - Fork -  read this article also in : en - es Onyx Protocol, another Compound v2 fork that just can't catch a break, has been exploited again. This time, the damage tally stands at a cool $3.8 million, siphoned off by the same high-profile vulnerability that bit them late last year. It's a rerun nobody asked for, featuring the usual suspects: a known bug, a newly added market, and a team seemingly allergic to learning from past mistakes. The exploit, executed with the precision of a seasoned chef following a recipe, drained a smorgasbord of assets including VUSD, XCN, DAI, WBTC, and USDT. Onyx finds itself in the unenviable ""fool me twice"" club, proving that in DeFi, lightning can indeed strike the same place twice - especially if you're holding a metal rod in a thunderstorm. In the grand tapestry of DeFi disasters, is Onyx weaving a masterpiece or just tying itself in knots? Credit: Cyvers , Onyx Protocol , Hacken , Peckshield In a plot twist surprising absolutely no one, Onyx Protocol decided to take ""double or nothing"" a bit too literally. As crypto degens were busy arguing about the next meme coin or prepping for another conference, Cyvers played the role of party pooper: ""Our system has detected suspicious transaction involving Onyx DAO on ETH chain! Total loss is around $3.8M."" Meanwhile, the Onyx team seemed to be practicing their ostrich impressions. 4 hours after the exploit, they finally poked their heads out of the sand : ""Onyx Protocol is aware of unusual activity on our platform and is currently reviewing third party post mortem examination data while conducting our own investigation."" But by then, the digital safe had long been cracked open, its contents scattered to the winds of the blockchain. As blockchain detectives pieced together the digital crime scene, they found themselves watching a rerun of ""Precision Manipulation: Onyx Edition."" Same vulnerability, different day. Hacken, playing the role of DeFi's CSI team, laid out the attack blueprint . Our intrepid hacker, clearly a fan of sequels, followed a script we've seen before: Kick things off with a 2K ETH flash loan from Balancer. Because why use your own money when you can borrow someone else's? Play the ETH shell game: deposit 1,999.5 ETH into the oEther contract, while sneaking 0.5 ETH into a malicious contract cooked up just for the occasion. Use this custom contract to mint and redeem oETH in amounts so small, they'd make even a satoshi blush. We're talking 0.00000001 oETH here, folks. Because in DeFi, size doesn't always matter. Rinse and repeat this minting and redeeming dance 56 times. Because if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try, try... (you get the idea) again. Watch as the exchange rate goes haywire, proving once again that in DeFi, it's not about the size of your transaction, but how you use it. This precision manipulation attack exploited a vulnerability that's becoming all too familiar in the Compound V2 family reunion. The flaw? A hiccup in the asset's exchange rate calculation when there's low liquidity in a market. It's as if Onyx left the door wide open, hung up a ""Free Money"" sign, and went on vacation. Exploiter address: 0x680910cf5Fc9969A25Fd57e7896A14fF1E55F36B Attack transaction: 0x46567c731c4f4f7e27c4ce591f0aebdeb2d9ae1038237a0134de7b13e63d8729 Attack Contract: 0xAE7d68b140Ed075E382e0A01d6c67ac675AFa223 But wait, there's more! Our enterprising hacker didn't stop there. Peckshield, playing the role of DeFi's Sherlock Holmes, uncovered another skeleton in Onyx's closet . The attacker also exploited a flaw in the NFTLiquidation contract, which failed to properly validate user input. This allowed them to inflate the self-liquidation reward amount, essentially giving them a blank check drawn on Onyx's account. The end result? A smorgasbord of stolen assets according to Peckshield : 4.1M VUSD 7.35M XCN 5K DAI 0.23 WBTC 50K USDT All in all, a $3.8M payday for our hacker, and another painful lesson for Onyx Protocol. One they've already learned... and apparently forgotten. Speaking of forgetting, in the Pokémon world, Onix evolves into Steelix, becoming stronger and more resilient. But in DeFi, Onyx Protocol seems stuck in a permanent state of vulnerability, as if it used an Everstone on itself. No matter how many times it gets hit by super-effective exploits, it never learns a new move. It's less ""Rock Throw"" and more ""Self-Destruct"" at this point. CertiK audited Onyx back in January 2022, and since then? Radio silence. No updates, no follow-ups, nada. At least publicly. It's as if Onyx thinks smart contracts are like fine wine - leave them alone and they'll get better with age. Spoiler alert: they don't. Meanwhile, Onyx decided to play Russian roulette with their protocol, adding a VUSD market via governance proposal. Because who needs a fresh audit when you're introducing new markets, right? Apparently, Onyx's idea of spring cleaning is sweeping old vulnerabilities under the rug while rolling out the red carpet for new ones. They didn't just skip a few steps; they took the express elevator to Rekt City, bypassing all the safety floors along the way. In a world where ""move fast and break things"" meets ""copy-paste and pray,"" is DeFi innovation outpacing common sense, or is common sense just taking a very, very long lunch break? If this story gives you a sense of déjà vu, you're not alone. We've been here before, folks. In our previous coverage of Onyx's misadventures, we highlighted a crucial point: while Certik did their audit dance, the real vulnerability lurks in the market conditions, not just the codebase. Remember the golden rule of Compound V2 forks? Empty markets are like catnip for hackers. Launching new markets should be handled with the care of a bomb disposal expert, not a ""yolo and hope for the best"" attitude. After the Hundred Finance sequel hack, Hexagate dropped some wisdom : ""Mint some cTokens, burn them, and make sure the total supply never hits zero. It's like DeFi's version of always leaving one cookie in the jar."" But did Onyx listen? Apparently, their memory is shorter than a goldfish's, and their learning curve flatter than a pancake. In the grand theater of DeFi, Onyx has managed to turn ""once bitten, twice shy"" into ""twice bitten, still clueless."" As the curtain falls on this repeat performance, one can't help but wonder: in a space where code is law, who's writing the constitution? And more importantly, who's bothering to read it?

Shortly after 11pm Thursday night (UTC), an attack on two fronts exploited a common reentrancy vulnerability, netting $1.9M on Arbitrum and $1.7M on Optimism. The alarm was raised a few hours later, and dForce confirmed the incident after a further 90 minutes. The team then expanded on their original announcement, stating that they had pause all vaults and adding: Users' funds supplied to dForce Lending and other vaults are SAFE. Good news came a few days later, when the exploiter returned all funds to dForce multisigs. However, the read-only reentrancy vulnerability is well-known, having most recently affected Midas Capital and, before that, Market.xyz . As we wrote in the Midas article: It’s always a shame to report on losses in DeFi, but especially when they are down to already known issues How much more will be lost to this bug? Credit: SlowMist , Peckshield The exploit used flash loaned funds to deposit into Curve’s wstETH/ETH, depositing the LP tokens into dForce’s wstETHCRV-gauge vault. Upon calling the remove_liquidity function, the attacker’s contract exploited the reentrancy vulnerability to manipulate the virtual price, which dForce uses as an oracle for the wstETHCRV-gauge tokens. This resulted in the hacker profiting off the liquidation of other users using wstETHCRV-gauge as collateral. Exploiter’s address ( OP , ARBI , ETH ): 0xe0d551017c0111ac11108641771897aa33b2817c Attack tx OP: 0x6c197621… Attack tx ARBI: 0x5db5c240… The vulnerability has been well-known for some time. According to ChainSecurity’s original report : On April 14, we informed Curve and affected projects about a read-only reentrancy vulnerability in some Curve pools. More specifically, the value of function get_virtual_price can be manipulated by reentering it during the removal of liquidity.” And Curve have provided a known workaround: one can call any method which has the nonreentrant lock (removing 0 liquidity is probably the cheapest). The attacker's ETH address was funded via Railgun on mainnet, before being used to fund OP and ARBI addresses via Synapse. dForce sent transactions ( OP , ARBI ) offering the attacker a bounty via tx input data. Fortunately, the hacker responded days later. dForce announced that funds had been returned to the project's multisigs and: All impacted users will be made whole, we will announce the details for distribution of the funds over the next few days. But this isn’t the first time dForce has got rekt. Back before rekt.news , in what seems like the distant past of April 2020, dForce lost $25M to an ERC-777 vulnerability. Users were reportedly refunded days later. More recently, though, Layer 2 networks have been enjoying a boom in adoption.

Yesterday, EraLend , a lending platform on zkSync Era, lost $3.4M to the rampant read-only reentrancy bug plaguing protocols across the cryptosphere. The alarm was raised and the losses stacked up . Syncswap was keen to reassure their users that they were not at risk, though recommended pulling LP tokens from EraLend as a precaution. In the end, only USDC deposits on EraLend were affected. This is the second leaderboard entry to come from zkSync, after Merlin DEX ’s $1.8M rugpull in April. With hack szn hotting up, where will be hit next? Credit: Spreekaway , Peckshield Read-only reentrancy is nothing new, with last Friday’s attack on Conic Finance the latest in a long line of projects rekt by the issue. In EraLend’s case, the attacker was able to exploit the vulnerability via a callback when burning LP tokens. in the syncswap LP tokens, one can burn, then callback before update_reserves is called. so the oracle uses an incorrect reserves value to calculate the price, resulting in an inflating oracle price. The buggy code was recycled from SyncSwap, but improperly implemented. Astonishingly, the code even contained the comment pointing out the potentially risky routine, which was apparently ignored: Note reserves are not updated at this point to allow read the old values. But comments are not effective reentrancy protection . Exploiter address: 0xf1D076c9Be4533086f967e14EE6aFf204D5ECE7a Example attack txs: 0x7ac4da1e… , 0x99efebac… Of the $3.4M lost from EraLend, Hacken puts the attacker profits at around $2.66M and traced funds to addresses on ETH, ARB and OP. BlockSec tweeted a warning to other projects that may be using the same code: Alert! All projects that rely on the following Syncswap code need to be vigilant. But given the prevalence of this attack type over the last months, why haven’t all devs already double (or triple) checked by now? Peckshield, who audited EraLend (then Nexon Finance) in March, washed their hands of responsibility. The audit apparently “ assumes a trusted price oracle ”, simplifying their job by simply ignoring one of the trickiest and most exploitable parts of many DeFi protocols. As noted by ChainSecurity’s Matthias Egli at EthCC last week, the losses from this string of hacks is far lower than the potential losses from far larger protocols that had been vulnerable before the vector was discovered last year. But that silver lining likely doesn’t make much difference to EraLend users. How long until this bug strikes again?

Socket’s Bungee bridge lost $3.3M yesterday to an attack draining addresses that had previously approved the SocketGateway contract on Ethereum. Shortly after the alarm was raised , the team acknowledged the hack, having patched the vulnerability just 14 minutes after the attack began . Wallet provider Rainbow also informed their users, as Socket’s contracts are used by the in-app bridging feature. They urged users to check whether their address was affected and revoke approvals via RevokeCash’s dedicated tool . As the over $80M NYE attack on Orbit shows, bridges continue to be a prime target for blackhats, and must be subject to the highest levels of scrutiny whenever any changes are made. Why did a known bug make it to production on a live bridge? Credit: qckhp , Peckshield , Beosin The attack was due to a lack of validation of user input contained in a new route added to the bridging contract three days prior to the exploit. The vulnerable route’s contract itself neglects to validate the swapExtraData parameter, allowing an exploiter to inject a transferFrom call, and send approved assets from victim addresses to their attack contract. As Beosin points out : It did not consider the case where the caller transfers in 0 WETH, allowing the caller to specify other functions in the call and still pass the balance check. Attacker’s address: 0x50df5a2217588772471b84adbbe4194a2ed39066 SocketGateway contract: 0x3a23f943181408eac424116af7b7790c94cb97a5 Socket contracts have audits by both Peckshield and Consensys Diligence . However, given that the new route was added just three days prior to the exploit, neither audit examined the vulnerable code. Funds stolen include ETH, MATIC, WBTC, WETH and DAI totalling approximately $3.3M. The stolen assets remain in the attacker's address, which has received a message threatening to dox the attacker if not paid off: 100 ETH and I'll throw away the timing analysis routing through FixedFloat that doxxes you. After 6 hours I go to Zach. Act swiftly. Infinite approvals strike again. Despite Bungee’s response that “ Bungee doesn't request infinite approvals by default ”, other protocols which route via the affected contract must subscribe to the UI before security mindset. Otherwise, it’s hard to believe that so many users would be vulnerable. With the biggest loss at over $600K and the five hardest-hit victims each losing over $100K, this will have been a costly lesson in approvals hygiene for some. Without a regular revoking detox, token approvals sit waiting for a live ( or forgotten ) project to be exploited. And given that tokens are stolen directly from users’ wallets, there’s no need to have any funds deposited to fall victim. However, all this could have simply been avoided by not making risky, unaudited upgrades to an existing bridge contract. Have you checked your approvals lately, anon?

Although the infinite mint exploit should have netted a tidy $3.3M profit, the clumsy crypto corsair dropped the loot overboard. 1570 ETH sent to the burn address and around $8k out of pocket overall . An embarrassing, but ultra-sound, self-rekt. Ancilia raised the alarm , with the Raft team quickly acknowledging the incident. An hour after the initial response, came the following update : Update: Further minting of R has been paused. Existing users are still able to repay their positions and receive their collateral. The next day, the team informed users that a recovery plan is in the works ( rugging a rug-artist , perhaps? ), while reminding users who had minted R that they are still able to recover collateral. The team also advised against speculating on the now-partially-unbacked stablecoin, adding: The current version of Raft will be sunsetted. Will they manage to keep themselves afloat for a v2? Credit: Ancilia , Igor Igamberdiev , BlockSec The hack involved inflating the value of collateral by liquidating previously opened positions from an address holding excess ETH (sourced via flash loan). The over-valued collateral then allowed the attacker to mint 6.7M R stablecoin, which were dumped for ( what should have been ) over $3M profit. For a full technical breakdown of the exploit, see threads by Ancilia , Igor Igamberdiev and BlockSec . See also the team's post-mortem . The freshly minted R tokens were dumped into the existing liquidity pool, causing the price to tumble: The token’s collateral reserves were not affected, and any users who have a CDP on Raft should be able to return R and withdraw their collateral.

Igor Igamberdiev explains : The problem is that the code for converting R to ETH and transferring it to the exploiter was called from another contract using delegatecall But delegatecall looks at the storage of the parent contract, in which the slot with the exploit address was not initialized Oops indeed. Despite how badly this exploit went for the attacker, they certainly aren’t stupid . Raft had been extensively audited by four organisations, including Trail of Bits and a Hats Finance contest.

Over $3.3M was stolen from SushiSwap users over the weekend via a new routing contract. All users who had approved Sushi’s 4 day old RouteProcessor2 contract at the time of the incident, were at risk, across 14 chains . Sushi Head Chef, Jared Grey, acknowledged the bug, urging users to revoke approvals. He later stated that the protocol is now safe to use, and the exploited contract has been removed, as well as promising a full post-mortem on events. Amongst the chaos, DeFi’s favourite villain got rekt for 1800 ETH, and there was plenty of whitehacking activity . One user claimed to have targeted 0xSifu as a whitehat, though the attempt appeared to have been botched , with only 100 ETH eventually returned . BlockSec also got involved, adding to their impressive list of recent whitehacks . Luckily, the days-old contract had relatively few approvers, and this didn’t turn out to be the AMM-ageddon it could have been. But this is a bad look for an already-embattled protocol, nonetheless. How many more scandals can Sushi take? Credit: Inspex , 0xfoobar , ernestognw The new contract contained the function, processRoute, which is insufficiently protected against accepting arbitrary data. The attacker was able to create a fake Univ3 pool, and insert their own contract address in place of a genuine liquidity pool. During the uniswapV3SwapCallback function, the contract is then able to drain (or 'yoink' ) tokens from any address which had approved it. As 0xfoobar explained : SushiSwap router exploit comes from a bad callback. Although the line 328 comment is correct, line 340 does not check the pool deployer. So you can impersonate a V3Pool, do a no-op swap, call safeTransferFrom on an arbitrary ERC20 and arbitrary from address on line 347 A more detailed breakdown was provided by ernestognw.eth. Example attack tx: 0xea3480f1… RouteProcessor2 contract on ETH: 0x044b75f554b886A065b9567891e45c79542d7357 See this list for addresses to revoke across multiple chains. Rather than an existential threat to SushiSwap, this incident is more of an embarrassment than anything. The damage wasn’t enourmous, nor particularly widespread . Users were either drained or revoked quickly, and whitehat efforts certainly helped to soften the PR blow. Ever since its launch, though, Sushi has been surrounded by drama. 2020’s DeFi summer saw Sushi come onto the scene in dramatic fashion, quickly establishing itself as one of DeFi’s darlings, alongside Uniswap, Curve, Aave and Compound. However, a period of stagnation during the 2021 bull run ended in infighting . Then, in October, the new head chef, Jared Grey’s, murky past in a variety of struggling projects drew suspicion. Sushi seems to be a good case study for DAOs working, until they don’t. A small team of highly-motivated devs can disrupt the DEX landscape in just weeks. But once the excitement wanes, a bloated team can get too comfortable with inactivity and apathy (or simply farming a project’s treasury). Grey receiving an SEC subpoena, criticism of a paltry bug bounty programme, and large operating expenses (including 500k for Grey himself)... It appears the drama is far from over for Sushi.

The NEAR-based token launchpad had its treasury drained of 1.1M NEAR, worth approximately $3.2M at the time. The exploit caused the price of SKYWARD to tank by ~90%: Rather than the usual damage-control and downplaying, the team’s announcement concedes that the exploit “ render[ed] the Treasury and the $SKYWARD token effectively worthless. ” Going on to explain that the contracts are fully immutable, the Skyward assured any projects currently launching via the platform that “ existing and previous sales are not affected, so funds and proceeds can be withdrawn safely. ” But there was no such good news for Skyward holders: We recommend users to withdraw their funds safely where they can and for the community to no longer interact with Skyward. Was this incident an honest, albeit simple, mistake? Or a planned ejector seat? Credit: Sanket Naikwadi , BlockSec Shortly after 5pm UTC yesterday, the exploiter redeemed (previously accumulated) SKYWARD for wNEAR from the treasury using the redeem_skyward function. However, the function lacks proper verification of the token_account_ids parameter, allowing the attacker to loop the redemption of wNEAR by repeatedly passing their withdrawal within the transaction. The exploiter repeated the exploited redemption process until the treasury had been drained of wNEAR.

Perhaps hackers are less familiar with the NEAR ecosystem and feel their time and resources can be put to use more profitably elsewhere… Or maybe this was a planned exit-by-exploit, and the users were right to be concerned before launch… This is the first leaderboard entry (#88) for a NEAR-based project; let’s hope we can learn something from it… When headed Skyward, don't fly too NEAR to the sun.

A blue-chip rekt by a front-end attack. A developer who had been contracted to work on the MISO auction for “JayPegs Automart” inserted his own wallet address into the contract instead of the auctionWallet . Remind us, which part of crypto is supposed to be “trustless”? Misplaced faith cost MISO $3.1 million. The aftermath was more aggressive than usual. In a since deleted tweet, Sushi CTO Joseph DeLong went public with his suspicions, doxxing the developer he believed to be responsible. The Miso front end has become the victim of a supply chain attack. An anonymous contractor by with the GH handle AristoK3 injected malicious code into the Miso front end. We have reason to believe this is @eratos1122 . Eratos1122 protested , but the Sushi team had made their case, and they refused to back down. DeLong had attached the resume, personal website, Facebook profile, email address and invoice details of eratos1122 into a public Google doc. After a few hours of these details being made public, and following threats from the Sushi team to involve the FBI, the money was returned. (865.094 of 864.8 ether, more than was originally stolen) The doxx document is now private, however some of the contents are detailed below. We’ll let the rekt readers decide why the funds were returned.

Doxxing somebody like that is a serious step to take, and the Sushi team / Joseph DeLong must have had a lot of conviction in order to be so public with their accusation. The tweets and documents may no longer be available, but the Sushi and Jaypeg team still seem confident that their suspicions were correct. Until now, Eratos1122 had earned a decent reputation in the space , and his Github shows a lot of experience. Whether the accusations against him are truthful or not, this incident will not be forgotten. Another close call for Sushiswap, who have appeared in rekt.news in the past, but always seem to escape total disaster. However, regardless of refund, a hack is a hack, and this one’s going on the leaderboard.

Banana Gun - Rekt,3000000,09/19/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/bananagun-rekt/,"Banana Gun - Rekt Wednesday, September 25, 2024 Banana Gun -  read this article also in : en - es Banana Gun slipped on a $3 million Telegram peel, proving once again that in DeFi, even your bot can go bananas. Another day, another protocol got caught with its pants down. Banana Gun, the supposedly secure Telegram trading bot, got royally split. On September 19th, while most of us were busy watching charts go sideways, some Banana Gun users found their wallets being peeled faster than a chimp on speed. This fruit fiasco started with a rumor of a few wallets going bananas, but quickly ripened into a full-blown plantain panic. Initially reported as a $1.9M slipup affecting 36 users, this bunch of bad news eventually grew to a $3M whopper impacting 11 very unhappy campers. Talk about your garden-variety FUD bearing some seriously rotten fruit. Banana Gun users found themselves in the crosshairs of a potassium-powered misfire. As refund promises fly, one wonders: in DeFi, is ""secure"" just code for ""not yet hacked""? Credit: Yannick Crypto , Banana Gun , Maestro Bot , Unibot The Banana Gun drama unfolded like a badly peeled banana, leaving a mess of questions and a slippery trail of lost funds. Crypto canary, Yannick, first chirped the alarm : ""There is rumour that Banana Gun wallet's getting drained right now. But there is rumour that there are much more victims."" Yannick spotted the first brown spot, but even he couldn't predict how quickly this bunch would spoil. As the crypto-sphere buzzed with the sweet scent of fresh FUD, initial reports suggested 36 users had been taken to the cleaners for a cool $1.9 million. When the last wallet was squeezed and the final digit drained, the true extent of the damage emerged: 11 users, $3 million gone. Fewer victims, bigger wounds. Talk about a concentrated potassium punch. The attack, exploiting a novel vulnerability in the Telegram message oracle, hit both Ethereum and Solana bots. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot with a banana. Seems like cross-chain compatibility is the ultimate equal opportunity exploiter. Who said innovation in crypto was dead? As the banana peels settled, the Banana Gun team sprung into action like a bunch of caffeinated monkeys. Their first move? Shut down the Ethereum and Solana bots faster than you can say ""rug pull."" At least someone had the presence of mind to stop the bleeding, even if it was a case of too little, too late. The attack, it turns out, was more surgical than a monkey with a scalpel. It targeted smart money traders and crypto veterans - you know, the ones who are supposed to know better. All victims were ""known"" in the space, either due to their social presence or trading expertise. Seems like fame in crypto comes with a price tag these days. In a twist worthy of a Christopher Nolan film, the victims watched in real-time as the attacker manually transferred ETH from their wallets. Talk about interactive entertainment! As if watching your portfolio during a bear market wasn't painful enough. Banana Gun's incident report reads like a who's who of security measures they should have had in the first place. Two-factor authentication? Check. Transfer delays? You bet. Thorough system reviews? Of course! It's amazing how a $3 million loss can suddenly make basic security look attractive. Seems like their security was as effective as bringing a banana to a gunfight. The cherry on top of this banana split? The promise of full refunds from the Banana Gun treasury. No token sales necessary, they assure us. Because nothing says ""we've got this under control"" like emptying your war chest to cover a hack. As for the root cause, Banana Gun points the finger at a ""potential vulnerability in the Telegram message oracle.” Potential, they say, as if there might be another explanation for $3 million vanishing into thin air. Maybe it was just a very convincing magic trick? In a twist worthy of a blockbuster heist film, Banana Gun wasn't the only bot feeling the heat that day. Reports surfaced of similar exploits targeting Maestro Bot and Unibot. Maestro Bot lost $200k to a suspicious wallet, while Unibot acknowledged an ""ongoing exploit."" Coincidence? Or a coordinated attack on the bot brigade? Curiously, neither Maestro Bot nor Unibot have released detailed incident reports. Maestro Bot tried to downplay the FUD , stating “We haven't received 1 single complaint from any of our users getting their funds stolen.” It's like they're all competing in the ""Who can say the least about losing the most"" championship. While these bots play their cards close to their chests, a larger question looms over the DeFi landscape. Could this Telegram oracle exploit be the first tremor of a seismic shift in DeFi vulnerabilities? Only time will tell if this slip-up will land Banana Gun in the annals of epic crypto fails or if it'll rise from the ashes like a phoenix... or should we say, like a banana tree from compost. The Telegram oracle exploit has peeled back the layers on a possible new breed of vulnerability, one that could make centralized chat platforms the next juicy target for DeFi predators. As trading bots proliferate faster than yield farmers at an airdrop, they're serving up a smorgasbord of attack vectors on a silver platter. In the end, Banana Gun users learned a hard lesson: when your financial fruit goes ballistic, it's your wallet that gets juiced. Banana Gun's quick reflex to shut down the bots may have stemmed the bleeding, but it left a $3 million shaped hole in their credibility. Their promises of refunds and security upgrades sound great on paper, but so did UST's ""algorithmic stability."" Meanwhile, the radio silence from Maestro Bot and Unibot speaks volumes. Are they frantically patching similar vulnerabilities, or just hoping nobody notices their own bruised fruits? As trading bots and chat platforms become the new playground for DeFi predators, how long until ""gm"" becomes shorthand for ""give me your money""?

Certik/Kraken - Rekt,3000000,06/09/2024,N/A,https://rekt.news/certik-kraken-rekt/,"Certik/Kraken - Rekt Thursday, June 20, 2024 Certik - Kraken -  read this article also in : en - es Kraken accuses security researchers of extortion after $3M bug bounty exploit. A cybersecurity firm's disclosure of a critical vulnerability in Kraken's systems has escalated into accusations of extortion and threats between the parties. Chief Security Officer Nick Percoco disclosed that Kraken received a bug bounty program alert from a security researcher in early June. Security research firm Certik revealed that they discovered the bug. However, rather than cooperating to address the issue, Kraken allegedly responded by threatening CertiK employees and making unreasonable demands, as claimed by CertiK. The conflicting claims have devolved into a public he-said-she-said dispute, with each party accusing the other of questionable behavior. In this strange and unsettling situation, can we truly trust the guardians of our digital fortresses? Credit: Nick Percoco , Certik , Tayvano , Immutable Lawyer While initially vague, the report claimed to have found an ""extremely critical"" bug that allowed inflating account balances on the cryptocurrency exchange. Nick Percoco stated that Kraken's security team promptly investigated the matter and discovered an isolated bug that allowed a malicious attacker, under the right circumstances, to initiate a deposit onto our platform and receive funds in their account without fully completing the deposit. Within an hour and 47 minutes, Kraken had deployed a fix to resolve the issue. CertiK alleges their investigation uncovered more alarming vulnerabilities in Kraken's systems beyond the initial bug report. According to CertiK, their testing confirmed the ability to fabricate deposits into any Kraken account, withdraw large sums of fabricated crypto exceeding $1 million, all without triggering any alerts for multiple days. CertiK claims that after responsibly reporting these critical findings, which Kraken itself classified at the highest severity level, the exchange then threatened CertiK employees with demands to repay a ""mismatched amount"" of crypto within an ""unreasonable time"" without even providing wallet addresses. The security firm alleges Kraken's threats came after CertiK had already assisted in successfully identifying and remediating the vulnerabilities. CertiK states they have gone public to protect users and urge Kraken to cease making threats against ethical security researchers acting in good faith. This contradicts Kraken's portrayal of the initial $3 million incident as clear extortion by bad actors. CertiK asserts they followed responsible vulnerability disclosure practices in coordination with Kraken initially. Further analysis revealed that the bug had already been actively exploited in the preceding days across three accounts associated with the original researcher's colleagues. One account controlled by the researcher had deposited a mere $4, seemingly to validate the vulnerability. Ultimately, the exploitation of a vulnerability in Kraken's systems enabled the withdrawal of over $3 million dollars from Kraken's corporate wallets over a five-day period by abusing the same flaw. CertiK claims that the transactions were merely testing deposit transactions , with millions being withdrawn from the system for testing purposes. Certik asserted that millions of dollars of crypto were minted out of air, and no real Kraken user’s assets were directly involved in our research activities. Notably, they underlined that despite numerous fabricated tokens being generated and exchanged for valid cryptocurrencies over several days, no risk control or prevention measures were enacted until CertiK brought the issue to light. When Kraken requested that the illegally obtained funds be returned per its bug bounty policy, the researchers refused and instead demanded a speculative ransom payment based on hypothetical maximum losses. This $3 million exploit formed the basis of Kraken's claim of extortion by bad actors. However, CertiK alleges this demand was in response to Kraken's own threats after CertiK reported even more severe vulnerabilities. It should be worthy to note, according to Kraken’s Bug Bounty page, the max pay out for a Critical severity is capped at $1.5 million . Strangely, 3 transactions made by the same address conducting these “tests” made 3 deposits to Tornado Cash almost 2 weeks ago. Tornado Cash Deposit Tornado Cash Deposit Tornado Cash Deposit If it turns out that Certik was routing funds through a Tornado Cash, a sanctioned virtual currency mixer , the legal implications could be massive. Time will tell who was in the wrong here, clearly someone really screwed up. Are we venturing into a realm where the lines between ethical behavior and exploitation blur, akin to crossing over into the enigmatic realm of the Twilight Zone? With both parties trading accusations of extortion and threats, the matter has devolved into a heated he-said-she-said quagmire. Kraken insists it took reasonable actions to protect itself after ethical boundaries were crossed. CertiK maintains it followed industry best practices for vulnerability disclosures and responsible coordination. Caught in the crossfire of this public spat are the users and broader crypto community. As fingers get pointed in both directions, maybe the truth about what actually transpired will be established. Whose narrative will prove credible? What if there is another version of the story that has yet to be uncovered, such as a rogue actor ? As the outcome may significantly impact platform security and user safety in the crypto world, one wonders if ethics and collaboration will triumph over assertions of misconduct. In light of this significant occurrence, it's important to consider the possible impact on security researchers who may be more cautious about sharing their discoveries, fearing potential involvement in similar disputes. Additionally, can we fully dismiss the possibility that a rogue actor within CertiK might have played a role in the alleged exploitation, further complicating the narrative and raising questions about trust and accountability in the security research community?

While the project’s social media presence and GitHub repos have been deleted, Swaprum’s website remains live, proudly displaying Certik’s seal of approval in its banner. This latest incident comes less than a month after Merlin DEX rugged $1.8M , sparking a debate as to whether a Certik audit was more of a red flag than a mark of confidence. This is the 4th rug over $1M we’ve covered so far this year, all of them supposedly audited. But not all audits are created equal… When will we learn? Credit: Beosin As with most rug-pulls, the mechanics behind the incident were not complicated. The project’s reward contract was upgraded to a new version which included the backdoor function add() . add() sends users LP tokens to the team’s Deployer address, which was able to steal the funds by draining the underlying liquidity. Attacker address (Swaprum: Deployer): 0xf2744e1fe488748e6a550677670265f664d96627 Example tx: 0x36fef881… Funds were bridged to Ethereum where a total of 1620 ETH was deposited into Tornado Cash. It should be noted that the upgraded (malicious) contract was not included in the audit . But the capability to upgrade contracts containing user funds to an arbitrary deployment was always there... Certik does mention major centralisation issues in Swaprum’s code, remarking that the contract owner has authority over certain aspects of the protocol. However, the wording mainly refers to external threats: Any compromise to the _owner account may allow the hacker to take advantage of this authority… If an attacker compromises the account, he can change the implementation of the contract and drain tokens from the contract. Given the recent backlash, one would think that auditors might make an effort to be more explicit about the potential for malicious insiders, reflecting the fact in the report’s wording. A simple ‘ruggability’ score would go a long way to communicating these risks in a degen-friendly format. However, the idea probably wouldn’t go over well with grifters looking to rubber stamp their latest scam. Certik has since updated Swaprum’s security score to “Exit Scam”. Too little, too late?

Orion Protocol - REKT,3000000,02/02/2023,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/orion-protocol-rekt/,"Orion Protocol -  Saturday, February 4, 2023 Orion Protocol -  read this article also in : en - es - tr - zh The hunter has become the hunted. Orion Protocol fell prey to a reentrancy exploit on Thursday, losing a total of $3M on ETH and BSC. The project is a ‘liquidity aggregator’ aiming to bring CEX liquidity on-chain (not to be confused with Orion Finance who rugged $320k on Arbitrum the day before). A few hours after the news spread on Twitter, Orion’s CEO announced the loss, clarifying that the damage was contained to an internal broker account and that user funds remain safe. Orion’s website states: WHY WE EXIST No one has solved liquidity, custody, accessibility, and scalability in one platform. Until now. Perhaps they should have added security to that list… Credit: SlowMist , Peckshield The attacker used manipulated swaps of flash loaned stablecoins, artificially depositing the assets twice before withdrawing the inflated balance. By creating a fake token (ATK) and routing a swap of the flash loaned funds via ATK, a reentrancy hook called depositAsset within ATK’s transfer function, effectively doubling the attacker’s account balance. Slowmist provided a detailed breakdown of the attack: The attacker first called the depositAsset function of the ExchangeWithAtomic contract to make a deposit of 0.5 USDC tokens in preparation for the following attack: Next, the attacker makes a flashloan of 284,700 USDT and then calls the doSwapThroughOrionPool function of the ExchangeWithAtomic contract to swap the tokens, the exchange path is ""USDC -> ATK(malicious token created by the attacker) -> USDT"". The out amount of the exchange is the USDT balance in the ExchangeWithAtomic contract after the exchange minus the initial balance of 2,844,700 USDT. The problem arises when a call to the ATK token transfer function during the exchange causes the attacker to re-enter the ExchangeWithAtomic contract depositAsset function, resulting in the transfer of 284.4 million USDT from the flashloan to the ExchangeWithAtomic contract. The attacker's deposit in the ExchangeWithAtomic contract is recorded as 2,844,700 and the balance of USDT tokens in the contract becomes 5,689,000. As a result, the attacker's exchange of USDT is calculated as 5,689,000 minus 2,844,700. By calling the library function creditUserAssets to update the attacking contract's ledger in the ExchangeWithAtomic contract used the exchanged USDT, resulting in the attacking contract's final deposit of USDT in the ExchangeWithAtomic contract being recorded as 5.68 million. Finally, the attacker withdraws the USDT and returns it to the flashloan lender and swaps the remaining 2.836 million USDT into WETH for profit. The attackers used the same method to launch an attack on the BSC chain and made $191,000 in profit. The root cause of the attack was the contract exchange function is not protected from reentrancy... Peckshield produced the following diagram showing the basic attack steps: Attacker address 1 ( ETH , BSC ): 0x3dabf5e36df28f6064a7c5638d0c4e01539e35f1 Attacker address 2 ( ETH , BSC ): 0x837962b686fd5a407fb4e5f92e8be86a230484bd Example tx (BSC): 0xfb153c57… Example tx (ETH): 0xa6f63fcb… Stolen funds have mostly been deposited to Tornado Cash, with approximately $1M of ETH remaining in the Ethereum address. The attacker’s account was funded from a Binance-labelled wallet, though the original source was allegedly another CEX , SimpleSwap. In his thread on the incident, Orion’s CEO Alexey Koloskov stated his confidence in his own team’s code: We have reasons to believe that the issue was not a result of any shortcomings in our core protocol code, but rather might have been caused by a vulnerability in mixing third-party libraries in one of the smart contracts used by our experimental and private brokers. But when such large amounts of money are on the line, security must be considered at all levels of a project’s stack. And it appears that this $3M loss has motivated Orion to take a more controlled approach: Moving forward, any and all contracts will be developed in-house to eliminate any potential vulnerabilities from third-party libraries. Our focus is to fortify the Orion Protocol and make sure it remains robust. Glad to hear Orion will be taking security more Sirius-ly.

The attack was funded with ETH (on BSC), originally sourced from Tornado Cash on mainnet. The funds were then swapped for large quantities of FTS, which were used to reach quorum for the malicious proposal and as collateral. Following the exploit, the attacker deposited a total of 1048 ETH ($2.6M) and 400k DAI into Tornado Cash. Oracle attack tx: 0x13d198… Attacker’s address on BSC and ETH :

An unexpected plot twist saw Deus DAO users liquidated via a flash loan attack on the recently launched DEI lending contract , with the attacker making ~$3M profit. Five months have passed since we last reported a flash loan attack, but they used to be commonplace. Is DeFi growing stronger? A flash loan attack was used to manipulate the balance of the Solidex USDC/DEI pool, which is used as an oracle for collateral value on Deus Finance’s $DEI lending contract. This resulted in user positions becoming insolvent, which the hacker’s contract liquidated, before repaying the flash loan. Credit: Peckshield 1: Flashloan 9,739342 DEI via SPIRIT-LP_USDC_DEI 2: Flashloan 24,772,798 DEI out of the sAMM-USDC/DEI pair (used as price oracle to calculate collateral value) 3: Liquidate the users who become insolvent from Step 2 4: Repay the borrowed 24,772,798 DEI to the sAMM-USDC/DEI pair 5: Burn the liquidated LP token to get 5,218,173 USDC + 5,246,603 DEI 6: Swap 5,218,173 USDC to 5,170,594 DEI 7: Repay flashloan with 3,001,552 DEI as hack profit Attack tx: 0xe374495036fac18aa5b1a497a17e70f256c4d3d416dd1408c026f3f5c70a3a9c The attacker then went on to send 3M USDC via Multichain from an FTM address to ETH address , and from there 1.1k ETH and 200k DAI to Tornado cash, totalling ~$3M gained. The project’s token, DEUS , dropped ~40% in the hour following the attack and, despite some recovery, remains volatile. Deus have announced that they will be reimbursing affected users who return their DEI debts, returning their liquidated collateral. Flash loan season taught even non-technical users about the importance of price oracles. Security standards emerged from our baptism of fire, and the industry learned and moved forward.

A double-whammy of embarrassing security blunders led to Stars Arena being drained of almost $3M ( its entire TVL ) on Saturday. The Avalanche-based FriendTech clone, heavily shilled by the usual suspects , had been hit by an (economically unviable) exploit the previous day. The team’s cringe announcement of a fix didn’t inspire much confidence that security was their primary concern: THE EXPLOIT HAS BEEN FIXED. BUT DON’T GET THIS WRONG WE ARE AT WAR. The team brushed off the vulnerability as “ throwing money away ”, a sentiment repeated by Ava Labs’ CEO Emin Gün Sirer, who dismissed the incident as FUD ( unsurprisingly, as he’d also spent last week relentlessly shilling the project ). While it may be surprising that Avalanche’s ecosystem ambassador would promote an unaudited, unverified fask-fork of a flash-in-the-pan SocialFi ponzi, the double-down after the second hack was more mindboggling still. The amount lost is only $3m… ...something that SA can recover in about 10 days or so… ...the hack is a mere speed bump... Presumably because this was the first time AVAX had been relevant in months, Sirer then continued to go to bat for the commpletely drained protocol as CT looked on in confusion. Ever heard the phrase ‘stop digging’ ? Credit: 0xlilitch , Beosin The first hack was down to a broken getPrice() function. However, the exploit required spending 4x the profit in gas to drain the contract, which lost just $2k before users ( allegedly including the user who publicised the vulnerability) gave up. The team announced the fix and the proxy was upgraded to a new ( also unverified ) contract. Then, amidst the criticism of the team’s comms, came the second exploit , draining $2.9M. The contract is unverified, but according to Beosin the attacker took advantage of a reentrancy vulnerability to insert a block height as the number of AVAX to send during the sellShares() function. Hacker’s address: 0xa2Ebf3FCD757e9BE1E58B643b6B5077D11b4ad7A As more attention was paid to the project, the hypocrisy of the team became clear, claiming "" security is the core driving factor behind everything we do "" whilst having access to users’ PKs and leaving their system wide open to DDOS. Oh, and getting hacked twice of course… As the summer’s FriendTech hype rapidly died away, our innovative industry did what it does best: launching a slew of clones, quick cash grabs which add nothing new. Except vulnerabilities. FriendTech itself has been hit by a wave of SIM-swap attacks with the last bull run’s easiest targets being made high priority . Or perhaps we have simply reached the boating-accident-via-SIM-swap stage of the ponzi cycle. As the scheme unwinds the userbase appears to be getting increasingly PvP by the day, but amidst the high-fee dumpfest the devs certainly aren’t complaining .

Credit: Certik , Beosin Launched in July, Lucky Star Currency is a Chinese Astrology-themed NFT project promoted under the handle AstrAstrol75591 on Twitter. The two attacked contracts, however, were published just over two weeks ago. The project’s deployer address used the privileged function withdrawToken() to first drain 1.65M LSC tokens from the project’s AwardCentre contract, then a further 1.45M LSC from the NFTMerge contract. The ~3M LSC were then swapped for $1.1M BSC-USD and forwarded onto a new address , where they remain.

OKX’s decentralised exchange aggregator has fallen victim to one of the oldest tricks in the book, losing $2.7M to a private key compromise. The losses were caused by a compromised proxy contract, which was upgraded and used to steal funds from users who had approved it. After community reports of funds going missing, Slowmist raised the alarm . An official acknowledgement came shortly after, stating that the affected contract was a deprecated version, and had now been secured. But if the contract was deprecated, why did they wait until it got rekt? Credit: SlowMist Although OKX itself is a centralised exchange, it runs a DEX aggregator (featuring “ best-in-class security ”, apparently ) to help its more intrepid users seek out more niche opportunities on-chain. According to SlowMist , the proxy admin of a trusted contract controlling OKX DEX trades was compromised. Then, shortly before midnight UTC, the implementation was upgraded in order to siphon user funds from addresses which had approved the proxy. The pattern is described as follows: ...when users exchange, they authorize the TokenApprove contract, and the DEX contract transfers the user's tokens by calling the TokenApprove contract. The DEX contract has a claimTokens function that allows a trusted DEX Proxy to make calls, with its functionality being to invoke the claimTokens function of the TokenApprove contract to transfer tokens authorized by the user. The trusted DEX Proxy is managed by the Proxy Admin, and the Proxy Admin Owner can upgrade the DEX Proxy contract through the Proxy Admin. Once compromised: ...the Proxy Admin Owner upgraded the DEX Proxy contract to a new implementation contract through the Proxy Admin. The new implementation contract's functionality is to directly call the claimTokens function of the DEX contract to transfer tokens. Subsequently, attackers began calling the DEX Proxy to steal tokens.

First Stake , then CoinEx . Is Lazarus going for a September hat-trick? In the third ( almost identical ) story of this month so far, Remitano has lost $2.7M from hot wallets on Ethereum and Tron. Suspicious withdrawals were again detected by Cyvers and Remintano dragged their feet in responding (only publicly announcing the incident over 20 hours after the attack began). However, this time there was some good news. Tether’s quick response in freezing funds vastly reduced the attack profits from $2.7M to just $260k. Are we… learning? Credit: PeckShield , Cyvers The attack, which began at 12:47 PM UTC yesterday, was yet another example of a simple hot-wallet draining due to a private key compromise. With two similar high-profile incidents in the last two weeks, it seems plausible that this is also the work of the Lazarus Group, a highly sophisticated DPRK state-sponsored hacking group. The official announcement from Remitano doesn’t specify exactly how hackers gained access to the hot wallet addresses in question, but does blame the theft on “ a data breach from a third-party source ”. The post explains that upon notification of the breach, they consolidated assets from other hot wallets into secure cold storage addresses, and collaborated with Tether to freeze funds. A total of 1.9M in USDT was frozen by Tether across the two chains, the remaining funds on Ethereum were swapped to ETH and deposited to an exchange, thought to be either HitBTC or Changelly. The funds on Tron remain in the hacker’s address. Attacker addresses: ETH: 0x74530e81e9f4715c720b6b237f682cd0e298b66c TRON: TEDNf1aqk8YJEUdNH9NRd4MqibZmdP49Fm Assets stolen on ETH: 1.36M USDT 210k USDC 34.4 ETH 100k ANKR And on TRON: 540k USDT 3.75M TRX. This time, Tether responded quickly enough to save the majority of funds, and Cyvers have called on exchanges to check deposits and block any funds that weren’t frozen. However, in general, the industry response to these types of events tends to be slow and incomplete. Granted, we should expect more from custodians’ ability to secure their wallets, but there is still often a glaring failure in action after the fact. Even funds with clear links to Lazarus are being freely moved in and out of major exchanges, with chain checkers only able to watch the flow in real time. Even the most well-respected exchanges don’t seem keen to do the right thing, apparently happy to perpetuate the stereotype of a lawless cryptosphere when they would surely benefit from some good publicity right now .

Atlantis Loans - REKT,2500000,06/10/2023,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/atlantis-loans-rekt/,"Atlantis Loans -  Tuesday, June 13, 2023 Atlantis Loans - BSC -  read this article also in : en - es UPDATE: Almost a week after the initial exploit, further funds have been drained, bringing the total lost to $2.5M (as noted by Peckshield ). The lost city sunk long ago. Now, former users have been drained , for a total of ~$1M. Atlantis Loans was a lending protocol on BSC, before being abandoned by the developers in early April. Users were informed via a Medium post in which the dev team said they couldn’t afford to continue maintaining the platform. They added: we believe that discontinuing our services is in the best interest of our users and the protection of their funds. However, the protocol remained live, with the UI even paid up in advance for two years. As stated in the post: the only way to make changes or turn things off will have to be done through the governance. Foreshadowing? Credit: Beosin , Numen Cyber The attack had been attempted on the 12th of April, but it failed to pass. With the project abandoned, little attention was paid to the recent proposal 52 published on the 7th June. The attacker pushed and voted through a governance proposal granting them control of Atlantis Loans’ token contracts. They then upgraded with their own malicious contracts, allowing them to transfer tokens from any address which still had active approvals to Atlantis contracts. For a full breakdown of how the proposal was executed, see Numen Cyber’s thread . Full list of contracts to revoke approvals. Attacker’s address: 0xEADe071FF23bceF312deC938eCE29f7da62CF45b The attacker was initially funded by Binance on ETH. Governance attacks can be varied in their scope and effects. Last month, we saw Tornado Cash ’s governance system hijacked by an attacker who snuck code into what was supposed to be a safe proposal. Last year, Beanstalk got rekt for $181M from a flash loan-enabled governance attack made possible by a lack of execution delay on the proposal. And in March, Swerve, an also-abandoned Curve-clone , was (unsucessfully) targeted via governance. The proposal would have transferred $1.3M remaining in the DAI-USDC-USDT liquidity pool to the attacker’s address, but they were unable to gather enough tokens to force the vote through. This week’s case serves not just as a reminder to revoke old token approvals, but highlights the importance of carefully monitoring governance processes, even on defunct projects. For Atlantis, it looks like it’s back to the murky depths… …for good this time.

TempleDAO launched as one of many OHM-forks in the run-up to last year’s market top, before pivoting to stablecoin farm when the Olympus model crumbled. Temple’s current focus is on yield for FRAX3CRV via Convex, and STAX forms part of their “ flywheel system ” as “ a reward boosting liquidity layer for the FRAX/TEMPLE gauge ”. Despite initially establishing a cult-like following, the devotion of their users seems to be waning. The day before the exploit, DCF GOD responded to a TempleDAO community vibe check: ”After a year of it, I’m low on hope” Now that users have lost all hope, who still has faith in Temple DAO? The alarm was raised by Spreek approximately an hour after the exploit, which was later confirmed by STAX . Although the damage done is unlikely to pose an existential threat to the wider TempleDAO protocol, the details of the exploit make for painful reading. How did the devs make such a simple oversight when they published the contract in June? And why did it take so long to be exploited? Credit: FrankResearcher , BlockSec This hack was worryingly simple. The StaxLPStaking contract’s migrateStake() function did not contain any checks that the oldStaking parameter was valid. This meant that anyone could create a contract with the same oldStaking parameter, specifying an arbitrary deposit amount and address to which the funds could be sent. The resulting ~320k Stax Frax/Temple LP tokens were then swapped for ETH inside the attacker’s contract .

STAX have assured that ” Remediations will be made for all affected users. ” Arguably, the greatest damage done will be to the project’s reputation, after allowing such a basic error to make it to production.

A flashloan attack has drained the Avalanche-based protocol of $2.2M, but this isn’t their first time on the leaderboard … In February, Platypus lost $8.5M when its recently-released stablecoin was attacked (also via flash loan). The incident wasn’t exactly a blackhat masterclass. The hacker had neglected to code a way to withdraw funds from the attack contract, and BlockSec were able to whitehack 2.4M USDC to be returned. Additionally, shoddy OPSEC led to the hacker being quickly tracked down , and later arrested in France. The project was also hit in July for $150k. **This time, after Peckshield raised the alarm, and the losses began to mount up , Platypus acknowledged the incident: Due to suspicious activities in our protocol, we have taken the proactive measure of temporarily suspending all pools. As we wrote last time: Evolution works in mysterious ways. But after three exploits in 8 months… …how long until Platypus goes extinct? Credit: BlockSec , Inspex The attack was comprised of three transactions, each of which used flash loans to manipulate the prices within the Platypus LP-AVAX pool . According to BlockSec , the attacker “ manipulated 'cash' and 'liability' which affected the swap price ” via slippage. Inspex provided the following step-by-step: 1/ The attacker deposits WAVAX to LP-AVAX, and sAVAX to LP-sAVAX increases the liability of both LP contracts. 2/ The attacker swapped sAVAX to WAVAX to reduce the cash from the LP-AVAX contract. 3/ The attacker then withdrawn WAVAX from LP-AVAX to remove all available cash from the LP-AVAX contract. This will increase the slippageFrom value, resulting in manipulating the actualToAmount value. 4/ As a result, the attacker swap and take profit from the manipulated slippage. Again, as in February, the hacker made a mistake which allowed for the recovery of some ($575k) of the stolen assets.

This time on Coinbase's pet project Base Network. ETHTrustFund rug pulls on Base, leading to $2.1 million in investor losses. Every ponzi needs a catchy name and what better way to inspire trust than by including ""ETH"" and ""Fund"" in your project title? It turned out to be anything but trustworthy. Users deposited their hard-earned ETH directly into the project's treasury without realizing they were funding an exit scam. The dev, known only as Peng, spent months building trust and raising capital, before ghosting investors for three months and finally pulling the rug. Doesn’t this look like it was a personal trust fund for the developer? Credit: Ogle , Octoshi , Coin Telegraph With a well-funded treasury of over $2 million, ETHTrustFund aka ETF , positioned itself as an OHM fork on Base. Investors believed the founder to be a seasoned dev, willing to build a legitimate project on the new chain. To outsiders, it looked like a token that pumped and dumped back in March, after pumping shortly after launching, it was down over 90% less than a week later. After months of inactivity, the price stagnated. Then came the inevitable. Crypto crime fighter Ogle from glue.net called out the project for rugging over this past weekend and reported it to Chainabuse . The fraudulent project abruptly moved funds from its treasury to a new wallet. Crypto community figure Octoshi disclosed a series of suspicious funds transfers and the project’s sudden inactivity. The founder, Peng, had deleted his Telegram, Twitter, the official Telegram of the project itself and was ignoring all messages and DMs. Tracing the stolen funds: All $BRETT tokens were swapped to $ETH and bridged from the treasury on Base to a fresh wallet on Ethereum.

But ""Peng"" had already vanished into the crypto ether… Social media accounts deleted, website down, only the ghostly remains of project docs were left behind, at least briefly, as those have been taken down too. All evidence pointed towards a classic rug pull/exit scam, with Base as the unwitting stage for this financial theater. ETHTrustFund positioned itself as a DAO with rebasing features, following the OHM playbook. They issued blockchain-based bonds and implemented a ""rebasing"" mechanism for stakers. They bragged to be the “Highest Return Yielding ETF On Earth”. The fund promised to eventually ""debase"" or destroy its own ETF tokens, supposedly pushing up remaining token prices. All invested assets would allegedly generate yield for token holders. Turns out that was all a smokescreen and the dev may have been the only one who profited through this web of ponzinomics. 0ctoshi urges those who were affected to contact him on X and his DMs are open, all info and help is welcome. Shortly after Base launched, a project named BALD pulled the rug for $23 million, 3 weeks later, Magnate Finance rugged for $6.5 million. As Base continues attracting projects and capital, it seems the L2 is speed running through some classic crypto scams. Will Base ever shake off its reputation as a playground for rug pulls? While Coinbase continues to tout Base as the future of DeFi, it seems the only thing truly decentralized is the distribution of scams across the network. From BALD to ETHTrustFund, Base is building a reputation as a haven for digital highwaymen. As investors lick their wounds and Peng presumably sips Mai Tais on a beach somewhere, we're reminded that in crypto, trust is as volatile as the markets themselves. As the L2 wars heat up, it seems Base is content to let its users serve as cannon fodder in the battle for adoption. In the race to crown the next big L2, have we forgotten that true innovation doesn't come at the cost of user security or is this just the price of admission to the future of finance? With crypto crime fighter Ogle and others on the hunt, the scammer has a target painted on their back. Hopefully they will paint themself into a corner and get caught. In this high-stakes game of cat and mouse, with scammers abound, is this turning into an expensive game of whack-a-mole?

Onyx Protocol - REKT,2100000,11/01/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/onyx-protocol-rekt/,"Onyx Protocol -  Thursday, November 2, 2023 Onyx Protocol - Fork -  read this article also in : en Another total fork-up. Onyx Protocol , a Compound Finance fork, lost $2.1M on Tuesday to a high-profile, well-known vulnerability. The exact same attack vector has hit two other forks, Hundred Finance and Midas Capital ( themselves both repeat leaderboard entrants ), already this year, tipping the total lost to this bug over the $10M mark. Peckshield, as ever, warned Onyx to “ take a look ”. However, no official response came for almost three hours, when a team member acknowledged the loss. In the meanwhile, and while TG mods were urging users “ Please don’t fud ” the protocol was hit by a repeat attack , though for substantially less profit ($~62k). Many protocols have fallen victim to repeated exploits of identical vulnerabilities over the course of the year, with read-only reentrancy also claiming multiple victims including Conic , Sturdy , EraLend and Midas . Are the devs paying attention? Credit: Peckshield , BlockSec The exploit was made possible due to a known vulnerability of Compound v2 code. Under certain conditions, a rounding error allows an attacker to manipulate empty markets in order to drain liquidity from across the protocol. In Onyx’ case, governance had recently voted through Proposal 22 to add a lending market for memecoin PEPE to the protocol. The ‘empty market attack’ involves taking a flash loan which is swapped, in this case, for PEPE. Then, by minting a small number of shares (oPEPE) and donating a large amount of PEPE to the pool, vastly inflating the price of oPEPE for use as collateral on Onyx. Other assets can then be borrowed against the overvalued oPEPE, draining the protocol’s liquidity. The rounding error is then exploited to withdraw the donated funds, and the flash loan is repaid. Exploiter address: 0x085bdff2c522e8637d4154039db8746bb8642bff Attack tx: 0xf7c21600… Repeat exploiter address: 0x5083956303a145f70ba9f3d80c5e6cb5ac842706 Repeat-attack tx: 0x27a3788d… The 1164 ETH ($2.1M) of profits were sent on to an intermediary address before 1140 ETH were deposited into Tornado Cash. The remaining 24 ETH were sent to on-chain panhandlers, prompting a follow-up stream of input data messages to the hacker’s address, begging for further scraps. Onyx Protocol was audited by Certik , however the viability of this vulnerability is ultimately determined by the conditions within the individual market, rather than the codebase in itself. Empty markets in Comp v2 code are a known issue; the launch of new markets should be treated especially carefully by project teams. The discussion following the (second) Hundred Finance hack references Hexagate’s recommendations for launching potentially vulnerable markets (“ markets with low total supply and a non-zero collateral factor (CF) ”): we recommend any Compound V2 fork, when launching new markets to mint some cTokens and burn them to make sure the total supply never goes to zero. When the total supply goes to zero, the protocol becomes vulnerable and this strategy mitigates this situation. That means that when listing a new collateral token, first set its collateral factor to zero, set in the Comptroller, mint some cTokens, burn them and then change the collateral factor to the desired factor. Compound itself has many eyes scouring all governance proposals, though the occasional blunder does seem to slip through … But with just 11 wallets voting on Proposal 22 ( and over 97% of votes coming from a single address ), perhaps Onyx doesn’t have the same level of community vigilance over its lending markets. For teams working with forks, devs must be sure to stay on top of the security landscape, to avoid getting rekt by replicated vulnerabilities. Blackhats are certainly keeping up-to-date. Onyx’ proposed compensation plan intends to refund victims by selling native tokens from the treasury, while DAO contributors' salaries will be paused until further notice. While superficially sounding like a fair and selfless way to make users whole, the plan has the potential to trigger a death sprial on XCN, whilst the team’s incentives grow increasingly misaligned… What could go wrong?

Last Sunday, the AMM ( along with ‘official partner’ Beethoven X ) lost $2.1M from v2 Boosted pools across Ethereum, Optimism and Fantom. First came a warning : Balancer has received a critical vulnerability report affecting a number of V2 Pools. Emergency mitigation procedures have been executed to secure a majority of TVL, but some funds remain at risk. Users are advised to withdraw affected LPs immediately. Then, when the list of vulnerable pools was announced, it seems to have set an army of blackhats to work, looking for a way in. A later update stated that over 99% of vulnerable TVL had been secured, and that just $565k remained at risk. Then, $2.1M ended up missing. Credit: Balancer , Peckshield , Beosin The hacks came five days after Balancer’s disclosure of a potential threat, advising users to withdraw funds from certain pools. An official post-mortem is yet to be published, and details of the attack vector remain under wraps, given that further funds may still be at risk. This article will be edited to add further details when they are released. EDIT - 14 SEPT 2023: While Balancer still hasn't provided an official post-mortem, BlockSec published a detailed incident report, concluding that "" the root cause stems from the price manipulation resulting from the rounding down logic in the linear pool. This consequently affects the cached token rate used by the corresponding boosted pool inappropriately. "" BlockSec justified their frontrunning of an official report, stating that three weeks had passed since Balancer's initial announcement , and two weeks since the hacks, adding: This incident emphasizes the critical need for prompt notifications to projects that have forked from a vulnerable source, which indeed poses a significant challenge for the whole community. EDIT - also 14 SEPT 2023, four hours later: Balancer finally published their own in-depth post-mortem . Balancer’s response to the threat followed a clear protocol in order to mitigate potential losses. As well as publishing the list of pools at risk, the team adjusted the UI in order to inform users whether their deposits were affected.

This isn’t the first time Balancer has been hacked, in 2020 the protocol lost $500k to a flashloan attack . But that was before rekt.news’ time, making this latest incident Balancer’s leaderboard debut. Doomscrolling the TL, it feels like we’ve hit peak apathy. With little to lift the spirits, influencers are content shilling themselves into quick profits via the latest popularity-ponzi. And some of last cycle's wannabe main characters continue to disgrace themselves. With the community at a low-point it's especially painful to see even OG protocols like Curve and Balancer eventually finding their way onto the leaderboard … Things look bleak and we may start to ask ourselves: Will there even be another cycle?

Zunami Protocol - REKT,2100000,08/13/2023,Hashex,https://rekt.news/zunami-protocol-rekt/,"Zunami Protocol -  Monday, August 14, 2023 Zunami Protocol -  read this article also in : en NOTE: This article has been edited to remove reference to Ackee Blockchain, who audited an earlier version of the protocol before the attacked MimCurveStakeDAO strategy was added. The Curve ecosystem can't catch a break… Yesterday, Zunami Protocol lost $2.1M as the project’s Ether- and USD-pegged stablecoins came under a price manipulation attack. Although Curve itself was unaffected, the exploiter drained Zunami’s zETH and UZD liquidity pools on Curve, causing the ‘zStables’ to depeg by 85% and 99% , respectively. Peckshield raised the alarm but, after the recent BlockSec/Curve debacle , was careful not to provoke criticism and opted not to provide transaction hashes or addresses. Shortly after, Zunami confirmed the exploit: It appears that zStables have encountered an attack. The collateral remain secure, we delve into the ongoing investigation. First Conic Finance , then JPEG’D, Alchemix and Curve itself , now Zunami… Could the Curve Wars be proving even more lucrative for hackers than for protocols? Credit: Peckshield , BlockSec Just over an hour after the initial alert, and presumably after confirming no further funds were at risk, Peckshield followed up with more detail : It is a price manipulation issue, which can be exploited by donation to incorrectly calculate the price as shown in the following figures. The attacker used flash loans to execute large token swaps (e.g. SDT), causing slippage in the pool which could be used to manipulate LP token prices. The root cause was a flawed price calculation via the totalHoldings function. BlockSec provided the following step-by-step: The proceeds (1184 ETH or $2.1M) were quickly deposited into Tornado Cash. The protocol itself and the UZD and zETH contracts were audited by Hashex . Attacker’s address: 0x5f4c21c9bb73c8b4a296cc256c0cde324db146df Exploit tx (zETH): 0x2aec4fdb… Exploit tx (UZD): 0x0788ba22… The Sushiswap SDT pool, although used by the hacker during the price manipulation, is safe ( despite what a certain relentless bear-poster might like to imply ). Peckshield may have been careful not to include sensitive information in their alert, but others weren’t so cautious . Following BlockSec’s public announcement of the root cause behind the Vyper bug last month, the backlash prompted a debate about how many security firms apparently chase Twitter clout while potentially aiding hackers. The discussion, and calls for feedback, appear to have led to tweaked alerting standards which prioritise only the crucial information to alert users who may need to withdraw funds, but without giving away any clues which bad actors may take advantage of. Another step forwarded is the SEAL 911 hack hotline ; the Telegram bot aims to use its list of members is a fast-response for any concerned whitehat looking to alert a potentially vulnerable protocol’s team. Security teams do important work in DeFi, where exploiters are lurking around every corner. Not least BlockSec, with their impressive whitehacking record . But keeping DeFi safe is a constant game of cat-and-mouse, one that can’t always be won. Who will be next to fall prey?

Kannagi Finance, a yield aggregator on zkSync pulled the rug on Saturday. Before the incident the project had $2.1M TVL according to DeFiLlama (now just $0.17), but the scammer only got away with around $1.1M. The project’s website and socials have since been deleted. Kannagi had been audited twice, and endorsed (via a deleted giveaway tweet) by ecosystem-leader SyncSwap, as was EraLend which got rekt for $3.4M on Tuesday. The current system of rubber-stamping protocols with incomplete audits and window dressing only serves to legitimise potential rugs and scams. There must be a better framework. We need internal consumer protection, if not Gary will be happy to do it for us. Is that what you want, anon? Credit: PeckShield As always, this rug pull offers nothing much to report. While the contract was unverified, the audit report includes the line: The MainChef address can initiate a withdrawal on behalf of a user by specifying the user's address and an amount to withdraw. Not much of a mystery then. And the effect: Scammer’s address (on zkSync and Ethereum ): 0x95ec03b821f164ce55cbb26f23f591a9bd40d6c1 The rugged funds were bridged to Ethereum and where 600 ETH ($1.1M) was deposited into Tornado Cash. Auditors SolidProof published a statement , clarifying that the vault contract did not fall under the scope of their audit, and passing the buck to SourceHat (previously Solidity Finance) who did audit the vault. The SourceHat audit indeed pointed out that “ some centralized aspects are present ”, but is this common throwaway observation sufficient to absolve auditors of responsibility? Combined with the statement “ No external vulnerabilities identified ”, and looking back in hindsight, that ‘external’ is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Perhaps the responsibility is on users to take more notice of the wording of audit findings and their implications. After all, any auditor handing over a report marked “WARNING: RUGGABLE” would soon find themselves lacking in clients. But when audits are used as a lazy stamp of approval by projects looking to entice new users, degen gamblers and airdrop hunters … …do we really expect anyone to read the fine print?

A recently introduced feature led to a loss of $2.1M from the project, crashing the price of GYMNET as the stolen tokens were sold off. The official announcement states that the team has already fixed the issue and plans to recover losses . The project’s two audits were completed last month. Why introduce new code so soon and risk an injury? Credit: Peckshield , Beosin The BSC-based yield aggregator, built on top of Alpaca Finance, introduced a vulnerable “Claim and Pool” feature in its updated Single Pool Contract two days ago. Peckshield states that: The bug is due to the lack of caller verification, which is exploited to increase the balance without making any payment. This allows the hacker to create fake deposits to the contract, which are processed despite the attacker not spending any coins. The hacker can then simply withdraw their balance of falsely credited deposits. Exploiter’s address: 0xb2c035eee03b821cbe78644e5da8b8eaa711d2e5 Example exploit tx: 0x8432c1… The attacker was funded via Tornado Cash, and their exploit contracts swapped the stolen GYMNET into a total of ~7.5k BNB . 2k BNB (~$570k) sent to Tornado Cash 3k BNB (~$855k) remain on the exploiter’s BSC address 2.5k BNB swapped to 387 ETH (~$700k) and bridged to ETH address Gym Network was quick to confirm the source of the vulnerability, posting the following message in their Telegram group. Although GYMNET dropped ~90% as the exploiter dumped the stolen tokens, it has since recovered to ~70% of its pre-hack price. The project was audited by both Certik and Peckshield in May, however the faulty code was introduced two days ago. Why carry out two audits if you’re going to change the codebase a month later? Was this the plan all along? The popularity of BSC among retail users has led to many low-effort projects with weak security, and some projects have been rekt multiple times . But the timing of this hack comes at a time when Binance itself is in the spotlight, with pressure coming from multiple fronts. On Monday, it was reported that an SEC investigation is currently underway into whether the launch of BNB amounted to the sale of an unregistered security. The same day, a Reuters hit-piece was published claiming that Binance is “ a hub for hackers, fraudsters and drug traffickers ”. At a time when critics are feeling vindicated by the collapse of Luna and UST, the narrative that crypto is only for dirty money is an tempting one for mainstream media outlets to push. However, Binance have published email transcripts showing a lack of willingness to cooperate on the part of the Reuters’ journalists who neglected to share the information necessary for the Binance team to investigate their claims. While the markets are down and bear-market apathy takes over, it’s clear that those who disapprove of crypto are making their moves. Ape season is well and truly over, and FUD season is in full swing. But amongst all the doom and gloom, it’s important to remember that this is not our first rodeo… Progress will not be linear.

Revest Finance - REKT,2010000,03/27/2022,Solidity Finance,https://rekt.news/revest-finance-rekt/,"Revest Finance -  Monday, March 28, 2022 Revest Finance -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - tr - zh ~$2M taken from Revest Finance. A financial NFT platform which “offers instant liquidity for locked assets”, fell victim to a reentrancy attack. A fast reaction from the Revest team prevented them from losing more funds, however, they still take a place on the leaderboard  (#67) . How did it happen? The Revest team were informed of the “exploit at 2:24 UTC from the BLOCKS DAO development team ”. In addition to BLOCKS DAO , substantial losses were also suffered by EcoFi and RENA Finance. By halting transfers of RVST tokens, the team thwarted the attacker’s attempt (70 secs later) to drain the RVST-ETH pool on Uniswap, avoiding a further $1.15M in losses. The attacker’s dump of the stolen tokens had a large impact on the price of BLOCKS (initially down >95%, currently down ~80%) and ECO (down ~98%), however the RENA tokens remain untouched in the attackers address. Credit: @BlockSecTeam The root-cause of the attack was due to a reentrancy vulnerability in the ERC1155 minting contract ( example tx: RENA ) The function mintAddressLock , used to create new Smart Vaults, contains two critical parameters: quantities and depositAmount . Revest Vault invokes the mint function of FNFTHandler, to mint quantities of ERC1155(s) with the next fnftId to the recipient(s) which can later be burned in order to claim the position’s proportion of locked tokens. fnftId increments by 1 each time the function is executed. Extra funds can be deposited to the FNFT using the depositAdditionalToFNFT function, deposits must be in the same proportion as defined by quantities , specifically: quantity==FNFTHandler.getSupply(fnftId) . If the above statement is not fulfilled, the user's share will be extracted from the position and transferred to a new FNFT with a balance defined by the existing position's depositAmount plus the newly deposited amount. Given that the existing position’s depositAmount is used, but fnftId (informed via fnftsCreated ) is not updated until the end of the minting routine, re-entrancy at this point allows for additional funds to be added to an existing position. Step by Step: 1: Attacker uses the mintAddressLock function to open a new position with fnftId=1027 , depositAmount=0 , quantities=[2] , asset=Rena , and recipients=[malicious contract] .  Since the depositAmount X quantities[0] = 0 X 2 = 0 , the attacker transfers zero Rena. 2: Attacker uses the mintAddressLock function again to open a new position with fnftId=1028 , depositAmount=0 , quantities=360,000 , asset=Rena , and recipients=[malicious contract] . Again, the attacker transfers zero Rena and receives 360,000 tokens (with fnftId=1028 ). Note that these 1028-tokens have no value now. 3: At the end of Step 2, during the mint function of FNFTHandler , the attacker re-enters the Revest contract via the onERC1155Received interface. The depositAdditionalToFNFT function is used with amount = 1e18 , quantities=1 , fnftId=1027 , which would normally open the fnftId=1029 (new) position. However, due to the delay in updating fnftId , position 1028 is overwritten with the above data, ascribing value to the 1028 tokens owned by the attacker. 4: The attacker uses the withdrawFNFT function to withdraw the 360,000 X 1e18 Rena tokens after having deposited only 1 quantity X 1e18 Rena tokens in Step 3. Token losses (approx $2M total) according to the official post-mortem report : 350k RENA (~$125k, still in attacker’s address ) 715M BLOCKS (~$1.7M) 7.7M ECO (~$100k) Smaller amounts ($10-$12K) of ConstitutionDAO and LUKSO were also stolen. After swapping the majority of the stolen tokens for ETH, the attacker deposited the funds into Tornado Cash. A security breach is never a good look for a DeFi protocol, especially when its product is a secure locker to be trusted with other project’s tokens. “One audit is never enough” says Revest, as they found that the vulnerability was not picked up in the project’s audit (solidity.finance). The team’s quick response and thorough post-mortem are promising signs, and although Revest have stated that “ we do not possess the funds needed for meaningful financial recompense ”, the postmortem report stresses the desire to make things right in the future. At the moment, it’s not clear how that will happen.

In a twist that would make even a quantum physicist's head spin, their uniBTC vault decided to play fast and loose with exchange rates, turning Ethereum deposits into a Bitcoin bonanza. This digital alchemy managed to transmute $2 million into thin air bon September 25th, before anyone could say ""smart contract audit."" The vulnerability, spread across 8 blockchain networks like a particularly virulent strain of crypto-pox, allowed users to mint uniBTC faster than a money printer on steroids. In the aftermath of yet another DeFi debacle, we're left pondering: when ""code is law"" fails, does it default to ""finders, keepers""? Credit: Dedaub , Bedrock In the high-stakes game of DeFi whack-a-mole, Dedaub just scored a critical hit. These code sleuths uncovered a ticking time bomb in Bedrock's uniBTC vault contracts - a vulnerability so juicy it practically had dollar signs for eyes. We're talking about a $75 million treasure chest spread across at least 8 different chains, just waiting for someone to pick the lock. Dedaub, channeling their inner Paul Revere, didn't waste time. They fired off alerts to Bedrock on Twitter and speed-dialed SEAL 911, all while the crypto world slumbered, blissfully unaware of the impending chaos. But in the world of DeFi, time waits for no dev. While Bedrock's team was likely dreaming of lambos and tropical islands (or just, you know, sleeping), the vulnerability transformed from potential threat to actual disaster. A mere two hours after Dedaub's digital distress signal, the exploit hit. A swarm of opportunists, realized that Bedrock's smart contract was practically begging to be milked. The damage? A cool $2 million vanished faster than you can say ""decentralized finance."" But here's the kicker - with uniBTC's $75 million market cap on Ethereum alone, this could have been just the tip of a very expensive iceberg. As the blockchain detectives pieced together the digital crime scene, they found themselves staring at a vulnerability so basic, it would make a first-year coding student blush. According to the post mortem , the vulnerability in Bedrock's smart contracts was more complex than a simple miscalculation. At its core, the issue stemmed from a failure to properly handle native tokens on non-native BTC chains. The crux of the problem lay in the SigmaSupplier contract, which didn't register NATIVE_BTC. This oversight caused the total supply to always register as zero, effectively neutering the caps restriction mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized minting. With this safeguard unknowingly disabled, the Vault contract's checks were rendered toothless. The result? A wide-open door for users to mint uniBTC tokens using native tokens on non-native BTC chains - a process that should have been impossible by design. In essence, Bedrock's smart contracts were playing by the wrong rulebook, allowing users to mint uniBTC in ways the protocol never intended. It wasn't so much a mathematical error as a fundamental mishandling of token types and chain interactions. This mishandling opened the floodgates for a series of exploits across multiple chains. The vulnerable vault contract deployed on September 25th , allowed an ETH to uniBTC exchange at a 1:1 rate. In one brazen example, an attacker minted 30.8 uniBTC using 30.8 ETH and promptly sold 28.8 uniBTC for 27.8 WBTC in a single transaction. Exploiter Address: 0x2bFB373017349820dda2Da8230E6b66739BE9F96 Attack Transaction: 0x725f0d65340c859e0f64e72ca8260220c526c3e0ccde530004160809f6177940 And this was just one of many such attacks that collectively drained $2 million from the protocol. Adding insult to injury, Bedrock's response was slower than a sloth on sedatives. It took them over 2 hours to publicly acknowledge the exploit after Dedaub sounded the alarm, and nearly 4.5 hours to finally pause the vulnerable smart contracts. In the lightning-fast world of DeFi, that's an eternity - plenty of time for the digital horses to bolt, the stable to burn down, and the ashes to cool. And in a twist that would make any security expert facepalm, this upgrade didn't undergo an audit. In the world of DeFi, skipping an audit is like going skydiving and deciding parachutes are optional. It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em. The fallout was swift. As word spread faster than a viral meme, the DeFi community sprang into action. Pendle, holding a significant chunk of uniBTC, hit the brakes on their platform faster than you can say ""not my bags."" Meanwhile, Bedrock's team, finally shaken from their slumber, scrambled to pause the vulnerable contracts. But in crypto time, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye, their response felt like watching paint dry. The damage was done. Across eight chains - Ethereum, BNBChain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, Mode, BOB, and ZetaChain - the vulnerability left its mark. A total of 125 exploiters (because why let one person have all the fun?) had their field day. In the end, Bedrock was left holding the bag, facing a $1.8 million hole in their liquidity and a whole lot of explaining to do. As they say in the crypto world: another day, another exploit. But this time, the price of skipping an audit came with a hefty price tag. If Bedrock itself can crumble so easily, what kind of foundation are we really building on? And in the rush to mint the next big thing, are we creating bedrock or just burying landmines? In the aftermath of Bedrock's $2 million face-palm moment, we're left shaking our heads in disbelief. How does an unaudited upgrade slip through the cracks of a protocol handling millions? Can they rebuild trust after this prehistoric-level security oversight? In the fast-paced world of DeFi, even the most solid foundations can shake. Bedrock's fumble serves as a stark reminder: in the rush to innovate, we might just be building castles on quicksand. As we watch this saga unfold, one can't help but wonder: in the annals of crypto history, will Bedrock be remembered as a cornerstone, or just another stepping stone on the path to ""doing better""?

Grand Base - REKT,2000000,04/15/2024,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/grand-base/,"Grand Base -  Monday, April 15, 2024 Grand Base -  read this article also in : en - zh Thieves in the night take advantage of Open House as RWA protocol on Base leaves the front door unlocked. Grand Base slammed in a $2m exploit due to a deployer wallet private key leak. The breach was first disclosed by a protocol admin in the Grand Base Telegram channel . The admin warned users that the token contract is no longer safe, advising them to immediately cease all swapping or interaction with the contract, and to remove their funds from any associated liquidity pools. Peckshield took the first swing at announcing the exploit publicly. Stepping up to the plate 6 hours later, in a subsequent post on X , Grand Base staff claimed they had tracked the wallets of the hacker and were in talks with centralized exchanges to freeze any funds the attacker tried to move."" Coinbase’s L2 is still going through growing pains. While they still had their training wheels on back in August, memecoin BALD rugged holders for $23m. Less than 2 weeks later, RocketSwap was compromised for $869k, thanks to private keys that were allegedly stolen in a bruteforce attack on the project’s server. Since then, Base has been hitting it out of the park, hovering around $1.5b in TVL and currently ranked #6 in all chains. Was somebody waiting for baseball season to start back up to start stealing bases again? Credit: Grand Base , De.Fi , Peckshield In the early hours of April 15th, at approximately 3AM UTC, GB, a token issued by Grand Base, experienced a drastic price movement that led to an over 90% dump. Due to a security breach of their deployer's wallet, the exploiter was able to mint & sell roughly 32.5m GB tokens. Before the minting attack, Grand Base had a maximum cap of 50 million GB tokens. Malicious transactions the scammer executed in order to mint tokens: Transaction 1: https://basescan.org/tx/0xe8b0af9a2c7a3482958792d620328aa780097788fc18e1b7e1328a4a459132d0 Transaction 2: https://basescan.org/tx/0x74237dfd7ac0e251311c71ff2c2536b146eeb68c465d47325bdd4517f34a7259 Afterwards, many swaps were made in order to exchange the tokens to ETH: https://basescan.org/address/0xcfe5f1bae0da05ffe9c9c73411b8ec1a286350fc In the end, ETH on BASE was bridged to Ethereum: Transfer 1: https://basescan.org/tx/0x519acbeb333fd43dead8bc66faa4d419d310d6bf8011a056ce279d26845da70d Transfer 2: https://basescan.org/tx/0x66334af4901b7d4e5e536c17fee41431aee3bde03c6da823d4d9dd5adc43aa92 Stolen funds are currently sitting in 2 wallets. Wallet 1: https://debank.com/profile/0xd8c21702b74d14b68f2580e28c10ecc53304c274 Wallet 2: https://debank.com/profile/0xb124546f9f89f178a785d539d299e372b9dc1ec6 The CTO took to Telegram to provide some further insight into the exploit: “One of our dev had his PC hacked, the LP wallet was accessible via this PC, with control over our token contract and liquidity pool. This wallet also had the authority to mint new tokens, and proceeded to do so before the market selling them all.” The CTO went on to state that the underlying dapp code is secure and can be easily forked. They claim to have intimate knowledge of every line of the codebase. However, the GB token itself will need to be relaunched following the exploit. According to the Docs on the Grandbase site, details on their contracts will be published very soon, this was last updated 6 months ago. Missing with their contracts are audits. Not a single audit can be found. With no audits or contract information in sight, it's clear that Grand Base has struck out when it comes to security. Will they step up to the plate and address these issues or continue to leave their users vulnerable to future exploits? The market has recently been going through a rollercoaster ride, experiencing dramatic highs and stomach-churning lows, leaving investors on the edge of their seats as they navigate the wild twists and turns of the volatile landscape. While Base is trying to onboard the normies to crypto, suspicious incidents like this serve as a black eye that may deter some users. The Grand Base team did initially announce the exploit to their Telegram community. Why did the team take 6 hours to announce on X that they were compromised? Amidst the turbulent market conditions, timely and transparent communication becomes even more critical in maintaining trust within the community. The delay in publicly announcing the exploit on relevant channels may raise questions about the protocol's commitment to keeping its users well-informed and protected. As Grand Base moves forward, it is crucial for the team to address the lack of contract audits and outdated information, ensuring that security measures are strengthened and user confidence is restored. Only time will reveal if Grand Base can effectively absorb the learnings from this experience, taking the essential precautions to safeguard against future incidents, or if they'll fall into a cycle of repeating past mistakes, exposing themselves to additional security risks. Will they show up with their A game or continue to strike out?

RIP MEV Bot 2,2000000,11/07/2023,N/A,https://rekt.news/ripmevbot2/,"RIP MEV Bot 2 Thursday, November 9, 2023 MEV Bot -  read this article also in : en The sandwicher has become the sandwiched. $2M was lost on Tuesday night as an MEV bot got a taste of its own medicine. The curious case of crypto-karma was spotted by Spreek , who identified the issue as an unprotected swap function within the bot’s code. The incident is reminiscent of when the notorious bot 0xbadc0de got rekt for $1.5M , last year. As we wrote at the time: MEV bots act on the boundary of “code is law”. When it comes to autonomous on-chain predators it’s hard to sympathise. Is this a simple case of ‘you win some, you lose some’? Credit: BlockSec , PeckShield , Spreek For all the complexity within the dog-eat-dog world of MEV, the exploit was surprisingly simple. The bot’s code had left a swap function unprotected, which anyone could call. This was exploited to sandwich attack the bot via WETH/WBTC trades on Curve, funded via a $50M flash loan. BlockSec explains : A bot was attacked due to the lack of access control of a public function 0xf6ebebbb, which could be exploited to manipulate swaps in Curve pools. The loss was ~$2M. Hence the attacker could first abuse the flawed function to pump the asset price (e.g., WETH) and then make a reverse swap to make a profit. And Peckshield provided a look at the sandwiched swaps: The result : Oooof. Attacker address ( funded via Tornado Cash): 0x46d9b3dfbc163465ca9e306487cba60bc438f5a2 Attack tx: 0xbc08860c… Victim address: 0x05f016765c6c601fd05a10dba1abe21a04f924a5 Whenever large amounts of money move in DeFi, things tend to work out nicely for Curve ( though not always ), and this incident was no exception. The swapping of vast sums necessary to imbalance the pool enough for a viable exploit generated a cool $250k in fees for the protocol. 0xc0ffeebabe , another bot known for the occasional whitehat exploit-frontrun, also made an appearance in cleaning up the mess. Autonomous bots, while constantly controversial, seem to be a necessary evil of a permissionless financial system. And with the juicy tips often paid to validators, many of the ecosystem’s key players are surely happy to tolerate the activities of the Dark Forest ’s most dangerous predators.

Dexible - REKT,2000000,02/17/2023,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/dexible-rekt/,"Dexible -  Monday, February 20, 2023 Dexible -  read this article also in : en - es - tr - zh Crisis-comms calamity as cross-chain chaos continues… The decentralised exchange aggregator, Dexible lost a total of $2M on Friday, on Ethereum and Arbitrum. Although contracts were quickly paused, an official announcement came more than 9 hours after the hack, and over five hours after Peckshield raised the alarm . The thread states that their tech lead “ discovered the attack early on ” but that the “ Twitter channel was not able to respond in time ”, despite various promotional tweets being published in the intervening hours. When they did finally respond, however, part of their message came across as, at best, tone-deaf and, at worst, indifferent. There's no excuse for an exploit, but these things happen And when called out , the Dexible team simply referred to rekt.news’ leaderboard , stating a hard truth: exploits happen in DeFi. Credit: Dexible, Peckshield , Beosin One feature of Dexible’s recently introduced v2 contracts allows users to define their own routing via the selfSwap function. Dexible’s post-mortem report (published via Telegram and Discord, in PDF format) explains: embedded in each request to swap was a ""route"" of what DEX to call and what data to send to that DEX to execute a swap However, the function does not check whether the router address is actually a DEX by, for example, using an on-chain allowlist: the router address was not verified on-chain in any way. This meant that instead of calling a DEX smart contract, the hacker simply called a token contract with a request to ""transferFrom"" any account that had spend approval on the Dexible contract Attacker addresses ( ETH , ARBI , BSC ): 0x684083f312ac50f538cc4b634d85a2feafaab77a Example tx: 0x138daa4c… Relatively few addresses were affected, with the majority of losses reportedly coming from an address belonging to BlockTower Capital which lost 18M TRU tokens, valued at ~$1.4M at the time. In total, approximately $1.5M was lost on Ethereum, and sent to Tornado Cash. A further $450k was lost on Arbitrum, which was bridged to BSC before also being washed via Tornado Cash. In the post-mortem report, the Dexible team attempted to justify releasing unaudited code based on the experience of their team: A formal audit was not performed on the latest set of contracts. We had several community members and Dexible engineers review the code, and they did not find the vulnerability. The core engineer that created the contracts has over 25 years of software engineering experience, and he did not see the vulnerability. Upon reviewing one of the hacker's transactions, however, he immediately understood how it was executed. An audit is not a silver bullet… but it certainly helps. Even the most experienced engineers may overlook a security vulnerability in their own code. Naturally, when building a new protocol, devs primarily have users in mind. But in this industry, security is paramount. And no shortage of unaudited protocols have made it onto the leaderboard . In Dexible’s own words: exploits happen in DeFi.

The Cronos-based DEX had its front-end exploited , resulting in losses of over $2M for its users. Beginning around 7:30 PM on 4th of May, users swapping, adding or removing liquidity on the protocol had the output funds redirected straight into the attacker’s wallet. The exploit lasted for approximately 3 hours before the team took down the front-end. During the attack, team members in Discord advised users not to interact with the site. But why was the compromised site left up for so long? Why didn’t they block access? It is unclear exactly how the attacker managed to gain access, and the official post mortem doesn’t give much away: MM.finance site was the subject of a DNS attack earlier where an attacker managed to inject a malicious contract address into the frontend code. Attacker used a DNS vulnerability to modify the router contract address in our hosted files. This led to some speculation in the rekt.news telegram group , with users contemplating whether the exploit had redirected users to a cloned version of the page. “hmm - looks like it was actually a dns redirect possibly…”
“ people are saying bad SSL certificate” While others were more skeptical . Some users raised their concerns via Discord , but were not taken seriously by the team. Whatever the attack vector, the exploit was prepared, exposing users’ transactions to a malicious router linked to the attacker’s address. Then, beginning with this swap at 19:28:35 PM +UTC, the outputs of all interactions with the DEX were rerouted to the attacker’s address . 600+ transactions were rerouted in this way, with the profits being swapped to USDT and bridged back to Ethereum before being deposited (743 ETH so far) into Tornado Cash. The post-mortem advises users to double check for the correct router address (0x145677FC4d9b8F19B5D56d1820c48e0443049a30) during transaction confirmations. Another mongoose playing fast and loose with their operational security. The Mad Meerkat team have traced the attacker’s financing back to OKX, and are appealing for help in determining the hacker’s identity.

DODO - REKT,2000000,03/09/2021,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/au-dodo-rekt/,"DODO -  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 DODO -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh Is it dead or has it just gone to bed? DODO was hacked for $2 million using a fake token attack, but the motive remains unclear. One thing’s for sure, whether hat white or black, only $2 million? Must try harder. Twitter remains the fastest source of news for DeFi - even the DODO team relied on Luciano to tell them that their own $WCRES / $USDT pool had been drained using fake tokens. The following analysis is taken from the official DODO release, with thanks to @samczsun , @tzhen , PeckShield , and SlowMist . The exploits targeted several DODO V2 Crowdpools, namely the WSZO, WCRES, ETHA, and FUSI pools. In total, approximately $3.8 million, of which $1.88 million is expected to be returned (see below for more information), was drained as a result of these exploits. The DODO V2 Crowdpooling smart contract has a bug that allows the init() function to be called multiple times. This means that an exploiter can perform an attack with the following steps: 1. Exploiter creates a counterfeit token and initialize the smart contract with it by calling the init() function 2. Exploiter calls the sync() function and sets the “reserve” variable, which represents the token balance, to 0 3. Exploiter calls init() again to re-initialize - this time with a “real” token (i.e. tokens in DODO’s pools) 4. Exploiter uses a flash loan to transfer all real tokens from the pools and bypass the flash loan check In summary, there are two individuals involved in this exploit. We will refer to them as Individual A and Individual B. Individual B has all the hallmarks of a frontrunning bot, because: They constructed their contract address with a prefix of several 0s They use the CHI gastoken They set extremely high gas prices; in one instance they raise configured the transaction to use 93,148 gwei. In addition, Individual B’s exploits preceded Individual A’s successful exploits by roughly ten minutes. Individual A Individual A has already contacted the DODO team through samczsun and offered to send back the funds removed from DODO pools. Here is a detailed account of Individual A’s actions: Individual A interacted with a centralized exchange. Individual A withdrew 0.46597 ETH from Binance: Individual A executed , in quick succession, 7 BUSD withdrawal transactions (see the link for one example), possibly involving the Binance Bridge: Individual A transfer their funds to another wallet address. Individual A transferred 67,416 BUSD to 0xa305fab8bda7e1638235b054889b3217441dd645 twice - ONE - TWO Individual A transferred 59,245.324743 USDT to 0xa305fab8bda7e1638235b054889b3217441dd645 twice: ONE TWO Individual A executed two exploits against DODO smart contracts. The first one was against the DODO-USDT test contract, and funds were transferred to 0xa305fab8bda7e1638235b054889b3217441dd645. The second one was against the WCRES-USDT contract, and funds were transferred to 0x56178a0d5f301baf6cf3e1cd53d9863437345bf9. The funds are now in the following two addresses: 0xa305fab8bda7e1638235b054889b3217441dd645 0x56178a0d5f301baf6cf3e1cd53d9863437345bf9 Individual B Individual B is most likely a bot.

Akropolis - REKT,2000000,11/12/2020,"CertiK, SmartDec",https://rekt.news/akropolis-rekt/,"Akropolis -  Thursday, November 12, 2020 akropolis - delphi -  read this article also in : en - es - fr - ko - ru - zh Pericles must be turning in his grave. The Akropolis has not been this rekt since the battle of Salamina in 480 B.C. A modern day King Xerses has razed the Akropolis once more, stealing $2,000,000 DAI via a combination of flash loans and re-entrancy. At first, the Akropolis admins tried to claim they were simply carrying out some “fixes”. We now know they were burned for $2 million. But how? The Akropolis protocol allows users to deposit tokens into a vault and get different tokens in return. The amount of new tokens you get back depends on how much is deposited. The deposit amount is calculated by the difference in balance from before and after the transfer operation. Here’s how the attacker took advantage of this system by creating a malicious token contract which called deposit again (reentrancy). This is the attack contract. Create faketoken Deposit faketoken 3a. Get a callback to faketoken, deposit 25k DAI 3b. Get credited for 25k DAI of deposits Get credited for 25k DAI of deposits Withdraw 50k DAI Credit samczsun Because the attacker was able to use their contract as the deposit token, they were able to use reentrance with a dYdx flash loan, as shown below. This is the hackers address. We can see they had started to execute batches of $50k attacks around 8 hours prior. They then sent $2m of these gains to a different address, where it remains at the time of writing. Credit @dogetoshi We should note that the smart contracts that the hacker interacted with had been audited by two separate security companies, Smartdec and Certik. Smartdec have a reasonably good track record , however, for Certik, Akropolis is an unwelcome addition to the growing list of projects that they have audited before an exploit. bZx, Lien, Harvest , and now Akropolis. A completed security audit should never be taken as a guarantee of safety, but a Certik audit certainly carries less weight than it used to... Even a well made and thoroughly audited contract can turn into a shit show if in the hands of bad players. The fact that Akropolis were so quick to lie to their users shows that not all the blame lies on Certik or the hacker. Although we so often strive for trustless protocols, when it comes to human communication between a user and a service provider, the fragility of trust should always be protected. Akropolis have lost that trust, and become rekt.

What started as a quiet night across Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Base networks exploded into chaos, as roughly $1.9 million worth of locked tokens found an unauthorized exit. Several projects watched helplessly as their supposedly secured assets slipped through GemPad's fingers, victims of DeFi's most notorious exploit pattern. BPay, Munch, Nutcoin, and others scrambled to calm their communities while GemPad raced to patch the vulnerability. The protocol swiftly acknowledged the breach and began working with affected projects, but their stolen liquidity had already scattered across chains.

Like a jeweler examining a suspect gem, scrutiny reveals what casual glances miss. OKLink's vigilant team first caught the sparkle of something wrong – multiple protocols bleeding liquidity through the same flaw. Their analysis revealed a critical oversight in GemPad's lock contract: missing reentrancy protection on the withdrawal function, leaving locked assets vulnerable to a classic sleight of hand. GemPad confirmed the exploit soon after , acknowledging their security locks had been breached and immediately began working with security partners to investigate. Cyvers Alerts later confirmed the scope of the attack, tracking the draining of digital assets across multiple chains as the attacker methodically emptied one lock box after another. Pennyplayer's analysis revealed the elegant simplicity of the attack: a classic reentrancy exploit targeting the collectFees function. The attacker crafted malicious tokens that triggered callbacks during transfers, creating LP locks essentially for free. With each reentrant call, they could withdraw the locked LP amount, turning GemPad's security mechanism against itself.

The casualties stacked up quickly. BPay and Munch Protocol watched their liquidity vanish, while AnonFi halted all token trading. Nutcoin's team demanded answers as their locks were drained, and FOMO Network could only watch as their pools emptied. The Law of Attraction Coin and Hemera Trading AI scrambled to calm their communities, while Dub Token faced the ripple effects through Alien Base's ALB/DUB farm . GemPad's approach to security painted an interesting picture. Their platform offered a no-code token creation system - five pre-audited templates ranging from Simple to Ultimate, each with ContractWolf's stamp of approval. Projects could point, click, and launch their token without touching a line of code . While democratizing token creation might have been the goal, this plug-and-play approach to security proved meaningless when the underlying lock mechanism failed. While pre-audited templates might make token creation accessible to all, they mean nothing if the foundation beneath them crumbles. When one lock breaks and several protocols fall, how many more dominoes are silently waiting their turn? Missing reentrancy guards turned a trusted vault into a systemic cascade of failures. Projects rushing to secure their assets behind GemPad's locks found themselves victims of crypto's oldest exploit pattern. Audited templates and no-code solutions promised security through simplicity, yet failed to protect against a vulnerability as old as DeFi itself. Multiple protocols learned the hard way that outsourcing security doesn't mean outsourcing responsibility. GemPad's swift response and commitment to affected projects shows promise, but their reputation as a trusted platform now hangs by a thread. Teams building on borrowed trust might want to check their foundations before the next domino starts to wobble.

The latest exploit caught by Chain Aegis on April 30, resulted in the loss of over $1.6 million in ARB, OP and ETH. Pike Finance confirmed shortly after. This incident followed a previous exploit related to a USDC vulnerability reported just days earlier. Pike Finance acknowledged the initial attack , but it wasn’t enough. Unfortunately, the actions taken by Pike Finance after the initial exploit left the protocol open to further attack. Another attack that could have been prevented. Does Pike Finance have what it takes to navigate these troubled waters? Credit: Quill Audits , Pike Finance , Chain Aegis Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice , shame on me. Pike Finance got played for the fool, falling victim not once, but twice to exploits that allowed attackers to seize control and siphon funds from the protocol. Pike is a universal liquidity market that enables lending and borrowing using native assets directly on their respective blockchains, eliminating the need for wrapping and cross-chain transfers. According to Pike Finance , the initial exploit on April 26 was caused by weak security measures in Pike's contract functions when handling CCTP transfers. During protocol pausing attempts, an added dependency in the code altered storage layout and moved the initialized variable, causing contract misbehavior. Seizing this opportunity, attackers upgraded spoke contracts without admin access, successfully siphoning off funds. The upgraded implementation contract of the target contract has a vulnerability, which allows the attacker to initialize and then steal the owner permissions. In addition to the attack on Ethereum, the attacker also carried out attacks on Arbitrum and Optimism. The two attacks stemmed from the same smart contract vulnerability, which allowed the attacker to override the contract. Attack Process by Quill Audits : The attacker exploited the initialize function in the original contract, adding their address to the _isActive variable. Taking advantage of unprotected initializer functions, the attacker bypassed security measures meant to prevent multiple executions. By leveraging version numbers, the attacker consumed and blocked reusable numbers, enabling them to execute new initialization steps with each upgrade. Finally, the attacker performed an upgradeToAndCall, implementing a malicious version of the contract and successfully breaching Pike Finance's security.

They have yet to even update their contracts page and currently just list the test net contracts. Pike had a community presale for their native PIU token at the end of March that generated $6.45 million. They reached out to the initial exploiter on April 26 in an onchain message . They are offering a 20% reward for the return of the funds, or information leading to the recovery of funds. In addition, a report and plan to make users whole will be provided at a later time. According to many responses to the exploit announcement , many users want their presale funds back, which appear to be unaffected at this time. Will the team get their act together, or end up doggy-paddling in a sea of mistrust? Pike Finance’s security woes raises red flags and makes one wonder, are they winging it or sinking it? The absence of public audits and bug bounty programs, coupled with their failure to secure contracts after the initial exploit, paints a picture of negligence. The slow response to the first attack enabled a second, putting its user base at risk, thanks to the sheer carelessness in handling the contracts. Investors, particularly those who participated in the $6.45 million token presale, are understandably worried. Pike's delayed updates and vague promises of a ""report and plan"" do little to ease their fears. Can Pike navigate these stormy waters, or will their cavalier attitude towards security sink them? Only time will tell if Pike Finance can right the ship or if they'll serve as yet another cautionary tale of cutting corners in the world of crypto security.

According to Certik’s analysis : In preparation for the @hope_fin exit scam, a fake router was deployed in txn 0xf188. The SwapHelper was then updated to use this fake router in txn 0xc9ee . This txn was approved by all 3 owners of Hope’s multisig 0x8ebd . In txn 0x1b47, _swapExactTokenForTokens variable was set to wallet address, 0x957D . When GenesisRewardPool.openTrade() is called to borrow USDC, GenesisRewardPool transfers WETH to TradingHelper to convert to USDC. Instead of swapping, USDC was sent to 0x957D. As the _uSDC address was deliberately left empty, the receiving address ( 0x957D ) was passed to v2 and the swapExactTokensForTokens() transferred 477 WETH to 0x957D.

The project had two audits prior to launch, by Cognitos (the code passed despite auditors flagging two ‘major’ issues, neither of which related to the mechanism used to rug) and AuditRateTech (who appear to have deleted the audit report , although a KYC certificate still remains on their site). It’s impossible to know whether the doxxed individual accused by the team is truly to blame. According to Streetview, the address given in the ID is a vacant lot .

Merlin, a DEX native to the recently-launched zksync L2, was in the middle of a 3-day “ Liquidity Generation Event ” as part of its token (MAGE) launch. The alarm was initially raised by a community member before Peckshield spread the message. Merlin then acknowledged the incident, advising users to revoke permissions as a precaution. Not to be confused with three-time leaderboard entrant Merlin Labs (who got rekt on repeat during Spring 2021’s BSC bloodbath), Merlin had passed its second audit by Certik just two days before the attack. Merlin’s story may be that of a simple rug; a tale we’ve heard many times before. But, this time, Merlin has inadvertently conjured a debate into the value of certain styles of audit… Credit: BeosinAlert The rug mechanism was a straightforward case of draining the liquidity pools into which users were depositing as part of the MAGE token sale. This was made possible via max approvals granted to the Feeto address upon deployment of the pools. The individual/s in control of the Feeto address could then drain the pool of all assets, which were then bridged to ETH. Merlin’s own post-mortem places the blame squarely on the back-end development team. The thread includes links to developers’ github profiles and states that Serbian authorities have been contacted. Attacker address (into which funds were drained): 0x2744d62a1e9ab975f4d77fe52e16206464ea79b7 See Beosin’s full analysis for further details and addresses. The rugged funds were bridged back to Ethereum, swapped for ETH and transferred to other addresses. This is the first incident on zksync, a zero-knowledge Ethereum rollup whose mainnet launched in March. It didn’t take long for the new environment to become a target… zksync already had a close call when their Twitter handle was targeted (presumably to conduct a phishing campaign) earlier this month. As new ecosystems flourish, leveraging exciting tech to push our industry forward, bad actors will never be far behind. And low-effort cash grabs make the perfect honeypot for those who would pull the rug on users or would-be hackers looking for vulnerable, hastily deployed code… Generally, an audit by a reputable blockchain security firm is a good sign for those unsure whether or not to ape in. But when some logos look less like a mark of quality and more like a red flag, what counts as ‘reputable’? The very same day that their recently-approved project was drained, Certik’s founder boasted of their volume of bargain audits in the industry. With Certik’s stamp of approval on so many rekt projects, many are casting doubts on the firm's value to the space. It should be noted that, in their initial audit , Certik did indeed bring up the issue of trust, recommending that the protocol take measures to sufficiently decentralise: We advise the client to carefully manage the privileged account's private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, we strongly recommend centralized privileges or roles in the protocol be improved via a decentralized mechanism or smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g., multisignature wallets. However, this issue was marked as ‘Resolved’ by Certik, who stated that the Merlin team had promised to use a multisig. Enough users apparently didn’t read the audit fully, or simply didn’t care about the implications of trusting the project. Facing further claims that the code includes an intentional backdoor, Certik is clearly feeling the heat. The firm is considering a “ community compensation plan ” to cover the losses. Quick and dirty audits should not be deemed sufficient reassurance, especially for multimillion dollar protocols. Some personal responsibility is also necessary to stay safe… Ruggers gonna rug. And when many protocols have centralisation issues which could potentially lead to a rug, yet are overlooked by FOMO-ing apes and airdrop hunters … Where does the blame really lie?

Despite the exploit being live for almost three weeks, the problem only became clear with Bent Finance’s recent listing on DeBank , when the exploiter’s wallet profile showed the billions of dollars-worth of pending rewards on the platform. Looking at the main wallet’s token transactions , we see a handful of small deposits, followed by some very large withdrawals, one on Dec. 12 (of 263k cvxcrv-f) and another today at 02:45 AM +UTC (of 250k cvxcrv-f). The tokens were then sent on to the exploiter’s secondary address , where they were cashed out for CRV, swapped for ETH and sent to Tornado Cash. In total, 440 ETH (~$1.75M) has been washed via Tornado Cash between 12/12 and today. The role that DeBank’s listing of Bent Finance played in today’s case and Nansen’s recent $75M raise show the value that these services bring to an increasingly more complex industry. Although on-chain data provides all the necessary information to those with the knowledge (and motivation) to investigate, these tools vastly increase the probability of spotting irregularities in lower profile projects. However, in the case of Bent Finance, given the source of the exploit, as well as the team’s response, this looks likely to be an inside job: Rug pull or rogue team member? Much bigger hacks have dominated the headlines recently, and incidents such as this will soon be forgotten. Maybe that’s what the Bent Finance team is counting on… SUBSCRIBE NOW email address *   serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on . donate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C disclaimer :  is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by .

So basic in fact, that many are accusing the developer of pocketing the funds themselves. As always, some of the more financially, or emotionally , involved users, are planning their revenge. Have any of these groups of victims ever caught their attacker? If this was a planned event, then it’s likely that the developers have a history of such behaviour. But surely they wouldn’t use the same brand name twice? Would they? $1.75 million gone, and perhaps the most interesting part of the story is that the developers were still using Facebook.

DeFiLabs - REKT,1600000,07/27/2023,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/defilabs-rekt/,"DeFiLabs -  Friday, July 28, 2023 DeFiLabs - Rugpull - BSC -  read this article also in : en - es The shitcoin casino claims another set of victims. Yesterday, DeFiLabs rugged $1.6M from its users on BSC via a backdoor function in their staking contract. The project describes itself as “ A decentralized financeplatform managed by AI ” with a “ Secure Stable High-Yield Return Staking Pool ”. A full-house on low-effort-buzzword bingo. Random, previously unheard-of projects rugging on BSC is nothing new. Mostly, a few to a few hundred thousand dollars go missing, socials get deleted, and a handful of degenerate gamblers barely notice they’ve lost one of their many longshot bets. But at this stage in the cycle, and with much of retail long gone… …who’s still YOLOing into this stuff? Credit: Beosin , HashDit As with most low-effort BSC rugs, there is no sophisticated hack to report in this case. The latest vPoolv6 contract contained the backdoor function withdrawFunds which allowed the funder address to drain the contract of user deposits. The stolen funds include BSC-USD (the vast majority), Cake, wrapped BTC and ETH, and BUSD. Exploiter address: 0xee08d6c3a983eb22d7137022f0e9f5e7d4cf0be2 Rug contract: 0xdEDbd1804569F369e33e453Ee311F0F97dCd0Bde Example tx: 0xcd255e0d… Funds ($1.6M) consolidated here: 0x53ccFbC90A3fCDAfe9a2a50F798bEE7CcB5461b6 It will come as no surprise that the project had been audited by Certik (who did point out centralisation, aka ruggability, issues), as well as Cyberscope . However, neither audit covered the vPoolv6 contract, despite the fact that both audits were conducted after the contract’s publication . DeFiLabs released a statement on both Twitter and Telegram stating that: [the] platform is currently undergoing maintenance and updates. Unfortunately, we encountered an unexpected issue during this process. To ensure the safety of your assets and smooth operations, we have decided to temporarily suspend staking operations. The message goes on to state that withdrawals are paused but, funnily enough, doesn’t mention the draining of the staking contract. The team have promised an update in 48 hours… …just enough time for the next rug to come along and everyone to forget. Two months ago DeFiLabs helpfully published a ‘RISK WARNING!!’ to make sure users didn’t accidentally stray from their rug contract. How considerate of them. This incident is just one in a long line of rugpulls on BSC, with the last notable incident being the $2.36M lost on GMETA last week. The ill-gotten gains of one rug are often being siphoned straight into the next project’s LP or used to pump the new token, according to BlockSec’s MetaSleuth. It’s all so tiresome.

Acala Network - REKT,1600000,08/13/2021,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/acala-network-rekt/,"Acala Network -  Monday, August 15, 2022 Acala Network -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh Edit 16/08/2022: In response to Acala Network’s announcement on its Spanish-language Twitter account, user @Jaumeelgran reached out to the team with a wallet screenshot displaying the vast majority of the erroneously minted aUSD, accompanied by the following message : “ Hey, I’m an Acala holder since day one and there’s no risk from me, get in touch with me via official channels, this was a fault of the system, not mine as a user ” Luckily the user had triggered the bug by mistake and has been cooperating with the Acala to return and burn the excess aUSD. Other users profited from the same malfunction, amounting to approximately $1.6M in stolen funds. However, while still not back at peg, the price of aUSD has remained above $0.90 since the protocol was reactivated. The one billion that wasn’t. Tornado sanctions didn’t deter these Polkadot thieves, who tried to steal ~$1.3B in aUSD from Acala Network : the self-proclaimed “DeFi Hub of Polkadot”. However, Polkadot plays differently to Ethereum, and the transfers were quickly disabled “until a pending Acala community governance decision resolves the error”. Meanwhile, the aUSD price chart shows an all too familiar pattern… Acala has yet to confirm the exact amount that was permanently stolen, as even with the disabled transfers, some funds still slipped through the net. Now we wait and we wonder, how much can Acala return or replace? And where should this go on the leaderboard? Acala stated that: ""We have identified the issue as a misconfiguration of the iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool (which went live earlier today) that resulted in error mints of a significant amount of aUSD,"" and… ""The misconfiguration has since been rectified and wallet addresses that received the errorneously minted aUSD have been identified, with on-chain activity tracing in respect of these addresses underway."" Let’s take a look at this “misconfiguration”. Credit: @alice_und_bob The misconfigured iBTC - aUSD pool had recently concluded bootstrapping and begun to trade. It was incentivized with aUSD, ACA & INTR. However, the incentives.claim_rewards() extrinsic in Acala wrongfully minted $aUSD in exponential amounts (1.3B in total). While most of the attention has gone toward the one user who minted 1.2b aUSD (greedy) , at the same time a handful of other users exploited the situation by: a) sending $aUSD to Moonbeam. b) swapping for $DOT and sending it to Polkadot. c) swapping for $iBTC and sending it to Interlay. The $iBTC/pool was almost completely drained, but the DOT pool managed to retain some of the value, because it was a DOT - LCDOT pool and users had to go through this route, which mitigated the damage. The two wallets that profited the most are listed below. 23bmUgSeKMD8Y9triphPw5YHuiz3QUJNqcbmb3Eg9QMQDMWN 253pFTg22JqHbLeLZupexGMDUuXAJLfEriTYkFqvGWPuwcFi A few other users extracted value from the misconfiguration, but it is harder to tell if they did so with bad intent. In total, $1.6M in “good value” was transferred off-chain, and $4.6M of “bad debt” in the form of wrongly minted $aUSD also left the chain. As Acala and Polkadot were able to so easily disable the stolen funds, we’re not left with not much to say. Like the stories of “compromised keys”, we simply wait and see what those in control decide to do. Will wrongly minted $aUSD be destroyed? Will they have to roll back the chain? And where should this story go on the leaderboard?! We’ll let our Telegram group members decide. Probably.

RIP MEV BOT,1500000,09/27/2022,N/A,https://rekt.news/ripmevbot/,"RIP MEV BOT Wednesday, September 28, 2022 MEV -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh Zero pity. The notorious MEV bot known as 0xbad has fallen on hard times, just like the rest of us. After 75 days of exploiting value from unexpecting users, this mempool menace backfired on its owner, creating a beautiful display of on-chain karma. After one unfortunate user tried to swap $1.85M of Compound cUSDC for USDC on Uniswap v2, a lack of liquidity meant they only received $500 in USDC. 0xbad was quick to profit from the swap, backrunning the trade with an elaborate arb involving many different DeFi dApps. $1.02M profit. Nice. However… 0xbad got put down… tremendously . An anonymous attacker noticed a flaw in the bots arbitrage contract code, and stole not only the recently acquired 800 ETH, but the entire 1,101 ETH in 0xbad’s wallet. Attacker’s address: 0xb9f78307ded12112c1f09c16009e03ef4ef16612 0xbad: 0xbadc0defafcf6d4239bdf0b66da4d7bd36fcf05a @bertcmiller of Flashbots broke it down: 0xbad did not properly protect the function that they used to execute the dYdX flashloans. Note ""callFunction,"" which is the function called by the dYdX router as a part of flashloan execution When you get a flashloan the protocol you're borrowing from will call a standardized function on your contract. In this case dYdX called ""callFunction"" on 0xbad. Unfortunately for 0xbad, their code allowed for arbitrary execution. The attacker used this to get 0xbad to approve all of their WETH for spender on their contract. The attacker then simply transferred the WETH out to their address. Down 0xbad To add further drama to the drama, 0xbad decided to try and threaten their attacker with a message sent via transaction input data. Congratulations on this, we got careless and you sure managed to get us good, that was not easy to see. We would like this cooperate with you on resolving this matter. Return the funds to @x19603D249DF53d8b1650c762c4df316013Dce840 before September 28 at 23:59 GMT and we will consider this a whitehat, we will give you 20% of the retrieved amount as a bug bounty, payable as you see fit.

Last year, in “Return to the Dark Forest”, we wrote: Frontrunning is vampiric. It feeds off weaker participants, while conflicts with other bots push gas prices to unusable levels. Most of the time, frontrunners win… But not this time… MEV bots act on the boundary of “code is law”. In the PvP arena that is Ethereum’s Dark Forest, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

Levyathan.finance sank last week, along with its TVL of $1.5M. The team have since issued a few tone-deaf tweets and long-winded Medium posts trying to shift the blame, but we’ll tell you how we see it. The Levyathan developers left the private keys to a wallet with minting capability available on Github. ~Four months later, these keys were used to mint and dump LEV into oblivion. Afterwards, when users tried to redeem what was left of their money, a bug in the withdrawal mechanism meant that their worthless tokens were also irretrievable... “Have a nice day” Said the Levyathan admins. The official post-mortem is almost irrelevant when you realise that they made it so easy for anyone to mint their token. As a result of the exploit, users were forced to use emergencyWithdraw() to attempt to retrieve their staked tokens. However, the emergencyWithdraw() logic contained a bug which referenced rewardDebt (a variable related to reward calculation) instead of user.amount as the quantity of tokens to be withdrawn. Some users who were quick to withdraw in this way noticed that they were receiving more tokens than expected, and continued to withdraw more and more LEV, depleting the contract and leaving nothing for those who came later. In their post mortem Levyathan provided an address to which users could return funds ”in an anonymous manner"", which has received 3 billion dog tokens and one PLUGANAL. The team later on provided a second address which has so far received ~150,000 BUSD ( coming from the first address provided by the Levyathan team ) . What a shitshow. Leaving clearly labelled private keys visible on a public repo is unthinkable. Especially when they grant access to total control (no multisig) over your protocol’s native token. In their latest clumsy communication , the Levyathan team pointed out the fact that as the private keys were publicly available, we can be sure “that it was not an inside job”. Until they said that, we had assumed incompetence, but could the Levyathan team be stupid enough to to try and set up this “exposed keys” situation as an alibi? You decide...

Treasure DAO has advised users to delist their NFTs, and the chase to track down the pseudonymous pirate has begun. The thefts were made possible due to a logic bug in the Marketplace’s buyItem function, which allowed existing listings to be “bought” for no fee. harry.eth pointed out that: buyItem doesn't check quantity is > 0... exploiter calls buyItem() with zero quantity, pays 0, still receives NFT As well as the simple fix which would have prevented the attack: require(_quantity > 0, “Cannot buy zero”); Shortly after the bug began to be exploited, the marketplace was paused and transactions started to fail. Co-founder John Pattern said: We will cover the costs of the exploit—I will personally give up all of my Smols to repair this. Examples of NFT listings taken can be seen on Treasure DAO’s Marketplace via, for example, the Smol Brains collection’s recent activity . The project’s floor price is approximately 2.5k MAGIC, worth over $9k at the time of the exploit. Following the news, the price of MAGIC dipped by around a third, but has since stabilised, down around 10% compared to before the incident. In the hours since the attack, on-chain investigators believe they have linked one of the exploiter accounts to ENS and Binance addresses. Many NFTs are also being returned , suggesting that the threat of doxxing is dissuading the attacker from keeping the illiquid stolen assets. Treasure DAO eventually released a statement on Twitter : Thank you to the community for your support during the marketplace exploit. It was a difficult moment, but your support speaks volumes about the resilience of the $MAGIC  community. We are heads down focused on finding the 50 NFTs that remain stolen and making buyers whole. Given the almost instant rally in the token price, and the community response , it looks like this incident won’t be sinking the project. But considering the dirt being dug up on those involved with the project, and the amateur error that led to the loss, perhaps Treasure DAO users should seek riches elsewhere… SUBSCRIBE NOW email address *   serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on . donate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C disclaimer :  is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by .

The victim, aavebank.eth ( no apparent relation to the lending protocol ), is no stranger to bad luck.

In the dark forest of MEV extraction, enormous sums are routinely weaponised, often to shave off mere crumbs from the amounts involved. Amongst such cutthroat competition between ever-evolving bots, the block reward lottery's top prizes are growing.

Should validators be rewarded quite so generously for sitting on their stakes while searchers seek out the opportunities only to pay hefty bribes? Or should predatory MEV bots be grateful for any scraps they can get? Do either of them deserve the spoils? Credit: Peckshield Despite its deceptive name, we should all be well acquainted with the risks of ‘impermanent loss’ by now, Uni V3 LPs more than most. But far greater risks come from within. Illiquid pools and fat fingers make for a dangerous combination on DeFi’s biggest DEX, where MEV bots are waiting to scoop up the spoils of even the slightest mistake. aavebank.eth added 2M USDT of liquidity at a very out-of-range pricepoint to the UNI-USDT pair, before burning the LP position to withdraw just 99k UNI (worth $730k) just two minutes later. In the meantime, MEV bot 0xfde0d1 had eaten the excess USDT worth almost $1.3M from the costly, albeit juicy, error. Out-of-range LP positions on V3 can be used to set limit orders. One user pointed out : aavebank.eth has added followed a similar pattern in the past where they add $2 million USDT out of range essentially setting a limit order to buy UNI in the future. However, this time they fucked up the range and essentially offered to buy $730k UNI for $2m USDT. While the victim LP holds the ENS aavebank.eth, the address doesn’t appear to have a connection to the Aave protocol or team. But that doesn’t mean experienced DeFi teams aren’t making similar blunders . In ensuring they would be the one to grab the spoils, the bot gave up the majority of the 578 ETH profit in a 566 ETH ($1.25M) bribe paid to the validator, keeping just 2% for their trouble. While previously a niche and lucrative racket, MEV has increasingly become a race to the bottom . It may be entertaining to watch the occasional examples of on-chain karma as these blockchain predators feast upon one another, but MEV bots can also be responsible for returning frontrunned hack attempts ( in this case, the bot responsible is tagged on Etherscan as having thwarted two hacks to date ). Whenever someone loses out, be it to a sandwich attack or fat-finger mishap, a blockchain predator will snap up their losses. But pickings are getting slimmer as the arena becomes more crowded. Bots willing to take the lowest profit margin are able to take it all, while validators sit back and feast on gradually more generous portions. When excess value comes directly from malicious behaviour , should the recipients feel obliged to return the ill-gotten gains ? Lido certainly doesn’t think so . So will these bumper rewards simply serve to drive up rates on liquid-staking behemoths, leading to further concentration of mainnet’s validators? Or might it encourage more users to solo stake, hoping to hit the bribe jackpot themselves?

The Big Combo (Growth DeFi - REKT),1300000,02/09/2021,Consensys Dilligence,https://rekt.news/the-big-combo/,"The Big Combo (Growth DeFi - ) Tuesday, February 9, 2021 BT Finance - Growth DeFi read this article also in : en - es - fr - ru - zh The days blur into one. Locked down, wired up and worn out. Millions of dollars gone but nobody blinks an eye. Seems to be the first time we hear about some of these protocols is when they get arbed into the limelight by hackers using the same old attack vectors. BT Finance? Growth DeFi? Small name backstreet protocols are easy prey for the serial killers who roam these streets without fear. We’ve been through this before, you know the deal. Manipulate the price, call earn, and withdraw the loot. Nothing new under the sun, why change the plan if it always works? BT Finance would have been stopped by a copyright claim if the hackers hadn’t got to them first, so they were already set to fail. For the few users who were tempted in by their sultry slogan of “Best yield for tokens”, maybe they should have seen this coming… If you’re depositing your money into a protocol that is trying something new, or competing with what’s currently on offer, then taking on a certain level of risk can be justified. However, these low quality copycat bits of code are by and for simple gamblers who don’t look long term. So BT Finance done , no surprise. $1.5 million . Flash in flash out, like taking candy from a baby. Is a Peckshield audit supposed to be deterrence or encouragement for a hacker? At this point it’s not quite clear. Growth DeFi had a little more to them. Although their product was nothing new, they worked hard and built up a user base before eventually falling victim to a slightly more exotic attack than the usual. By forcing the staker contract to accept a liquidity pair containing a fake token, the attacker was able to remove $1.3 million in liquidity. The attacker created a fake token called AXZ and supplied rAXZZ/GRO liquidity. He then staked it in the contract and pulled out the other pair. @r0bster97 summarised the attack. First transaction : Swap 0.001 $ETH for ~0.0148 $GRO Second transaction : ~0.0148 $GRO and 100,000,000,000 $AXXZ liquidity to Uniswap Third transaction : Remove ~27,516 $GRO and ~1,218 $rAAVE liquidity from Uniswap. ""Missing if-condition in the smart contract code"" Fourth transaction : Swap ~27,516 $GRO for ~597 $ETH on Uniswap. Payday. The Growth DeFi team has provided a further analysis of the attack on their Medium page here . Two attacks, two techniques, the same end result. $2,7 million combined, taken with little to no consequence. Just another day in the wild west phase of DeFi. Money always moves to the smartest players, whether that’s through deception or not is irrelevant. Don’t rely on audits to do your diligence for you, check the code yourself or work with people that can. In a game where the smartest players are trying to outsmart each other, all the small guys can do is try to play safe.

Levana Protocol - REKT,1146000,12/13/2023,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/levana-rekt/,"Levana Protocol -  Friday, December 29, 2023 Levana Protocol - Osmosis -  read this article also in : en Gradually, then all at once. Perps platform Levana Protocol lost over $1.1M, or approximately 10% of the protocol’s liquidity, to an oracle manipulation attack lasting almost two weeks. The slow burn went unnoticed until network congestion fanned the flames. A disclosure published on Wednesday explained how the majority of the losses were realised when elevated gas costs on the Osmosis network suddenly made the exploit more profitable. The sharp increase in losses alerted the team, who responded by pausing the protocol. The exploit started 14 days ago. Over a period of 12 days the attacker succeeded in draining approximately 4% of Levana's LPs. The change in PnL was initially attributed to organic trader profits and lack of effective cash and carry on Levana's smaller markets. Yesterday the attack increased significantly during Osmosis congestion, draining an additional ~5% from the pools until the protocol was closed from new positions being opened. But if it hadn’t been for the increased network traffic… Would they have even noticed? Credit: Levana , Carter L. Woetzel According to Levana’s post-mortem , the attack began on December 13th, before ramping up significantly on December 26th. The exploit took advantage of temporary price discrepancies (delta) between oracle updates to place winning trades in “ volatile markets with high leverage ”. Although the attack vector is fairly simple, context is key. Oracle updates are pushed during regular user trades, as well as from Levana’s off-chain update bot, or every 90 seconds. But by timing attacks just right, and ensuring other transactions couldn’t get through, there was a window of opportunity every once in a while… During the first stage, profits were minimal, as the exploit relied on a combination of conditions: You would have to find, or artificially create, a period where two events coincide: the large price delta in <90 seconds, plus no other interrupting trading or bot activity The second, more profitable stage took advantage of a period of congestion on Osmosis; it remains unclear whether this congestion was organic or engineered for the purposes of the attack. Whatever the cause, it allowed for more cases in which the exploiter was free to make their loaded bets as regular user txs couldn’t get through. The report explains : A bug in the Osmosis fee market code meant that during times of congestion, the provided gas price was generally insufficient for making trades or performing ongoing bot maintenance activities. To top it off, the project was subject to an ongoing DDoS attack over the majority of the exploit period, hampering their ability to respond. The markets affected and their losses (totaling $1.146M) are as follows: stATOM_USD: $241k ATOM_USD: $229k BTC_USD: $190k ETH_USD: $128k TIA_USD: $108k *_USDC: $168k + $82k The following step-by-step, provided by Carter L. Woetzel , shows the many factors at play. 1 Spam txs such that no oracle update txs can get through (from either users or Levana infra) 2 DDoS backend infra tied to regularly scheduled oracle update txs 3 Have an intelligent system tracking the delta🔺between the stale data and the actual market pricing that is ready to get pushed 4 Use a multiexecute tx to go long or short + update the stale data to market pricing - guaranteeing profit for the attacker as they know exactly what the stale price of the oracle is about to get updated to within their multiexecute tx while also comboing it with a long or short guaranteed to be directionally correct. 5 Because the attacker was the source of congestion, they knew precisely where to submit txs such that they would get accepted by the nodes Levana had been audited by both FYEO and Peckshield earlier in the year. However, bugs which rely on external factors such as network congestion don't look to have been within scope. The project plans to make users whole via fees and an upcoming airdrop of LVN tokens, and is incorporating a transaction queuing system which will require a fresh oracle price to open positions. Even in the autonomous and disembodied world of DeFi, protocols do not exist in a vacuum. Fundamental considerations such as dependencies on external oracles and the reliance on an underlying network’s fee system must be constantly studied and meticulously tweaked to ensure a stable running product. And with inscriptions fever spreading across all chains lately, any protocol could find themselves suddenly clogged up. Crafty attackers may attempt to identify similar opportunities, waiting for congestion to hit a critical threshold, and ready to strike on multiple fronts. But considering the complexity of this hack, which took advantage of network-level pressures, protocol logic and off-chain systems, all combined with a distracting DDoS attack… Did Levana simply get unlucky? Or are we seeing the emergence of even more nuanced and time sensitive attacks?

Steadefi lost $1.14M to a compromised deployer address on Monday. Phishing or an inside job? The yield farm on Arbitrum and Avalanche announced the exploit: NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited and all funds are currently at risk. The warning came with an on-chain bounty plea to the attacker (though a second message followed, due to a typo in the email provided for negotiation…). Taking inspiration from the bounty offered following the recent hack of Curve pools , the exploiter has a deadline to return 90% of the funds, keeping the rest as a bounty. After the deadline, the 10% bounty will be offered to the public as a reward for information leading to a conviction. Could this a new industry standard for bounty payments? And will it work? Credit: Steadefi According to Steadefi’s own announcement , the deployer address of the protocol was compromised. As the deployer was the owner of all of the platform’s vault contracts, the attacker was able to transfer ownership (for example, the USDC vault on Abritrum in this tx ) to their own address. From there, the exploiter: went on to take various owner-only actions such as allowing any wallet to be able to borrow any available funds from the lending vaults. The attack drained all funds available for borrowing on both Arbitrum and Avalanche, with the only funds protected being deposits in the ‘Depositor vaults’. Steadefi’s TVL fell from over $2M to just $550k. At least some of the remaining TVL appears to have been locked in contracts by the exploiter: However, the exploiter has also paused the farms contract, which means that if you (and the majority of everyone is) has your svTokens or ibTokens deposited in the farms, you will not be able to withdraw them as well. However, the exploiter is also unable to withdraw them. The funds were swapped to ~625 ETH and bridged to Ethereum before being forwarded onto another address , where they remain. Attacker’s address ( ETH , ARB , AVAX ): 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc With many projects having funds returned recently, Steadefi may be hoping for a happy ending. However, given that this incident was due to an account compromise and not a potential whitehat poking about for bugs in a smart contract, we won’t be holding our breath. Especially if certain state-sponsored phisherman are involved… But who knows, between Arkham’s opening of a public doxx-market and Curve’s bounty hunter reward , we may be seeing the emergence of a new post-hack strategy.

Sovryn - REKT,1111000,10/04/2022,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/sovryn-rekt/,"Sovryn -  Sunday, October 9, 2022 Sovryn -  read this article also in : en - es - ru - tr - zh More fuel for the maxis. On the 4th of October, ~$1.1M was stolen from Sovryn, a “DeFi” protocol on the controversial “Bitcoin smart contract network”, RSK (apparently “the most secure smart contract network in the world”). The devs placed contracts into “maintenance mode” preventing further losses and the attack was announced via a rather self-congratulatory written thread on Twitter. But, isn’t pausing contracts somewhat centralised, for a protocol catering to Bitcoiners? While truly Bitcoin-native DeFi apps remain impossible, good marketing attracts investors, and Sovryn was heavily-shilled by Anthony Pompliano upon launch last year, based on an erroneous claim that it had higher TVL than Uniswap v3, at almost $2B. The TVL turned out to be miscounted, including native staked SOV, leading to DeFiLlama’s addition of the staking toggle to their TVL metrics, and dropping Sovryn’s figure to just $52M. Since then, TVL is down approx 90% since peak and the native token SOV has dropped 99% from its ATH of one year ago. Credit: BeosinAlert The protocol lost funds from two legacy lending pools: the RBTC (RSK-bridged BTC) pool, for 45 RBTC (~$900k), and the USDT pool, for 211k USDT. According to Beosin’s analysis , the exploit was down to the “ external call of callTokensToSend function. ” Attacker’s address: 0xc92ebecda030234c10e149beead6bba61197531a Example tx: 0xf5ea62… The attacker first deploys the attack contract and transfers into 0.03 RBTC. Then invokes the attack contract to borrow 8.20 RBTC to three pair addresses via flashloan, then deposits the entire 8.23 RBTC. The attacker uses the LP to borrow 52,999 side tokens. The closeWithDeposit function is then called to repay the collateral. 26,900 side tokens were swapped for 4.17 RBTCs. Notice that the attacker minted 26,000 side tokens into 22,653 Load Token, while in the closeWithDeposit function, there is no such mint function. Then we found that the attacker used the side tokens to call the attack contract externally, and used the attack contract to call the mint function. Because in the tokenPrice function, it relies on the number of side tokens to calculate the Load token price, and the total number of tokens has not been updated at this time, resulting in the attacker getting more Load tokens. Finally, the attacker calls the burn function to burn 22,653 Load Token to get 27,086 side token. Then the attacker calls the related function in a loop to get the side token, and finally converts them to RBTC. The stolen funds were deposited into Tornado cash. An update posted on October 7th assures that no Sovryn individuals need to worry, stating that: Roughly half of the funds have been recovered so far Potential remaining user losses will be fully covered by the Exchequer And five days after the attack, a final announcement: ”All user funds stuck on the ETH bridge have been unstuck. There is only once [sic] exception: the user bridging in USDT to XUSD.” There is no shortage of BTC-focused projects on Ethereum, including bridged assets such as WBTC/renBTC and protocols like Badger , but the scale of Bitcoin adoption remains low. Even the largest of these, WBTC, with a TVL of ~$5B , barely scratches the surface of Bitcoin’s $387 billion market cap. BTC maxis don’t trust their coins to be wrapped onto other networks. Many are suspicious of Ethereum, DeFi and any experimentation regarding what they believe to be a pure cryptocurrency. This incident will only give the bitcoiners even more reasons to cling onto their digital gold.

Yesterday, $1.1M in referral rewards were robbed from the BSC-based perps platform. The alarm was raised by definalist (whilst the attack was still ongoing) and confirmed two hours later by the Level Finance team. Luckily, the losses were contained to the project’s referral programme, with Treasury funds and LP both safe. The hacker dumping LVL tokens for BNB initially crashed the price by 65%, though this has mostly recovered since. The attack was initially attempted over a week ago, but it seems nobody noticed. Could a warning have saved Level? Credit: Peckshield , BlockSec Level Finance’s LevelReferralControllerV2 contract contained a bug which allowed for repeated referral reward claims to be processed within the same epoch. The exploiter prepared the attack by creating many referrals and using flash loans to make swaps, thereby increasing their reward tier. The claimMultiple function does not contain a check that the claim’s epoch is not being reused: Exploiter's address: 0x70319d1c09e1373fc7b10403c852909e5b20a9d5 Example tx: 0xe1f25704… LevelReferralControllerV2 contract: 0x977087422C008233615b572fBC3F209Ed300063a The project was audited by Quantstamp and Obelisk , who both examined LevelReferralControllerV2 as part of the project’s Core contracts without spotting the bug. UPDATE 09/05/2023 - Quantstamp contacted rekt.news stating that the vulnerability was introduced after their audit. They provided the following statement via DM: The vulnerability was included in an upgrade done on April 18 ( bscscan.com/tx/0xe0a8e635f… ) that upgraded the proxy of LevelReferralControllerV2 ( bscscan.com/address/0x9770… ) to the vulnerable implementation ( bscscan.com/address/0x9f00… ). This code is different to the commit audited by Quantstamp as stated in the audit report ( certificate.quantstamp.com/full/level-fin… ). The source code for the vulnerable implementation in question is not committed in the official public repository of Level Finance in GitHub ( github.com/level-fi/level… ). In total, 214k LVL tokens were drained by the exploiter, who swapped them for 3,345 BNB, worth approximately $1.1M at the time of writing. The funds currently remain in the attacker’s address. The sell-off of tokens caused the LVL price to drop from $8.42 to a low of $2.93 (-65%), though this recovered substantially following the attack. As mentioned by BlockSec , the week that passed between the hacker’s first attempts and their eventual successful exploit demonstrates the potential of on-chain monitoring systems. When malicious contracts are created containing code designed to interact with DeFi protocols in unconventional ways, tools like Forta , Sentinel and Spotter are able to recognise the actions as suspicious, and alert teams accordingly. However, few incidents have so much warning. DeFi protocols can go from SAFU to rekt from one block to the next. Usually, though, an attack contract must be deployed before a hack can be executed. And even a few minutes' warning could be useful for more centralised protocols with the ability to pause contracts. If not, though, BlockSec’s own whitehat frontrunning system has intervened in a number of cases, saving funds and thwarting the efforts of hackers. Perhaps a future of on-chain sentinels protecting fully decentralised and self-executing code seems a long way off for now… …but who knows what the future will bring?

Moby's initial response floated somewhere between damage control and a lesson in humility: ""We want to emphasize that it was not a security issue related to the protocol's smart contracts - hackers attempted to steal funds by simply upgrading existing smart contracts using stolen proxy private keys."" Translation: ""Our keys were stolen, but hey, at least our smart contracts worked as intended!"" Behind the scenes, a carefully orchestrated attack was already in motion. Like any skilled hunter, they first tested their harpoon on Arbitrum Sepolia before striking mainnet's depths. Attacker Testing the Waters: 0x2a566D111d0a5Be888FEC5F3834434Af3245Bb1b At the helm of this exploit sat a compromised admin key - the digital equivalent of leaving your ship's wheel unattended in pirate-infested waters. The assault began with a swift transfer of ownership, setting off a chain of events that would drain two vaults. Like a methodical predator, the attacker struck first at the S_VAULT before circling back thirty minutes later for the M_VAULT. Here's how the ship went down… Attacker Address: 0x2a566D111d0a5Be888FEC5F3834434Af3245Bb1b Transfer of Ownership: 0x9da34da770f1e9c5d5e176578b32710d8e288587d8401582f34a9631edf9be4b S_VAULT Attack Transactions: 30,180 USDC: 0xfb260f58332034fe203a41b031c41b8461f469e46d5632b33b328f22aed1fb42 0.074 wBTC($6,776): 0xa64829baf5b83fb6fbebcac334f2c73f6d8ec31a4c8b210538e32105c8ca8566 0.786 wETH ($2,376): 0x15890f9b4db381875d2e1e606f5c0b39540295f2af7ab34abe4dd4722dde18d2 M_VAULT Attack Transactions: 206.97 ETH ($625,302): 0x78b8900134bb345c16694096a43532d513dffdbeb3f7e154ac280377c35351b8 3.70 wBTC ($338,446): 0x39e21d38087de0d31a3e6bdae42c2431211c3773ca8ea96956062de393dfa291 But the attacker made a fatal mistake - they left an unprotected upgradeToAndCall function in their wake. Enter SEAL911, proving that not all heroes wear capes - some just write better smart contracts and have cooler tech. The white hat team spotted the vulnerable upgrade function faster than a shark smells blood, deploying their own implementation to rescue $1.47M USDC that was still at risk. As Tony Ke from SEAL911 put it: ""We just automatically hacked the hacker!"" $1.47M USDC Rescue: 0xa247fb0c2a641ad09f3c798c754662ee46ec56ebebc85c17afa397fdeaafe64a A race against time left SEAL911 just 30 seconds behind the original attacker - close, but not close enough to save the WETH, WBTC and USDC already lost to the depths. The final damage report as of press time: 207.78 wETH: $627,678 3.774 wBTC: $345,222 USDC: $30,180 Total stolen: $1,003,080 Amount rescued by SEAL911: $1,470,191 For the complete trail of over 35 addresses used to disperse the stolen funds, see Moby's detailed post-mortem . Before finally bridging through Stargate to Ethereum: 0x6a92d4840309f447922114a349984a1d09a51470 The waters cleared slowly - first an incident report , then a post-mortem revealing the wreckage. The protocol detailed their damage control as follows. OLP depositors could withdraw their deposits once systems normalized, funded by the team treasury, while options traders would see their positions either compensated at ""most favorable value"" or returned intact. Although, their journey to Berachain mainnet has been ""a little bit"" shifted. Meanwhile, somewhere in the depths of Arbitrum, stolen funds float through Stargate to safer waters. Some lessons of the sea, like lost keys and lost limbs, only need to be learned once. Perhaps they're hoping to find their private keys swimming back upstream? SEAL911's rescue operation proves that in DeFi, sometimes you need a white hat to catch a black hat. But when will protocols learn that private keys make better bait than security solutions? In DeFi’s waters, private keys aren’t just bait - they’re chum. And the sharks are always circling. The crypto seas remain as dangerous as ever, where one protocol's vulnerability becomes another team's rescue mission. At least this time, some white hats were there to throw a life preserver. Perhaps next time Moby Trade will remember - in DeFi's ocean, your private keys aren't the only thing that can get harpooned. In these waters, who's really the whale - the protocol that lost its keys, or the predators waiting for the next leak?

But presumably not for the reasons Coinbase would like. RocketSwap has lost ~$869k to compromised private keys, allegedly stolen in a bruteforce attack on the project’s server. And it’s not even the first time they’ve been in hot water . Two weeks ago , the high-profile rugpull of BALD was followed quickly by LeetSwap getting rekt.

If Base is supposed to be our new hope for a boom in retail adoption, we'll have to do better than this… Credit: Certik , Peckshield , RocketSwap At approximately 11pm UTC on August 14th, RocketSwap's farming contracts were drained via an internal address. If the team is to be believed , the project's announcement of the incident states that the keys were bruteforced from the server on which they were stored: We are sorry to inform you that the team needed to use offline signatures when deploying the launchpad and put the private keys on the server. A brute force hack of the server was detected, and due to the proxy contract used for the farm contract, there were multiple high-risk permissions that led to the transfer of the farm's assets. We shut down the farm to prevent further damage. The team have promised to redeploy the farming contracts directly, i.e. not via a proxy contract, and relinquish minting privileges. But with comments disabled on their tweets and the community Telegram also on pause, one wonders why they are so keen to control the narrative… Attacker’s address: 0x96c0876F573e27636612CF306C9db072d2B13DE8 The attacker bridged 472 ETH back to Ethereum as well as launched their own memecoin with 400 ETH liquidity , maybe hoping for a repeat of the BALD frenzy. While Base may be Coinbase signaling to the community that they still believe in crypto's core principles, especially whilst under pressure from the SEC, this messy start might just spur on Gensler even further. Building on top of OP, one of the more utopian visions for crypto and with a strong focus on public goods, is a show of support for what the tech could accomplish and a motivating force during times when spirits are low across the industry. Though even the most well-intentioned platforms sometimes beggar belief with their inability to read the room . But Base itself is, so far, drawing parallels to the early days of BSC , a new chain launched by a CEX, full of memecoins and quick rugs (another project, SwirlLend, has rugged since ).

Somewhere between Tuesday night's darkness and Wednesday morning's light, Orange Finance's admin keys slipped through fingers like digital butter, leaving their Arbitrum-based protocol ripe for plucking.

Their initial response followed the familiar incident response playbook: a warning to users against protocol interaction, instructions for contract approval revocations, and finally , a negotiation attempt with their attacker. ""If you respond positively to our offer within 24 hours, we guarantee that no law enforcement agencies will be involved, and the matter will be treated as a white-hat hack."" Their follow-up investigation revealed a string of operational failures - not only no monitoring framework and inadequate processes for privileged access, but most critically, their supposedly secure multi-sig wallet configured to execute with a single signature. Now Orange Finance promises a detailed spreadsheet documenting each user's losses, as if tabulating the damage makes it hurt less. Meanwhile, their investigation into how the private key leaked continues - presumably right after they figure out why leaving a door unlocked might lead to theft. How many more protocols need to learn that a multi-sig wallet is only as strong as its configuration? Private key compromises continue to plague DeFi with mechanical regularity, each incident following the same script - vulnerability, exploit, investigation, report. Yet protocols keep treating basic security like an optional upgrade rather than the foundation it needs to be. Orange Finance's follow-up investigation reads like a ""what not to do"" manual in protocol security. No monitoring framework, no proper access controls, and a multi-sig wallet with all the security of a garden fence. All while users watch their funds vanish faster than their faith in Web3. The team promises spreadsheets tracking losses and investigations into leaked keys, but these administrative band-aids can't stop the bleeding of bad security practices.

BlockSec provided the following step-by-step: Attacker’s Address: 0x1e8419e724d51e87f78e222d935fbbdeb631a08b Attack contract (with front-running protection built in): 0x0b09c86260c12294e3b967f0d523b4b2bcdfbeab Attack Tx: 0xeb87ebc0… The 442 ETH ($800k) profit was immediately deposited into Tornado Cash, completing the laundering just 20 minutes after being funded from the same source. This read-only reentrancy vulnerability has been seen in a number of attacks over the last year. A February post on Balancer forums noted how some Balancer pools are also susceptible to the attack vector, with the specific pools targeted in today’s attack listed as vulnerable. With three audits (from Certik , Quantstamp and Code4rena ), and a well-known exploit type, it is surprising that these pools were left open to attack. EDIT 02/06/2024: As pointed out by Quantstamp , the vulnerable version of the LendingPool contract did not fall within the audit scope. The leaderboard has been updated accordingly. No wonder many are discussing the need for oracle-free lending systems, which is becoming a hot topic . Though, certain solutions may eventually need oracles of their own … Let’s hope that, in the future, we’ll be building on Sturdy-er foundations.

Tornado Cash Governance - REKT,750000,05/20/2023,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/tornado-gov-rekt/,"Tornado Cash Governance -  Monday, May 22, 2023 Tornado Cash - Governance -  read this article also in : en - es Cypherpunks strive to become ungovernable… …but not like this. In a whirlwind of events, Tornado Cash's governance has been taken hostage via a trojan horse proposal, effectively granting control of the DAO to a single address. While the contracts do not allow for draining of the ~$275M in the privacy pools themselves, the exploiter gained control of the TORN governance token, the power to modify the router to reroute deposits/withdrawals, and admin status over Nova, the Gnosis chain deployment. However, it seems not all is lost. Yesterday, just before midday UTC, the exploiter published another proposal to revert the changes. As long as there are no nasty surprises this time, this could be a bullet dodged for the Tornado Cash community. Repentant grey-hat? Lazarus intern ? Or maybe the hacker is just looking to pump and dump their remaining TORN? Credit: samczsun , SlowMist , BlockSec , Apoorv Lathey It’s been a tough year for DeFi’s go-to crypto mixer. From the OFAC sanctions levelled in August, and the jailing of core developer, Alexey Pertsev, now released pending trial. Last week there were worries that someone was attempting to exploit Tornado’s governance system, creating multiple addresses and locking 0 TORN to the governance vault. Given that nothing immediately came of it, it was dismissed as a failed attempt. Was it a decoy, perhaps? Or a preparatory move? Exploiter address 1: 0x092123663804f8801b9b086b03b98d706f77bd59 Exploiter address 2: 0x592340957ebc9e4afb0e9af221d06fdddf789de9 The successful attack was smuggled in under cover of a proposal to penalise certain ‘cheating’ relayers . While the code purportedly used the same logic as a previous proposal , the attacker had added an extra function which allowed them to selfDestruct the contract. The proposal contract itself was published via a deployer contract. By combining CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes, the attacker could take advantage of their deterministic deployment to deploy new code into the address approved by governance. Using selfDestruct , the hacker was then able to erase the approved code, simultaneously resetting their nonce, and allowing for a redeployment of the malicious contract at the same address. BlockSec’s Yajin Zhou explains : Option I: Use CREATE2 opcode to create a malicious proposal contract. This will raise a flag since CREATE2 and self-destruct are used together. Option II: Use CREATE2 to create the deployer contract (0x7dc8), which further deploys the malicious proposal contract (0xc503) using CREATE. Then the deployer contract is self-destructed (to reset the nonce), and it can create a new proposal at the same address (0xc503). 4/ That's because the address of the deployed contract using CREATE depends on the sender and nonce (nonce = 1), enabling the attacker to create a new proposal with the same address (0xc503) These techniques for creating ‘ metamorphic contracts ’ are one reason that some have called for the selfDestruct opcode to be deprecated. The malicious proposal then assigned 10,000 TORN to all addresses created in last week’s ( presumed ) failed exploit. These were unlocked and withdrawn from the vault, granting the exploiter 1.2M votes (against 700k legitimate votes) and full control of Tornado governance. See BlockSec’s chart for a full breakdown of the attack stages: In unexpected turn of events, the exploiter later published a proposal to revert the effects of their hostile takeover, handing back control to the DAO as before. Apart from the 430 ETH (~$750k) profit from dumping TORN ( any guesses where the attacker chose to launder the profits? ), the hacker may have other motivations : Either they're giga trolling or it will end up being an expensive but not disastrous lesson in Governance security. As community member Tornadosaurus-Hex pointed out : I mean note that we don’t even have a choice in regards to this proposal but it is still important nonetheless. Hopefully, this devastating (albeit impressively crafted) exploit will have a happy ending. Should it have been spotted? Maybe. But with recent trouble amongst contributors , perhaps the DAO was not at full strength. The warning “ You will be at the helm of negligent tokenholders. ” reads as stunningly prescient, in hindsight. However we got here, hopefully this all turns out to have been nothing more than a storm in a teacup .

Merlin Lab, (another fork of PancakeBunny), was attacked in a similar fashion to the Bunny and the Autoshark hack. As a result, the hacker was able to remove ~240 ETH (~680K USD). Transaction Details on BscScan. 1: Add a small sum of deposit to the LINK-BNB Vault (with this transaction). 2: Send 180 CAKE to the LINK-BNB Vault contract. (This is the key that leads to the hack.) 3: Call getReward with the deposit of LINK-BNB Vault from the first step. 4: With the large amount of CAKE token in the wallet balance of the vault contract (sent by the hacker in step 2), it returns a large amount of profit. As a result, the system minted 100 MERL as a reward to the hacker. 5: Repeat 36 times. Receive 49K of MERL token in total. 6: Swapped MERLIN token into 240 ETH and transferred out of BSC using Anyswap.

Midas Capital - REKT,660000,01/15/2023,Out of scope,https://rekt.news/midas-capital-rekt/,"Midas Capital -  Tuesday, January 17, 2023 Midas Capital - Jarvis Network -  read this article also in : en - es - tr - zh The Midas touch has backfired, leaving a $660K hole in one of its pools of Jarvis Network ’s jFIAT assets. On Sunday, Polygon-based lending protocol Midas Capital was exploited via a flash loan attack on a recently-added collateral type. Both organisations announced the cause of the attack as the use of WMATIC-stMATIC Curve LP token. The read-only reentrancy vulnerability is a known weakness of this type of LP token, and had previously led to a $220k loss on market.xyz in October. All that glitters is not gold… Credit: BlockSec , Beosin Midas recently added WMATIC-stMATIC Curve LP token for use as collateral. These tokens have a read-only reentrancy vulnerability which allows the token's virtual price to be manipulated when improperly implemented. According to BlockSec’s analysis the attack has 5 basic steps: the calculation of a position's collateral depends on self.D and totalSupply self.D is updated after an unexcepted callback, so the four borrows in step 5 to use an outdated self.D. the contract burns stMATIC-f before the unexcepted callback, which causes the four borrows in step 5 to use an updated stMATIC-f.totalSupply() . As a result, @MidasCapitalxyz over-estimated the attack contract's position and lent excessive assets to the contract. Attacker address: 0x1863b74778cf5e1c9c482a1cdc2351362bd08611 Attack tx: 0x00534902… Attacked smart contract: 0x5bca7ddf1bcccb2ee8e46c56bfc9d3cdc77262bc The attacker was able to borrow the following assets against the inflated collateral: jCHF: 273,973 jEUR: 368,058 jGBP: 45,250 agEUR: 45,435 Which were then swapped to ~660k MATIC ($660k) and sent on to Kucoin and Binance. It’s always a shame to report on losses in DeFi, but especially when they are down to already known issues, with simple workarounds . Jarvis Network will cover the (~$350k) shortfall in backing of jFIATs that resulted from the exploit, and Midas Capital have reached out to the hacker in an attempt to negotiate a bounty. In a statement to rekt.news, Jarvis Network's founder Pascal Tallarida explained how they plan to deal with the incident going forward: As a result of the Midas exploit, the protocol lost 257k jEUR, 237k jCHF and 45k jGBP, and users lost 111k jEUR and 36k jCHF. The jFIATs belonging to the protocol were not collateralized. We have decided to do not wait after Midas, and we are working on a plan to re-collateralize the jFIATs the protocol lost, and reimburse the users who were victim of the exploit. We will propose to the Jarvis governance to allocate part of the protocol’s revenus (liquidity provision, lending interests, protocol fee and farming with POL) and part of the protocol treasury to it, and we will ask for the help and support of our community, partners, investors, and “frens”. I have already discussed with many of them and they have expressed their will to support us in this difficult moment, either with or without counterparty. Also, the company which is the main liquidity provider within the protocol, will help, with both its treasury and revenues (±$700k last year with swap fees, interests and market making). Then, Midas promised us that they will do right by us, by reimbursing what they can, and by helping us to provide value to the protocol. It could take them a while to do so, but I trust that they will do it. This isn’t the first time we have seen a hastily incorporated collateral type leading to a loss, and is unlikely to be the last. Let’s hope this rushed decision doesn’t prove to be Midas’ undoing this time… ""His senses are captured by the bait, and, thrilled beyond measure, he feasts his greedy eyes on the sight. So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold: but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold cursed his prayer.""

The trading bot’s brand new router was exploited to drain at least $640k from users who had approved the contract. An hour after Peckshield raised the alarm , the team’s response gave the impression that the exploit was over: We experienced a token approval exploit from our new router and have paused our router to contain the issue. Any funds lost due to the bug on our new router will be compensated. Your keys and wallets are safe. However, copycats deployed cloned exploit contracts and continued to drain funds after the official announcement. Any user with existing approvals to the new router contract remained vulnerable. Why didn’t the team warn users to revoke their approvals? Credit: Beosin , BlockSec Unibot’s new router contract , which had been deployed on Saturday and remains unverified on Etherscan, contained a vulnerability which allows an attacker to insert a transferFrom() call to drained approved tokens directly from Unibot user wallets. Any users who had approved the new router to spend tokens, and not yet revoked , is a potential victim. Revoke approvals for the router contract address: 0x126c9FbaB3A2FCA24eDfd17322E71a5e36E91865 Specifically, BlockSec explained that: As the code is not open-sourced, we suspect that there is a lack of input validation of the function 0xb2bd16ab in the 0x126c contract, which allows an arbitrary call. Therefore, an attacker could invoke 'transferFrom' to transfer out tokens approved to the contract. Beosin provided the following diagram of the vulnerable code: While the original exploiter has been inactive since sending 355 ETH ($640k) of profits to Tornado Cash, there have been reports of copycat attackers deploying contracts to replicate the exploit. Exploiter address: [0x413e4fb75c300b92fec12d7c44e4c0b4faab4d04] ( https://etherscan.io/address/0x413e4fb75c300b92fec12d7c44e4c0b4faab4d04 ) Example attack tx: 0xcbe521ae… The attack looks to be identical to one that hit Maestro, another TG trading bot, for ~$500k last week. However, Maestro’s response was quick and clear, even refunding users with more than they had lost. Hopefully refunds for today’s victims will be easily budgeted for after the volume they created. But it seems bizarre that Unibot, a team working on a such a similar product, wouldn’t have double-checked their new router code for the same vulnerability after such recent incident. In contrast, some responses from the Unibot team seemed to diminish the risk, potentially leading to further losses. Ouch. TG trading bots, like the recent SocialFi ponzi boom, sacrifice security for convenience. While this incident did not involve compromised keys, trusting your wallet to a closed-source project is exactly the kind of behaviour we’re continually warned about. And as today’s incident ( as well as LastPass , and StarsArena ) shows, these UX tradeoffs sometimes result in costly lessons about trust. Will we ever learn?

Approximately $575k was stolen from users who approved, with proceeds being sent to CEXs and Tornado Cash. It seems OFAC’s sanctions don’t scare those who are already breaking the law… The exploit was not active on curve.exchange , the project's alternate UI, which the team directed users to while the incident was dealt with.

When even the backbone of DeFi is reliant on legacy infrastructure… …how decentralised can we claim to be? As with other DNS hijacking events, identification of the exact cause falls to the service provider, and we must rely on their account of events, without being able to corroborate on-chain. So far, iwantmyname is yet to comment on exactly what led to the hijacking, but Curve believes that the underlying nameserver was compromised, rather than a vulnerability at the account level. Curve Founder and CEO Michael Egorov confirmed his team's suspicions with rekt.news: Well for now I can say that dns registrar iwantmyname had their ns compromised No account hack Switched the ns Besides a good bunch of hacked money frozen by centralized services What could be done better.. we should try to go away from web2 things like dns tbh, that would be the best Further details provided here .

Attacker’s address: 0x50f9202e0f1c1577822bd67193960b213cd2f331 The stolen funds (340 ETH, or ~$575k, in total) have been deposited to CEXs FixedFloat (292 ETH of which 112 ETH have been frozen ) and Binance (20 ETH) as well as Tornado Cash (27.7 ETH) Currently, for the vast majority of users, DeFi is only as secure as the centrally-hosted front ends that they interact with. As the battle-tested contracts which secure established protocols’ back end become gradually more robust, exploiters are increasingly targeting the front end. This vector leverages users’ trust in the project’s contracts whilst overlooking the security behind the UI. Without real decentralisation at every step, we will continue to see approval-harvesting attacks, such as those that have affected users of BadgerDAO , Mad Meerkat Finance and, most recently, the Namecheap breach which affected front ends of four DeFi protocols. For all the effort put into smart contract security, audits and decentralisation of governance powers, a project’s reputation can get still rekt through the fault of a web2 corporation. Aside from monitoring for any site changes , DeFi protocols (and more importantly, users) are stuck trusting another company’s security infrastructure and staff members . The next logical step is protocols hosting their Dapps via IPFS and ENS, cutting reliance on web2 DNS providers. The vast majority of users are not interested in dealing directly with smart contracts; front end security should not be treated as an afterthought. How much longer will web3 rely on web2?

In a Twitter thread, Hedera explained that “ The attacker targeted accounts used as liquidity pools on multiple DEXs that use Uniswap v2-derived contract code ported over to use the Hedera Token Service ”. HTS was audited by FP Complete in 2021. The head of Pangolin published a preliminary writeup which states the teams believed that the exploit was “ only affecting Hashport tokens. This proved to be false. Further investigation revealed all hts [Hedera Token Service] tokens were at risk ”. This allowed the attacker to burn bridged/wrapped tokens, as well as remove LP positions from the affected DEXs. According to the report, some funds were bridged back to ETH, after the Hashport team deactivated the bridge, the attacker turned to CEXs. Attacker’s address: https://hashscan.io/mainnet/account/0.0.2015717?p2=1 The report puts losses from Pangolin at $120k. HeliSwap lost just $2K, according to their rundown of events. The attacker’s alleged addresses contain a total of around $515k; ~$60k of HBAR and $280k of HTS stablecoins on Hedera , and $175k of ETH on Ethereum . Despite the news, the network’s native token, HBAR , lost less than the rest of the (currently tanking) market. In an industry known for its frequency of multimillion dollar hacks, striking a balance between a clear warning and sowing panic is tricky. Especially following the MyAlgo wallet-draining fiasco last week, the realisation that this incident was not contained to any one protocol was bound to cause chaos. While the pausing of the chain may have saved some user funds, it’s a worrying move which damages claims of legitimacy as a DeFi platform. One look at Hedera’s “ decentralized and transparent governing body ” gives an idea of the kind of organisations involved. The likes of Boeing, Dell and Ubisoft don’t strike us as hardcore DeFi idealogues. We may see some clarity over the next few days as to the exact mechanism of the exploit, but the damage has likely been done. DeFi users spook easily… …and with good reason .

Clober DEX's Liquidity Vault bled $500k yesterday when attackers exploited a vulnerability as old as DeFi itself - reentrancy. The protocol's team had rolled out fresh code changes without proper security review, accidentally leaving their vault door wide open. Trust Security and Kupia had done their due diligence, auditing the original contract thoroughly, but Clober's post-audit modifications rendered their work meaningless. Like a horror movie victim who decides to investigate the strange noise alone, Clober walked right into one of crypto's most notorious traps. The story serves as a textbook example of how not to handle protocol security - deploy first, think later. When will projects learn that audits aren't magical shields against their own rushed decisions? Credit: Clober Dex , Nick Franklin , Peckshield , Kupia Security , Trust Security , Raz0r Some thieves bring a crowbar, others just need a callback. Some protocols still can't resist leaving their security checks unchecked. Clober Dex learned this the hard way when their Liquidity Vault bled $500k in yet another reentrancy exploit. While most of crypto slept, one attacker found their opening through a simple exploit. By the time anyone noticed, 133 ETH was already on the move. Like clockwork, Clober's team rushed to Twitter with the familiar ""URGENT: Security Breach Alert"" playbook. They assured users that while their Liquidity Vault had been compromised, the core protocol remained unscathed. Stop me if you've heard this one before - another reentrancy exploit making its rounds through DeFi. According to the breakdown provided by Nick Franklin , the attacker's recipe was depressingly simple: find the unguarded _burn function, abuse its burnHook callback, and watch the ETH flow. Using their own malicious token contract and a custom strategy, they orchestrated a dance of incomplete state updates and multiple withdrawals, waltzing away with 133 ETH. Attack transaction: 0x8fcdfcded45100437ff94801090355f2f689941dca75de9a702e01670f361c04 Attacker Address: 0x012Fc6377F1c5CCF6e29967Bce52e3629AaA6025 The stolen funds didn't stay still for long. PeckShield tracked the attacker's movements as they bridged the 133 ETH from Base to Ethereum mainnet, splitting the spoils between two addresses. Stolen funds sent to: 0x711C87A0767101Fa6f3893FACb670B5689621e23 0x7760d838192f6E526721a0f6b160627baE989a3e As fingers pointed and questions flew, attention turned to the protocol's security history. The aftermath revealed a complex web of audit histories. Trust Security, who had audited the original contract, were quick to distance themselves from the carnage : “A post-audit code change introducing the reentrancy attack was audited by another firm.” Trust Security Audit Meanwhile, the other firm, Kupia Security found themselves caught in the crossfire after revealing they'd flagged potential issues with malicious strategies – though Clober insisted this was ""NOT related to the reentrancy attack."" Adding another layer to the story, Kupia Security had completed their own audit just days before the exploit . They had raised concerns about potential issues with malicious strategies in the Rebalancer contract, though Clober maintained these warnings were unrelated to the actual exploit. Kupia Security Audit According to Raz0r from Decurity, the vulnerable burnHook call appeared to be a post-audit addition - a critical detail that might explain how such a well-known vulnerability slipped through the cracks. A familiar pattern emerged: different audit findings, post-audit changes, and somewhere in between, basic security practices slipped through the cracks. In the end, Clober did what every recently exploited protocol does - offered the attacker a 20% bounty and promised not to press charges. But when protocols treat audits like checkboxes and deploy code without review, who's really to blame when the callbacks come home to roost? Call them audits, reviews, or security checks - they mean nothing without proper deployment practices. Projects rush to tout their security partnerships while quietly pushing unreviewed changes. Each reentrancy exploit feels like a rerun, yet protocols keep falling for the same tricks. Trust Security and Kupia did their jobs, flagging issues and reviewing code. Yet somewhere between their reports and deployment, basic security measures vanished into thin air. The carnage that followed serves as another testament to crypto's goldfish memory when it comes to security. Maybe next time a protocol considers deploying unchecked code, they'll remember Clober's $500k lesson. But with DeFi's track record, why wait for the next victim when we could just check the callbacks?

This vault was not supposed to be publicly available or ready to launch to the public.

The increase in WBNB balance was then seen as the profit. By sending BNB to the contract directly, it is also converted to WBNB and considered ""profit"". By depositing BNB in the contract, the attacker could harvest and all that BNB would be assumed to be rewardable profit. Straight to ETH, then Tornado and it’s gone. It’s hard times at Merlin Labs.

The Idols NFT - Rekt,324015,1/14/2025,N/A,https://rekt.news/theidolsnft-rekt/,"The Idols NFT - Rekt Thursday, January 16, 2025 The Idols NFT - Rekt read this article also in : en Narcissus stared at his reflection until it destroyed him. The Idols NFT protocol learned a similar lesson about self-reflection. Digital mirrors proved just as dangerous as mythological pools when an attacker exploited The Idols' reward system through a simple yet effective manipulation. By making transactions talk to themselves, they drained 97 stETH ($324k) from the protocol. The vulnerability lurked in plain sight – transactions where sender and receiver were identical created an echo chamber of infinite rewards. Like the nymph Echo calling out to Narcissus, each mirrored transaction multiplied the damage. The Idols team spotted the exploit within two hours, but the ripples had already spread through their stETH reserves. In the end, perhaps it's fitting that a project called ""The Idols"" fell prey to self-reflection. When smart contracts fall in love with their own reflection, who's left to tend the pool? Credit: Tikkala Security , TheIdolsNFT , TenArmorAlert Tikkala Security first glimpsed the reflection of trouble in The Idols' pool around noon on January 14th, spotting an alarming ripple in the IdolMain contract . The protocol's reward system had become entranced by its own image. A critical flaw in the _beforeTokenTransfer() function turned the contract into a hall of mirrors , where each self-referential transaction created infinite reflections of unearned rewards. The exploit's vanity was matched only by its elegance: when a transaction gazed upon itself - sender and receiver address perfectly mirrored - and the balance stood at precisely 1, the reward system would fall into a narcissistic loop. Like Narcissus himself, the contract became trapped in an endless cycle of self-admiration, doling out stETH rewards it should have kept locked away. The attacker, emerging from the depths of Union Chain, understood this fatal attraction. Initial Funding: 0x26aba26511874128b2bf075c4d5f801b27a42082c1ce7aa25327f61fa0185981 Through a series of self-reflecting transactions, they coaxed the protocol into an expensive form of self-worship. One ripple in the pool remains as a reflection of the attacker's artistry. Example Attack Transaction: 0x5e989304b1fb61ea0652db4d0f9476b8882f27191c1f1d2841f8977cb8c5284c The Idols team spotted their distorted reflection in the pool within two hours, warning users away from the treacherous waters. By the time the waters settled, the attacker had drained approximately 97 stETH from the protocol - a $324k reflection of The Idols' vulnerabilities. The exploit's success hinged on manipulating the claim reward logic. According to TenArmorAlert's analysis , the _beforeTokenTransfer() function suffered from a critical oversight - when processing transactions where the sender mirrored the receiver, and the sender's balance was exactly 1, the system would first delete the claimedSnapshots for the sender before claiming the reward for the same address. This sequence created a fatal vulnerability: instead of verifying previous claims before issuing new rewards, the function would erase its memory of past distributions. Like Narcissus forgetting everything but his reflection, the contract would reset its reward tracking state before processing each new claim. The system essentially developed amnesia about what rewards it had already given out. This fatal flaw created a loop of infinite reflections - each time the system gazed at itself, it forgot what rewards had already been claimed. The attacker simply had to repeat this process, watching their stETH balance multiply with each mirror image transaction. The attack unfolded through multiple transactions, each one a perfect reflection of the last. The hacker executed their strategy with the precision of someone who understood exactly what they were looking at. Blockchain explorers watched the attacker's address create ripple after ripple across the protocol's surface. Attacker Address: 0xe546480138d50bb841b204691c39cc514858d101 Even their OpenSea profile stands as a looking glass into their activities: OpenSea Account Flow of funds can be found here: Metasleuth Flow of Funds The Idols had positioned itself as more than just another NFT collection. Their 10,000 generative portraits came with the promise of perpetual stETH rewards - each NFT holder entitled to an equal share of the protocol's growing treasury. The treasury was designed to be ""monotonically increasing"" - a fancy way of saying the stETH principal could never be withdrawn, only the staking rewards earned. This mechanism was meant to ensure NFT holders would always have intrinsic value through their proportional claim on future rewards. But like Narcissus's pool, what seemed beautiful on the surface concealed dangers in its depths. The same reward mechanism meant to provide perpetual value became the vector for its undoing. The protocol's gaze, fixed too long on its own reflection, failed to spot the fundamental flaw in its reward distribution logic. While previous audits by both CertiK and WhiteHat DAO had examined the protocol in early 2022, none of the contract addresses involved in the exploit match those reviewed in the audits. Whatever reflection of security those early reviews provided had long since rippled away. The damage - 97 stETH drained from a protocol designed never to lose its principal - reveals how even the most elegant reward mechanisms can drown in their own reflection. When smart contracts spend too much time admiring themselves in the mirror, do they forget to check what's lurking beneath the surface? The Idols' security reviews from 2022 might as well be ancient Greek scrolls - their wisdom lost somewhere between audit and deployment. Over two years passed, code changed, and different contracts emerged bearing only shadows of what CertiK and WhiteHat DAO once examined. The protocol's story reads like mythology now: blessed with dual audits at birth, yet cursed to fall prey to its own reflection. Their reward mechanism, designed to provide eternal value, instead delivered eternal lessons about the dangers of self-reference. Those ancient auditors warned of centralization risks and privilege problems, but nobody could have predicted a protocol's narcissistic tendencies would be its undoing. Now 97 stETH sleeps beneath the surface of some hacker's pool. In the end, which reflection proves more dangerous - the one we see in the water, or the one we choose to ignore?

Fast forks are understandable when done by small teams - often anonymous developers just looking for fast cash. However, this was a heavily funded and promoted project that offered nothing new to the community. Raise $4.2m, copy the code from Curve, and get rekt. If you fully understand the maths behind Curve Finance, you have the power to build tools that push forward the technological progress of the human race. So why imitate? If you don’t fully understand the maths behind Curve Finance, why imitate? If you have enough funding to become a VC firm, you have enough cash to invest in projects that offer something new to the world. So why fund a fork? Any investor that backed this project values profit over progress. This includes new (and old) media companies, who took money from Saddle in exchange for promotional pieces. We know it’s hard to start a business and you have to take the work when it’s offered, but please consider your reputation... Saddle finance devops fan, Sunil Srivatsa, was not available for comment. The only unexplored field covered by Saddle Finance was the limitation of IP laws . After the Saddle Finance pools were arbitraged for millions within hours of launch, the Saddle team were forced to release a formal excuse for their performance, which contained an unacceptable amount of slippage for a protocol designed to “fix the problem of slippage in DeFi” Some of the early transactions were executed with high slippage. Individuals may not have yielded to warnings of high slippage. In response to some of those early transactions with high slippage, we’ve updated the front end to make high slippage warnings even more explicit. Igor Igamberdiev released several warnings advising users to exit the Saddle Finance pools, while their founder Matt Luongo showed no sympathy for the users who lost money by using the protocol he had helped to copy. At least three major arbs took over 7.9 BTC ($275,735) from the early liquidity providers within 6 minutes. 4.01 BTC $139,961 Jan-19-2021 04:06:54 PM +UTC 0.79 BTC $27,573 Jan-19-2021 04:08:46 PM +UTC 3.11 BTC $108,548 Jan-19-2021 04:12:37 PM +UTC Users who deposited into Saddle Finance in the hour after their launch will never get out as much as they put in, they can only hope that the liquidity rewards are generous... You can’t prevent apes from aping but you can at least care about the outcome. Maybe this was all part of Saddle Finance’s marketing plan. If any publicity is good publicity, then maybe they do win, but it’s the early LPs rather than the rich VCs who pay the price for this poor promotion. At least they went to the effort of getting a Quantstamp audit , but then what’s an audit worth if nobody reads them? Quantstamp has performed a security review of the Saddle Finance implementation of StableSwap. It is important to note that this implementation is ported from in the Curve Finance contracts, which was used as a reference during the review. In total 14 security issues spanning across all severity levels were identified, along with a few deviations from the specification, code documentation issues and best practice issues. Due to the poor documentation we were not able to determine how the developers have derived some of the implemented formulas from the StableSwap whitepaper. Additionally, we have noticed that all tests in the current test suite use exactly 2 tokens in the pool. We strongly recommend adding more tests that use 3 or more tokens and addressing all identified issues before deploying the code in production. The implemented relation looks different (from the original StableSwap). We are not able to understand how this relation is derived from the relation in the original StableSwap paper, mentioned at the beginning of this description. Ben Hauser of Curve said: The saddle codebase includes sections of the curve codebase in it's comments to explain how it works. It also says ""check the curve.fi implementation"" at one point when explaining something. They clearly didn’t care much for my gas optimisations, or just lacked the ability to understand why they were optimisations. Valentin Mihov said: In the open source world, rewriting instead of forking has certain implications. For example, if tomorrow Curve implements something new in their protocol, the rewritten system can’t just merge the changes in. They will need to spend significant time to rewrite them in their system. This is not the case for Sushi or DSD for example. This is where the difference comes imo. Ivangbi the TG admin provided the following analogy: ""I did not copy your book, I translated it to English and added 2 pictures"" Above quotes forked from l0bsterDAO Telegram group . Considering it took Saddle Finance six months to port the Curve code from Vyper to Solidity, the end result leaves much to be desired. We await the stale memes of Matt Luongo and team. The founders of Saddle Finance are closely linked to the Thesis project - creators of tBTC. veCRV holders expressed their views on the arrival of Saddle Finance by voting to reduce CRV rewards to the tBTC pool. Saddle finance devops fan, Sunil Srivatsa, was not available for comment. “Good artists borrow, great artists steal” What must have sounded like the perfect quote for the imitators to include in the Saddle Finance smart contract teaches a different lesson when we turn to the original words of T.S Eliot . Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn. The founders and funders of Saddle Finance are all mature enough to know better. There is plenty of opportunity to make money in this industry without copying the work of others. This project will not replace its predecessor, but it does serve to expose the true colours of those who promoted it.

Less than two weeks ago we asked: Are all algorithmic stablecoins bound to the same fate? Only $250k taken this time, via an infinite mint exploit. The exploit used a bug in SafeDollar’s reward mechanism to manipulate the accSdoPerShare value, eventually being able to claim vast quantities of SDO for each token deposited. An initial deposit into one of the protocol’s Safe Farms was made in preparation. The token that SafeDollar was incentivising, PLX , charges fees on transfers. These fees are supposedly borne by the user, but during withdrawal transactions these fees were deducted from the rewarder balance instead. A deposit/withdraw loop , allowed the hacker to gradually deplete the PLX balance of the pool over the course of 101 transactions, resulting in a massively inflated accSdoPerShare of 1,142,913,215,739,484,400 SDO being rewarded for each PLX deposited. With the rewards system now skewed, the attacker fired a final transaction. Claiming the rewards on the initial deposit produced a total of 831,309,277,244,108,000 SDO , which was simultaneously sold, crashing the price of SDO straight to $0.00. Despite owning such an enormous quantity of the stablecoin, the attacker could only make off with the defunct coin’s exit liquidity of 202k USDC and 46k USDT. So, just $248k, not $248 million. At position number 36 on the leaderboard , hopefully this will be the smallest hack we'll have to cover. Apparently CTRL C / CTRL V is just as popular when writing about DeFi protocols as it is when forking them.

Hypr Network - REKT,220000,12/13/2023,Unaudited,https://rekt.news/hypr-network-rekt/,"Hypr Network -  Thursday, December 14, 2023 Hypr Network - Bridge -  read this article also in : en What is this, a bridge hack for ants? Yesterday, gaming-focused L2 Hypr Network lost 2.57M HYPR (approx $220k) to a bridge exploit just two days after launch . The incident was quickly identified by a user, and the team warned users that something was amiss, but without initially admitting to an exploit: 📢 ATTENTION: Do not use the Hypr Network Bridge. The team wants to perform some more tests and do some further audits on the bridge. The team’s follow-up statement reassured users that HYPR holders in general were not affected, with losses coming from just two addresses ( the only users to have bridged funds up to that point ). However, the token did experience a drop of almost 40% when the proceeds were dumped for 97 ETH, worth approx $220k at the time of writing, the price has since recovered with the market rebound. While we’ve seen plenty of bridges lose funds to compromised keys over recent months, this is the first example of exploited code leading to a bridge hack since last autumn’s BNB bombshell ( unless you count the Shibarium bridge ’s temporary self-rekt in August ). Forking code can be risky, especially when devs aren't up to date with issues in the original source. Should developers of a codebase designed to be forked take more responsibility for communications? Or were Hypr simply not paying enough attention? Credit: BlockSec , Hypr Network The Hypr Network is built via OP Stack which allows developers to deploy fully functional L2s, forking Optimism as a template. In the Hypr team’s post-mortem thread , they explain that: Hypr used the most recent version of the develop branch of the OP monorepo at the time of deployment. Unbeknownst to us, this was not a production-ready branch and at the time contained a critical vulnerability which had yet to be patched. The full post-mortem report can be found here . BlockSec summarised the vulnerability as follows: The root cause was that the attacker managed to circumvent the 'finalizeERC20Withdrawal' function check by reinitializing the contract, due to the existence of the 'clearLegacySlot' modifier. Exploiter address 1: 0x5b8d598b354f5760b2a65f492154e7a3df46d1be Exploiter address 2: 0x3ea6ba6d3415e4dfd380516c799aafa94e420519 Attack tx: 0x51ce3d9c… The exploiter was funded from hacker-favourite FixedFloat and, at the time of writing, the stolen ETH remains in the 0x5b8d address. Composability, interoperability and building upon open-source code are elements which allow for many of DeFi’s greatest innovations. But they also mean that a bug in one place can affect multiple protocols across the sector. Communication between teams and staying up-to-date with security conversations across the ecosystem is key for anyone relying on forked code. As BlockSec points out : Note that the vulnerability was patched by the OP team after the contract had been deployed. This incident underscores the importance of the community working collaboratively to refine the process for releasing security patches, which will undoubtedly benefit us all. Hypr’s post-mortem report states that, following consultation, with the OP Labs team: [OP Labs] agreed that improvements on their release and communications process And, after reassuring users that other OP infrastructure was unaffected, the Optimism Foundation added: We encourage developers building projects in production to use releases approved by Optimism governance, which meet the security bar established by the Collective. We're also improving our release comms processes to help ensure it's clearer to projects leveraging the OP Stack. As ever, being the first to bridge to a new ecosystem can often lead to lucrative first mover advantages. After a prolonged period of apathy, FOMO is driving a growing desire to try new things as markets begin to heat back up once again. Are the potential rewards worth the risk?
