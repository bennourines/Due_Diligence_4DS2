b monerov xmv www monerov org team monerov org abstract monerov community led project designed create limited supply hard fork monero cryptocurrency new scalable blockchain algorithm idea create decentralized environment professional developers chosen community enhance simplify develop monerov scale mass use original monero vision create private digital currency conservative centralized core control slow development process prevents new users technologies incorporated rapid development process based bounty programs allow new people world participate potentially monerov private digital currency millions people open endless development possibilities addition monerov adhere core austrian school economics principles capping total monerov coins created parting monero xe2 x80 x99s infinite coin supply structure 1 introduction monero created specific reason alternative digital currency bitcoin private anonymous unlike bitcoin monero untraceable cryptocurrency based cryptonote protocol transactions amounts transferred wallet addresses senders receivers monero network obfuscated transactions linked particular user x0cunfortunately monero suffered drawbacks example monero s infinite coin supply centralization decision making prevents implementation new features scaling issue bloated blockchain high transaction fees growing hash rate mainly based mass usage botents unsuspected browser based miners prevents genuine miners compete critical flaws fixed rapidly monero s voluntary donation based development process deterred monero xe2 x80 x99s widespread adoption circumstances better create hard fork split indefinitely fix problems fixing problems require dedicated team time developers monerov born 2 max coin supply monero source code forked bytecoin implementation cryptonote protocol cryptonote white paper suggests predefined maximum coin supply case bitcoin simply intuition natural upper bound coins created largest number represented essentially infinite xe2 x80 x9cnot intuition n coins ought anybody xe2 x80 x9d unfortunately monero implemented suggestion guaranteeing infinite xmr coins created monroe s fundamental flaws fixed way central banks world print money thin air monero xe2 x80 x99s infinite coin supply tax form inflation xmr holders bitcoin xe2 x80 x99s 21 million maximum coin supply introduced specifically avoid having body controls money supply completely restricting future inflation devaluation bitcoin coins x0cbased merit monero able compete bitcoin world xe2 x80 x99s best digital currency idea infinite coin supply incorrect intuition monerov adheres core austrian school economics principles caps total xmv coins created 256 million initial coin circulation time hard fork 10 times xmr coins 158 million xmr holders prior hard fork receive 10 times xmv coins 3 scale features development conservative approach feature development monero seen strength example privacy concerns approach prevents integrating crucial features differentiate cryptocurrencies terms mass use monerov takes approach fast development feature integration monero scale time writing monero xe2 x80 x99s median transaction size excluding coinbase transactions 51 2 times larger bitcoin xe2 x80 x99s median transaction size 13 21 kb vs 258 bytes monero handle cumulative transactions amounts bitcoin blockchain size higher 7 7 terabytes comparison bitcoin xe2 x80 x99s 155 gigabyte blockchain turn fear imminent bloated juggernaut blockchain comes higher median transaction fees bitcoin monerov plans tackle scaling issues main source problems monero cryptocurrency coins matter integrate mimblewimble protocol blockchain size bound number users monerov number transactions network significantly reduce transaction costs blockchain size permanently solving scaling problem monerov pragmatic approach comes end user applications usage example introducing light monerov wallet default users asked download blockchain want
