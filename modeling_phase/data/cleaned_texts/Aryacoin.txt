transfer funds countries restrictions digital signatures prevent double spending low transfer fees allows moving huge amounts fees proof work allows transaction verified confirmed anonymity allows users use coin anytime 1 introduction bitcoin launched revolutionary allowing people transfer money anytime low transaction fees decentralized party involved transaction sender receiver involved xe2 x80 x8b xe2 x80 x8btransactions computationally impractical reverse protect sellers fraud routine escrow mechanisms easily implemented protect buyers paper propose solution double spending problem peer peer distributed timestamp server generate computational proof chronological order transactions system secure long honest nodes collectively control cpu power cooperating group attacker nodes xe2

aware transactions decided arrived accomplish trusted party transactions publicly announced 1 need system participants agree single history order received payee needs proof time transaction majority nodes agreed received 4 timestamp server solution propose begins timestamp server timestamp server works taking hash block items timestamped widely publishing hash newspaper usenet post 2 5 timestamp proves data existed time obviously order hash timestamp includes previous timestamp hash forming chain additional timestamp reinforcing ones 5 proof work implement distributed timestamp server peer peer basis need use proof work system similar adam s hashcash 6 newspaper usenet posts proof work involves scanning value hashed sha 256 hash begins number zero bits average work required exponential number zero bits required verified executing single hash timestamp network implement proof work incrementing nonce block value found gives block s hash required zero bits cpu effort expended satisfy proof work block changed redoing work later blocks chained work change block include redoing blocks proof work solves problem determining representation majority decision making majority based ip

honest chain grow fastest outpace competing chains modify past block attacker redo proof work block blocks catch surpass work honest nodes later probability slower attacker catching diminishes exponentially subsequent blocks added compensate increasing hardware speed varying interest running nodes time proof work difficulty determined moving average targeting average number blocks hour

incentive nodes support network provides way initially distribute coins circulation central authority issue steady addition constant new coins analogous gold miners expending resources add gold circulation case cpu time electricity expended incentive funded transaction fees output value transaction input value difference transaction fee added incentive value block containing transaction predetermined number coins entered circulation incentive transition entirely transaction fees completely inflation free incentive help encourage nodes stay honest greedy attacker able assemble cpu power honest nodes choose defraud people stealing payments generate new coins ought find profitable play rules rules favour new coins combined undermine system validity wealth 8 anonymity coin provides decent level anonymity users users send transactions public nodes broadcasted transaction sent nodes signed private key sender address allows users use coin time sending transactions directly node allows users place country 9 real life usage team continuously developing new innovative ways use coins currently developing exchanges users exchange coins fees restrictions coins platform mrdigicoin io exchange currently developing innovative technologies allow users spend coins 10 offline exchanges x0cwe working different offline vendors enable buy sell coins directly users fixed variable price allow easy buy sell directly cash allow coins accessible users restrictions online exchanges increase value number users new ways spend coin increase anonymity level coin introduce new users cryptomarket technology creating revolution educates people crypto introduce crypto world introduces new group people crypto decentralized future 11 transactions transactions working close transactions bitcoin transaction divided inputs outputs transaction contains 2 outputs payment return change number inputs 1 input large value small inputs small amounts transactions signed sent directly nodes anonymity privacy transactions allow transferring huge amounts low fees low difficulty allows faster confirmations 12 conclusion aryacoin coin looking use cryptocurrency allows privacy buying selling coin coin transactions proof work cryptographic hashes allows transactions verified computing power transaction verification providing miners reward exchanges offline vendors allowing users use coin restrictions cryptographic signatures allow users send transactions directly nodes allow user privacy keeping integrity data passed transactions x0creferences 1 w dai b money http www
