inception 2009 bitcoin born dissatisfaction existing monetary system longing currency marketization implying whitepaper s bitcoin peer peer electronic cash system nakamoto satoshi xe2 x80 x99s original intention inventing bitcoin hope means payment short hoped convenient use past years supporters bitcoin placed great hopes considerable efforts efforts came private sector commercial organizations sovereign governments unfortunately bitcoin widely accepted means payment present bitcoin fact commodity speculation 2017 2018 bitcoin price rose low $1 400 high nearly $20 000 volatility 1400% 2018 lowest price bitcoin 7 400 yuan highest price 9 900 yuan monthly fluctuation 34% current daily price volatility 10% years bitcoin price 10 million times higher birth calculated price $20 000 believe huge price fluctuations digital currencies instability purchasing power price fluctuation fiat biggest obstacles widespread acceptance means payment requirement stability purchasing power modern economic system unanimously affirmed mainstream economists total currency constant growth total growth economy s demand currency able support rapid growth economy cause recession today s economies purchasing power money remained relatively stable mainly mandatory use legal currency controlled sovereign governments use monetary policy instruments regulate money supply unlike legal currency total digital currency usually fixed issued destroyed according certain linear rule flexibly changed according demand market demand digital 5 x0cmoney cause huge fluctuations price uncertain stability currency xe2 x80 x99s purchasing power people reluctant use medium exchange example iphone priced 0 1btc 800usd btc price 0 2 0 05 btc day usd price remain 800usd case order
