protocol benet 2014 serves backbone decentralized storage applications provides documented protocol implementing distributed file system suitable serving web applications types content ipfs described having central point failure fully peer peer meaning user participate system file system protocol rely central authority govern operation ipfs poised create new decentralized internet infrastructure free censorship 2 2 implementation xe2 x80 x93 shift storage cluster default state ipfs infrastructure represented globally shared network lead problems comes verifying data integrity availability custom implementation details earning token rewards running storage node reason shift runs private swarm storage nodes use custom swarm key ensure talk nodes key prevents shift nodes host deliver content added outside shift network improve reliability performance order store data permanently ipfs implements concept called pinning pinning content means content available permanently unpinned default pinning applies single peer pinned means machine goes offline content lost way ipfs cluster subnet private net running ipfs daemon containing shift peers shift cluster runs wrapper ipfs daemon allows end user connect group ipfs nodes content stored replicated group cluster elects leader charge keeping track content available locations shift cluster provides modular clustering system use ipfs clustering system works conjunction ipfs daemon order accomplish following tasks 1 pin unpin repin content peers 2 provide http api communications 3 assert follow cluster consensus 4 replication
