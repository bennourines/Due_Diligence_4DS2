tokens currently existing cryptocurrency economic utility token security token coins sec recently announced consider initial coin offering ico securities good thing icos securities new viable way raise funds called tokenized securities paper propose tokenized hardware new viable way hardware manufacturing production open hardware economic tokenized hardware ensure assets hardware rights data privacy data security hardware tokens accordingly propose concept initial mining offering imo generate hardware tokens place way tokens pre mined tokens need agreed tokenized hardware ecosystem including manufacturers developers consumers consider tokenized hardware technology represent revolutionary innovation build trust secure hardware keywords token blockchain cryptocurrency tokenzied hardware 1 introduction recent years crypto emerging technology creating secure decentralized systems ethereum platform ethash based blockchain system uses technology issue tokens utilized cryptocurrency traded central exchange accordingly startups raise funds selling virtual shares form security tokens called tokenized security paper proposes tokenized hardware new idea current crypto economic figure 1 shows hardware undergo phase invention paper proposes currently early stage evolution new technology called tokenized hardware blockchain technology represents innovation enables secure communications parties trusted network x0cfig 1 tokenized hardware proliferation notable benefits tokenized hardware ensure data trust privacy open new business opportunities manufacturers tokenized hardware gain viable benefits security privacy decentralization associating tokens hardware devices based blockchain technology position paper introduce change benefits traditional hardware economic tokenized hardware economic tokens secure values utility hash access services tokens consensus mining cryptographic systems generate hash values hash values called utility tokens compared api keys today xe2 x80 x99s cryptocurrency economics hash values security tokens raise funds 2 tokenized hardware xe2 x80 x99s token fundamentals define benefits customers gain holding tokens linking viable benefits token usage models critical issue research reviewing fundamentals related tokens propose imo model address issue tokens mined imo model called utility tokens highly scarce commercial use benefits customers gain utility tokens following examples x0c1 access basic cloud service 2 sales service 3 purchase discount total supply utility tokens equals total quantity shipment utility tokens record benefits provided public blockchains ethereum hyperledger paper propose dextoken public blockchain purpose short utility tokens grant permissions authorized hardware accessing cloud service request sales service available benefits provided hardware manufacturers unlike public blockchains private blockchains permissioned blockchains controlled operators grant permissions authorized users 1 shipment hardware employed private blockchain utility tokens mined maker cultural phenomenon open hardware industry internet things iot connected device enables sensory data transfers internet applications participate iot device access sensory data participating iot device participants pay device data access unlike utility tokens payment cryptocurrencies bitcoin erc20 currencies uses encryption techniques regulate generation units cryptocurrency verify transaction funds unlike fiat currencies cryptocurrencies usually operating independently central bank minted public blockchains ethereum conclusion payment funds achieved cryptocurrencies peer peer p2p manner called client client c2c model support p2p model paper offers dextoken ethash based token payments 3 assets assets tangible intangible represent value ownership produce value 2 converted cash digital assets exist form binary data ownership digital assets hard determine example data possess right use regarded digital assets problem usually arises hardware industry furthermore tokenized hardware proposed paper resolve problem accordingly figure 1 shows differences hardware tokenized hardware xe2 x80 x93 tangible assets physical materials include pcba chipsets sensors etc xe2 x80 x93 digital assets data produced hardware summary tokenized hardware comprises tangible digital assets compare traditional hardware tokenized hardware ensure benefits x0c xe2 x80 x93 ownership rights use dextoken platform ensure ownership tangible assets possess right use digital assets xe2 x80 x93 depreciation use coin age technique calculate depreciation hardware xe2 x80 x93 externality externality benefit consequence economic activity experienced unrelated parties value increment celebrity effect externality positive negative mainly affected party fig 2 tokenized hardware benefits come utility tokens previously described utility tokens generating imo model tokens publicly accessible dextoken platform platform provide extra information tokenized hardware manufacturing date product model dextoken replace traditional hardware labels furthermore tokenized hardware industry visible impacts hardware company provide incentive design favorable incentive design help build sustainable blockchain network network healthy meaning incentive encourage participants support company participating business activities company 4 blockchain technology technically success tokenized hardware attribute device interoperability peer peer network developed flowchain x0c 3 blockchain iot practically prove concept work previous work attempted build generic software framework tokenized hardware decentralized iot applications fig 3 flowchain software framework paper use flowchain previous work paper build trusted assets storage tas tas local storage store trusted transaction objects transactional data stored local storage regarded trusted accordingly hardware blocks grow size object storage technically tas decentralized file storage hardware expand storage size mining blocks wifi camera use case tokenized hardware products wifi camera tangible asset video streams produced camera digital assets short tokenized camera asset comprised hardware asset digital assets token holder rights use assets subsequently blockchain issue access tokens users want access digital data camera use scenario tokenized camera hardware 1 john app mobile phone 2 app pays units wifi camera 3 blockchain issues access token mobile apps verifying transactions x0c4 app starts received video streams digital assets tokenized hardware 5 john watch video camera use scenario use case tokenized hardware proposed paper define connected tokenized hardware tokenized things compare classical internet things iot technically tokenized thing represented virtual things ontology web things wot operates p2p manner paper developed devify software framework 4 generic comprehensive software framework based flowchain building p2p iot networks 5 decentralized exchange paper proposes dextoken decentralized exchange tokens tokenized hardware exchange digital assets p2p networks notably digital assets require clients pay access dextoken applied alternative cryptocurrency altcoin miners tokenized hardware sell dextoken existing cryptocurrency exchange accordingly dextoken network relies volunteer miners relaying digital assets encryption techniques verify transactions payment accessing digital assets miners rewarded fixed units dextoken supporting dextoken network furthermore cryptocurrency holders sell existing centralized exchange recognized crypto assets tokenized hardware exchange dextoken existing cryptocurrency short tokenized hardware simply employed hardware wallets store digital assets crypto assets cryptocurrencies 6 key challenges paper depicted conceptual framework tokenized hardware system viable benefits consumers community seeed studio lead open hardware manufacturer shown experiences exist challenges current hardware industries xe2 x80 x93 manufacturing costs ecosystem benefit consumer community lot increase cost manufacture tokenized hardware extra increased costs mainly come operations fee blockchain systems x0c xe2 x80 x93 scarce paper depicted imo idea generate highly scarce tokens achieve solid incentive instead manufacturers crypto community utility tokens issue fundamental challenges build health tokenized hardware ecosystem 7 conclusion address issues fundamental challenges build sustainable tokenized ecosystem paper
