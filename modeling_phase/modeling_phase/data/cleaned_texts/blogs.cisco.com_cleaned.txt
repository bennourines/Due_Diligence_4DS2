reader good understand current effort cryptocurrency regulation different jurisdiction cod3x crypto council innovation atlantic council liquidity liquidity play critical role assess reliability cryptocurrency token project low liquidity significantly impede investor s ability trade particularly try exit position sell additionally leave crypto project susceptible price manipulation small capital drastically affect price environment ripe scheme like pumpanddump rugpulls high liquidity conversely price manipulation challenge require substantial capital impact market meaningfully s worth note low liquidity doesn t signify lack potential point newly conceive project lack substantial major crypto project begin limited liquidity organically grow time liquidity consider alongside project feature comprehensive evaluation assess liquidity crypto project coinmarketcap useful tool key metric focus include fully dilute market cap reflect total value cryptocurrency coin circulation circulate supply indicate currently available coin market extremely low value metric pose significant risk additionally circulate supply small fraction fully dilute market cap indicate potential risk large release coin circulation lead substantial price fluctuation manipulation detail outline project s whitepaper website carefully review audit use case demonstrate use propose audit methodology need diligence evaluate crypto project apply framework hypothetical example cryptocurrencies tokens case focus public blockchains private hybrid blockchains function black boxes blockchains limited
