advantages decentralized exchanges today account negligible percentage overall cryptocurrency transaction volume reasons lack adoption include high technical barrier entry performance usability issues availability lack incentives coordination hydro middleware layer incentive system decentralized exchanges background problems challenges 1 usability performance issues completely chain decentralized exchanges slower expensive centralized exchanges empirical evidence suggests majority users won xe2 x80 x99t trade away significant degradation performance improved security 2 susceptibility arbitrage chain maker chain taker model performs better purely chain exchanges susceptible arbitrage running order collisions 3 technical barrier entry successful exchanges built run operation focused teams technical difficulties building high performance hybrid exchange barrier entry 3 x0crelated work multitude projects related decentralized exchanges landscape roughly represented decision tree

following assumptions 1 canonical order schema elemental unit exchange order e buy sell x y rate decentralized exchanges ether use proprietary order schema openly shared advantage having use canonical open order schema orders match resulting cross exchange liquidity sharing additional concern smart contracts decentralized exchanges permission hold transfer assets potentially contain loss inducing bugs fragmented system order level increases possibility accidental loss theft help establish canonical order schema hydro built open order protocol 0x 2 incentive share open order makes possible share liquidity evident decentralized exchanges want share liquidity open permission orders easier arbitrage likely result order collisions details later usability problems aside unclear batch decentralized exchanges main barrier entry proactively help bootstrap potential competitors hydro introduces incentive system encourages decentralized exchanges cooperate share liquidity 3 common framework thousands cryptocurrency exchanges wildly different operating characteristics similar features technical implementations 5 x0chydro provides set middleware components lower cost creating
