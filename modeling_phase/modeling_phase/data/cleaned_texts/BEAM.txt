exploded producing thousands different projects technologies research papers today find projects ranging distributed computing enterprise solutions applied fields medicine automotive industries basic need people store money transact secure way relying centralized authority main use case important reasons bitcoin cryptocurrency influential today years ago bitcoin crypto currencies balance represented series transactions traced beginning blockchain order trust system need sure transaction chain valid relying centralized entity main purpose bitcoin nodes miners participants system agree

research shown data leaks come exchanges merchants otc deals collecting clustering blockchain data possible deanonymize users data including transaction amounts open permanently stored public ledger users identity known transactions past future balance directly linked person situation far ideal individuals organizations prefer transactions balance remain confidential seen parties specifically authorized require limiting visibility transaction details including transferred amounts identities participants keeping little information possible transactions public record prevent future analysis potential disclosure introducing mimblewimble august 2016 new protocol published anonymous author suggesting elegant approach topic efficient confidential blockchain called mimblewimble reference spell harry potter books builds concepts originally proposed greg maxwell confidential transactions transaction cut following high level explanation key principles mimblewimble detailed explanation read original whitepaper confidential transactions implemented cryptographic commitment scheme basic properties hiding binding similar giving closed safe box message inside know combination time comes reveal key person sure commitment valid binding know key received hiding mimblewimble utilizes known commitment scheme called pedersen commitment achieves elliptic curve cryptography form c r g v h r blinding factor secret key hiding real value v g h generator point specific elliptic curve input output transaction linear combination factors actual value transaction blinding factor order transfer ownership utxo unspent transaction output sender needs reveal value blinding factor receiver turn needs create new output commitment different blinding factor known linearity property pedersen commitments identical transactions b b c cut intermediate transaction resulting merged transaction c valid transaction system block list transactions list inputs outputs block seen large transaction allowing xe2 x80 x9ccut xe2 x80 x9d e merge intermediate outputs single block multiple blocks blockchain extending approach entire chain system needs store current utxo state instead entire transaction history validity history brought state confirmed storing headers previous blocks hold proof x0cvalidity previous states structure called merkle tree proof work allows reach consensus header chains considered correct case blockchain branching needed prove ownership utxo value unique blinding factor need store addresses blockchain creating transaction wallets online secure mechanism commitment recorded blockchain means matter resources attacker personal information extracted blockchain addition inputs outputs proofs fees mimblewimble transaction includes transaction kernel basic form contains difference blinding factors sender receiver transaction contain non interactive zero knowledge range proof ensure transaction value positive revealing actual value important allowing user create transactions negative value result ability arbitrarily create new coins prohibited system purpose use bulletproofs compact highly computation efficient implementation zero knowledge range proofs attached transaction checked system transaction validation q question beam equihash mining answer equihash pow mining algorithm adopted miners globally equihash based solving generalized birthday problem io bound meaning requires large memory opposed bitcoin s sha256 requires lot processing power equihash built way allow easy tradeoff processing power memory making difficult use asic miners existed time creation today dedicated asic miners equihash times efficiently average cpu question compact blockchain work data actually deleted blockchain answer data deleted blockchain blockchain append definition compact blockchain means information needed validate entire blockchain smaller complete list transactions user wallet new node connected system existing want store information download block headers current state verify entire blockchain question performance beam terms number transactions second answer exact numbers safe slightly better bitcoin existing privacy
