CRYPTOCURRENCY DILIGENCE
Avoiding regulatory and sanction pitfalls in the digital asset arena demands thorough up-front screening, tailored due diligence, and ongoing monitoring.
We help virtual currency companies understand who they are doing business with so they can avoid the potential perils associated with contemplated partnerships or third-party relationships.
We illuminate answers to questions that cryptocurrency companies are well-advised to be asking, including:
What are the potential regulatory and sanctions exposure from any parties or associates engaging in crypto transactions?
In which jurisdictions do partners or other third parties operate?
What is the degree of engagement with crypto mining, unregulated coin swap services, or technology masking such as private wallets?
We customize and calibrate our world-class, high-quality screening and due diligence acumen to comprehensively address these and other areas of interest.
“The chasm between crypto as an actively traded currency and regulatory oversight creates potentially serious business risks for organizations conducting business with the wrong third party.”
