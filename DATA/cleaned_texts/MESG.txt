b decentralized network services migrating traditional technologies decentralization anthony estebe nicolas mahe xcc x81 anthony mesg com nicolas mesg com november 2018 https mesg com 1 introduction web evolved point traditional web technologies coexisting alongside newer secure interactive technologies blockchains machine learning engines new technologies vast improvements traditional web old new serve purpose run parallel creating applications migrate traditional web services trustless interactive services currently costly difficult inherent limitations web service ecosystems helpful difficult use functionality limited connect world needs way connect web service ecosystems new systems like blockchains maintaining spirit newer trustless decentralized solutions allow exist harmoniously way create applications decentralized infrastructure supports bridging traditional web service ecosystems needed 2 network services years software web development certain concepts proven efficient service oriented architectures event driven architecture widely adopted powerful easy scale inherent scalability makes architectures easy decentralize 2 1 service design services way connect specific business logic feature technology typically feature bi directional communication services receive task execute like classic service oriented frameworks proactively send events related business logic 1 x0cany incoming data service categorized task outgoing data categorized event 2 2 trustless services create trustless environment services need validatable blockchains adopted deterministic virtual machines validate executions allowing actors network execute check result matches way executions validated fact traditional web technologies validatable example actor network executes task records data database actors validate checking data present remained unchanged order fully reliable trustless system services xe2 x80 x99 tasks events need validated network services requires validation different actors network 3 verification consensus service different services connected blockchains iot devices centralized databases etc requires different level verification depending applications xe2 x80 x99 requirements extent verification range verification verified nodes meaning range fully trusted service fully trustless service network services allow flexible level trust long service verifiable decision use service trustless decentralized way belongs applications specific use cases high level verification decentralization necessary considerably slow applications approach applications determine actors involved validation service course service node trusted applications number verifications set zero hand node known case decentralization applications want high number validations sure service executed correctly level trust applied components services xe2 x80 xa2 events emitted services xe2 x80 xa2 tasks executed services 3 1 event consensus events observed emitted services node running service willingly unintentionally emit wrong inaccurate events order prevent network ensures events valid 2 x0conce event occurs node hashes data event shares rest nodes based unique deterministic event id service provides majority nodes observe event specific period time defined service depending estimated frequency event event marked valid 3 2 task consensus task executions need verified level verification differs execution based level decentralization needed applications verification mechanism dynamic parameters involves types actors executor validators task executions handled single executor multiple validators executor node executing task validators nodes validating execution reproducing exactly task comparing outputs deterministic task executing verification method nondeterministic task verifiable 4 stability network order sure network reliable actors participating validation execution process network needs provide incentives nodes helping network incentives need favourable good actors network extremely costly malicious behavior 4 1 staking system behaviors concern nodes participating relevant service order participate service xe2 x80 x99s execution validation node needs provide commitment behave correctly continue running service minimum period time fill contract nodes need stake tokens attest good intentions contract digitally signed malicious behavior detected result loss stake ensure nodes behave correctly system needs able detect malicious behavior originate different actors xe2 x80 xa2 emitters submit incorrect events xe2 x80 xa2 executor execute task incorrectly xe2 x80 xa2 validators validate task xe2 x80 x99s execution incorrectly 3 x0c4 2 detecting malicious behavior portion stake lost relative severity malicious behavior number nodes involved process event emission task execution task validation fewer nodes involved process higher penalty malicious behavior nodes involved process lower penalty malicious behavior events checked consensus mechanism xe2 x80 x9cevent consensus xe2 x80 x9d node running service submit version events necessary information node emits result differs reached consensus node xe2 x80 x99s stake slashed tasks checked validators task result submitted executor proven invalid validators executor xe2 x80 x99s stake slashed tasks critical executed single selected node network case malicious behavior needs result strong penalty validators step need regulated regulation way events verification validator majority considered invalid verification portion staked tokens slashed critical needs secure possible ensuring malicious behavior costly misbehaving nodes 4 3 incentivize good actors order nodes absorbing risk sure work correctly incentive system needs implemented motivate correctly job supposed node provides good event task validation node receive tokens work supporting network incentive large encourage users run nodes penalty large discourage behaving maliciously reputation built based behavior actors good reputation importance network applications pay fees use network fees distributed directly different actors contribute application xe2 x80 x99s use network rewards good behavior creating new tokens automatically distributed actors network based reputation involvement 5 node selection different kind actors emitters executors validators need selected wisely node selected node misbehaves big 4 x0cimpact application sure best nodes selected selection based different criteria xe2 x80 xa2 service node running xe2 x80 xa2 tokens staked service xe2 x80 xa2 time period committed support service xe2 x80 xa2 previous successful emission execution validation rate based requested task xe2 x80 xa2 total stake previously taken number incidents malicious behavior xe2 x80 xa2 time period behavior xe2 x80 xa2 availability uptime node combining criteria network select node executing task selection needs deterministic ensure emitter agrees executor validators handle execution additional criteria added ensure wide actor selection xe2 x80 x9crandomness xe2 x80 x9d included based data provided event select necessarily best nodes opportunity nodes ensures nodes selected according data process 5 1 custom distribution users opportunity manually select set nodes gives users possibility creating sub networks running trusted executions traditional service providers progressively migrate trustless decentralization running services trusted network adding verifications trust component finally allowing execute services opening network decentralized component 5 2 data security actors known selected data encrypted specifically ensures confidential data xe2 x80 x99t revealed entities shouldn xe2 x80 x99t access combined custom node selection allowing privacy data 5 x0c6 conclusion network services solves issue migrating traditional web technologies trustless decentralized systems giving possibility progressively migrate migration following steps xe2 x80 xa2 allowing service accessible decentralized network remaining trustful trusted executions xe2 x80 xa2 removing trust services providing task verification functionality xe2 x80 xa2 allowing nodes run services fully trustable decentralized service provides single method communication kind service making traditional web technologies trustless decentralized technologies able communicate technologies like iot service executions monetized traditional web services new way monetizing technologies allows creation applications based event driven architecture connect events tasks verified consensus step opens possibility creating real decentralized applications choose level decentralization according need users 6 x0c
