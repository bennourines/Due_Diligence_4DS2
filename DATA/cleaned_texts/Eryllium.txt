demonstrate viability future peer peer crypto currencies dependency energy consumption named project eryllium coin age concept coin age known nakamoto early 2010 bitcoin help prioritize transactions example didn xe2 x80 x99t play critical role bitcoin xe2 x80 x99s security model coin age simply defined currency times holding period simple understand example bob received 10 coins alice held 90 days bob accumulated 900 coin days coin age additionally bob spent 10 coins received alice coin age bob accumulated 10 coins consumed destroyed x0cin order facilitate computation coin age introduced timestamp field transaction block timestamp transaction timestamp related protocols strengthened secure computation coin age proof stake proof work helped birth nakamoto xe2 x80 x99s major breakthrough nature proof work means crypto currency dependent energy consumption introducing significant cost overhead operation networks borne users combination inflation transaction fees mint rate slows bitcoin network eventually pressure raising transaction fees sustain preferred level security naturally asks maintain energy consumption order decentralized crypto currency important milestone theoretically technologically demonstrate security peer peer crypto currencies depend energy consumption concept termed proof stake discussed bitcoin circles early 2011 roughly speaking proof stake means form proof ownership currency coin age consumed transaction considered form proof stake independently discovered concept proof stake concept coin age october 2011 realized proof stake replace

transaction called coinstake named bitcoin xe2 x80 x99s special transaction coinbase coinstake transaction block owner pays consuming coin age gaining privilege x0cgenerating block network minting proof stake input coinstake called kernel required meet certain hash target protocol making generation proof stake blocks stochastic process similar proof work blocks important difference hashing operation limited search space specifically hash unspent wallet output second instead unlimited search space proof work significant consumption energy involved hash target stake kernel meet target unit coin age coin day consumed kernel contrast bitcoin xe2 x80 x99s proof work target fixed target value applying node coin age consumed kernel easier meeting hash target protocol example bob wallet output accumulated 100 coin years expects generate kernel 2 days alice roughly expect 200 coin year wallet output generate kernel 1 day design proof work hash target proof stake hash target adjusted
