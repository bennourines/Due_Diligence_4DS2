spreadcoin october 5 2014 introduction proof work cryptocurrencies new coins generated network process mining purposes mining protect network double spending attacks history rewriting miners generate new blocks check contents blocks generated peers conformation network rules miners delegate checking work crucial cryptocurrency security pools means pool operators large hashing power control generation new blocks brings unnecessary centralization decentralized system controlling 50% mining power allows perform double spending attacks 100% chance success 50% control possible perform attacks chances succeed1 core idea spreadcoin prevent creation pools mining decentralized system secure 1 double spending bitcoin wiki https en bitcoin wiki double spending pool prevention pooled mining miners perform work necessary fulfill proof work requirements pools care block generation broadcasting distribute reward miners according shares submit scheme miner alternatives 1 solo mining case miner send shares pool accepted 2 pooled mining miners shares accepted pool case miner actually generate new block reward pool redistribute miners allows organization pools miners way cheat steal generated money prevent creation pools remove possibility pool created miner pool submit shares usual reward case actually finding block miner send directly network instead pool reward spreadcoin mining organized way miner know following things 1 private key corresponding coinbase transaction 2 block header ensures miner broadcast mined block spend coins generated block necessary know private
