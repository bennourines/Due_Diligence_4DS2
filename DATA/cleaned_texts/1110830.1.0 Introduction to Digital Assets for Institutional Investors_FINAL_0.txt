piece, introduce popular digital asset concepts provide road map looking understand market evaluate making allocation digital assets. let s start bitcoin believe useful investors begin digital asset education understanding bitcoin impact technology. bitcoin created 2009 satoshi nakamoto, pseudonymous person group people. bitcoin white paper describes decentralized payment system powered network miners running algorithm. defines fixed supply 21 million bitcoin deflationary halving mechanism. halving, reward creating new bitcoin cut half 210,000 blocks, approximately years. bitcoin network, transactions recorded transparent open database, ledger. instead keeping centralized copy database person s control, thousands people computers update copy. computers called verifiers, nodes, or, sometimes, verifying nodes, responsible tracking previous transactions ledger verifying new transactions. digital assets?

blockchain systems allows distributed, anonymous validators agree network s state, confirm accuracy database. decentralized network, bitcoin, typical voting system vote person identify person prevent people voting multiple times , vote computer ip address use lot machines overtake voting process . instead, bitcoin uses vote unit computing power electricity expended, referred proof-of-work. successfully block transactions, randomly generated number guessed. computer guesses repeatedly correct number submitted, essentially trial- and-error guessing. computer energy means attempts miners guess correct number. computer accurately guess number wins write access ledger temporarily gaining authority include pending transactions block s ledger. service, receive reward form new bitcoin, known block reward. mechanism allows decentralized network come agreement solves problem double spending, malicious users try spend bitcoin token twice. network s transaction history publicly available, dishonest actors transactions rejected rest network s honest users. mining process requires lot guesswork computing power bad actors disincentivized attempting dishonest activity energy wasted transactions rejected. network grows, energy required new blocks. miners compete guess randomly generated number, network expensive participate dishonestly, securing network. additionally, mining power fluctuates, network algorithmically self-corrects concept called difficulty adjustment, adjusts work required guess right number. mechanism helps schedule blocks added ensures state competition miners trying guess number. keeps supply newly minted bitcoin schedule, holding bitcoin s inflation rate check.
