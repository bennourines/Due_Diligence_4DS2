      "Still, TradFi institutions and other organizations looking to grow and invest in the digital asset space \n",
      "will do so in the face of lingering worries over the business and legal uncertainty as well as regulatory \n",
      "scrutiny that will likely persist throughout this developing industry, particularly in the United States. \n",
      "Such uncertainty and scrutiny underscore the importance of conducting robust technical, legal and \n",
      "business due diligence to evaluate risk and alleviate concerns in major strategic deals. \n",
      "With the possibility of enhanced scrutiny, it is imperative that parties looking to enter the digital asset \n",
      "space through acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions understand the relevant \n",
      "technologies and markets as deeply as possible. This means analyzing the current state of the business  \n",
      "and its historical conduct, including its relationship to digital assets and the concentration of its assets,  \n",
      "as well as possible regulatory issues. \n",
      "Given the commercial, regulatory and technical complexities involved in the digital asset space, devising \n",

      "With the support of the right experts and an understanding of industry nuances that may arise, \n",
      "dealmaking teams should evaluate the following key elements as part of conducting robust due diligence \n",
      "for blockchain and digital asset deals.\n",
      "A. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n",
      "Digital asset and blockchain protocols can raise complex copyright, trademark and patent questions. \n",
      "When examining potential target companies that are active in blockchain, digital assets and web3, \n",
      "buying organizations must consider the protections and contracts that targets have implemented around \n",
      "their intellectual property (“IP”) to avoid inheriting infringements or investing in IP that may be or \n",
      "may become compromised. \n",
      "A particular challenge of IP in blockchain projects is separating out IP owned by the target, IP owned  \n",
      "by the holders of any digital assets developed by the target and IP owned by any relevant decentralized \n",
      "community (such as a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO). Careful attention should be \n",
      "paid to the allocation of rights in each piece of IP to understand potential risks posed by various rights \n",
      "holders.\n",
      "Understanding the technical structure of digital assets and the methods by which they are created and \n",
      "transacted is a business necessity. Buying organizations should examine the architecture of each asset  \n",
      "and the relevant blockchain network to determine their suitability for targets’ use cases. Proper due \n",
      "diligence should also include research on industry players who pose a potential threat to the IP of a  \n",
      "target company.\n",
      "Copyrights and trademarks\n",
      "For diligence targets with image- and brand-driven digital assets—such as creators behind non-fungible \n",
      "token (“NFT”) collections—acquiring parties should understand the possible copyright and trademark \n",
      "protections for such assets and ensure they are appropriately registered, including with the U.S. \n",
      "Copyright Office and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). Copyrights and trademarks serve \n",
      "different but synergistic functions when it comes to digital asset protection. Copyrights may be used to \n",
      "protect original works associated with an NFT, while trademarks offer an additional way to protect \n",
      "against forgeries and unauthorized monetization by third parties. Together, these protections build \n",
      "integrity for the collection and protect the project as a whole.\n",
      "Beyond NFTs, blockchain technology consists of software and other content that may be copyrightable. \n",
      "Many blockchain projects rely on open-source software, so acquiring parties should carefully diligence \n",
      "the proprietary or open-source licensing schemes under which the target’s software is developed. The \n",
      "presence of copyleft licenses, for example, may compromise the commercial potential of the technology. OCTOBER 2024  3\n",
      "Additional license schemes, including the Business Source License, which permits copying for only  \n",
      "non-production purposes for a certain period and later converts to an open-source license within four \n",
      "years, have also gained popularity. Diligence teams should ensure that the target company’s software \n",
      "development and usage comply with such licensing requirements and that the target’s software products \n",
      "are adequately protected. \n",
      "Patents\n",
      "Certain blockchain technologies and web3 applications are also patent-protectable. Unlike traditional \n",
      "business methods, which are difficult to patent due to eligibility hurdles, blockchain technologies may \n",
      "be technical systems directed to more than an abstract concept and thus may be more likely to be viewed \n",
      "as patent-eligible subject matter when compared to TradFi business methods. The USPTO has granted \n",
      "more than 10,000 patents for blockchain-based inventions to date, and the number of patent \n",
      "infringement suits related to blockchain-related patents has also increased. Diligence teams should \n",
      "investigate and understand in depth the technical mechanisms, as well as the target company’s patent \n",
      "portfolio, and, if any, anticipate any associated patent litigation risk. \n",
      "B. DIGITAL ASSET GOVERNANCE & OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE\n",
      "Custody and ownership of assets\n",
      "Verifying assets under custody (or the claims that a target has made about the volume or value of assets  \n",
      "it has under custody) is particularly challenging, as the process for doing so is different from standard \n",
      "approaches for validating individual ownership of currency and traditional assets. The diligence process \n",
      "must include validation of how custody has been defined, who has control of the assets on chain and off \n",
      "chain, the accounting processes involved and the governance controls around custodied assets. Doing so \n",
      "is typically a highly technical assessment of underlying infrastructure. Verifying the ownership of such \n",
      "assets may also prove to be particularly challenging for digital asset targets with products that focus on \n",
      "privacy or with complex organizational structures.\n",
      "Technical considerations\n",
      "The technical considerations that may be relevant to a due diligence team are fact specific and dependent \n",
      "on the company and the product or service at hand. Generally speaking, however, diligence teams \n",
      "should ensure that they have a clear understanding of the type of digital asset being offered, use cases for \n",
      "such digital asset, the methods by which outside users may interact with the asset, the asset’s distribution \n",
      "system, the target’s smart contract infrastructure, the programmability of such digital asset and any \n",
      "policies, protocols or internal controls limiting programmability and how the asset functions on the \n",
      "blockchain at a technical level, including its path from the target to the investor or end user.OCTOBER 2024  4\n",
      "C. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n",
      "Diligence teams should assess whether a target’s compliance teams, policies, procedures and tools are \n",
      "adequately robust to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Depending on an \n",
      "organization’s industry, operations and location, it may be subject to an array of federal, state and foreign \n",
      "regulatory requirements. These requirements could include, among other things, obligations arising \n",
      "under securities and commodities laws, sanctions restrictions, transaction monitoring requirements, \n",
      "anti-money laundering (“AML”) and know-your-customer (“KYC”) controls, anti-fraud and \n",
      "corruption measures and data security requirements. Of course, each target organization is different, \n",
      "and it is important that diligence teams consult with counsel to determine which of these requirements \n",
      "may apply in a specific instance.\n",
      "U.S. securities laws\n",
      "A common issue facing target companies in this space is whether the digital assets related to their \n",
      "business are securities, and, if so, whether those digital assets have been offered or sold in violation  \n",
      "of securities laws and whether the target companies have violated securities laws. Without adequate \n",
      "compliance with the applicable securities laws, web3 target companies may be subject to a number  \n",
      "of legal issues and potential liability, including from regulators. \n",
      "The U.S. federal securities laws apply to the initial offering and sale, as well as subsequent offers and \n",
      "sales, of digital assets if such digital assets are securities. Whether a digital asset is a security under the \n",
      "Securities Act of 1933 generally depends on whether the digital asset is an investment contract. A digital \n",
      "asset is generally considered a security by virtue of being an investment contract if it satisfies the \n",
      "four-prong test that the U.S. Supreme Court articulated in its landmark 1946 decision, SEC v. W.J. \n",
      "Howey Co.1 The Howey  test applies to any contract, scheme or transaction, regardless of whether it \n",
      "resembles a traditional security.\n",
      "The Securities Act establishes a transaction-based, mandatory disclosure regime designed to provide \n",
      "investors material information relating to securities offerings that do not fit within specified \n",
      "exemptions. The Securities Act makes it unlawful for issuers to offer or sell securities, including digital \n",
      "assets that qualify as securities, unless the offer and sale: (i) is pursuant to a registration statement filed \n",
      "with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or (ii) qualifies for an exemption from \n",
      "registration. Additionally, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, certain issuers of securities must \n",
      "file periodic disclosures with the SEC. These disclosures are designed to provide investors material \n",
      "information about the issuer, including its financial condition, operations and governance.\n",
      "Moreover, in the United States, a digital asset platform that offers trading in digital asset securities and \n",
      "meets the definition of an exchange must either register with the SEC as a national securities exchange \n",
      "or operate pursuant to an exemption from registration, including as an alternative trading system. \n",
      "1 328 U.S. 293 (1946). Under Howey , a non-traditional asset (such as a digital asset) is a security if: (i) there is an \n",
      "investment of money, (ii) in a common enterprise, (iii) with the expectation of profits, (iv) to be derived from the efforts of \n",
      "others. All four factors must generally be met to be classified as a security. See  also Reves v. Ernst & Young , 494 U.S. 56 \n",
      "(1990) (resulting in the so-called “Reves test”, infrequently applied to digital assets in comparison with Howey  but \n",
      "relevant to certain digital assets that resemble “notes”). OCTOBER 2024  5\n",
      "The current chair of the SEC has stated (but not speaking on behalf of the SEC) his belief that “of the \n",
      "nearly 10,000 tokens in the crypto market . . . the vast majority are securities.”2 Recent enforcement \n",
      "actions and guidance by the SEC highlight the agency’s focus on tokens and digital assets, although  \n",
      "there have been entities that have challenged its authority and jurisdiction in court.3 A comprehensive \n",
      "regulatory framework specific to digital assets offered, sold or resold in the United States, or to persons \n",
      "in the United States, does not exist. Instead, U.S. regulators apply traditional regulatory and legal \n",
      "frameworks to digital assets. Such frameworks require fact-specific analysis, which generally leaves \n",
      "market participants to gauge adequate compliance based on prior regulatory or judicial determinations \n",
      "and regulators’ public statements.4  \n",
      "Given the status of the digital asset markets, issuers of digital assets may be subject to a number of legal \n",
      "issues and potential liability, including from SEC enforcement. These issues could include individual \n",
      "liability and monetary damages, as well as operational impediments caused by orders to cease and desist \n",
      "from further violations of U.S. securities laws and regulations. It is crucial for diligence teams to validate \n",
      "a digital asset issuer’s compliance with the U.S. securities laws and regulations as well as assess \n",
      "compliance for those that provide services to the issuer if, for example, they are distributing tokens on \n",
      "behalf of the issuer.\n",
      "In addition, targets may have financial commitments or other obligations to early investors, such as \n",
      "obligations pursuant to simple agreements for future tokens or equity. Prior transactions, previous or \n",
      "planned initial coin offering activity and prior associations are likely to impact deal terms and deal value, \n",
      "and sometimes even viability. Understanding these early in the process is critical to supporting risk \n",
      "mitigation, accurate valuation and negotiations.\n",
      "Commodities laws\n",
      "Diligence teams should similarly take care to ensure that companies trading in digital asset commodities \n",
      "or derivatives are in compliance with the rules and regulations governing such instruments. The \n",
      "Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regulates U.S. derivatives markets, including  \n",
      "the trading of certain commodity derivatives products such as futures, options or swaps. Certain digital \n",
      "assets, including some virtual currencies, may qualify as commodities under the Commodity Exchange \n",
      "Act of 1936, which is enforced and administered by the CFTC.5 Individuals, firms and exchanges \n",
      "engaged in commodities derivatives trading must adhere to Commodity Exchange Act requirements, \n",
      "including registration as a regulated exchange or intermediary.\n",
      "2 See https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-sec-speaks-090822.\n",
      "3 See, e.g., SEC v. Ripple Labs, Inc., Case No. 1:20-cv-10832-AT-SN (S.D.N.Y. July 13, 2023) (holding that the Howey  test \n",
      "was not met where a digital token was sold programmatically, i.e. , via a trading algorithm, on a blind bid/ask basis—where \n",
      "the purchaser did not know the seller and the seller did not know the purchaser—or where the token was distributed as \n",
      "compensation in exchange for services).\n",
      "4  For example, some market participants have sought No-Action Letters from the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance \n",
      "requesting confirmation that the offer or sale of a given digital asset will not violate U.S. securities laws (or have \n",
      "structured their digital assets conservatively to ensure they fit within the parameters of existing SEC No-Action Letters).\n",
      " 5 The Commodity Exchange Act defines “commodity” broadly to include all “goods and articles, … and all services, rights, \n",
      "and interests … in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.” 7 U.S.C. § 1a(9). Generally, \n",
      "the CFTC’s regulatory jurisdiction is limited to derivatives—the agency’s authority over the underlying commodity (spot) is \n",
      "limited to anti-fraud/manipulation. OCTOBER 2024  6\n",
      "The CFTC has exercised its enforcement authority after determining that trading in certain digital \n",
      "assets is subject to its authority. Additionally, federal district courts have held that some digital assets, \n",
      "including certain cryptocurrencies, are commodities subject to CFTC jurisdiction. Acquiring parties \n",
      "should investigate whether target companies that trade digital assets are subject to the Commodity \n",
      "Exchange Act and CFTC rules and regulations.\n",
      "The Bank Secrecy Act and AML obligations\n",
      "Under the Bank Secrecy Act, web3 companies may be required to implement controls to ensure that \n",
      "their digital asset platforms are not exploited for money laundering or terrorist financing. Diligence \n",
      "teams should determine whether a target is required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and, if so, \n",
      "ensure that adequate AML protections are in place.\n",
      "The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to implement an AML program that includes KYC \n",
      "procedures and various reporting and record-keeping requirements.  Financial institutions subject to  \n",
      "the Bank Secrecy Act are required to implement adequate measures to verify customer identities, \n",
      "monitor transactions and report suspicious transactions. A compliant AML program must be in writing \n",
      "and include, at minimum, (i) the development of internal AML policies, procedures and controls;  \n",

Specifically, it includes securities that utilize DLT to represent or embody rights similar to those of traditional securities, whether these are issued directly on a blockchain (i.e., native security tokens) or are digital representations (i.e., digital twins) of existing securities (e.g., all forms of equity, debt, derivatives, etc.). These digital assets might provide dividends, voting rights, interest payments, or other rights associated with traditional securities. Excluded from this scope are money or money-like digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which function primarily as means of payment or stores of value.\n",
