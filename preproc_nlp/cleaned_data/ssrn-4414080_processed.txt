Abstract
Digital assets (DAs) are a unique asset class that presents investors with opportunities and risks
that are contingent upon their particular characteristics such as volatility, type, and profile, among
other factors. Among DAs, cryptocurrencies (CCs) have emerged as the most liquid asset class,
holding this distinction for almost a decade. However, while CCs offer a high level of liquid-
ity, investors must be aware of the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in this
asset class, and should conduct a thorough evaluation before making any investment decisions.
Our study examines the risk profile of CCs through portfolio analysis, utilizing Spectral Risk
Measures (SRMs) as the commonly applied method. In this study, we investigate the application
of SRMs in assessing the risk structure of CC portfolios, and their alignment with investors’
risk preferences. We employ SRMs to evaluate the CC index CRIX and portfolios constructed
from the most liquid 10 CCs from the Blockchain Research Center (BRC), optimizing different
SRMs.Our empirical findings suggest that various optimal portfolio allocations can be formu-
lated to meet the unique risk appetites of individual investors. All Quantlets (macros, code

1. Introduction
Cryptocurrencies (CCs) have gained prominence among Digital Assets (DAs) as
the most liquid asset class, maintaining this position for nearly ten years (Trimborn and
H¨ardle, 2018). Additionally, CCs have become an increasingly appealing asset class
for institutional asset managers and private investors alike in recent years. As more
investors add CCs to their portfolios, it has become crucial to understand the potential
downside risks associated with this asset class. To address this need, this study employs
portfolio selection techniques that minimize quantile-based risk measures, in response
to the rapid growth and evolution of the CC market.
The focus of this study is a broad class of quantile-based risk measures that can be
expressed as a weighted average of quantiles from the return probability distribution.
These measures, known as spectral risk measures (SRMs), are capable of capturing
both value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) as special cases. This approach
is based on previous work by Acerbi (2002, 2004), and allows for a comprehensive
evaluation of the risk structure of investments. A special case for a probability level of
α is VaR1−α the quantile of the P&L (Profit&Loss) that employs a degenerate weighting
function: the Dirac delta. By contrast, ES 1−α is another SRM that uses a simple step
weighting function equal to 1/α for all tail quantiles and 0 for all others. VaR has been
extensively studied in financial literature and is widely used as a risk management
tool in the industry (Weiß, 2013; M¨ogel and Auer, 2018; Simlai, 2021). Despite its
popularity, VaR has been found to have several limitations, with the most significant
being that, as per the terminology introduced by Artzner (1997), it is not a coherent
measure of risk due to its general lack of subadditivity (M¨ogel and Auer, 2018). It
is worth noting that only a particular subset of risk measures satisfy the axiomatic
conditions necessary for a proper risk measure.
The advantage of SRM is that conveniently fits investors’ preferences. Examples
are exponential and power utilities, as introduced by Dowd and Blake (2006) that link
SRMs with investors preferences. However, these models have been found to possess
certain properties that can pose challenges when applied to practical risk management.
Despite these limitations, it has been demonstrated that the exponential utility func-

tion may be a viable option under certain circumstances, as originally proposed by
B¨uhlmann (1980). However, the choice of utility function and the determination of
corresponding risk aversion profiles depend on the specific asset at hand.
In this study we concentrate on portfolio allocation of CCs, whereby the weights
are determined through the minimization of SRM. Through the exploration of various
parameters, this research investigates the characteristics of the portfolios that result
from different parameter values. Additionally, the study provides an overview of SRMs
and examines their relationship to investors’ preferences. To ensure the accuracy and
reliability of our results, we adopt a rolling window methodology with rebalancing
intervals of 30 days on a monthly basis, which is aligned with the rebalancing frequency
of the CRIX index. Additionally, we conduct the same analysis using longer intervals
of 90 days on a quarterly basis, as well as shorter intervals of 14 days on a bi-weekly
basis, to further strengthen the robustness of our findings. To evaluate the performance
of each portfolio, we utilize a range of out-of-sample performance metrics, including
Turnover (TO), Target Turnover (TTO), Cumulative Wealth (CW), Standard Deviation
(SD), Sharpe Ratio (SR), and Calmar Ratio (CR). We compare the outcomes of the
portfolios based on these measures.
This research paper offers three main contributions to the existing financial litera-
ture on risk management. Initially, we propose an approach to determine the optimal
weights for a portfolio of CCs by minimizing quantile-based risk measures. To the
best of our knowledge, these have not been previously addressed in the published lit-
erature. We emphasize the importance of aligning the chosen risk measure with the
risk preference of the investor, and suggest that SRMs are particularly suited for this
purpose. SRMs incorporate the investor’s level of risk aversion and enable practition-
ers to construct portfolio allocations that cater to the varying degrees of risk aversion
among investors. Our empirical findings show that portfolios of risk-averse investors
have lower associated risk compared to less risk-averse investors, with risk lovers ex-
periencing considerably higher rewards associated with Fung (2013). As such, various
optimal portfolio allocations can be determined to suit the distinctive risk appetites of
individual investors.
Secondly, CCs have established themselves as the most liquid asset class among
3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Page 4 ---

DAs, maintaining this position for almost a decade. Despite the high liquidity that CCs
provide, investors should exercise caution and carefully consider the potential risks and
rewards before making any investment decisions. Conducting a comprehensive evalu-
ation is essential in this regard. Thirdly, we examine the variations in the weightings
of each CC concerning the degree of risk aversion of each portfolio. Our analysis indi-
cates that as investors become more risk-averse, the weight of Bitcoin dominates over
the other CCs. This can be attributed to the fact that the standard deviation of Bitcoin’s
value is comparatively lower than that of other CCs, as illustrated in Table 2. However,
the power utility function with a risk aversion parameter 0 < γ < 1 behaves differ-
ently from other risk measures, leading to questions about its practical usefulness. Our
study’s results offer valuable insights into the characteristics of these risk measures.
The empirical evidence of this study can be summarized as follows. For one thing,
when attempting to estimate the total value of portfolios, as we observe, during the
pandemic the returns of portfolio experiencing higher volatility reach more extreme
values. Additionally, after analyzing the performance of Minimum Exponential SRM
portfolios across a range of parameters (from 1 to 25), it is found that the portfolios with
a parameter value of k = 1 (representing the least risk-averse portfolio) demonstrated
higher volatility in terms of their cumulative wealth. Conversely, the portfolio with a
parameter value of k = 25 (representing the most risk-averse portfolio) exhibits the best
performance. What is more, power SRM is estimated by considering two situations,
0 < γ < 1 and γ > 1. Based on our analysis, it can be inferred that as the SRM values
estimating from these two situations decreases, the corresponding Turnover (TO) also
decreases. This implies that a strategy with lower turnover is less susceptible to the
impact of transaction costs and is more likely to achieve better performance. One final
remark, we proceed to compare the portfolios using the selected SRMs in Section 5.1,
both with each other and with the benchmarks. These benchmarks include the popu-
lar Cryptocurrency Index (CRIX), the Minimum Variance (MinVar) portfolio, and the
Equally Weighted strategy, also known as the Naive portfolio. Our analysis reveals that
the portfolio that minimizes the Power SRM with a parameter of γ = 0.1 outperforms
the other portfolios significantly.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 we have the literature review. In

folio model. Section 4, we present our dataset of DA. Section 5 contains the details of
empirical analysis. Section 6 concludes.
2. Literature Review
The theory of spectral risk measures, introduced by Acerbi (2002), has emerged as
a captivating and highly promising development in the field of financial risk. These
measures are closely linked to the coherent risk measures proposed by Artzner (1997);
Artzner et al. (1999). Prior research has primarily concentrated on estimating the VaR
risk measure at high confidence levels. Nonetheless, VaR has faced significant criticism
as a risk measure due to its failure to satisfy coherence properties, particularly its lack
of subadditivity (Artzner et al., 1999; Acerbi, 2004). Subadditivity is based on the
intuitive idea that individual risks tend to diversify, or at the very least, not increase
when we combine risky positions. When VaR fails to satisfy subadditivity, it can result
in unexpected and unfavorable consequences. ES has emerged as the most prevalent
alternative (Acerbi and Tasche, 2002; Rockafellar and Uryasev, 2002) to VaR. ES has
been extended to the class of SRMs, see e.g.
SFM course.
A notable advantage of SRMs is their ability to connect the risk measure to the risk-
aversion of the user. Essentially, the SRM represents a weighted average of the loss dis-
tribution’s quantiles, with the weights determined by the user’s level of risk-aversion.
Consequently, SRMs allow us to link the risk measure to the user’s risk preference, im-
plying that a more risk-averse user should face a higher level of risk, all other factors
being equal, as determined by the SRM value. SRMs have found widespread use in
various domains, such as determining capital requirements or achieving optimal trade-
offs between risk and expected returns. Overbeck (2004) suggests that they could be
useful for capital allocation, while Cotter and Dowd (2006) propose that SRMs could
assist futures clearinghouses in setting margin requirements that align with their cor-
porate risk preference. In addition to its application to Artzner et al. (1999) original
framework of bank regulation, SRMs have been applied in portfolio selection (Adam
et al., 2008; Brandtner, 2013) and optimal insurance contracts (Cai et al., 2008), among
5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Page 6 ---

others. While this expanded perspective has broadened the scope of SRM application,
it has also raised new questions. Adam et al. (2008) explore risk measurement and
portfolio optimization under risk constraints using various risk measures, applied to a
hedge fund asset management framework, and shows the robustness of optimal portfo-
lios to the choice of risk measure.
The focus of this study is on exploring alternative SRMs that are based on differ-
ent underlying utility functions. Specifically, the study investigates exponential SRMs
that rely on an exponential utility function, which are equivalent to those previously
studied by Acerbi, and power SRMs that rely on a power utility function. Even though
they reveal that SRM has some properties which cause problems when applying to
practical risk management, they show that exponential utility function might be plau-
sible in some circumstances under weak conditions B¨uhlmann (1980). If the relative
risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are less than 1, Dowd and Blake (2006) address that
the weighting of lower risk-averse is higher than the higher risk-averse as the loss of
portfolio increases. On the other hand, the power SRM proposed by Dowd and Blake
(2006) when the relative risk aversion coefficients (RRA) are larger than 1, has also
proper features to give a higher weight as loss increase. It is important to note that
the choice of utility function and the determination of the risk aversion parameter will
depend on the specific financial problem being addressed.
In this study, SRMs are utilized for the purpose of CCs portfolio asset allocation.
The optimal weights of CCs are determined by minimizing the SRMs. Specifically,
this paper provides estimations of VaR, ES, exponential SRM, and power SRM, for
each of the CCs’ positions. The different estimates are compared with one another, and
alternative methods of estimating precision are examined and compared.
3. Methodology
3.1. Spectral Risk Measures
The Spectral Risk Measure (SRM) is a quantile-based risk measure, like the VaR
but with the difference that it involves a weighting function. This weighting function
ω(p) can be individually characterized by investors more general depending on the
6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Page 7 ---

investor’s risk aversion. More precisely the SRM is given by
Mω(X) = −
Z 1
0
ω(p)F−1(p)dp
(1)
hence a weighted average of the quantile function. If ω(p) is the Dirac delta function
which gives the outcome at say p = 0.95 an infinite weight and gives every other
outcome a weight of zero then the SRM boils down to the VaR at the level of 95 %
since it simply equals F−1(0.95), where F is a cdf of P&L.
The characteristics of ω(p) determine the usability and the properties of SRM in
practice. A desired property of any risk measure is coherence, simply the property that
combining portfolios into a larger portfolio should result in smaller risk. According
to Acerbi (2003) an SRM is coherent if it satisfies the properties of non-negativity, in-
creasingness and normalisation. The last condition ensures that the weighting function
rises with p, that is, higher losses are assigned with weights that should be no less than
the weights assigned to lower losses.
P1. Non-negativity:
ω(p) ≥0
(2a)
P2. Increasingness:
ω′(p) ≥0
(2b)
P3. Normalisation:
Z 1
0
ω(p)dp = 1
(2c)
The first property requires that the weights are non-negative, and the second property
is intended to reflect user risk aversion. The third one requires that the probability-
weighted weights should sum to 1.
Note that VaRα and ES α are included in spectral risk measures as special cases.
The weighting function of VaRα is a Dirac delta function which gives the outcome
an infinite weight and the others a zero weight. On the other hand, the ES α gives
all tail quantiles exceeding VaRα the same weight. Both of them are not a suitable
weight function for capturing investors’ risk attitudes. By setting a ’well-behaved’ risk-
aversion function which indicates the weights will rise more rapidly when the degree
of risk aversion is higher (Dowd et al., 2008), we investigate the behaviors of the users

in terms of different weight functions.
3.1.1. Value-at-Risk
Mathematically, the weight function for in terms of SRM can be expressed as fol-
lows:
ωVaRα(p) = lim
δ−→0 δ−1 1(α + δ > p > α).
(3)
3.1.2. Expected Shortfall
The weighting function for ES gives the same weight of (1−α)−1 to all tail quantiles
and gives zero to non-tail quantiles. Accordingly, the weight function for ES α in terms
of SRM can be written as (see Figure 1):
ωES α(p) = (1 −α)−1 1(p > α).
(4)
Figure 1: Expected Shortfall Risk Spectrum for different α
Notes: ES Risk Spectrum for α = 10%, α = 5% and α = 1%.
3.1.3. Exponential Risk Measure
The exponential SRM is specified by only one risk parameter k. To obtain the risk
spectrum, we set ω(p) = λe−kp and λ =
k
1−e−k . Then, the risk spectrum is (see Figure 2)
ω(p) = ke−kp
1 −e−k ,

where k ∈(0, ∞), p ∈[0, 1]. This function depends on only one k. By substituting
weight function into (1), the exponential SRM is
Mω(Rp) = −
Z 1
0
ke−kp
1 −e−k F−1(p)dp.
(6)

Notes: Exponential SRM Risk Spectrum for k = 1, k = 5, k = 10, k = 15, k = 20 and k = 25.
3.1.4. Power Risk Measure
The power weighting function only has one parameter γ, which leads to
ω(p) = λ(1 −p)γ−1
1 −γ
(7)
as γ > 1. Then, by setting λ = γ(1 −γ), the risk spectrum is (see Figure 3)
ω(p) = γ(1 −p)γ−1.
(8)
Plugging the weighting function to (1), the power SRM is obtained
Mω(X) = −
Z 1
0
γ(1 −p)γ−1F−1(p)dp.

Notes: Power SRM Risk Spectrum for (a) 0 < γ < 1 are γ = 0.1, γ = 0.3, γ = 0.5, γ = 0.7 and γ = 0.9.
Power SRM Risk Spectrum for (b) γ > 1 are γ = 1.5, γ = 3, γ = 5, γ = 10 and γ = 15.
For the case of 0 < γ < 1, we have
ω(p) = λpγ−1
1 −γ
(10)
with λ = γ(1 −γ). The risk spectrum is written as
ω(p) = γpγ−1.
(11)
The power SRM for γ > 1 then becomes
Mω(X) = −

0
γpγ−1F−1(p)dp.
(12)
3.2. Coherent Risk Measures
SRMs have originally been designed to fulfill a set of six axioms. It is noteworthy
to state that the axioms of translation-invariance and positive homogeneity together in-
duce the following linearity property. A risk measure satisfies the following properties
(H1)-(H4) (Artzner et al., 1999; Bellini and Bignozzi, 2015) is coherent.
(H1) Positive homogeneity: A risk measure is positive homogeneous, if the risk of
a portfolio is scalable by the size (defined by λ) of the portfolio.
ρ(λX) = λρ(X), λ > 0
(13)
10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Page 11 ---

(H2) Translation-invariance: A risk measure is translation invariant, if the risk of the
portfolio is reduced by exactly the same amount λ when adding this risk-free asset into
the portfolio.
ρ(X + λ) = ρ(X) −λ
(14)
(H3) Monotonicity: A risk measure is monotonic, if a portfolio almost surely generates
a higher return than another portfolio, the portfolio with higher return should have less
riskiness embedded in it.
X ≥Y, ρ(X) ≤ρ(Y)
(15)
(H4) Sub-additivity: A risk measure is sub-additive, if the risk of one large portfolio
comprised of multiple securities is no larger than the sum of the risks of the single
positions.
ρ(X + Y) ≤ρ(X) + ρ(Y)
(16)
In addition to these four properties mentioned above Alexandre et al. (2008) also
list two other properties which are desired for risk measures in practice. (H5) Law-
invariance: A risk measure is law invariant, if the two risk positions X and Y have the
same return loss distributions, they will also have the same risk measure value.
FX = FY, ρ(X) = ρ(Y)
(17)
(H6) Comonotonic additivity: A risk measure is comonotonic additive, if the loss dis-
tributions of two risk positions are comonotonic, combining these two risk positions
will not result in any diversification effects as their losses are influenced by some com-
mon risk factor(s).
ρ(X + Y) = ρ(X) + ρ(Y)
(18)
Table 1 gives us a summary of these three risk measures in terms of six axioms.
In addition, it is worth noting that Value-at-Risk (VaR) does not fulfill the property
of subadditivity, which means that diversification may not effectively decrease the risk
as measured by VaR. This is not an ideal situation. The following example demon-
strates how VaR violates subadditivity. Let X and Y be i.i.d and X, Y ∈{0, 100}, then

the discrete random variable X or Y has the following probability distribution:
P(X = 0) = P(Y = 0) = p; P(X = 100) = P(Y = 100) = 1 −p.
(19)
For p = 0.96, α = 0.95, it holds that VaRα(X) = VaRα(Y) = 0. As the cdf of discrete
random variable X (in an analogous manner for random variable Y) is given by:
FX =

0, X = 0;
p, X = 100;
1, X = 100.
(20)
So when α = 0.95, the VaR0.95(X) or VaR0.95(Y) which is F−1(0.95) is still equal to
zero, but jump to 100 when p = 0.96 as VaR0.96(X) = VaR0.96(Y) = 100. Meanwhile,
assume we have 3 states of X + Y:
State 1:
P(X + Y = 0) = p2
(21a)
State 2:
P(X + Y = 100) = 2p(1 −p)
(21b)
State 3:
P(X + Y = 200) = (1 −p)2.
(21c)
The cdf of is:
FX+Y =

0, X + Y = 0;
p2, X + Y = 100;
p2 + 2p(1 −p), X + Y = 200;
1, X + Y = 200.
(22)
The cdf of X + Y jumps from 0 to 100 at p = 0.9216, followed by jump to 200 at
12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Page 13 ---

p = 0.9984. Both p = 0.96 and α = 0.95 are smaller than 0.9984, so the VaR0.95(X +
Y) = 100. In this case, we have the following result,
VaRα(X + Y) = 100 > VaRα(X) + VaRα(Y) = 0 + 0 = 0.
(23)
VaRα therefore fails to satisfy the sub-additivity property, and it can lead to unex-
pected and unfavourable consequences. Since coherent risk measures are discussed
intensively in finance and risk management, the recent questions have arisen are more
coherent asset allocation (Kroll et al., 2021).
3.3. Portfolio Selection Model
This study examines the allocation of cryptocurrencies by minimising the risk mea-
sures, i.e. VaR, ES , exponential SRM and power SRM. The return Rp on a portfolio is
given by
Rp =
n
X
i=1
wi ∗ri,
(24)
where ri and wi are the return and weight of constituent CC i, respectively. The problem
consists in determining the weights, wi, by minimising a quantile risk measure for a
given confidence level 1−p, where p is the cumulative probability. The quantile-based
risk measures here serve as risk minimisation objectives which we consider different
quantile-based risk measures, Mω(Rp),

the return of CRIX.

3.4. Performance Measures
The results of the portfolios are compared using the out-of-sample performance
measures for each portfolio (Phengpis and Swanson, 2011), which we have chosen as
well as Petukhina et al. (2023):
Turnover (TO) is calculated to evaluate the potential trading costs associated with
portfolio rebalancing. This measure is defined following DeMiguel et al. (2009) and
DeMiguel and Nogales (2009), as the average sum of the absolute value of the rebal-
ancing trades across the N assets of the investment universe and over L rebalancing
months.
TO = L−1
L
X
l=1
N
X
j=1
| ˆwj,l+1 −ˆwj,l+|
(29)
where ˆw j,l+1 is the weight assigned to the asset j for the rebalancing period l + 1 and
ˆwj,l+ denotes the weight just before rebalancing at l + 1.
To explain further, TO considers the weights assigned to each asset during rebal-
ancing periods and just before rebalancing at time l. This accounts for price changes
during the period, as trades need to be executed to rebalance the portfolio towards the
target. High turnover results in significant transaction costs. Therefore, a strategy with
a lower Turnover (TO) is less affected by non-zero transaction costs and performs bet-
ter. While market makers do not consider reduced turnover a critical parameter in their
decision-making process, we believe that buy-side investors could benefit from a lower
turnover.
In addition, we also calculate a Target Turnover (TTO), following the approach of
Petukhina et al. (2021).
TTO = L−1
L
X
l=1
N
X
j=1
| ˆwj,l+1 −ˆwj,l|
(30)
where ˆwj,l is the weight assigned to the asset j for the rebalancing period l. This
measure is constructed to focus on modifications of the target portfolio weights due
to active management decisions, and is cleaned from the influence of assets’ price
dynamics. Unlike the previous definition of turnover, this target turnover measure is
designed to have a value of zero for the equally weighted (EW) portfolio.

The Cumulative Wealth (CW) achieved by each benchmark strategy with an initial
investment CW0 = 1 is calculated as follows Petukhina et al. (2021):
CWl+1 = CWl + ˆwT
l rl+1.
(31)
Standard deviation (SD), we calculate the standard deviation of the out-of-sample
daily returns series.
Sharpe Ratio (SR) is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. This version of the ratio
takes account of the difference in returns and the associated risk measured by Standard
deviation S D, and therefore it can be very useful for performance evaluation Leng and
Noronha (2019). The Sharpe ratio is given as
S R = Rp
S D
(32)
where Rp is an average out-of-sample return of the portfolio and S D is standard devia-
tion.
The Calmar Ratio (CR) is a metric for risk-adjusted return that is popular among
practitioners because of its unique focus on maximum drawdown instead of volatility,
as in the Sharpe Ratio Petukhina et al. (2021). CR is calculated as follows:
CR = 365 × Rp

4. Data
Data on digital assets are abundant, but here we concentrate on crypto currencies,
since they are the most popular DA as of today. More DA data can be found on the
BRC Blockchain-Research-center.com where one can download e.g. NFTs for digital
art pieces or high frequency order books and options for the most dominant CCs. The
CRIX, the most well known CC Index can be also found on SP Global. CRIX is

calculated via a Laspeyre mechanism but with varying number of constituents and a
slick model choice procedure based on a modified AIC technique, called the CTDC.
Our dataset consists of the daily values of the CRIX index since its beginning, i.e.,
from March 16, 2018 to March 19, 2023. This data will be used for the initial analysis
of spectral risk measures, and we will use the average daily prices of the ten most liquid
cryptocurrencies available on the BRC in the subsequent construction of the portfolios.
Specifically, we used the following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC),
Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Dash (DASH), Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic
(ETC), Zcash (ZEC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV). The dataset for these
cryptocurrencies is from 10 November 2018, which is the data availability date for all
selected cryptocurrencies on BRC until 19 March 2023.
Out of the cryptocurrencies selected by us, four of them (BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE)
are also part of the CRIX index, which currently (March 2023) consists of a total of six
cryptocurrencies, including Cardano and Binance Coin in addition to the previously
mentioned ones.

also has the highest volatility, as measured by SD, followed by BSV, while BTC with
the CRIX index exhibits the lowest volatility.
Upon examining Figure 4, it is evident that most of CCs have been a sudden and
significant surge in the data for the begging of the year 2021. It’s understandable that
during that period, in order to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
economy, the government and central bank injected a massive amount of liquidity into
the economy. However, between 2021 and the middle of 2022, the CC market experi-
enced increased volatility and instability, likely attributed to factors such as inflation,
wars, and global economic recessions.

5. Empirical results
To begin this section, we look at how different SRMs react to movements in the
CCs market, which is represented by the CRIX index. Then, in the rest of this section,
we examine portfolios that minimise the different SRMs.
Figure 5 shows the daily evolution of the different SRMs and the maximum draw-
down using an estimation window of 365 days. The last sub-graph shows the evolution
17

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Page 18 ---

of the value of the CRIX index and therefore we can see the response of the different
SRMs to a change in the value of CRIX. From the figure of VaR evolution, we can see
that this measure increases as α decreases, while it reacts more sharply to changes in
the evolution of the CRIX index. Observing the sub-figure showing the evolution of
ES over time for different parameters alpha, it can be concluded that this evolution is
similar to the one in the sub-figure with VaR.
The next sub-figure in Figure 5 shows the evolution of the Exponential SRM, from
which we can observe that as the parameter k increases, the value of this SRM increases
and also responds more steeply to changes in the value of the CRIX index. This ob-
servation is consistent with Figure 2, where we see that as the parameter k increases,
lower values (higher risk) are given a higher weight.
In Figure 5, we present two sub-figures that depict the power SRM for different
values of the parameter γ. The fourth sub-figure shows the evolution of the SRM
for γ ∈(0, 1). It can be observed that as the value of γ increases, the value of the
SRM decreases. Furthermore, the peaks and troughs in the SRM trajectory become
smaller in magnitude as γ increases. These findings are consistent with Figure 3. The
second sub-figure depicting the Power SRM corresponds to values of γ > 1. Here,
we can observe opposite results compared to the previous case. As the parameter γ
increases, the value of the Power SRM also increases. Moreover, we can observe more
pronounced reactions to changes in the values of the CRIX index.

5.1. The spectral risk minimising portfolio models
In this section, we find portfolios that have a minimum SRM based on the model
presented in section 3.3. In the portfolio construction, we use a rolling window ap-
proach with monthly (30-day) rebalancing as the CRIX index is rebalanced, which we
also extend to quarterly (90-day) and bi-weekly (14-day) rebalancing for robustness of
the results. Due to the high volatility of our chosen asset, cryptocurrencies, we opted
for only a one-year (365-day) estimation window when we calculate the weights.
To compare our results, we chose two classical approaches of the benchmark port-
folio theory and the best known crypto index CRIX. The first benchmark approach is
the naive allocation strategy or equally weighted portfolio approach, which, according
to DeMiguel et al. (2009), is difficult to outperform in practical applications. This ap-
proach is typically used as a benchmark for comparative analyses.The second principle
we chose as a benchmark is the Markowitz (1952) Mean-Variance or more practically
used Minimum-Variance (MinVar) portfolio. This model is a basic model of portfolio
theory and is also often used as a benchmark in various studies.
The results of portfolios minimizing different spectral risk measures for different
parameters will now be considered. Specifically, we used the Value at Risk, Expected
Shortfall, Exponential, and Power SRM.
5.1.1. Minimum Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall portfolios for different α
We start the analysis with the spectral risk measures Value at Risk and Expected
Shortfall, which were defined in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. The results of portfolios
minimizing these SRMs using a rolling window of 1 month (30days) can be seen in
Figure 6 and Table 3. As a robustness check we produce also the rolling window
14days and 90days, these results you can find in Appendix A.1 and Appendix A.2. In
Figure 6 we can see the evolution of the cumulative wealth of Minimum ES and VaR
portfolios for different parameter, specifically we used values of 1%, 5% and 10%.
When we look at the evolution of the cumulative wealth of the portfolios in Figure
6 we can see that all the portfolios except the Minimum VaR on the 1% aspect have a
similar evolution. A given portfolio reaches more extreme values and is more volatile.
We can also observe that all the VaR minimizing portfolios achieve better cumulative

wealth values than the ES minimizing portfolios. Very similar results can also be found
when rebalancing, every 14 days in Figure A.1 and 90 days in Figure A.2. with one
exception, which is that the portfolio Minimizing VaR at α = 1% does not dominate
so strongly at the 14 days rolling window and if we look at the results at the 90 days
rolling window this portfolio is even the worst, which implies that this portfolio is very
volatile and unstable in results.

We can compare the performance of the individual portfolios in Table 3, which
shows Turnover (TO), Target Turnover (TTO), Cumulative Wealth (CW), Standard
Deviation (SD), Sharpe Ratio and Calmar Ratio (CR). VaR minimizing portfolios have
reached several times higher TO and TTO values, indicating that there are significant

changes in positions when rebalancing, from this point of view, ES minimizing port-
folios are more attractive. Similarly, portfolios minimizing ES perform a bit better
in terms of risk measured by SD. In terms of SR and CR, VaR-minimising portfolios
again perform better, with the best VaR portfolio on the level α = 1% reaching 0.056
in SR and 1.479 in CR. Based on the results, we select the VaR-minimizing portfolio
with the α = 5% and the ES portfolio at the 5% level for the final comparison in Sec-
tion 5.1.5. The α = 1% VaR portfolio was not selected because, while it significantly
outperformed the other portfolios based on the 30 day rolling window results, we can
see that these results are not robust after reviewing the results in Appendix A.1 and
Appendix A.2. Portfolio minimizing VaR at 5% achieved the second best SR. The ES
portfolio with α = 5% achieved the second lowest TO and TTO, and also achieved the
highest CW, SR and CR from the minimum ES portfolios.
5.1.2. Minimum Exponential Spectral Risk Measure portfolios for different k
Another spectral risk measure for which we constructed portfolios is exponential.
The exponential spectral risk measure was defined in Section 3.1.3. The outcomes of
portfolios that minimize exponential SRM by using a rolling window of 1 month (30
days) could be found in Figure 7 and Table 4. Figure 7 displays the performance of
Minimum Exponential SRM portfolios for different parameters , namely 1, 5, 10, 15, 20
and 25, by showing the cumulative wealth evolution. As a robustness check, we also
generate results using rolling windows of 14 days and 90 days, which are presented in
Appendix A.3 and Appendix A.4, respectively.
In Figure 7, we can observe that all portfolios perform very similarly, except for
the portfolio with parameter k = 1, which performs above and is also more volatile.
Interestingly, in terms of cumulative wealth, the portfolios with parameter k = 1, which
by definition is the least risk averse, and portfolio k = 25, which in contrast is the most
risk averse, perform the best. Very similar results can be found when rebalancing, every
14 days in Figure A.3 and 90 days in Figure A.4 with one exception, namely that the
Minimizing Exponential SRM portfolio with k = 1 does not dominate as strongly in
the 14-day rolling window and if we look at the results in the 90-day rolling window,
this portfolio is not in the top two, indicating that it is more volatile and less stable

CC from BRC with monthly (30 days) rebalancing: Turnover (TO), Target Turnover (TTO), Cumulative
Wealth (CW), standard deviation (SD), Sharpe ratio (SR), Calmar ratio (CR).
In Table 4, we can assess the effectiveness of each portfolio by examining vari-
ous metrics such as Turnover (TO), Target Turnover (TTO), Cumulative Wealth (CW),
Standard Deviation (SD), Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Calmar Ratio (CR). According to Ta-
ble 4, there is an inverse relationship between k and TO or TTO, where a increase in
parameter k leads to a decrease in TO or TTO. Additionally, an increase in k typically
results in an increase in CW, with the exception of the case where k = 1. When mea-

suring risk using SD, the results for most parameters of k are similar, except for the
portfolio where k = 1. Interestingly, the portfolio with an exponential SRM and a pa-
rameter of k = 1 showed the best SR and CR, while higher values of k generally led to
an increase in the ratio, except the case k = 1.
Based on results in Figure 7 and Table 4, we select the portfolio minimising Ex-
ponential SRM portfolio for parameter k = 25 for final comparison in Section 5.1.5.
Our decision to select this particular portfolio was based on several factors. Firstly,
the cumulative wealth of this portfolio was found to be the second highest, after the
portfolio with parameter k = 1 which is less stable as we show in Appendix A.3 and
Appendix A.4. Additionally, the Exponential SRM portfolio with parameter k = 25
demonstrated less risk based on SD, and exhibited a more favorable TO and TTO.
5.1.3. Minimum Power Spectral Risk Measure portfolios for different 0 < γ < 1
In Section 3.1.4, we introduced the power spectral risk measure. In this section, we
present the results of constructing portfolios that minimize this risk measure. Specifi-
cally, we consider the power spectral risk measure and use a rolling window approach
of 30 days (1 month) and the minimum power spectral risk portfolios are computed
from the previous 365 days (1 year) of data. We report the results in Table 5 and dis-
play the cumulative wealth evolution in Figure 8 for various values of the parameter
0 < γ < 1 (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9). As a robustness check, we have also computed results
using rolling windows of 14 days and 90 days, which can be found in Appendix A.5
and Appendix A.6, respectively.
In Figure 8 we can observe that again several portfolios evolve similarly except for
one, which in this case is the portfolio with parameter γ = 0.1. Further, we can observe
from the figure that as the parameter γ increases, our cumulative wealth decreases. Very
similar results also found when rebalancing, every 14 days in Figure A.5 and 90 days
in Figure A.6 with one exception, namely that the Minimizing Power SRM portfolio
with γ = 0.1 does not dominate so strongly in the 14-day rolling window respectively.
it is beaten by the portfolio with γ = 0.3.

tiple metrics, including Turnover (TO), Target Turnover (TTO), Cumulative Wealth

(CW), Standard deviation (SD), Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Calmar Ratio (CR). The data
presented in Table 5 indicates that as the parameter γ increases, there is a correspond-
ing increase in TO and TTO. We can also see from Table 5 and Figure 8 that as our
parameter γ increases, our cumulative wealth (CW) decreases. In terms of risk mea-
sured by SD, we can see that the risk decreases from γ = 0.1 to γ = 0.7 and then the
value of risk increase again. The last two indicators are the SR and CR, in which case
we notice again that as parameter γ increases, its value decreases.

Based on the results in Table 5 and Figure 8, we select the portfolio minimizing the
power SRM with parameter γ = 0.1 for the final comparison in Section 5.1.5, since this
portfolio has the lowest TO and TTO and also the highest CW. In terms of risk, this
portfolio has a increased risk compared to the portfolio with parameter γ = 0.7 but as
we can see in the SR and CR, this risk is significantly compensated by the return and
also by the lowest TO or TTO.
5.1.4. Minimum Power Spectral Risk Measure portfolios for different γ > 1
In this section we continue with the Power Spectral Risk Measure for values γ > 1,
results for values γ < 1 can be found in Section 5.1.3. Our analysis focuses on the
power spectral risk measure, where we adopt a rolling window method spanning 30
days (1 month). To determine the minimum power spectral risk portfolios, we compute
data from the preceding 365 days (1 year). Our findings are presented in Table 6, and
we illustrate the cumulative wealth evolution for different parameter γ > 1 values
(1.5, 3, 5, 10, 15) in Figure 9. As a robustness check, we also generate results using
rolling windows of 14 days and 90 days, which are presented in Appendix A.7 and
Appendix A.8, respectively.
In Figure 9 we can see that all portfolios that minimise the Power SRM with pa-
rameter γ > 1 evolve almost exactly the same. When we look in more detail, we can
see that the cumulative wealth increases with parameter γ, which is opposite to the case
of portfolios minimising Power SRM with parameter γ < 1. However, we can find one
exception and that is the portfolio with parameter γ = 1.5, which is last at the begin-
ning (year 2020) but in 2021 it starts to outperform the other portfolios and finally ends
up third in terms of cumulative wealth.
Different results can be found when rebalancing, every 14 days in Figure A.7 and
90 days in Figure A.8. When rebalancing every 14 days, the portfolio with γ = 1.5
dominates, but when rolling the 90 days window, on the contrary, this portfolio is the
worst and the portfolio with γ = 3 dominates. The portfolios for the rest of the γ
parameters i.e. 5, 10 and 15 are quite stable.

The data presented in Table 6 demonstrates that as the parameter γ increases, there is
a corresponding decrease in TO and TTO. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the CW
generally increases as the γ parameter increases, with the exception of γ = 1.5. Re-
garding the risk measurement, we observe that the SD is at a similar level except in the
case for γ = 1.5. Finally, we analyze the SR and CR, where we observe that its value
generally decreases as the γ parameter increases, except for the case of γ = 1.5.

Based on the results in Table 6, and in Appendix A.7 or Appendix A.8 we select
the portfolio that minimizes the Power Spectral Risk Measure with parameter for the
final comparison in section 4.5. This portfolio achieved the best results in TTO, CW,
SR, and fell behind the portfolio with parameter by only 0.003 in the SD.
5.1.5. Comparison of Best Minimum SRM portfolios against benchmark portfolios
In the previous sections, we compared portfolios minimising four SRM (VaR, ES,
Exponential, Power) using different parameters to find out the properties of the portfo-
lios when varying the parameters. We now compare the portfolios using the different
SRMs we selected in Sections 5.1.1 to 5.1.4 with each other and also with the bench-
marks, which are the well-known cryptocurrency index CRIX, the Minimum Variance
(MinVar) portfolio, and the Equally Weighted strategy, which is also often referred to
as the Naive portfolio. The results using a 30-day rolling window are in Figure 10 and
Table 7.

In Figure 10, where the evolution of CW is shown, we can observe that all portfo-

lios perform very similarly, except for the portfolio minimizing the Power SRM with
parameter γ = 0.1, which outperforms significantly. The second best performing port-
folio is the VaR minimising portfolio at 5% and the worst performing is the CRIX
index, which is the only one that has different assets in its composition.

Notes: Out-of-sample performance measures of chosen portfolios to final comparison with benchmark port-

rebalancing and index CRIX: Turnover (TO), Target Turnover (TTO), Cumulative Wealth (CW), standard
deviation (SD), Sharpe ratio (SR), Calmar ratio (CR).
Table 7 provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of each portfolio and index
CRIX based on multiple metrics, including Turnover (TO), Target Turnover (TTO),
Cumulative Wealth (CW), Standard deviation (SD), Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Calmar Ra-
tio (CR). In Table 7, we can see that in terms of TO (we don’t calculate it for CRIX),
it is most convenient to invest in a portfolio that minimizes the Exponential SRM with
k = 25. In this criteria, the minimum VaR portfolio with α = 5% performed the worst
and is immediately followed by the Minimum Power SRM portfolio with γ = 0.1,
however, these portfolios achieved the best performance in terms of CW.
In terms of risk as measured by SD, almost all portfolios are the similar level ex-
cept for the Minimum Power SRM with γ = 0.1, which has this value multiple times
higher than the other portfolios, and the MinVar portfolio performed the best as ex-
pected. When examining the risk-return ratios, specifically the SR and CR, it can be
observed that the Minimum Power SRM portfolio with a parameter value of γ = 0.1
outperforms other portfolios significantly in CR, followed by the Minimum VaR port-
folio at a significance level of α = 5% and the Naive portfolio. In terms of SR, the best
29

ratio had CRIX and Minimum Variance.
In summary, the results from Figure 10 and Table 7 indicate that the portfolio mini-
mizing the Power SRM with parameter γ = 0.1 performs significantly better than other
portfolios in terms of CW and risk-return ratios. However, this portfolio exhibits sig-
nificantly higher volatility compared to other portfolios, as well as higher TO, which
could potentially lower the overall performance of this portfolio.
5.1.6. Comparison of the weight allocations of CCs by minimizing different SRMs
Additionally, this study examines the optimal weight variation of CCs by minimiz-
ing different SRMs. Specifically, we report portfolio weights of minimized Variance,
Value at Risk (VaR) with a confidence level of α = 5%, Exponential SRMs with k = 5
and k = 25, and Power SRMs with γ = 0.1, γ = 0.5, γ = 10, and γ = 15. The op-
timal weight distributions for these risk measures are presented in Figures B.1-B.8 in
Appendix B. From a first look at Figures B.1-B.8, which show the weights of different
portfolios, we can see that the portfolios invest in smaller number of assets, with one
exception, the VaR minimizing portfolio. Figure B.2 shows that the allocation of CCs
differs from period to period when optimizing for minimum VaR at α = 5%. Interest-
ingly, this suggests that a particular portfolio may perform more extreme and exhibit
greater volatility of the weight changes. Investors can thus invest in a portfolio of dif-
ferent CCs but we can see from Table 7 that this comes at the cost of higher transactions
costs, measured by TO and TTO.
The portfolio shown in Figure B.4 is designed for investors who are more risk-
averse, as measured by Exponential SRM with k = 25, compared to those in Figure
B.3. The weight of Bitcoin in the portfolio increases after 2021 because more risk-
averse investors seek assets with lower risk. Although the data after 2021 indicates that
many CCs have become more volatile, which we can observe in the Figure 4. Table 2
reveals that Bitcoin has a lower standard deviation than other CC assets, making it a
comparatively stable asset in the market. Furthermore, as investors become more risk-
averse, the weight of Bitcoin in their portfolios increases, as demonstrated in Figures
B.7 and B.8.
In Figure B.5 and B.6, we can observe that the power utility function with behaves
30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Page 31 ---

differently from other risk measures, leading to distinct outcomes. According to the
power weighting function, higher risk aversion results in more weight being placed on
lower losses and less weight on higher losses (Dowd et al., 2008). This contradicts
our intuition and leads to questions about the practical usefulness of some SRMs, par-
ticularly those based on power utility functions with 0 < γ < 1, as argued by Dowd
and Blake (2006).The key takeaway from our study is that those utilizing spectral risk
measures should exercise caution and choose utility functions that match the specific
characteristics of the problem they are addressing. In particular, when using power
SRMs, users must be especially careful. Nevertheless, our findings provide valuable
insights into the properties of these risk measures.
6. Conclusion
To sum up, cryptocurrencies have become a highly attractive investment opportu-
nity, but also come with inherent risks that need to be evaluated before making any
investment decisions. This study focuses on cryptocurrency portfolio selection tech-
niques that minimize quantile risk measures, specifically SRMs, which are capable of
capturing both VaR and ES as special cases. We provide an introduction to SRMs,
explores their links to investors’ preferences, and compute SRMs for cryptocurrency
portfolios. Overall, investors need to conduct thorough evaluations of the risks and
rewards associated with investing in cryptocurrencies before making any investment
decisions. Our study also presents a parsimonious and intuitive measure for practition-
ers, the resulting weights of each CCs can be a representation of the risk profile for
different level of risk-averse investors.
The results of the portfolios are compared using out-of-sample performance mea-
sures such as turnover, target turnover, cumulative wealth, standard deviation, Sharpe
ratio and Calmar Ratio. Data on digital assets, particularly cryptocurrencies, are abun-
dant, and the dataset used in this study includes the CRIX index and the ten most
liquid cryptocurrencies available on the BRC. The use of rolling window approach
with monthly, quarterly, and bi-weekly rebalancing is done for the construction of the
portfolio. The study also highlights the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, which ne-
31

cessitates the need for effective risk measures to better manage digital asset allocation.
There are four primary areas in which the analysis can be expanded. The first area
concerns optimizing the portfolio for each SRM in order to consider other values of
their parameters. This extension can provide greater insights into the performance of
investment strategies in relation to different parameters. The second area involves ex-
panding the performance measures used to evaluate investment strategies. This ap-
proach could lead to a more comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the
investment strategies. The third area entails including additional portfolio-allocation
strategies in the comparison. This extension can provide a more detailed understand-
ing of the strengths and weaknesses of various portfolio-allocation strategies. The last
area could be to constrain the maximum weight of an asset in the portfolio to avoid
allocating weights to only one asset as we have shown in Section 5.1.6.
