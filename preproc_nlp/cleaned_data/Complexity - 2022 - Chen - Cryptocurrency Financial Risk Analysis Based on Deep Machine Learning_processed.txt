Digital currency is considered a form of currency which is used in the digital world such as digital forms or electronic devices.
Several terms are synonyms for digital currency like digital money, electronic money, and cyber cash. Accurate prediction of the
digital currency is an urgent necessity due to its impacts on the economic community. +e electronic economy is very dangerous
and must be approached with great caution, so as to avoid or minimize the risks that occur in such cases. Deep neural network
(DNN) algorithm was improved to predict the Bitcoin price and then achieve the main goal of reducing ﬁnancial risks to proceed
with electronic business, and good estimation was achieved by using informative data such as transactions and currency return.
+e proposed method extracted features of related Bitcoin and used the informative ones. Transaction plan considered building
nodes in terms of network. Development of deep learning algorithms opens the horizons for the development of electronic
businesses that use digital currency. +e proposed method achieved worthy results in terms of accuracy (53.4%) and correct
prediction (MSE 1.02) and oﬀers the prospect of other research in this area.
1. Introduction
Day by day, digital currency signiﬁcance increases rapidly
due to its importance in the ﬁeld of electronic trading which
is essential in new ﬁnancial system [1]. Despite the fact that
the digital currency concepts are not new, the use of this kind
of currency has grown up remarkably [2]. Money is not set in
banks or safe boxes, but it is available in processors and
storage of the cyber world, and it is traded in the form of
information. +e main purpose of such technology is to
increase the payment eﬃciency [3]. Till now, the standards
for digital currency mechanism are not clear, and therefore
its boundaries are not set yet, so the customers communicate
together with the absence of regulators. However, the public
acceptance of digital bank transactions allow alternative
types of money to be developed; these new types are not
related to traditional bank accounts and are fully based on
digital environment; therefore, it is called digital currency
[4, 5].
Prespeciﬁed range of supply should be guaranteed for
virtual currency, and Bitcoin is an obvious example for this
limitation (21 million of Bitcoins is the whole amount
issued) [6]. Virtual currency and cryptocurrency are sorts of
the digital currency. Bitcoin is now leading the new form of
currency (virtual currency), and it forms about 93% of the
market of cryptocurrency [7]. +ere was an extreme ﬂuc-
tuation of Bitcoin exchange rate; on January 1st, 2013, the
rate was 13.30$ for each one Bitcoin, but this rate was in-
creased dramatically to be $1.147.25 in December 4th, 2013;
however, on March 1st, 2015, the price went down to be
$258.97. +e strong ﬂuctuation in Bitcoin exchange rate
made big opportunity and high risk at the same time to the
investors [8]. In addition to the huge ﬂuctuation, there are
other issues in the risk ﬁeld. +eft risk exists; in 2014 this
type of risk was highlighted by Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange.
Bitcoin dealers, especially buyers, also face risks of fraud
from some fraudulent sellers, which was conﬁrmed by the
US Securities and Exchange Commission.
+e pricing of digital currency is based on traditional
pricing perspective [9]. However, the main risk in dealing
with digital currency is the systematic and ﬂuctuation risk in
pricing process; thus, this study will attempt to analyze these

two types of risks, while theft and fraud risks will be set aside.
From the perspective of nonprofessional investors, the ex-
treme ﬂuctuation in digital currency price will lead to a risky
investment [10], but those who are professional in the in-
vestment ﬁeld would not put all their eggs in one basket.
+erefore, they will try to make diverse purse as much as
possible to avoid or at least to minimize risk; they prefer to
deal with assets not aﬀected by the market ﬂuctuation to
avoid the asset risk called systematic risk assets [11]; oth-
erwise, they should be called nonsystematic risk assets which
are related to the whole marketing process. Bitcoin is
considered as a nonsystematic risk asset, and the sophisti-
cated investors prefer to deal with this type of business [12].
+e popular digital currency is Bitcoin, and it is con-
sidered a target for theft or sometimes illegal activities. +is
problem cannot be solved only when the transaction address
is ﬁxed [13]. More challenges regarding Bitcoins [14] came
from rampant hacking attacks and thefts, so security control
of digital wallet is necessary. Making Bitcoin stand against
any hacks, thefts, and frauds needs big secure system and
process with cryptocurrency in addition to assets sharing
some characteristics according to transition [15].
Is Bitcoin a currency or not? +is is a big question for
which people are looking for an answer. Chen and Pandey
2014 [16] make study on Bitcoin to determine whether there
is a match between roles of currency and Bitcoin and
whether it is possible to invest in it as safely as assets; the
correlation between Bitcoin and the major currencies of the
world was also examined. +e results of their study show that
the major currencies of the world were correlated signiﬁ-
cantly, but the correlation between these currencies and
Bitcoin was insigniﬁcant. In addition, they found that there
is insigniﬁcant correlation between the beneﬁt of investment
in gold and the beneﬁt of investment in Bitcoin [17]. Because
the behavior of Bitcoin is diﬀerent from the behavior of both
of the major currencies of the world and the gold, re-
searchers claim that Bitcoin can be less used as useful
currency [18].
Bitcoin sustainability will encounter signiﬁcant risk.
Bitcoin users are now enjoying the low transaction fees, and
transaction companies and individuals apply very small rates
on each transaction to encourage people to buy Bitcoin and
increase the price as a result of demand increasing. However,
the same companies plan to increase their future proﬁts by
increasing the transaction amounts due to increasing the
value of each Bitcoin in addition to increasing the exchange
rate [19]. Since all Bitcoins have been already created, and
there are no longer any more Bitcoins, the marginal beneﬁts
that will result from owning currency will disappear. On the
other hand, the cost of marginal transactions will increase, so
the beneﬁt of Bitcoin business will decrease compared with
the ﬁat currency.
Recent development in deep learning may support ef-
forts for solving these challenges [20], as it is known that
deep learning and neural network can solve issues in divers
ﬁelds such as pattern recognition, education, healthcare, and
industry. Deep learning approach shows high performance
compared to machine learning approaches; therefore, it
proved useful in many research ﬁelds, and it can handle data
that tend to be messy, even if data includes many variables
and includes labeling errors. As is known clearly, neural
network aims to mimic the human brain, and deep learning
is an advanced form of neural network which mimics the
human brain more eﬃciently [21]. Explicitly programing
everything is not needed to achieve better results.
2. Literature Review
Many researches consider digital currency in terms of
prediction and risk management. In this section, we present
the most important studies that left impression in this topic.
LSTM system of deep learning was used to learn the chaotic
behavior of three cryptocurrencies evidently, achieving
better prediction in digital currency market [22]. Prediction
of digital currency price by using decomposition method
and optimization algorithm combined with deep learning
was done by [23]. A diﬀerent model was suggested by [24] to
predict Bitcoin based on huge dataset to improve the per-
formance, and stochastic gradient descent was applied for
deep learning techniques to learn the parameters used.
Bitcoin price prediction using scikit-learn library as dataset
for training method was presented by [25] via new strategy
based on genetic algorithm with three chosen parameters
that directly aﬀect the digital market. Large vector of features
was provided by to design neural network system for
learning the machine in minimum time period due to system
using to predict the price online system in real time issue.
However, due to many features, they achieved better results
in online prediction [26]. All existing methods seek accurate
prediction to avoid the risk of ﬁnancial issue.
2.1. Concept of Digital Currency. Digital currency, also
named as cryptocurrency or crypto asset, aims to reverse
some or all of the traditional uses of money—payment
manners, value store, and unit account [5]. +e terminology
used to describe it is often misleading and confusing,
changing a high range of ﬁnancial statements with verifying
technical, practical, and legal characteristics, ranging from
decentralized digital tokens like Bitcoin at one end of the
domain to oﬃcial and sovereign digital currencies supported
by central banks in other end. Bitcoin and many of their
similar things, sometimes known as crypto assets, are viewed
like a volatile speculative assets. Some people accept it as a
method of payment [27]. +is is partly due their security that
depends on cryptographic combination and no central
“blockchain” technology that keeps the holder identity out of
danger; governments consider deeply the use of illegal ac-
tivities like money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorist
ﬁnancing.
+e term of digital currency has been given more at-
tention by both by the companies testing the use of the
digital money and the governments that insist on applying
rules and regulations to stablecoins.
2.2. (e Reason of Central Bank Owning Digital Currency.
+e main reason may be that the system can pay eﬃciently
but that is not always the case. An example is that

commercial operations and currency trading have a second
aspect [4]. Many products depend exclusively on the Chi-
nese currency in order to revive the national economy, but in
fact it is the promotion of the Chinese currency over the US
dollar.
One of the reasons is the emergence of hidden com-
panies that are a repository for commercial funds that are
held on social media platforms due to transactions between
millions of users such as Facebook, as well as some of the
bonds traded for major companies that develop the idea of
electronic currency to evade tax and exploit the reputation of
some international brands in order to collect overlapping
funds [28].
2.3. Feature Extraction. Trading and dealing with digital
currency are fraught with a lot of dangers, so it is nec-
essary to know the components and data of the digital
currency and how to deal with it so that we can make
simulations to avoid the risk arising from dealing with it.
Items of digital currency can be classiﬁed into three main
categories: Bitcoin feeding, transaction, and return [29].
With Bitcoin being the basis of the currency and due to
the technological development, it attracted attention and
became popular in investing. Some traders and investors
consider it free money that is easy to obtain, while others
consider it as gold prospecting. Mining of Bitcoin refers
to the digital process of adding transaction records to
blockchain, a publicly distributed ledger which is holding
the history of each transaction of Bitcoin [30].
Transaction refers to sending Bitcoin through any path
and anywhere, and these transactions clump together in new
term called blockchain which is serial of transaction blocks,
recording the history of transactions.
Returns of Bitcoin are the interest on cryptocurrency
when Bitcoin increases during investing after a period of
time; mining of Bitcoin for some time can be returned to end
user with transaction history record to value this Bitcoin.
For this purpose, we can extract the features from digital
currency to develop supervised machine learning technique
through its network for prediction and reduce the risk as-
sociation with it. Features improved the time frame within
hour, day, week, and month prior prediction. +e main goal
of using deep learning to forecast digital currency is to
predict Bitcoin price of USD at least one hour in advance
[31]. All the information will be gathered in advance and
used for processing and computing, considering the
transaction path and nodes for Bitcoin in addition to the
features extracted such as the following:
(i) Current Bitcoin price
(ii) Flow of the path per hour
(iii) Number of transactions per hour
(iv) Mean value of the transaction
(v) In\out degree of averaging node
(vi) Transaction median value
(vii) Median degree of the node
(viii) Number of mined Bitcoins.
(ix) Source and destination address.
(x) Number of transactions per node.
Some of these features are directly related to the price of
Bitcoin and others are indirectly related [32]. For each node,
we can collect some extra features such as the following:
(i) Bitcoin passing through the node
(ii) Weight of ﬂow Bitcoin
(iii) Transaction number
(iv) Nearest centrality to the node
+e purpose of getting these features is not only to
classify or cluster certain Bitcoin and its ﬂow, but also to get
general idea regarding how the important players in the
market of Bitcoin aﬀect the valuation and how they control
the market.
One of the best information items gained from features is
the activity of diﬀerent addressing and balancing of the net,
as shown in Figure 1.
2.4. Selection of Features. An important part of feature ex-
traction is to ﬁrst choose which one should be used during
classiﬁcation or regression. Reducing features in calculation
process that take the mutual data among the features and
output results will be the pure features that illuminated or
pruned insigniﬁcant features. Mutual information is pro-
duced by the following equation:
I(A; B)  􏽘
b∈B
􏽘
a∈A
p(a · b) × log
p(a · b)
p(a)p(b)
􏼠
􏼡,
(1)
where A is extracted feature, B output data, and I mutual
function.
+rough this equation, we can put the rule of given
information, that is, which feature is informative and which
is uninformative and can be normally discarded. For such
research informative features can be changed within the time
but still ﬁltered according to their importance; however,
some features are still informative in a speciﬁc process, such
as the following:
(i) Mined Bitcoin for the last hour
(ii) Transaction number through new addresses for the
last hour
(iii) Mean of the node degree for the last hour
(iv) +e net ﬂow for the last hour
Informative features help to predict the right current
price then can avoid the risk of digital currency issue.
Another important process for the features is Union
Find which is the algorithm of determining the contiguous
subnets through the network. It is preprocessing technique
to ﬁnd the relation of multiple accounts belonging to a single
owner. +is algorithm carries out many iterations to ﬁnd out
the union and ﬁnding function.
First, union function merges two disjoint subnets to
produce their union.

Second, ﬁnd the function by checking other parts and
ﬁnd out whether the subnet belongs to the same merged
subnet.
2.5. Deep Learning. Current studies focus on automation
and prediction of Bitcoin behavior to avoid digital cur-
rency risk in the market. Making the machine touchable
is not easy and requires powerful processors and high-
performance computers. +e development in data science
and modern technology, such as big data and high-
performance computers, provided an opportunity for
machine learning to understand data and its behavior
through complex systems. Machine learning gives the
machine ability to learn diﬀerent algorithms without
strict orders from certain programs or limited instruc-
tions [33].
Deep learning can be deﬁned as technique of machine
learning used to learn useful features directly from given
Bitcoin transaction, paths, and subnet domain. Many layers
are exploited by deep learning for nonlinear data processing
of unsupervised or supervise feature extraction for classi-
ﬁcation and pattern recognition [34]. Deep learning moti-
vation is greatly reduced by Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) area,
which simulates the human brain ability to analyze data,
make decision, and learn. Deep learning goal is to emulate
the approach of hierarchical learning of extracting features
by human brain directly from unsupervised data.
+e core of deep learning is the hierarchical computation
of features and representation of information, such as de-
ﬁning features starting form low level to high level. With
cryptocurrency,
the
standard
techniques
of
machine
learning do not work well when running directly due to
ignoring nature of blockchain. In deep learning, features are
extracted automatically from Bitcoin transaction. One of the
characteristics of these feature methods is considered to be
learning in the system [35].
+e character of Bitcoin transactions as a function is a
key issue for the processing or success of the digital currency.
Features extracted in Bitcoin have some limitations [36]. For
this reason, we can use deep learning with its feature ex-
traction to solve risk issues in digital currency.
+e main diﬀerence between machine learning and deep
learning is feature selection method, as shown in Figure 2.
Features in deep learning will be generated automatically
to simulate the appropriate results [37]. Diﬀerent hidden
layers participate in decision making by using the feedback
from one next layer to previous one, or resulting layer will be
fed into ﬁrst layer [38]. DL enables computers to perform
complex calculations by relying on simpler calculations to
optimize computer eﬃciency. It is diﬃcult for a computer to
understand complex data such as transaction number and
weights or subnet region of a complex nature, so we use deep
learning algorithms instead of usual learning methods [39].
Deep learning considers the nonlinear relation between
blockchain and transaction determining the weight of Bit-
coin reconstructed that depends on linear model since the
variation of digital currency gets large. +is is actually be-
cause linear model is similar to nonlinear behavior of the
relationship between Bitcoin transactions and the data of the
previous hour [37]. For this reason, DNN is used to solve the
nonlinear model of improving quality of Bitcoin prediction.
+e second factor that deep learning takes into consideration
is the speed. Real time is necessary in dealing with online
currency during data acquisition and analysis prediction.
2.6. Blockchain of Finance. +e blockchain starts when
dealing with some anonymous fake online transactions.
+is dealing over the Internet is described as peer to peer
payment through blockchain infrastructure. Payments are
deﬁned as Bitcoin, the ﬁrst cryptocurrency and the largest
currency, giving them hundreds of other currencies, that is
digital cash. Technology of blockchain is established on the
principles of gathering all the transactions data to be block
of public ledger. +ey part and connect to previous block
via a Merkle root, in form of ﬁxed chain as shown in
Figure 3.
Cryptocurrencies spread their transactions that take
agreement from neighboring nodes to integrate together to
achieve chain.
+is is known as the veriﬁcation process of competitive
entry. +erefore, the ﬁnance of blockchain is deﬁned as
decentralized process and the management as capability of
self-management. Process of cryptography supports this
technology and is known as proof-of-work. It is the algo-
rithm fee reward that each node earns as part of contributing
node power mathematically expressed as
P(B −1)  R2
H
H −1
H
􏼒
􏼓
R−1
.
(2)
P(B −1) is the probability of parting node of block 1, R is
hash rate to certain node, and H is hash rate of the network
rate (competitors).
+e equation above illustrates that larger hashing power
to user and probability of the node can reach the correct
transaction; when it is conﬁrmed, the reward will go into
eﬀect and it is found that the number of blocks per minute is
actually a binary distribution. Proof of stake is known as the
alternative cryptographic method for distribution achieve-
ments. It is an algorithm mainly based on process of leader
selection and expressed by

2.7. Proposed Method. In this study, we focus on the digital
currency eﬀectiveness and prediction. +en, we apply deep
learning algorithm to increase the accuracy of prediction and
reduce the statistical risk in cryptocurrency. Figure 4 shows
the general framework of the proposed method starting by
collecting two categories of data ﬁrstly. +e data provided in
the last history are used in the training system.
Training mode is supposed to be labeled with known
results in advance, and neural network has to put the result
which is known in advance in order to build the system on
this basis, in addition to the information gathered from
previous months about transactions of digital currency.
Features will be extracted in this stage to be processed
according the weight supported.
Predictive model called linear regression is used to
formulate a line located at the best ﬁt separating between
dependent variable scalar and multiple variables. Mean
square error is considered between actual and predicted
output and minimized by the linear ﬁt. Some calculation is
needed such as parameterization (or factorized form),
hypothesis, linear regression goal, and cost function, as
follows:
hθ(x)  θ0 + θ1x,
J θ0 · θ1

where the hypothesis h is provided with parameters θ0.θ1 to
satisfy the cost function J to ﬁnd its minimum.
Neural network considers the family of machine
learning technique, derived from the biological nervous
system via modeling interconnected neurons’ system that
depends on iterative learning. Neural network system starts
with feeding by connecting multidimensional input to the
hidden layer neurons before predicting the right result. +e
entered
data
or
features
go
through
several
shifts
depending on the weight of the features and the neural
network construction strategy. Each hidden layer produces
data for any other layer, or its results go to the inputs of
previous layers as feedback.
Normally, nonlinear functions such as h function are
used after each output layer, N × N dimensions’ matrix
suggested for adjustment N is considered account numbers,
nodes can be represented as rows and columns in a matrix
matrix, connected nodes in a pattern use non-zero values to
represent the relationship between nodes and their trans-
actions. +e process of neural network is shown in Figure 5.
Depicting all the information collected from blockchain
to form vector and matrix makes prediction easy, and neural
network can determine root mean square error (RMSE) as in
the following equation:

DNN.

the proposed method, we can also understand the

3. Experimental Results
+e many leveraged iterations for neural network model are
used to predict price of digital currency (Bitcoin) on hour in
the future to reduce statistical risk by using improved feature
set. For the baseline prediction setting, set the normal
prediction and increment the process per hour to achieve
normal mean squared error. +en, neural network is applied
with normal features extracted to run the system. In the last
running, DNN was applied with preprocessing of feature
reduction on many iterations. +is is actually running under
training mode with fetching data from previous predicted
data as shown in Table 1.
Prediction error is a controlling factor in determining
statistical risk and plays an important role in the beneﬁt
reward of digital currency. DNN experiments the results
many times during iterations and feeds back the predicted
result to the neural system again when it is not proper or
suitable prediction.
To evaluate the system, we considered year 2018 for
training to ﬁnd the accuracy. Accuracy reﬂects the good
prediction of the system by comparing the actual results with
the expected results and the degree of convergence between
them. Figure 6 shows the accuracy over accumulative square
error.
According to Figure 6, we can notice the extent of the
convergence between the accuracy of the prediction pro-
posed by the DNN and the actual results. +is result can
reﬂect the worthiness of the model and how it can avoid the
risk of the greed of investors and speculators in the stock
market for digital currency.
Proposed informative features such as net ﬂow
through the account (per hour) and transactions’ number
are provided by new address for given hour. Figure 7
shows the correlation of features; many of the transac-
tions are close to zero, as well as the ﬂow of nodes in the
system. +is information allows moving Bitcoin. We can
also notice that when the feature is large and positive, the
price will decrease, while when feature is large and
negative, the price will increase.

4. Conclusion
+e digital currency term is commonly used in the
present day, but there are many risks involved in digital
currency, so it is imperative to ﬁnd a way to avoid or
reduce the risks faced by those who deal with Bitcoin.
Deep learning is widely used to solve complex cases that
require an advanced prediction of ﬁnancial transactions.
One of the deep learning algorithms used in this study,
deep neural network, has been improved to adapt to this
problem statement to be suited to the appropriate way to
resolve such cases. Features extracted in advance were
used to build neural network from the transactions and
nodes (Bitcoin) with currency return. Prediction process
was used to reduce uninformative features to gain per
hour data that satisfy requirement of the algorithm. Deep
neural network achieved worthy results in terms of
accuracy and MSE when trained on given previous data of
year 2018. Prediction of beneﬁt of Bitcoin in advance
helps to avoid statistical risk in digital currency.
