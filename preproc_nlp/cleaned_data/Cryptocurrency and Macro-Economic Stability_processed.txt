Abstract 
 
This research aims to determine the impact of Cryptocurrency on macroeconomics, 
especially in terms of inflation, exchange rates, and other relevant aspects. This article also 
analyzes the various regulatory approaches that governments around the world have 
implemented to address risks and manage the development of cryptocurrencies. The 
method used in this research is qualitative with a descriptive-analytic approach. The 
methods used in this research include collecting data from various sources, including 
historical cryptocurrency data, macroeconomic data, and cryptocurrency regulatory data. 
The results of the analysis show that cryptocurrencies can have a significant impact on 
macroeconomic stability, both positive and negative, depending on factors such as 
widespread use, price volatility, and role in the global financial system. Additionally, the 
different regulatory approaches reflect the diversity of global views on cryptocurrencies and 
the challenges of regulating technological innovation. This article summarizes these 
findings and underscores the importance of a deep understanding of cryptocurrencies in 
the era of digital finance.

A. 
INTRODUCTION 
Cryptocurrencies are a relevant topic in relation to macro-economic stability 
because they have the potential to influence various aspects of the macroeconomy, 
including monetary, fiscal, and financial stability (Lekashvii & Mamaladzem, 2018; 
Bajaj et al., 2022). Based on data on the Ministry of Finance website, Cryptocurrency 
has even become very popular among young people recently. It is considered to be 
more secure because it is guaranteed by Cryptography, which makes it a currency that 
is impossible to counterfeit and spend multiple times. Wang et al. (2022) provide a 
logical reason why this has become very popular, namely because Cryptocurrency is 
not tied to centralized financial institutions such as banks, thus avoiding a centralized 
financial system, and with this, of course, minimizing very complicated regulatory 
pathways so that anyone can access it as long as they are connected with computers.

This is very closely related to macroeconomics because, in several countries, 
Cryptocurrency has been officially used as currency. 
The first and very crucial influence is the influence on the exchange rate. 
Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have become a significant global investment 
alternative. Fluctuations in cryptocurrency values can affect national currency 
exchange rates, which in turn can affect the competitiveness of a country's exports and 
imports (Noam, 2019). In the context of the global economy, cryptocurrencies, such as 
Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become a topic of interest due to their potential impact on 
national currency exchange rates (Hayes, 2016). This could be caused by a 
phenomenon in cyberspace called Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital 
currency that operates in a decentralized manner without the involvement of a 
government or central bank. When cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum make 
headlines in the media and attract investor interest, their impact can be felt far beyond 
cyberspace. 
Among the effects are speculation and trading; if many parties buy Bitcoin at 
the same time, then the price will certainly rise in a short time and have an impact on 
other people who sell national money to buy Bitcoin; the long-term impact of which 
will affect the exchange rate of the money. experiencing depreciation (Chen, 2018; 
Matkovskyy et al., 2020). Next is related to security in uncertainty; this happens when 
there is economic instability in a country, and people who feel worried will look for 
alternatives that are more-stable and safe. In the long term, this will certainly trigger 
an outflow of funds and affect the exchange rate. Next is the relationship with the 
Global Market; this occurs when there is a change in Cryptocurrency, which triggers 
a wave in the exchange rate and becomes a means of payment that influences the 
balance of trade within a country as well as other countries that are its economic 
cooperation partners (Al-Thaqeb et al., 2022). 
The second influence is the influence of inflation and deflation. Some 
cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have a characteristic called "limited supply." This 
means that there is a quantitative limit on the number of cryptocurrency units that 
will ever exist. For example, Bitcoin has a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins that will 
ever exist. With this limited supply, there is potential for deflation. Deflation occurs 
when the value of money increases or purchasing power increases over time. In the 
case of a cryptocurrency with a limited supply, the supply of the Cryptocurrency will 
not grow quickly along with demand, thus driving an increase in the value or price of 
the Cryptocurrency. This can produce a deflationary effect, where people are more 
likely to keep Cryptocurrency rather than spend it because they expect its value to 
continue to increase. As a result, Cryptocurrency tends to be less widely used as a 
means of everyday payment because people prefer to keep it as an investment; this is 
in accordance with the results of research conducted by Asena Deniz (2020) and 
Abdullah & Nor (2018).

This is like a double coin, as rapid growth in the supply of new 
cryptocurrencies can result in potential inflation in the cryptocurrency economy. 
Basile (2022) explains that some other cryptocurrencies, such as some altcoins, have 
different supply models, where more new cryptocurrency units are generated over 
time. For example, Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that has an expandable supply. If the 
number of new cryptocurrency units produced significantly exceeds new demand, 
this could lead to a decrease in the value or price of the Cryptocurrency. When 
cryptocurrencies experience inflation, people may be less willing to hold them because 
they do not want to see their value continue to decrease. This can affect the purchasing 
power of cryptocurrencies and the impact of their use as a means of payment. 
However, keep in mind that inflation and deflation rates in cryptocurrencies 
can vary greatly depending on the type of Cryptocurrency, supply model, and 
economic factors that influence it. Additionally, Podder (2023) and Coulter (2022) 
explain that cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile, which can produce sharp price 
fluctuations in a short period, regardless of limited supply or possible inflation. 
Therefore, it is important to understand the specific characteristics of each particular 
Cryptocurrency when considering its impact on inflation and deflation in the 
cryptocurrency economy (Cahyadi et al., 2021; Marzo et al., 2022).

decade, utilizing data sourced from Statista's Digital Economy Compass report. In 
recent years, growth has been astonishing, surging from just a handful of virtual 
currencies by the end of 2014 to nearly 20,000 by the end of May this year. This rapid 
expansion, particularly evident in the last three years, can be partly attributed to the 
ease of creating new cryptocurrencies, a process that costs virtually nothing and can 
be accomplished with a few simple steps (Assaf et al., 2023; Maltkovskyy & Jalan, 
2019). Nevertheless, the digital assets included in our data source must meet specific 
criteria, including being listed on an exchange platform, which serves to filter out 
fraudulent schemes and less reputable contenders. 
The next impact is related to the role of Cryptocurrency in global finance. 
Cryptocurrencies have assumed an increasingly important role in the world of global 
finance, especially in the context of cross-border money transfers. Let us explain how 
this role can influence the global financial system and the role of national currencies 
in international trade in a descriptive narrative (Walther et al., 2019; Hachicha et al., 
2022). In the past, to make cross-border money transfers, individuals or businesses 
had to rely on traditional financial systems such as banks or international money 
transfer services. This process is often time-consuming, expensive, and requires 
multiple intermediaries, which can result in additional costs. Additionally, currency 
fluctuations and time zone differences can slow down cross-border fund transfers. 
In connection with the emergence of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, the 
process of cross-border money transfer has undergone significant changes. 
Cryptocurrencies allow users to send and receive funds internationally quickly and at 
much lower costs compared to traditional methods. Cryptocurrency transactions do 
not require intermediaries such as banks or other financial institutions. They also work 
non-stop and without paying attention to time zones. However, this also has negative 
impacts that need to be paid attention to by all, namely high-value fluctuations in 
Cryptocurrency, security issues, and regulatory uncertainty are some examples. 
Additionally, the use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions has also 
sparked debate about their role in money laundering and other illegal activities. With 
that point in mind, cryptocurrencies have changed the global financial landscape by 
providing a faster, more efficient, and affordable alternative for cross-border money 
transfers. However, the uncertainty and challenges associated with cryptocurrencies 
remain an important topic in the global financial debate. 
 
B. 
METHOD 
This research uses a qualitative-descriptive type of research. The methods used 
in this research include collecting data from various sources, including historical 
cryptocurrency data, macroeconomic data, and cryptocurrency regulatory data. The 
theoretical framework used includes macroeconomic and financial theory, as well as 
literature related to Cryptocurrency and regulation. In its implementation, this

research considers limitations, such as high volatility in cryptocurrency data and 
external factors that cannot be fully measured. With this method, this research can 
provide a deeper understanding of the impact of cryptocurrencies on macroeconomic 
stability and the effectiveness of regulations in managing the associated risks. 
 
C. 
RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
1. Impact of Cryptocurrencies on Macro-Economic Stability 
In analyzing the impact of cryptocurrencies on macroeconomic stability, we 
must consider several key aspects, including inflation, exchange rates, and other 
relevant elements. 
First, cryptocurrencies can affect inflation, which is the general growth rate of 
prices in an economy. If cryptocurrencies are widely used as a means of payment and 
investment, fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies may affect the prices of goods 
and services. For example, if cryptocurrency prices suddenly spike, people may be 
more inclined to save them rather than spend them. This can slow down the 
circulation of money in the economy, which in turn can affect the rate of inflation. On 
the other hand, if cryptocurrencies experience deflation (a significant increase in 
value), then people may be more inclined to hold them, which could exacerbate 
economic deflation. 
Second, 
national 
currency 
exchange 
rates 
can 
be 
influenced 
by 
cryptocurrencies. If there is an increase in interest and investment in a particular 
cryptocurrency, the national currency could weaken as investors turn to digital assets. 
This can reduce the competitiveness of exports and increase the cost of imports, 
affecting the country's trade balance. Conversely, if there is concern or nervousness in 
the cryptocurrency market, investors may return to more stable national currencies, 
strengthening their exchange rates. 
Cryptocurrencies can also impact the financial and banking sectors. The growth 
of the cryptocurrency market may divert some liquidity from the traditional banking 
system, which could affect monetary policy and banking stability. Apart from inflation 
and exchange rates, cryptocurrencies can also influence other elements such as interest 
rates, investments, and overall financial stability. Therefore, in the analysis of the 
impact of cryptocurrencies on macroeconomic stability, it is important to consider 
these various factors carefully and involve appropriate data and analysis methods. 
In continuing the analysis of the impact of cryptocurrencies on macro-economic 
stability, several additional factors need to be considered, including the following: 
The first factor, namely the role of Cryptocurrency in cross-border payments 
and transfers, can influence national and international payment systems. The speed 
and lower costs associated with cryptocurrency transactions could change the way 
companies and individuals conduct cross-border business. This may impact payment 
processing, banks, and other financial institutions, as well as their business models.

739 
The Second Factor is that events such as the development of stablecoins 
(cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to more stable assets such as fiat currency) have 
raised questions about the extent to which cryptocurrencies can function as a stable 
means of payment. The success of stablecoins in achieving value stability can have a 
significant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions and value 
stability. 
For the Third Factor related to regulation, government efforts to supervise and 
regulate cryptocurrencies can influence their level of adoption and use in the 
economy. Strict regulations can limit the growth of cryptocurrency markets, while 
loose or unclear regulations can increase financial and stability risks. 
Fourth factor, it is important to consider the uncertainty and high volatility in 
the value of cryptocurrencies. Short-term sharp fluctuations in value can create 
uncertainty in the economy, and dramatic changes in the value of cryptocurrencies 
can affect the wealth of individuals and investors. 
The final factor related to the impact of cryptocurrencies on the macro-economy 
can vary from one country to another. Countries with economies that are more open 
to cryptocurrencies may experience a greater impact compared to countries that adopt 
a more restrictive approach. 
In the overall analysis of the impact of cryptocurrencies on macroeconomic 
stability, it is important to combine empirical data, theoretical frameworks, and an 
understanding of cryptocurrency market dynamics. Further research and continued 
monitoring of cryptocurrency developments will be necessary better to understand 
their role and impact on the global economy. 
 
2. Cryptocurrency Regulation 
An overview of the various regulatory approaches that governments in various 
countries have implemented regarding cryptocurrencies illustrates the diversity of 
approaches and challenges faced by various jurisdictions around the world. Several 
general approaches have been implemented, which are presented in the following

requires 
cryptocurrency exchanges and other related 
companies to verify customer identities and

views on their benefits, risks, and impacts. Therefore, developments in cryptocurrency 
regulation are an important subject to monitor continuously. 
Meanwhile, this is different from the situation in Indonesia. In Indonesia, 
government regulations and rules regarding Cryptocurrency have experienced a 
number of developments in recent years. The following is an overview of government 
regulations 
and 
rules 
regarding 
cryptocurrencies 
in 
Indonesia: 
Initially, 
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin were introduced in Indonesia without clear 
regulations. However, in 2017, Bank Indonesia, the country's central bank, issued a 
regulation prohibiting the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Bank 
Indonesia considers that the use of Cryptocurrency in transactions can endanger the 
stability of the country's financial system and has the potential to be used for money 
laundering and terrorism financing. As a result, the use of cryptocurrencies as a means 
of payment was immediately stopped. Even crypto assets that are quite popular have 
been widely accessed via various platforms, as in the following image: 
 
Figure 2. Crypto Exchange Landscape in Indonesia 
Source: Xendit 
Although the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment is prohibited, the 
Indonesian government does not expressly prohibit ownership, trading, or 
investment in cryptocurrencies. However, they encourage activities related to 
Cryptocurrency to be carried out carefully and in accordance with applicable 
regulations. To be precise, in 2019, the Indonesian government issued Government 
Regulation no. 80 of 2019 concerning Procedures for Reporting Financial Transactions. 
This rule requires crypto asset exchange service providers to register and report their 
transaction activities to the competent authorities. The goal is to monitor transactions 
involving cryptocurrencies to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and 
terrorism financing. 
Indonesia has also planned to launch a national digital currency (CBDC) called 
"Digital Rupiah." This will be an initiative managed by the central bank, Bank 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

742 
Indonesia, as a regulated alternative to cryptocurrencies. It is hoped that the Digital 
Rupiah will facilitate cross-border transactions and increase financial inclusion in 
Indonesia. In its development, Indonesia continues to monitor cryptocurrency 
developments and assess its potential impact on the country's economy and finances. 
Cryptocurrency regulations in Indonesia are still in the process of evolution, and the 
government is trying to find a balance between encouraging blockchain technology 
innovation and mitigating financial and security-related risks. As a result, more 
detailed guidelines and regulations can be expected in the next few years to regulate 
cryptocurrencies in Indonesia. 
In its development, the effectiveness of regulations in overcoming the negative 
impact of cryptocurrencies on macroeconomic stability depends on various factors, 
including regulatory precision, enforceability, and adaptability. Below are some 
aspects to consider: 
a. Financial Crime Prevention: Effective regulations must be able to prevent the 
misuse of cryptocurrencies in money laundering, terrorism financing, and 
other illegal activities. This can be achieved by implementing strict KYC 
(Know-Your-Customer) procedures, which allow cryptocurrency exchanges to 
identify and track their users. Good regulations should also require reporting 
of suspicious transactions to competent authorities. 
b. Consumer Protection: Regulations must provide adequate protection for 
consumers who use Cryptocurrency. This includes requirements to disclose 
investment risks, provide easy access to information about digital assets, and 
ensure that consumers have protection rights in the event of fraud or loss of 
access to their assets. 
c. Financial Stability: Regulations should focus on maintaining financial stability. 
Extreme fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices can have a negative impact on 
the economy, so effective regulation must be able to identify and manage these 
risks. This could include restrictions on leverage or margin trading in 
cryptocurrency exchanges. 
d. Exchange Supervision: Good regulation should provide a strong supervisory 
framework for cryptocurrency exchanges. This involves necessary licenses and 
permits, as well as active supervision by financial authorities. Exchanges that 
do not comply with regulations should be subject to strict sanctions. 
e. Taxes and Income: Regulations must address the taxation and reporting of 
income related to cryptocurrencies. This helps ensure that income from 
cryptocurrency trading or investing is taxed according to local laws. 
f. Education and Awareness: In addition to regulation, it is also important to 
increase public awareness about the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. 
Effective education programs can help reduce the potential for abuse and errors 
by consumers.

743 
While good regulation can have a positive impact in addressing 
Cryptocurrency's negative impact on macro-economic stability, it is important to 
remember that Cryptocurrency is a rapidly evolving technology. Rigid regulation too 
quickly could stifle innovation and growth in the sector. Therefore, effective 
regulations must remain relevant and able to adapt to technological developments 
and changes in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as stated by Bank Indonesia (2022). 
 
D. 
CONCLUSION 
Based on the results of data analysis and discussion, Cryptocurrency has 
become an increasingly important subject in the global economy. The rapid growth of 
the cryptocurrency market and the innovation of blockchain technology have changed 
the global financial landscape by providing alternatives in the form of digital assets 
that can be traded and invested. The impact of cryptocurrencies on macroeconomic 
stability can be complex. On the one hand, cryptocurrencies can improve the efficiency 
of cross-border fund transfers with lower fees and higher speeds. However, high-
value fluctuations in cryptocurrencies and the potential for illegal use may also pose 
risks to economic stability. Cryptocurrency regulations have varied from country to 
country. Some countries adopt a progressive approach, while others ban or strictly 
limit cryptocurrencies. These regulatory approaches reflect differences in views on the 
benefits, risks, and impacts of cryptocurrencies.
